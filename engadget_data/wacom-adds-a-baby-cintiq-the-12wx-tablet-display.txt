The unit is basically an Intuos3 tablet with an integrated display, so it features everything you'd expect -- 1,024-level pressure-sensitivity, input device rotation support, touch strips, ExpressKeys, Tool ID, and tilt sensitivity -- with the added bonus of being able to work directly on the 1280 x 800 image itself. Wacom says the Cintiq 12WX will be shipping November 1 in the UK for Â£829 ($1679) and will support XP, Vista, and OS X -- no word on when it'll be out in the States, but we can't imagine it'll be long.

[Thanks, Mark]
