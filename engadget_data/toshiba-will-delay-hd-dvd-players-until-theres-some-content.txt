The players wereoriginally meant to ship this month, but that timeline was jeopardized by Warner Home Video's announcement last week that its initialslate of HD DVD flicks wouldn't be out on March 28th as originally planned. Now, Toshiba says it plans to"synchronize the launch of our players with HD DVD title releases." Of course, if you've preordered one of the playersand were hoping to use it as a very large and expensive paperweight, you're out of luck. For everyone else, the delaywill give us one more excuse to wait a little longer for a dual-format player to hit the market.
