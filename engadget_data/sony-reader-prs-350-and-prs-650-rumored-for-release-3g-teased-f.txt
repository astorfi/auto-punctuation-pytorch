 It's about that time, folks. And by "about that time," we mean "time for Sony to release another round of Readers." If you'll recall, the outfit dumped a few on us last year right around this time, and the sleuths over at Sony Insider have dug up information that they purport to be true about Sony's next Reader duo. Reportedly, the outfit is gearing up to reveal the PRS-350 and PRS-650, each of which will boast E Ink displays and be thinner / more longevous compared to the existing PRS-600 and PRS-300. It's bruited that they'll be under 10mm thick, while the 650 will boast a 6-inch display and the 350 a 5-inch panel. We should also see a bump from 512MB to 2GB in terms of internal storage space (at least on the 650), and we wouldn't be shocked to find both 3G and WiFi support on the higher end of the two. As for software? We're told that the Reader UI will be refaced somewhat, and the note-taking program in the PRS-600 will find its way onto the lower-end PRS-350. Mum's the word on pricing, but it shouldn't be too long before all that gets cleared up -- think it over good, Sony. We've got options, you know.
