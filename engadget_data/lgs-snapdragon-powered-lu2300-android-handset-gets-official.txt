The biggest news is that LG has confirmed that the phone does indeed pack a 1GHz Snapdragon processor and Android 2.1, along with some other fairly impressive specs to match, including a 3.5-inch AMOLED capacitive display, a 5-megapixel camera, built-in WiFi, DivX support and a DMB TV tuner -- that last feature of which likely indicates that this one won't be available over here anytime soon. There's also still no indication of a price or a firm release date, although it will apparently be available in Korea sometime this month or next.

Update: It looks like LG's UK blog may have been a bit too eager to get word of the LU2300 out, as it has now clarified that the phone won't have an AMOLED display and may or may not come with Android 2.1.
