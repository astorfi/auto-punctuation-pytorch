Speculation about the partnership began a fewweeks ago, when the CEO of Alienware rival VoodooPC blogged that a deal was in the works, but the rumors were denied by Dell and Alienware. Accordingto Michael Dell, Alienware will continue to be managed by its current executive team as "a standalone unit."However, the deal is still likely to frustrate those who consider Dell a commodity manufacturer, rather than a high-endspecialist -- though it's sure to please AMD fans, given that Dell has long been an Intel-only shop, and Alienware has abroad line of AMD-based products.
