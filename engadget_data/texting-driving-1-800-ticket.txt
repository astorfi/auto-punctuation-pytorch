You already know you're not supposed to be texting while
driving—or watching TV and driving, or talking on the
phone while driving, or pretty much
anything else while driving—but in South
Wales the fine for getting caught sending an SMS while on the road just jumped from £30 to £1000 (that's about $1,800).
Even despite their long-range texter-finder cameras and tight road monitoring, ultimately we don't see how they can
really enforce this law (what, you can't text with one hand without looking?).
