While this presumed follow-up to Samsung's Pixon 12 (M8910) isn't official, the announcement looks imminent based on the leaked collateral above and the spyshots that emerged over the weekend. What's impressive here is that extending 3x optical zoom -- something carried over from the SCH-B600 -- and dedicated camera controls like a mode dial, shutter and zoom, and big 3.3-inch WVGA AMOLED display. Rounding out the specs are HD (720p presumably) video, HSDPA data, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth, microSD slot, and DMB mobile television; that latter spec making this Korea-only whenever it does launch.
