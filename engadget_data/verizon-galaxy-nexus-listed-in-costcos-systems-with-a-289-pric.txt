  If you're still thirsty for any release details of Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Nexus, allow yourself to be ever-so-lightly-moistened by this Costco inventory screenshot from Android Central. It shows the Galaxy Nexus for Verizon priced at $289, a slim $10 discount on the $299 we'd heard in a leak a few weeks ago (that also predicted the price of the HTC Rezound, if you're keeping score). There never was much doubt this Ice Cream Sandwich would be a pricey one, but it's definitely one thing to consider while we await official news on its release and seemingly-inevitable Verizon exclusivity.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
