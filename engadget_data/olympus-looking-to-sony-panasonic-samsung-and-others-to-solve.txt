 Olympus has had a rough go of it lately, what with a $1.7 billion accounting scandal that implicated its management on the highest levels and resulted in the company suing its own executives and president for fraud. Now, Reuters reports that the company in a financial pinch and may partner up with Sony, Panasonic, Samsung, Fujifilm or Terumo Corp. to get the cash it needs. Naturally, none of the companies in question are confirming that such a deal is imminent -- Samsung has even denied being interested -- but word on the street is that it'll be done by February. Now, the question is who'll be the rising tide that floats Olympus' sinking ship?
