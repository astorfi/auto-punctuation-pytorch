A screen up on TmoNews says that the policy will start this Saturday, October 16, after which exceeding 5GB of data usage in a month will result in "web browsing capabilities... at slower speeds... which will be determined by [the user's] device type." If it's any consolation, the same screen says that less than one percent of users will actually be affected in practice... and something tells us most of you know who you are. But hey, getting throttled is still better than getting slammed with overage, right?
