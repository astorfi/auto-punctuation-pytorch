 When in search of retro cool, there's little out there that can compete with iconic gramophone. The Gramovox keeps the 19th century design with a large horn to amplify your tunes. But under the hood, audiophiles Pavan Bapu and Jeff Parrish have replaced the need for physical media with a Bluetooth radio. Inspired by similar docks that funneled audio from a phone's speaker though phonograph-style horn, they've set about creating a version that doesn't require you to tether your smartphone to a large, non-portable object. Unfortunately, we don't know much else about the device. It's still in development and the creators are currently aiming for a Q3 release. If you're interested you can sign up for updates at the source link. And you'll find a quick teaser video after the break.
