Well, a Something Awfulforum poster by the name of Interrupting Moss was having (unintentional) thermal issues with his ownoverheating 129° F MacBook Pro, so he cracked it open andfound a dearth of silvery paste. He generously reapplied his own and re-gauged the temperature at 103° -- a 26degree drop, and that's only an IR reading of the keyboard area. Is this a cure-all for overheating MacBooks the worldover? Hard to say, but if your MacBook is too hot to handle (certainly not too cold to hold), you might consider a moremano a la máquina approach before you wait in line to talk to a Genius just to have him/her whisk awayyour precious laptop for who knows how long.
