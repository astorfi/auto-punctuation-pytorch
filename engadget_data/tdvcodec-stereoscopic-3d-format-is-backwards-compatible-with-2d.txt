Essentially, video streams encoded in the TDVCodec format can be viewed on all existing 2D set-top-boxes, DVD / Blu-ray players and presented on 2D televisions, but for those with TDVReady devices and PCs with TDVision's Dejaview software, eye-popping visuals are available from the very same stream. Regrettably, there's no word on any major firms picking up the solution and planning to distribute, but if something akin to this takes off, it could give folks one more reason to splurge on a 3D-ready DLP from Samsung or Mitsubishi (or a TDVisor, if that's your bag).
