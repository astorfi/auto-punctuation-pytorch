 In North America, the PlayStation 3 is the Model T of consoles: you can have any system color you want, as long as it's black. Sony might be dropping the circa-1908 approach in the near future, at least in Canada. Both Best Buy and its Canada-only sister chain, Future Shop, are listing a Crystal White Limited Edition Bundle that includes a 500GB hard drive, a year-long PlayStation Plus subscription and a trio of games for $300 Canadian ($305 US). It's a good deal compared to the existing lineup, but extra-special when white has been limited to a handful of other countries -- and when Sony hasn't mentioned any North American plans for the color. We've asked the company for comment, and we'll let you know the response. When both stores list a January 27th in-stock date, however, any answers will come quickly.
