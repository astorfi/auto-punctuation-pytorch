HTC's got two to offer you, and now Amazon's UK bureau is ready to take pre-orders for the new Salsa and ChaCha handsets for a June 26th delivery. The ChaCha's equipped with a portrait QWERTY keyboard and a 2.6-inch touchscreen, while the Salsa stretches out to 3.4 inches and eschews the physical keys. Both feature 600MHz Qualcomm MSM7227 processors and 512MB of RAM, which are used to run Android with Sense laid over the top. The unsubsidized prices are set at £250 ($409) for the ChaCha and £320 ($524) for the Salsa, though we're sure you'll be able to get them without any upfront payments if you're happy to sign your life away to a carrier for the next couple of years.
