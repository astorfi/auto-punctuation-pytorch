With ASUS' strikingly thin Eee PC 1008HA -- which we toyed with for an unhealthy amount of time at CeBIT this year -- up for pre-order in the UK, we're just certain a US launch is imminent. As of now, Britons with £379.50 ($565) can get in line for the Midnight Blue edition, which should be dispatched in around a month or two according to Amazon UK. For those feeling something a bit less vivid, the all-white version can be ordered up at LaptopsDirect for £20 more. Too pricey for an Atom-powered netbook?
