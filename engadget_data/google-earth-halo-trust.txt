One such organization is the HALO Trust, a group that's dedicated to clearing war-riddled countries (such as Cambodia and Angola) of minefields. Taking advantage of Google Earth, the Trust has been able to survey land, validate data and produce maps for governments and other organizations, thus making a huge impact on people left impoverished as a result of these minefields. Check out the video below to learn more about the HALO Trust's efforts, and head to the More Coverage links if you're curious to see how this group is working with Google to make a difference.
