 We just love us that Opera Mini, especially whenwe're constrained to a non smartphone and/or a slow mobile connection, but the Opera peeps aren't just sitting on theirhands while we enjoy the mobile web, and have just announced version 2.0 of the browser. They seem bent on making Operathe go-to mobile platform, and have added SMS functionality for mobile commerce so that you can buy via the browser andhave ringtones, games or other content delivered via SMS without a lot of hassle. The browser also now supports filedownloads, skinning, multiple search engines, "speed dial" bookmark shortcuts, and the vaguely defined"visual navigation." Not quite earth shattering, but content providers might take note of the fact that justabout anybody can have access to a browser that can actual do something with the content they provide.[ViaAll About Symbian]
