This time it's sending them pre-release TouchPads as an enticement to get busy and boost the 9.7-inch slate's app count before it launches next month. HP recently promised that "thousands" of TouchPad apps are on their way and, in addition to attracting big names like Skype and Amazon Kindle, it's also ensured that legacy apps continue to be supported on WebOS 3.0. With nearly 600 unofficial goodies sitting pretty at PreCentral's homebrew app gallery, HP clearly feels it makes sense to reach out in that direction too. And who said love was just a trick?
