 
Verizon's finally fessed up to a couple hotly-anticipated handsets that've been kicking around in rumorland for some months now: the MOTORAZR maxx Ve from Motorola and LG's VX8700. The maxx Ve is the CDMA rendition of the V6 maxx for GSM networks, offering a 2 megapixel cam, touch sensitive controls, and a thin, sleek package -- in other words, nothing has changed since yesterday spec-wise -- and will drain your wallet, purse, or other currency-toting device of $200 after rebates on a two-year agreement when it hits on April 24. Announced alongside the maxx Ve, the VX8700 takes LG's Shine formula and brings it to the US for the first time, although Verizon has opted not to tag the phone with Shine branding for some reason. Like the maxx Ve, you get a 2 megapixel cam, microSD expansion, but this one's for the high-style types with a champagne-hued brushed metal case. It'll beat the Moto to market, rolling out on April 6 for $180 after rebates with the requisite contract.Read - Motorola MOTORAZR maxx VeRead - LG VX8700
