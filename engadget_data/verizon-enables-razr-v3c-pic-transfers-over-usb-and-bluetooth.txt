As RAZR owners are well aware, the previous two firmware updates haddisabled and then completely removed OBEX, which gives customers a free way to transfer their files to a PC, mostimportantly their pictures. The new firmware not only enables OBEX, say HowardForums users, but actuallyallows pic transfers over a wired USB connection as well using the Motorola Phone Tools software. Having seen Verizonhas take such a shocking step following their change of heart on DUN,we're expecting reports anytime of Apple opening up the iPod, Sony dumping the MemoryStick, and the HD-DVD and Blu-raycamps coming to a super-last-minute compromise.
