Not so, as LG has reportedly developed its own technology in order to produce a PDP with "absolute blackness," and if all goes to plan, we could see it surface by the end of July. Aside from that, we don't know much more about the PG7000 just yet, and while we're told the first model will indeed be 1080p, lower-resolution flavors are slated to follow. Get ready folks -- the battle for blackerness is about to get even darker.[Thanks, heikki]
