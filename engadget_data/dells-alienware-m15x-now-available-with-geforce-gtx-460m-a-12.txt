 
Originally teased at Computex, NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 460M has just recently started to slip out into a limited amount of laptops, and naturally, Dell's Alienware line is amongst the first to get it. The almighty M15x can now be configured down in the source link with a 460M that boasts 1.5GB of GDDR5 memory, and best of all, it's only a $119.84 upgrade over the stock 1GB ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5850. Mama always said frames per second were worth paying for, now didn't she?
