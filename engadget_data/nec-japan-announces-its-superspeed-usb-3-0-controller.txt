Well, that day is almost at hand: NEC has just announced details for the first USB 3.0 controller. The ÂµPD720200 chip is backwards compatible with USB 1.1 and USB 2.0, with the company making samples available this June at $15 a pop (including Windows drivers). Look forward to seeing peripherals hit the streets soon after. Until then? Like the rest of us, you'll just have to keep on keepin' on.[Via Everything USB]
