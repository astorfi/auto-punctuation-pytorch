I don't know about you, but I've wanted a Pip-Boy of my own since I first played Fallout 3. With the Pip-Boy Edition of Fallout 4, I'll finally be able to make that happen with a real-life wrist-bound stat-tracker and menu system. The wearable (I use that term lightly) comes with a companion app that'll be available on Android and iOS, too. The mobile love doesn't stop there either, because tonight Bethesda is releasing Fallout Shelter, an app that lets you design your own shelter in the game, tonight on iOS. Are your bathroom breaks ready?




Here a link that should get you to Fallout Shelter for iOS. https://t.co/FX5vIMg22U pic.twitter.com/BDqkyetGds
