  Google won't shutter Wave entirely until April 30th, but the once clamored-for service is now seeing restrictions imposed upon it, as it prepares for its eventual rendezvous with the grim reaper. It's now read-only, which means new Waves are strictly verboten and those with anything of value in Mountain View's ocean, ought to look into the existing PDF-export functionality, or consider a migration to another open-source alternative -- like Apache Wave or Walkaround (which we've conveniently linked below). And with that folks, an era slowly draws to a close. Sayonara Wave, we hardly knew ye -- but find solace in knowing you'll always live-on in our hearts, our hands-on and inside other Google services.
