We just got to see the display in person at SID 2011, and can confirm that the presence of Pentile pixels should no longer be a cause of concern. Nouvoyance, who designed the display, told us that the panel's RGBW pixel configuration makes your whites whiter and brights brighter (up to 600 nits worth), while consuming 40 percent less power than conventional LCDs. The company also told us the tech's been around for awhile, but that market forces conspired to keep it concealed -- though after seeing it in person, we can't fathom why it didn't make it into Sammy's stellar new slate. Pixel-density people shouldn't pout, however, as devices packing the display will drop by Q4 of this year or Q1 2012. Video explaining why you should join the RBGW revolution's after the break.
