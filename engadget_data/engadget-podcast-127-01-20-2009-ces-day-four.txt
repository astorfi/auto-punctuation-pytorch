Sleep deprivation is now a way of life. But we're still podcasting: Dell's Adamo makes its way into our lives, Freescale shows off new processors, and Ryan Block chimes in with his views on the show in general and on the Pre in specific - it's another unmissable episode, mercifully recorded while the sun is still out.

Note: You can tell we're tired... Josh says it's 2008!
