 
HD Beat has the scoop onan upcoming 42-inch plasma display from Hitachi that delivers a lot of features for its $2,500 price tag. The 42HDS69accomplishes a native resolution of 1,080i through a rather strange pixel configuration of 1,024 x 1,080, sports suchviewing enhancements as an anti-reflective screen and ALiS pixel barrier minimization technology, and features threeeach of component and HDMI inputs along with an optical audio out and CableCard support. No definitive release date hasbeen announced, but the 'Beat reports that we can expect to see this model in stores "soon."[ViaHD Beat]
