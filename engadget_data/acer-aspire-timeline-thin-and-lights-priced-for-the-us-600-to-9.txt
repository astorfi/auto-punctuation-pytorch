 
Acer's Aspire Timeline inexpensive thin-and-lights have been popping up here and there around the world since we first laid eyes on 'em in April, and now the CULV machines are ready to hit the States. Pricing is actually a little lower than we initially heard, with the base 15.6-inch 1.3GHz Pentium SU2700 machine coming in at $598, but you're more interested in the two smaller machines: the 14-inch, 4.2-pound 1.4GHz SU3500 Core Solo unit is $699, while the 13.3-inch, 3.5-pound 1.4GHz SU9400 Core 2 Duo pictured above is $899. All three machines feature 16:9 1366 x 768 LED-backlit displays driven by Intel 4500MHD graphics, and battery life exceeds eight hours, aided by a PowerSmart energy-saving switch. So -- anyone still thinking about an Adamo? Full press release and two more pics after the break.





14-inch Timeline15-inch TimelineAcer Brings "All Day Computing" to the U.S. Market with the Aspire Timeline Thin and Light Notebook FamilyWith prices beginning at $598, Acer's affordable sleek and elegant notebooks offer more than eight hours of battery lifeSAN JOSE, Calif., June 2, 2009 – Acer America, part of the world's second largest manufacturer of notebook PCs (1), today introduced the U.S. availability of its much anticipated Aspire Timeline Series of "all day computing" notebooks. Averaging more than 8 hours of battery life(2), Acer Timeline sets a new standard for value, mobility and productivity.The Aspire Timeline breaks the notebook paradigm with a thin and light mainstream notebook that doesn't break the bank. The secret to its extended battery life lies in Acer's unique design that combines Intel's ultra low-voltage processors, advanced power management, high-capacity batteries and LED backlit displays, which result in a thinner, lighter, more energy-efficient and longer lasting notebook PC.For road warriors and others on-the-go, concerns about battery life, spare batteries and cables just became a thing of the past. On just a single charge, consumers can remain productive or entertained an entire coast–to-coast flight, or work remotely from 9 to 5 without ever stopping to plug in and recharge."Acer has introduced yet another game changer in the world of notebook PCs," said Sumit Agnihotry vice president of product marketing, Acer America. "The Timeline sets new standards in both value and battery life, which are sure to be well received in this economy by on-the-go, yet always connected consumers."With prices beginning as low as $598, the Timeline delivers high-end styling and excellent performance in a thin and light design. Finally, the pricey ultra portable class of notebooks, long coveted by high-paid corporate business executives, is now more affordable to general consumers.Unparalleled Battery Life Achieved with Low Power Components and Acer's PowerSmart FeaturesWhile most notebooks with long battery life use higher cell batteries which protrude from the back of the notebook, Acer combined numerous low power components with a standard high-capacity 6-cell battery, allowing them to keep the design as small as possible.In addition, a conveniently located PowerSmart button located above the keyboard allows consumers to easily extend battery life. A simple press of the button activates the advanced power savings settings, traditionally a tedious procedure accessed through numerous software-based steps. This one-button approach simplifies the process.Lastly, an Acer PowerSmart adapter senses when the notebook is unplugged, and stops sending needless energy. It also stops pulling power from the wall outlet when the adapter is full.Battery Testing by Principled Technologies® Validates Revolutionary Battery LifeUsing Bapco's MobileMark 2007 Productivity benchmark test, an industry standard created to measure PC battery life and performance, Principled Technologies, the industry leader in technology assessment services, found Acer's Aspire Timeline notebook PCs averaged more than eight hours of battery life. The AS3810T achieved 9 hours and 7 minutes of battery life, while the AS3810TZ logged in a whopping 9 hours and 48 minutes, clearly outpacing the industry norm and significantly outlasting competitive systems.

With prices ranging from $598 to $899 and three lines to chose from, students, small businesses and families trying to economize will find the Timeline is easily within their reach.Road warriors demanding the smallest and lightest notebook possible will find the 3.5 pound AS3810 with a 13.3-inch display is the ideal traveling companion. For those who need a slightly larger display and an integrated optical drive, the 4.2 pound AS4810 with a 14-inch display will more than satisfy their requirements. The AS5810 includes a large 15.6-inch display, integrated optical drive and dedicated numeric keyboard.At its slimmest point, all models are less than one-inch thin, and just over one-inch at their thickest. Weighing between 3.5 and 5.3 pounds, they are lighter and easier to carry than comparable systems. Fitting easily in a backpack, purse or laptop carrying case, they won't break the bank or a shoulder.Providing an elegant, high-tech design, a stylish brushed aluminium finish on the display also provides solid protection to the display and internal components. The system is also lead- and mercury-free, making it easier to recycle.In addition, Acer has incorporated Intel's Laminar Wall Jet technology for the first time, directing air flow in parallel layers, to keep the notebook significantly cooler.Small, but Powerful Enough to Get the Job Done and Then SomeWith a range of models, consumers can choose from a number of well-equipped, full featured systems.Offering either Intel Pentium, Intel Core Solo or Intel Core 2 Duo ultra low voltage processors and 3GB or 4GB of memory, the Timeline Series packs enough power to easily handle daily productivity tasks such as email, Internet browsing and Office applications.The Acer Aspire Timeline features high-definition CineCrystal LED backlit widescreen displays (16:9 ratio), which offer 33 percent more energy savings than traditional notebook screens, bringing significant power savings to mobile computing.Internet access is provided through Gigabit Ethernet or Wi-Fi 802.11b/g Draft-N, making it easy to browse websites, check email, make VOIP calls, and enjoy online entertainment, including the latest social networking platforms like facebook, twitter and YouTube.An integrated Acer Crystal Eye™ webcam delivers smooth video streaming and high quality images for online chats and business video conferences, even in low-light situations. The built-in digital microphone conveys superior voice quality, keeping background noise levels low and minimizing echoes. Consumers can also enjoy music and video sound with the Dolby Headphones and two built-in stereo speakers.A Multi-Gesture Touchpad allows users to pinch, flick and swirl their fingers across the touchpad for more natural photo and video viewing as well as intuitive navigation of websites. The Multi-Gesture Touchpad allows users to scroll, zoom in and out and flip through web pages, photos, spreadsheets and more. The TouchPad can also be disabled with a one-touch button, eliminating accidental cursor movement with palms and wrists when using an external mouse.The Timeline family of notebooks also includes a backup button that lets consumers easily select and protect their irreplaceable digital files through regular scheduled backups or on an as- needed basis. Data can be backed up to an external hard drive, flash card, thumb drive or to a secure hidden partition on their PC.Configurations, Pricing and AvailabilityAvailable now, the new Acer Aspire Timeline Series includes numerous models within the 13.3-inch AS3810, 14-inch AS4810 and 15.6-inch AS5810 lines.
