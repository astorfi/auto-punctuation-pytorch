Nintendo's big exclusive game for its Wii U home console is Bayonetta 2. It was Nintendo's big coup announcement ahead of the Wii U's launch. Bayonetta's notable not just for being good -- the first game is critically-acclaimed -- but also for being made by a developer other than Nintendo. And hey, it's October, so that means games are being released into the wild. Among them is Platinum Games' Bayonetta 2, featuring the stylishly appointed, combat-ready Rapunzel-alike you see above. The series is known for its over-the-top, goofy-yet-calculated style, and we're gonna put the latest one through its paces in a stream for you just below starting at 4PM ET.
