 HTC's CFO Winston Yung appears ready to make a deal with market rival and patent nemesis Apple. The Taiwanese company has had some rather harsh words for the Cupertino crew, and it hasn't seemed any more conciliatory after getting slapped by the ITC. That may be starting to change, as Yung told Bloomberg, "we [Apple and HTC] have to sit down and figure it out." He went on to say that the house that Sense built was open to discussions with Jobs and co. but did not venture to guess what a final agreement might look like. Of course, it's worth pointing out that this is absolutely standard practice, and we'd expect nothing less. In fact, HTC really only has two options here: plead for licensing cooperation, or go into gummy bear sales.
