According to Microsoft's official Windows Phone Blog, we need only wait another week or two before the update begins rolling out. The Windows Team indicates it won't be pushed to your phone OTA when the time comes, so you'll want to ensure you have the right software (Zune for PC, Windows Phone 7 Connector for Mac) installed on your computer before this all goes down. Now, a word of caution: we'd be completely taken by surprise if every phone received the update on the same day -- after all, the NoDo rollout spanned several weeks before it was delivered everywhere -- so it's best if you exercise a degree of patience if your particular handset isn't ready the very first day, just in case.

Update: WPCentral reports the roll out will start on September 27th for AT&T's HTC Surround, LG Quantum and Samsung Focus handsets.
