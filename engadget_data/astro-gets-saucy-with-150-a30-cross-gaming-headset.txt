After going on a year-long hiatus from crafting new hardware, the company is hitting back with an all-new headset based around the same DNA found in its A40. Rather than cranking out yet another pair of mic-infused headphones that do users little good outside of the LAN party setting, the A30 Cross-Gaming actually boasts a street-style design that enables them to double as vanilla headphones. The boom mic is removable (though an in-line mic allows for communication in any situation), and you'll find interchangeable speaker tags if you're scouting a way to "be yourself." It's up for order today at $149.95, but if you're looking to pick up a Dolby-powered Astro MixAmp -- which is said to "seamlessly blend voice and game sounds" -- you'll be looking at a grand total of $229.95.
