No details were given on this "dedicated silicon for the tablet space," but we can assume that it's going to fall into the Atom line up. Whether it will be an extension of the Moorestown family or just be an outgrowth of the Pineview platform found in netbooks and nettops remains to be seen, but you can bet on us listening up for more info when we're live from Taipei next week.
