To that end, it looks like the boys and girls in Waterloo filed for "SurfBook" in early August, though it's only showing up in Canada's filing system at this point -- there's no matching documentation in the USPTO just yet. Obviously, applying the word "surf" to anything electronic at this point evokes the pleasingly vintage phrase "surfing through cyberspace," which leads us to believe you'll probably be able to use the SurfPad to browse the World Wide Web and swap warez on your favorite BBS. Keep trying, RIM. No, wait -- definitely use SurfPad.
