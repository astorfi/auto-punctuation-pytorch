Has TiVo started testing their
new program to place banner ads up on screen while you're
fast-forwarding? Haven't noticed anything unusual on the ol' TiVo we keep around Engadget HQ yet, but a bunch of
people over at the TiVo Community Forums have been complaining about banner ads popping up when they try to
fast-forward through the commercials of some shows. Apparently it's not the mere presence of the ads that they seem to
find bothersome as much as it's that the banners take up most of the screen while you're fast-forwarding, making it
hard to tell when the show you're watching has resumed. We're all for TiVo trying to make a buck where they can, but
right now might not exactly be the best time to alienate your customers with something like this, you know?


 P.S. - If you haven't already, it's probably a good time to implement that
30-second skip tweak for your TiVo
remote.
