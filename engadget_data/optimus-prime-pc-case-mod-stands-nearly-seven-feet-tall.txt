Pennsylvania's own John Mangus spent some 300-hours over the course of a year building his Optimus Prime machine, which amazingly stands in at six-feet, ten-inches in height and weighs 125-pounds. It's so big, in fact, that the backs of its legs actually house lockable compartments large enough to cram keyboards (and probably printers) into. Quite honestly, this thing would be impressive without a hint of PCB residing within, but be sure and click through for another angle of what's possibly the most coveted case mod we've seen in recent memory.
