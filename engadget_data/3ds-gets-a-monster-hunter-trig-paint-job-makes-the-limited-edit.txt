	As Nintendo is wont to do, a new assortment of colorful 3DS handhelds will soon be flooding the market -- in Japan. Yes, it's time once again for that tried-and-true approach of treating gamers in the company's homeland to special edition packs. This time out, it's the release of Capcom's Monster Hunter 3 (Tri) G that'll ring in the above pictured red-on-white portable, in addition to Ninty's recently unveiled slide pad add-on. Unfortunately, interested parties'll have to choose between the 20,800 yen (about $271) game plus console bundle, or merely opt for the hardware-less 6,990 yen (about $91) peripheral and software option -- both available on December 10th. If neither of the above has your inner Big N fanboy aflutter, you can always drop 15,000 yen (about $195) on that bland Ice White version slated for October 20th. Speak Japanese? Then hit up the source links below to parse through the official pressers.
