According to Microsoft product director Albert Penello, external drive support for the Xbox One has always been on the company's docket to enable in a future update. That refresh looks to be on the horizon after an unnamed Xbox developer took to Reddit to tease an image showing that very feature in action. Members of the Xbox One preview programme are often privy to early features, which have recently included improved Party Chat and manual checks for system updates, but this leak will likely attract the most attention. Although the Xbox One ships with a 500GB internal hard drive, blockbuster games can command 50GB without breaking a sweat. That game storage, of course, adds up over time. Attaching an additional drive will not only stop you from running out of space, it'll also stop you from voiding your warranty with a do-it-yourself replacement.
