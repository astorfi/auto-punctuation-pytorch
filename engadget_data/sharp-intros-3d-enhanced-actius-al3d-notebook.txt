The new Sharp Actius AL3D notebook sports a 1.86Ghz Pentium M processor and 1024MB DDR2 SDRAM with an 80GB hard
drive. Designed specifically for 3D applications, it ships with a 128MB nVidia GeForce Go 6600 GPU, and its 15-inch XGA
(1024 x 768) LCD can be switched between 2D and 3D modes via a button control on the unit. It includes a DVD-R/RW/RAM
optical drive that can produce and playback 3D DVDs, and supports 5.1 virtual surround sound (but only with external
speakers with built-in Dolby Virtual Speaker, and only when using WinDVD - WTF?). In the connectivity department we've
got FireWire, three USB 2.0 ports, and Gigabit ethernet, but no wireless whatsoever. Still interested? It'll set you
back $3,499 for all that 3D goodness.
