But if you're a music lover and not on an OLED budget, this new device might have to do the trick. Just announced for Europe, the Walkman E-Series Video MP3 players come in your choice of either Black or Red, and sport a five band EQ, support for rights-managed WMA and WMV files, and an FM radio tuner (with one-touch recording). This bad boy will be available overseas from the end July. No word yet on price or Stateside availability, but you'll know as soon as we do. In the meantime, peep that gallery below. Tiffany Giardina won't mind.
