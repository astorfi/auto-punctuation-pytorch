You'll recall an earlier ruling by a federal jury in Eastern Texas found the CE maker guilty of infringing upon PA's playlist-related IP with an assortment of older iPods. This new filing alleges that newer Apple devices, like the iPhone 4, iPad 2 and modern day iPods -- which weren't part of the original 2009 case -- also violate that same IP, in a move we'd surmise serves to pad Personal Audio's coffers. Not like Apple's apt to feel the pinch should Personal Audio snag another victory, but hey....
