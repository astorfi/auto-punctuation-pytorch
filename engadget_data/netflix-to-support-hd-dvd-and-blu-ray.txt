 We're not entirely sure whyNetflix sent out a release today saying they're planning onsupporting both HD DVD and Blu-ray when titles hit the market -- something we more or lessanticipated -- but we found it a little bizarre that the title of said press release was "Netflix Will SupportHigh-Def DVD at Launch." Ok, maybe it's because HD DVD is supposed to make it to market before Blu-ray, but westill find it a little bizarre that they'd be so blatantly headlining one standard over the other when they plan tosupport both. Either way, they claim we should expect discs in late March -- no word on whether there'll be a"high def" account or increased fees for renting next-gen discs.
