 The rumor mill continues to buzz with speculation that AMD is laying off five percent of its staff across the board, but it looks like the company's trying to put out the fire -- we just spoke with AMD reps who denied that any layoffs had already taken place, but wouldn't comment further on "rumor or speculation." That's the message that's been going out to pretty much every media outlet today, so it's not clear if that means no job cuts are coming or if we're just playing a fun little semantic shell game. We're hoping things are turning around -- the company has been meeting ship dates for Phenom processors lately, and it's got the first certified DisplayPort card -- but we'll see how things pan out when the company announces its quarterly results.
