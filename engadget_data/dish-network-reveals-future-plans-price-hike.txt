First, the bad news: price hikes are on the way, starting February 1 Turbo HD packages increase between $5 - $10 per month, while the HD add on package price stays the same. Of course, increased HD services are promised to make the higher price worth it, and in a bit of good news, The Dark Knight hits DISH On Demand in 1080p the day after Christmas for $6.99, for all three of us who haven't bought the Blu-ray yet. Other than assorted other price changes, DISH is switching to a confusing new naming scheme for its SD channel lineups and all receivers, so say goodbye to the ViP722 and hello to the Enhanced HD Duo DVR Receiver. We can tell you've been overwhelmed by the excitement, check out the rest of the details at Satelliteguys.us and then let us know how you feel.
