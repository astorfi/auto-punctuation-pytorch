Taking our pets to the vet has been a kind of a don't-ask
don't-tell scenario — yeah, I know kitty doesn't look so good, I'll just hand her to the vet
and pick her up tomorrow. Most animals never really show how bad-off they really are, so that's
why an Ohio researcher has developed a pain detecting device which vets and lab workers can test the animal's
pain-level (1 to 10). It works like a lie-detector test, measuring stress levels as an electric
current, and the palm-sized ($595) device picks up the current by being placed on the animal's
skin. Maybe you don't want to know that Whiskers has been in intense pain for the past three days as
you've pushed off taking him to the vet, but more likely the device will help determine better
treatments.
