Alright, so you're a big shot CEO/CFO/CTO or some other flavor of high-powered acronym, but can you win this game?
Your tireless, dogged determination will get you nowhere in 'Relax to Win,' a mobile game developed by Philips Design
for major UK cellphone provider Orange. They've designed a device that measures your galvanic skin response and sends
it wirelessly to a PC or cellphone. To play (here's the hard part), you've got to slide the device between your fingers
and relax. Your character is a friendly dragon on the PC or cell screen, and the more you chill out, the more your
dragon will fly. With any luck, you'll have perfected the art of becoming barely conscious in no time.
