Multiple independent sources now say that NVIDIA's SoC is out of the autostereoscopic picture as the 3D handheld nears completion, and further confirm that the project codename is "CTR" -- which reminds us of a certain Nintendo motherboard. How the handheld has evolved since then is anyone's guess -- we're betting praying it's a good bit smaller -- but we'll find out next week at E3 for sure.
