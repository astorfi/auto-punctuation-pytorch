According to MadBoxPC, the ATI Radeon HD 3450 will be based on the RV620, utilize 55-nanometer fabrication technology and will feature a 525MHz core clock, 400MHz memory clock (800MHz DDR), 256MB of DDR2 RAM and VGA / Display Port outputs. Moving on up, we've got the Radeon HD 3470, which is based on the same core but gets clocked a hair faster and ditches Display Port for DVI. Finishing things off is the RV635-based Radeon HD 3650, which will come in a 800MHz XT flavor and a 600MHz Pro iteration along with 256MB - 512MB of GDDR3 RAM. The trifecta is reportedly going to ship sometime next month, and they'll cost you just $50, $60 and $100, respectively.[Via DailyTech]
