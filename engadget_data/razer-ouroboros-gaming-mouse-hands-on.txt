 
 You recall the Ouroboros, right? Nope, not the mythical snake yarn, the latest gaming mouse from Razer that inadvertently broke cover over at the FCC. While it's been official for around a month, Germany's annual gaming convention has offered us our first chance to get to grips with it. Razer has tied itself in a ergonomic knot over the Ouroboros, with most of the mouse's dimensions happily adjustable to suit practically any gamer hand. We get customizing right after the break. 




 First off, yes, it'll fit both of your hands happily, but it's when you start adding the optional fins to the sides that you start to see the handful of mouse "styles" that this transforming mouse is capable of. Looks-wise, it looks as Dark Knight as we thought it would, with some purely aesthetic touches -- like two exhaust ports -- adding to the effect. Having said that, it's a head-turner and more importantly, felt really good in our hands from the outset. We then got to adjusting it, raising the bridge of the lower half of the Ouroboros, and extending the back out a little. We weren't completely sold on the fins, being more of a classic mouse user, but those that like to play CoD with a claw are well advised to try them out, southpaw or not.The mouse packs a pair of sensors, with a top end 8,200 DPI primary joined with a secondary sensor to detect and adjust to different playing surfaces. Yeah, it's sounding pretty precise. While the mouse is wireless, there's a cable which will not only charge it, but also switch it to a "wired" mode, stopping any broadcast and presumably speeding up the recharge. The mouse will also connect to Razer's Synapse 2 cloud-based settings service, which will house the finely-tuned key shortcuts and preferences online, downloading them to any other PC you start to use the Ouroboros with. The mouse is still set to launch in Q4 this year, ringing up at Razer's online store for $130.
