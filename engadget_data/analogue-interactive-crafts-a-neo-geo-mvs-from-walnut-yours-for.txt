Crafted from 100 percent real walnut, the console boasts a seamless design without any visible screws or nails, all the audio / video outputs you could want (for a Neo Geo, that is), and even some working dust flaps. Of course, it does come at a bit of a premium price -- but $649 is actually the exact same price that SNK's original Neo Geo AES home console sold for back in the day, and it was only made out of plastic.
