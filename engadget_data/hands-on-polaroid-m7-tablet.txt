 Polaroid has its generically named Kids Tablet on hand at CES -- and don't you worry, we tested its child-proof design with a few hearty drops -- but the company is also displaying two full-grown Android tablets. The smaller of the two is the M7, which packs a 7-inch, 1,280 x 800 display. Under the hood is a 1.6GHz dual-core A9 processor with 1GB of RAM, and a 2-megapixel front camera sits to the left of the display. We found the tablet very responsive when swiping through home screens and jumping in and out of apps. This guy is running Jelly Bean -- with a skin of tile-like widgets running on top (it seemed a little too similar to Windows Phone 8's Metro interface, if you ask us).

 We can't emphasize enough how prevalent the fingerprints were when we picked up this device. Sure, it was well into a long day at CES, but the display was much greasier than other tablets we've handled. The tablet sports a rubber, textured backing which may seem cheaper than a metal finish but provides for a very comfortable grip. There's 8GB of internal storage, and the microSD card slot allows you supplement that. The MSRP is $129, with release for this spring. For now, check out our hands-on gallery and video after the break.
