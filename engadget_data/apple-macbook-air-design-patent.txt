As explained by The Verge, this one is intended to cover the laptop's distinctive wedge shape, or what's indicated by the solid lines in the illustrations included with the patent. That doesn't include things like the hinge, rear or sides of the device, but it would appear to give Apple some fairly solid ground to stand on should it choose to go after other laptop manufacturers using a "substantially similar" wedge shape (regardless of any other differences). Those interested can examine the full patent at the link below.
