And, we have to admit,recycling your old gear is a lot better than just tossing it into the basement -- or worse, a landfill. So follow theexamples of these companies, and make your gear green!

Apple Computer will pay for shipping andenvironmentally friendly disposal of any old computer with the purchase of a new Mac from the company's retail oronline stores. So, if you're a switcher, you can now let Apple deal with getting rid of that old Windows box, and ifyou're upgrading, Apple will give that old Quadra a proper send-off.
Â Sprint Nextel will spring for shipping andrecycling or disposal of any brand of cellphone -- and you don't even need to buy anything. Just grab a prepaid mailinglabel from Sprint's web site, stuff your phone in an envelope and send it off. So forget about the sentimental valuealready and send off that MicroTAC. 
VerizonWireless will also accept any old cellphone for recycling -- but you have to bring it into one of their stores. But,hey, at least they're trying.
CTIA has more info aboutcellphone recycling programs nationwide.
Delloffers something called the Asset Recovery Program. It's similar to Apple's plan, but it's only good for corporatecustomers. So, if you're an IT manager and you're about to upgrade, get Dell to clear out your old stuff, dude.
Staples will give you $30 worth ofcoupons if you drop off an old computer for recycling -- at least at certain Chicago-area stores. We hope the couponsare good on items like recycled printer paper, so you can double your greenie points.
100 Percent Day is a project sponsored by Microsoft, Intel, theUS Chamber of Commerce and others with the goal of collecting 100,000 computers for recycling -- today. The project'sweb site has a list of dropoff locations where you can bring your gear.
