 Nike's always been tight with Apple, as its Nike+ platform has gotten along with iPods and iPhones for years, and the cooperation continued with an iOS app for the FuelBand. Given the number of Android users out there, many figured the Swoosh would also release a 'droid friendly version, but it turns out those expectations will remain unfulfilled... for now. Nike Support's Twitter account confirmed as much today, saying its devs are focused on iOS and web and are not working on an Android app. Why no love for the little green 'bots? Well, Nike had this to say:

  To deliver the best experience for all Nike+ FuelBand users, we are focusing on the FuelBand experience across iOS and nikeplus.com, where you can sync your activity, set new goals, and connect with friends. At this time, we are not working on an Android version of the mobile app.

 When we asked if it's shelving its Android efforts permanently, the company informed us that it was not -- meaning we may see such an app at some undisclosed time in the future. So, hope springs eternal for all you FuelBand users with Googlefied phones.
