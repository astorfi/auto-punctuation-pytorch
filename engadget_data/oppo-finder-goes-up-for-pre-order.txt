Coming somewhat belatedly, pre-orders are now open for Chinese who want to make the 6.65mm-thick Android 4.0 phone their own. While there's just one version with 16GB of built-in space, it takes only Â¥2,498 ($393) contract-free to get a 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus screen, a dual-core 1.5GHz chip, an eight-megapixel rear camera and a 1.3-megapixel front shooter. If that sounds tempting, you won't have long to pull the trigger before the golden day: pre-orders stop on June 24th before a full-scale launch on July 1st. That won't make prospective Huawei Ascend P1 S buyers any happier at having lost phone thickness bragging rights, but it will mean just a couple of weeks' wait until we crown a new champion.
