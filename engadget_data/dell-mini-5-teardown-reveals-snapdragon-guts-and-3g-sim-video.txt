And who better to fill in the blanks than the kids over at Tinhte -- the original source of the leaked Android handheld that got official at CES? The Vietnamese site did the world a solid today by tearing into a Mini 5 sample revealing a 1GHz Snapdragon processor, two microSD slots, and a bigger 1,530mAh battery than the original 1,300mAh baby we saw back in October. The site also confirms the SIM slot with 3G radio and taste for faux 80s metal. See what we mean in the video (and bonus pic) after the break.
