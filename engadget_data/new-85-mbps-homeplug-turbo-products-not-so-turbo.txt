The good news is that HomePlug Turboproducts (they tested devices from Actiontec, NETGEAR and SMC) best HomePlug 1.0 by a few hard earned Mbps, averagingaround 10 Mbps compared to the pokey 3-5Mbps of the original, the downside is you'll be paying twice as much for theprivilege, and won't even be scraping the 4-6x speed improvements claimed. Chipmaker Intellon even confirmed theresults, so if you want that extra boost, can't string cables, and WiFi isn't cutting it, you might not have many moreoptions, but at least you know what you're getting into.
