You can add one more thing to Apple's list of new hardware and software upgrade announcements: the latest iteration of Aperture. Version 3.5 brings a handful of new features to the OS X app, including iCloud Photo Sharing support that lets you access (or give access to) shared image or video streams. In addition to that, Aperture's Places feature now uses Apple Maps to pinpoint locations where photos are taken -- not a huge surprise considering OS X Mavericks has Cupertino's map app baked right in. The upgraded app can also recognize and support iOS 7 image filters, upload videos up to three minutes long to Flickr and sync with a SmugMug image hosting account. All these features come free along with a barrel of bug fixes, so long as you have Aperture version 3.0 -- otherwise, the app's available on iTunes for $80.
