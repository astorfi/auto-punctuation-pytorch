As its name vaguely suggests, the SYNC is a heavily music-oriented device -- as many featurephones seem to be these days -- with a dedicated Cingular Music button chilling on the keypad. Features that make this Cingular's hottest 3G clamshell yet include touch-sensitive external music controls, Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP, and a 2-megapixel camera, not to mention microSD expansion and solid support for garden-variety multimedia. Look for the SYNC to make an appearance in stores and on Cingular's site... well, real soon now at a $50 price point on contract with rebates.
