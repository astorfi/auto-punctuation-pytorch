So now that the Motorola Q is finally making its way into the sweaty, outstretched palms of mobile professionals and Windows Mobile fanboys everywhere -- including our own --Â we figured it was about time for a proper roundup of reviews and news. Reaction is generally positive, with everyone naturally loving the thickness of the device and A2DP support. Some folks are reporting that the Q gets a bit pokey at times, but it's nothing our Wizard-toting friends aren't already used to.
