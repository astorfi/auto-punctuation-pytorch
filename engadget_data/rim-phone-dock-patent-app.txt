   It's that special time of the week when we examine the what-ifs and whys of the patent system. Research in Motion applied for a patent last year to construct a telephone-dock that'll nestle your BlackBerry when you're sat in the office. Plonk your device in the carved out slot and it'll offer up its display and address book for the use of your landline, in essence, a RIM-branded version of the Phone Dock we saw back in 2010. Although this device has the added benefit of being able to hand off your desktop calls to your cell and vice-versa. Now, only the vagaries of the Patent and Trademark Office, Thorsten Heins' management decisions and market forces stand between us and this device appearing in the flesh.
