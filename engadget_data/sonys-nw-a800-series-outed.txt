 
Things are finally heating up on the Sony DAP front, with those NW-A800 players we've been hearing about finally getting their first spy shots thrust into the public eye by the shameless Sony fanboys at ATRACLife. Not a lot of info can be divulged just yet, other than those 2-8GB capacity and 10 hour video battery specs we were hearing earlier, but Sony.de has a countdown to March 1st going on, so we're guessing we'll be learning more then, if not before.[Via ATRACLife]
