The 10.2 megapixel camera seems awfully similar to their previous Alpha A100 DSLR (is this the supposed successor?) with some obvious changes, including a slightly bumped 2.7-inch LCD (up from 2.5-inch) and a 750 shot lithium-ion battery (up from 600). No word on release date or price, but we'll keep our ears open, okay?Update: It's been announced for the US, details here.
