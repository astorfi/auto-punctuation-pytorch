It's basically an induction powered hotplate attached to a laptop, with a removable cutting board sandwiched between the screen and burner. Designer Dragan Trenchevski envisions this portable cook top as a boon to travelers and campers who can pull up recipes while whipping up meals miles from home, thanks to its 3G connection and battery pack. Of course, grease splatters, CPUs overheat, and an induction cook top will chew threw a battery in no time. But, like we said, the Mobile Kitchen Concept is all about flash -- not feasibility. We've got one more pic after the break, but you'll find tons more at the source.
