We knowthe I-Cat and its newly announced friends -- including the I-Pup (which sits in front of speakers instead of gettingline-in), black and pink I-Dogs, and I-Dog Chill set -- may beslightly more palatable to the American toy audience than the I-Fish, but we have to admit that we were a little bummed when thelittle guppy wasn't announced. Expect kitty and puppy this fall for $30 and $15, respectively, and the new I-Dog colorsthis spring for $30.
