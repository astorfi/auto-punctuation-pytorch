Evernote for Android just got a sizable update infused with a fresh batch of features and improvements. These changes promise to make the app easier to use, starting with listing recently made notebooks above older ones and giving users the ability to hide Business notebooks. Premium users can now draw shapes and scribble on PDFs attached to notes, courtesy of the integrated Skitch features. They can also consult the new PDF summary page, which shows snippets of all annotated content. The power to customize one's home screen is another plus for paid users, as the app now lets them hide select items from the menu. Finally, improvements to the Page Camera -- the feature that takes photos of handwritten notes and auto-enhances them -- complete this round of upgrades. The refreshed app, which is also sprinkled with stability tweaks, is now available from Google Play.
