 New York City promised subway cell phone coverage five years ago, and Transit Wireless took up the $46 million banner in 2007 -- now, three years and a friendly British jab later, at least two major carriers are convinced it's actually going to happen. Bloomberg reports that T-Mobile and AT&T have both signed ten-year agreements to let their customers access Transit's subterranean wireless network, which should cover 277 NYC stations in the years to come. Critically, we're still talking about coverage at just the stations, not actually on board -- there's till no word on when we can expect the tubes themselves to boost our sorry reception bars.
