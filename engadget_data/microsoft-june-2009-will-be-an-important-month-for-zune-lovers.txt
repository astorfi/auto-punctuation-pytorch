What's strange though, is that the people behind the account seem to care more about the future of the Zune than Office. Two tweets (of five) from this account have caught our attention. The first says, June 2009 will be an important month for Zune lovers.Then as a followup to the barrage of questions received, @officethemovie adds, New product launch, that's all I'm allowed to say. Hold off from buying an iPhone/Pre. Naturally, we're expecting the launch of the Zune HD and/or the unveiling of project Pink. Whatever happens, the month of June is going to be historic with Apple's WWDC scheduled to kick off on June 8th and the Palm Pre rumored for release on June 5th or June 7th.Update: It's worth mentioning that the big E3 gaming expo kicks off on June 2nd (press events on the 1st) -- could be important if there's any truth to the new Zune HD supporting some form of Xbox game integration.Update 2: Sadly, it's all a hoax -- but it was fun while it lasted.[Via Neowin, thanks Anthony S.]
