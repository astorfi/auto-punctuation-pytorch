 

Pioneer just officially announced their DRC-101A Blu-ray burner we toldyou about back in August. This OEM-targeted burner/player is capable of hitting up both DVDÂ±R/RWs andBlu-ray's beefier 25GB next gen optical format. Sure, it's not available for purchase but it's still good to seegenuine product announcements as 2006 nears. Expect to see much more on Blu-ray and HD-DVD asvendors begin to unveil their offerings at CES next week. [Via Akihabara News]
