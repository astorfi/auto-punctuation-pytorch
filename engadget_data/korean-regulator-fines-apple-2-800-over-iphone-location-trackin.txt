The fine certainly won't break Cupertino's bank, but it does set a precedent, marking the first time that a regulator has taken Apple to task over the issue. A few weeks ago, a Korean court ordered the company to pay about $1,000 in compensation to an individual who brought action against Apple, as part of a case that is expected to blossom into a larger, class-action suit. Kim Hyung-suk, the lawyer spearheading the campaign, told Reuters that he's looking to file the lawsuit "by next week." Apple's Korean unit, meanwhile, is still claiming innocence, with spokesman Steve Park saying: "Apple is not tracking the location of your iPhone. Apple has never done so and has no plans to ever do so." Park, however, would not say whether the company will agree to pay the fine.
