Earlier today, HTC posted the Android 4.4 KitKat kernel source and framework files for the HTC One Google Play Edition, which usually means an official OTA update is imminent. Sure enough, a user on XDA Developers has now reported that he's received the update the safe way, over-the-air. That means you'll soon see the more streamlined interface if you're rocking the Sense-less device, though some waiting may be required if the rollout is staggered. Other benefits you'll notice will be a better camera app with its own shortcut, improved battery life and more speed overall. Meanwhile, owners of the regular HTC One should get KitKat skinned with Sense in January, at least in the US and UK. If you went for the Google Play Edition, you can check your settings for the update or, if you're feeling brave, download it at the "More Coverage" link after the break.


Update: Voice activated search using "OK, Google" from the homescreen is only available on the Nexus 5 with the Google Experience launcher. The post has been updated to reflect that.
