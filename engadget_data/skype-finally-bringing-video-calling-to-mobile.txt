 So let us set this up for you: Skype has been telling everyone that it'll be making a "series of video-related announcements" at CES next month... and it's participating in a panel called "Video Calling Gets Ready for Primetime," so yeah, needless to say, we'd have to guess that Skype's finally getting ready to enter the mobile video calling game in a big way. Anyhow, the final piece in the puzzle filtered into our inbox this morning: a help document on Skype's site detailing making video calls using Skype for iPhone. We don't know whether there's a corresponding document out there for Android, Symbian, or other operating systems, but we're certainly hoping so -- because if these guys come to the table at once with versions for all the major phone platforms, we've got a feeling they'll be dominating the mobile-to-mobile and mobile-to-PC video calling market in no time.

Oh, and here's a little trivia fact for you: the Nokia N900 was actually the first device to get official video calling support from Skype, so this isn't a first for these guys -- but it'll certainly be the first time they've taken it to a mass market. Seems like they'll probably have the MeeGo build ready to go, at least.

[Thanks, Nelson]

Update: ...and they've pulled the help document. You'll just have to trust us, it was there. We swear!
