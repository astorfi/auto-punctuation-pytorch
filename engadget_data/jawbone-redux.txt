 Yeah so we know we
mentioned this little beauty quite a while ago, but now
the first reviews of Aliph's Jawbone cellphone headset are starting to turn up (this thing'll be bestowed upon the rest
of us on Wednesday). The Jawbone was designed by Yves Behar, which we didn't know before, and pretty much as we did
know before, uses bone conduction and sound processing to reduce background noise, an attribute which has caught
DARPA's attention. $150 will get you one of your very own.
