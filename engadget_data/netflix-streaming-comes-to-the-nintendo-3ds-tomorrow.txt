This may be too late for those that followed through on threats to cancel after the new rates were announced yesterday, but all other 3DS owners can get their Parks & Rec (in 3D?) anywhere in range of a WiFi signal. Joystiq also points out there's also two Game Boy games coming in tomorrow's update, Game & Watch Gallery and Baseball, just in case you're interested in using your portable game machine to actually play games.
