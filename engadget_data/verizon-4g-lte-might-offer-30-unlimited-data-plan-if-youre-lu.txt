In fact, we're just fanning the flames -- according to the folks at Droid Life, Big Red's $30 unlimited data plan could be coming to 4G LTE. The site's sources point out that this might mean $30 plus $15 for 4G data, and that pricing structures are likely to change as the LTE Juggernaut powers ahead. Considering the first Verizon 4G phones haven't even made it to market yet, unlimited data might be around for sometime to come ... then again, it might not -- don't you just love speculation?
