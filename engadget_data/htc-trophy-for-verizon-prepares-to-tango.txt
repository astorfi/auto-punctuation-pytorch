We've received a bit of good news, however, as Verizon's own documentation reveals the update is on the way. Meanwhile, a leaked tidbit courtesy of AndroidGuys suggests that we may see the refresh come as soon as tomorrow. Whether the specific date pans out remains to be seen, but whenever Tango actually arrives, it'll bring newfound WiFi hotspot functionality, multi-picture and video MMS attachments, and the ability to send / receive ringtones. As for that little blurb about the Trophy catching a piece of Apollo... well, let's just chalk that up to codename confusion.
