A full four days before these things are supposed to go on sale to the North American masses, an image of Nintendo's black Wii console has leaked from none other than Best Buy. This here shipment was actually received in the Great White North, but we're more than confident that similar packages are hitting the shipping docks of Best Buy stores everywhere here in the US, too. You'll notice that giant "Do Not Sell Before 05/09/2010" sticker there in the lower-right, but as we've seen in the past, all it takes is a pinch of airheadedness, a touch of charm and false sense of urgency to snag one early. Godspeed, Earthlings.

P.S. - The "old" Wii bundle is now on sale at Best Buy for $179.99 ($20 less than yesterday), and we suspect this will be a trend that continues to other retailers as the new packages roll out. Thanks, David!

Update: Seems these are arriving at Sam's Club locations as well, though they aren't to be sold until May 9th.
