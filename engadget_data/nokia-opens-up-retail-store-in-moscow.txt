Doesn't look like Nokia got the memo that opening stores doesn't equal increased sales (see:
Gateway), but Nokia opened up shop in Moscow today with
the intention of opening another seventeen Nokia retail stores in the next two years. Perhaps they might be forgetting
the fact that you can already try out and trade in your Nokia handset at carrier retail locations the world over, but
we assume they're approaching this as a brand-builder where Nokia phones won't have to fight tooth and nail for
consumers' attention, and where customers can get the definitive word (or even support) on old, new, and forthcoming
devices.
