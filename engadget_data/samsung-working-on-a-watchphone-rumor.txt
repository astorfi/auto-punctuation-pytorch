The Gear 2 isn't even out, but we're already seeing rumors about something else that's lurking in Samsung's R&D labs. The Korea Herald is reporting that the company is working on a SIM-enabled watchphone that'll make calls without the aid of a smartphone, just like LG's old Watch Phone and Samsung's own SPH-WP10. Of course, if a model does exist, it's likely to be an exclusive for Korean network SK Telecom in the same way that local users get first dibs on Samsung's Exynos-powered Galaxy phones. Considering the power needs of such hardware, however, it's likely going to gain a few pounds like the hefty Neptune Pine and chunky XS-3, so maybe we're better off waiting for version two... or three.
