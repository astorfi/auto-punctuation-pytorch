   Anyone who finds themselves in a New York taxi over the next few weeks stands a slim chance of getting their hands on Square's latest experiment. As The New York Times reports, the company will soon begin rolling out the first phase of its new mobile payment system for taxis, which will see 30 cabs equipped with an iPad encased in a metal housing that also includes a credit card reader. That will let folks swipe their card, sign their name on the screen with their finger, and then receive a receipt on their phone either by text or email; taxi drivers are also able to interact with the system, dubbed "Checker," using their own iPhone app. Unfortunately, details beyond that initial roll out remain a bit light, although Square is happy to point out that the system is completely silent and offers no other distractions.
