Now their entry-level $2,000 MacBook Pro has a 1.83GHz Core Duo (up from 1.67GHz), and the$2,499 model has a 2GHz processor (up from 1.83GHz) with an option to upgrade to a 2.16GHz chip for another $300. Arethey going to pass this upgrade on to people who've already pre-ordered their MacBook? Well, we certainly hope so, orApple's liable to have a lot of irate customers on their hands for upgrading their computers faster than they canactually release them.
