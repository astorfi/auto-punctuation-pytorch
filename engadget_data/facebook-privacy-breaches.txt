 Before you've even sipped your morning brew, a regional German court has delivered yet another stern judgement affecting a multinational organization. This time it's Facebook back in the dock over the Friend Finder feature, which uploads a user's contact list to Zuckerberg's bunker without proper warning. Another offense involves the ownership of data -- any original photo or music track uploaded to Facebook supposedly belongs to the company and can be used however it likes, which has now been deemed to breach data protection laws. Someone ought to add this to the Harvard Student Handbook.
