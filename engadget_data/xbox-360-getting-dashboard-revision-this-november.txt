If a set of purportedly authentic images that surfaced on Logic Sunrise (and have since been pulled at Microsoft's request) are any indication, it appears that the Xbox 360 dashboard will be tweaked to match the appearance of the new Family Center component that Microsoft recently announced (and is set to launch in November). Those changes include a new horizontal menu system instead of the current slanted design, and some other more minor tweaks like smaller text for the menu options. The image above may well not be the final dashboard, however, considering that some of the other leaked images made reference to Natal instead of Kinect, suggesting that they're from an older build.
