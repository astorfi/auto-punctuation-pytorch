If you're notyet satisfied with iris scanning, fingerprint reading, and voice recognition, it looks like Fujitsu's finally bringinga new smaller 35 x 35 x 17mm version of their palm-vein scanningPalmSecure biometrics system to a laptop near you. Nah, we're not gonna be happy until we have to urinate into acup and provide a DNA sample every time we unlock our corporate machines (you know what they say about loose lips andsinking ships), but until then at least we'll be adequately protected assuming someone doesn't chop off our hands,gouge out our eyes, and record our voice (preferably not at the same time, anyway).
