Of course, the ability to upload, store and share such high-resolution videos won't come without a price (unfortunately), and users interested in taking advantage of it are going to be forced to pay $34.95 per year. For those "Premium" members, they'll also get unlimited storage / delivery, the ability to download their original video source, embeddable HD widgets and access to all of their clips from their iPhone. For more on Viddyou, head on down to the full release -- as for us, we're just hoping this is a sign of things to come.
