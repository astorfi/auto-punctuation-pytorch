You start out by downloading a modest 18-odd megabyte package that just contains tools with no target platforms, then you open a separate app to pull and install only the platforms you want (you can go all the way back to version 1.5, if you're so inclined). So kick off that download now while you grab lunch -- we hear the lobster bisque they're serving in the cafeteria today is pretty good.
