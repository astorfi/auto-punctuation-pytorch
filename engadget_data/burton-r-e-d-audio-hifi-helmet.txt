Burton's new snowboarding helmet with a built in audio system and an ear clip design that lets those
bass notes boom right where you'll feel'em might be one of the best ways you can find to spend $150 bucks. A mute
button and an emergency-disconnect plug means you could also wear this baby in the real world, like on your
bicycle, and still hear what bums were shouting at you.
