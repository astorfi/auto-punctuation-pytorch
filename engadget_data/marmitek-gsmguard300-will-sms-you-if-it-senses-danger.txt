 You know, there's home security systems, and then there's home security systems. While other more low-budget security systems have webcams that can take pictures of the perp, this Marmitek GSMGuard300 combines the awesome power of window and door sensors with the security tool that should be in everyone's arsenal: text messages. When your door or window is opened, the system will automatically let rip a resounding klaxon and simultaneously will send you a text message. Of course, if you're not near the site an SMS won't exactly save your stuff from being stolen, nor will it give you a visual record of who stole it, but at least thanks to this â‚¬479 device, you'll have the piece of mind to know that your fortress has been breached and the slow-ass po-po can be alerted.[Via Red Ferret]
