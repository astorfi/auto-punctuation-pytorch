Apparently LaCie is feelin' said mantra, as its latest version of the Hub differs very little from last year's iteration in the design department, but it certainly shows preference for the tried and true Universal Serial Bus. The revamped Hub sports a totally round base for maximum wobbling, but maintains the white polycarbonate finish and strung out ports just like last time. If you'll notice, however, each of the seven cables are some form of USB 2.0, and no, there's not a production line snafu to blame. LaCie is betting that some of you out there would actually prefer an all-USB Hub, and if you just so happen to fit that mold, you can grab one now for $79.[Via Electronista]
