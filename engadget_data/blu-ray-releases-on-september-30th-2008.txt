 We are finally getting our first Summer blockbuster in time for the holiday season, after some rumors of delays, as Iron Man is set to hit the shelves tomorrow. This is the first title to be released in some time that is expected to once again raise the Blu-ray bar and be the best selling titles to date. But this isn't the only news this week, for starters Discovery has its latest title, When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions, which we expect to sell well, but nowhere near what Planet Earth did. Universal has a decent slate as it has a few catchup titles HD DVD and DVD fans have been enjoying for some time like Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Halloween is very obviously right around the corner as all the horror flicks are being released in droves this week, like the famous Dawn of the Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Another catalog we look forward to enjoying for the first time all over again is The Sixth Sense. Noticeably absent from the list this week is two Olympic titles like the Opening Ceremonies and a Michael Phelps special, that are only available on DVD. Looking forward, next week is the first time Disney is going into the vault and releasing a classic on Blu-ray with Sleeping Beauty, and there are a bunch more horror movies on the schedule as well.
