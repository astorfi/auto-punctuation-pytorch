 If you were following Sony's CES press event in detail, you might recall it launched with a quick video of a new Sony product made by hand. We now know that was to be the Xperia Z, and now the company's released a curiously relaxing video of a (largely) off-camera tinkerer crafting the aforementioned phone, a Cybershot RX1 and one of its HD camcorders. All within five minutes. We doubt this is how the electronics-maker's real production line works, but at least you get a glimpse into how Sony ensures its new flagship phone is kept 'omnibalanced'. (Hint: there's not much space left beneath that glossy back panel.)
