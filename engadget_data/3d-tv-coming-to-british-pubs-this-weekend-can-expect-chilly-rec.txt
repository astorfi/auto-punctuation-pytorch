 
Imagine, if you will, the quintessential British pub. A pair of elderly chaps sitting in the quiet corner discussing their best Spitfire manoeuvers, the teenage whippersnapper putting on a mature voice and trying to buy alcohol at the bar, and the inevitable legion of sports fans setting up for their weekly life or death football match. Now put 3D glasses on 'em -- doesn't work, does it? Sky TV is hoping its launch of 3D content around UK drinking establishments will be a runaway success, whereas we're just hoping those glasses aren't too hard to clean up after being inevitably discarded with disdain. Nine pubs will be broadcasting the Arsenal versus Manchester United match in 3D this Sunday, with a full rollout in April.
