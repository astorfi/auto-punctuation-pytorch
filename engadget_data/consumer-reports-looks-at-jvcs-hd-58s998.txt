       Just because a TV is a rear projection doesn't mean its got to be deep. Consumer Reports has JVC's flat LCoS up on their test bench and found it to be great picture. Sure, it costs a bit more then the sets LCoS brothern but it's flat. That way the set can be pushed directly up to the wall or even hung up if that's your type of thing. They found some flaws in the picture and knocked it down a bit due to lack of cable card, but overall found it to be a nice HDTV. If you seeking a slender, big screen HDTV, this might be the best way to go.
