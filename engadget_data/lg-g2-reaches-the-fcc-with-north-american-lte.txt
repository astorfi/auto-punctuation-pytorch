Want to know which North American carriers might offer the LG G2 after August 7th? The FCC is offering a big hint: it just approved a region-appropriate version of the Android flagship. Going under its D801 codename, the G2 variant cleared by the agency supports all the LTE and HSPA frequencies used by AT&T, T-Mobile and large Canadian networks. As such, it's likely that the smartphone will get a multi-carrier launch next month. The real question is whether or not any CDMA providers (which aren't included in the filing) will come along for the ride.
