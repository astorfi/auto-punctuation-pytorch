 
Garmin's just unleashed two new lines of GPS units, the nüvi1200 and 1300 models. Both lines are capable of pedestrian navigation (making use of CityXplorer maps), which is totally awesome if, like us, you use the GPS to get you where you're going, then get lost as soon as you set foot outside your vehicle. The new, super-slim nüvis come in 3.5-inch (1200) and 4.5-inch (1300) variations, and some models in the lines will offer features such as Bluetooth and text-to-speech, and all of them feature Garmin's free lifetime traffic service. The new units should be available in North America in the second quarter of 2009, for prices ranging from $250-$300. Hit the read link for the full release after the break. 

 
          
 
 
 Garmin® Introduces the Ultra-Thin nüvi® 1200 and 1300 Series, Offering New Pedestrian Navigation and Expanded FunctionalityPosted March 3, 2009LATHE, Kan./March 3, 2009/Business Wire - Garmin International Inc., a unit of Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRMN), the global leader in satellite navigation, today announced the nüvi 1200 and nüvi 1300 series – an innovative family of navigators with a new ultra-thin design that offer enhancements for navigation in and out of the car. This new series of products introduced at CeBIT in Hannover, Germany, March 3-8, 2009, is ideal for the consumer who wants advanced features at a value price. The nüvi 1200 and 1300 series are the first nüvi devices to offer pedestrian navigation capability enabled through optional CityXplorer™ maps. CityXplorer maps are available for select tourist destinations in both North America and Europe, and can easily be downloaded directly to the nüvi.Various models of the nüvi 1200 and 1300 product families also provide other premium features like free lifetime traffic alerts and lane assist for added confidence in navigating complicated intersections and turns. All these new devices feature text to speech, a technology that enables the enunciation of names and upcoming roads – enhancing confidence while navigating in unfamiliar locations."Our nüvi devices are known for the great navigation experience they provide in the vehicle. Now our customers can have that same great experience when navigating an unfamiliar city by foot or public transportation," said Dan Bartel, Garmin's vice president of worldwide sales. "The nüvi 1200 and 1300 products allow us to meet the needs of that on-the-go customer by offering an affordable nüvi that provides location and destination information when, where, and how they need it most. The personal navigation device (PND) is no longer just for the car – take it with you wherever you go and enjoy the enhanced usability and rich features only a dedicated device like this can offer." In addition to features offered by other members of the nüvi family, these new multi-mode navigators feature a public transit mode supporting optional CityXplorer content. Available as a download for select cities, CityXplorer allows the user to plan and use routes that can include public transit options such as bus, tramway, metro and suburban rail systems. With CityXplorer, users can get the most out of their navigation experience to many exciting cities across North America and Europe. The thinner and lighter form factor of these new products allows the unit to be more easily carried in a pocket or purse – making it ideal for pedestrian navigation. Content from CityXplorer varies in cost from $9.99 - $14.99, depending on the city. A list of cities offered in North America and Europe is expected to be available in the second quarter of 2009 at www.garmin.com.To help drivers make their gas tanks go the extra mile, these devices come standard with ecoRoute™, which suggests fuel-efficient navigation. In addition to "faster time" and "shorter distance" for route preference, ecoRoute lets nüvi users choose "less fuel" as the best way to save gas and money. Through ecoRoute's Fuel Report and Mileage Report, drivers can focus on their fuel conservation, and also find fuel-saving tips along the way.All models in the nüvi 1300 series boast a bright 4.3" touchscreen display and feature text to speech technology.

For transatlantic travel, the nüvi 1370T comes standard with mapping for North America and Europe. Both the 1350, 1350T and 1370T add lane assist, which highlights the preferred lane for navigation.
