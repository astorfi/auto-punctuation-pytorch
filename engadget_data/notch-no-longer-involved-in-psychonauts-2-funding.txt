  Markus "Notch" Persson, who has made a fortune as the developer of indie game Minecraft, is no longer interested in financing Psychonauts 2. Persson's involvement in the project began last year when he offered to fund the project. Although he noted reservations at the time, it appears those issues have grown over the past year to the point where he won't be funding the project."I somewhat naively thought 'a couple of million' was two million. I had no doubt in my mind that a Psychonauts 2 would earn that money back easily. Turns out [Double Fine] wanted 18 million dollars, haha," Persson wrote on Reddit last week. "I don't have the time at the moment to even try to get educated enough to make an 18 million dollar deal. Perhaps in some distant future when I'm no longer trying to make games, I could get into angel investing. I've made one private investment into a game so far, at $100K, and it's frankly a lot more work than I thought."Psychonauts developer Double Fine tells VentureBeat that it's currently focused on its funded Kickstarter project. The company states it hasn't budgeted out a sequel and will "likely explore alternative funding methods that will require multiple sources to make it a reality."
