Taking the leap into Google's mobile world just became that little bit easier as T-Mobile has decided to strip off the last remaining $50 on its G2 contract price and set it loose for free on two-year deals. This will be a quite familiar sight to our European readers, but premier Android handsets rarely, if ever, occupy such sweet price points in the US. Let's hope it's a harbinger of happy things to come.

Update: This pricing is only valid between now and January 20th, so if you want in, better do it soon.
