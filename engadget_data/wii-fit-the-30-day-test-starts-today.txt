Although I'd like to start by disclaiming that I've never really worked out with any regularity, I'm not exactly known for my physical coordination, and in school I always came pretty close to flunking PE -- so really, I'm kind of Nintendo's ideal customer.Methodology

I'll be working with Wii Fit out about 20 game-minutes a day, 7 days a week.
My program will consist of five minutes each of routines and games from the four fitness categories: strength training, aerobics, yoga, and balance games.
As a control, I won't be dramatically changing up my eating habits. I'm already a reasonably healthy eater, so any physical changes will be more easily attributable to the Wii Fit regimen.
I have about a week of travel scheduled this month, so for whatever days I miss on Wii Fit I'll be extending the trial.
I'll chart my changes in weight, BMI, coordination, etc. and thoughts on the experience in a weekly update for the next five weeks.
