According to a report from the Financial Times, the Finnish manufacturer is looking to sell off its Vertu line of luxury handsets, as part of the firm's ongoing restructuring process. Citing a source "familiar with the process," the FT went on to explain that Goldman Sachs is overseeing the sale, though it's still in a nascent stage of development. The brand has reportedly attracted the interest of unnamed private equity firms, though the same insider claims that luxury goods vendors may toss their hats in the ring, as well. Neither Nokia nor Goldman have commented on the report, but we'll be sure to let you know when they do.
