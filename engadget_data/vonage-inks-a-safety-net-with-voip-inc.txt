 
Vonage just announced a deal with VoIP, Inc. in hopes of skirting 2 of the 3 Verizon patents they were found to be infringing upon. The two-year deal allows VoIP Inc. to carry calls made by Vonage customers across its nationwide network -- likely under their existing VOICEONE brand. The agreement should provide Vonage (and its customers) some protection should the permanent injunction be upheld. After all, VoIP Inc. claims to own the intellectual property swaddling their network services. Something Vonage also claimed back in the day. Ah, such is patent law.
