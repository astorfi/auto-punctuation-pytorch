Except users no longer need say "Vista with CableCARD" or OCUR (OpenCable Receivers) -- those boxes are now referred to as "Digital Cable Tuners", or DCTs, and that's the hardware you're going to need on your CableLabs certified Vista box to record digital cable HDTV. Expect to see a hell of a lot of boxes like this one at this year's CES, as well as any number of HTPCs ready to take advantage of it.
