Well, we don't know yet if beta 3 is any better, but it's here -- and if you're a member of Apple's iPhone dev program, it's ready for you to install. So yeah -- take care, good luck, godspeed, be prepared for the worst, and hope for the best. Let us know how it goes in comments, yeah?

Update: And... it's been pulled. Good thing we just restored our phone. We'll let you know if and when it comes back.

Update 2: Turns out you can still access the firmware with a little creative URL hackery -- but you've still got to be an iPhone dev program member, naturally. Thanks, Brian!

Update 3: Reports are coming in that it's back and available without any trickery!
