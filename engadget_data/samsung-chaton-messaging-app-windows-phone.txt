It has already claimed a place on Android, Bada, iOS, and BlackBerry devices, plus its own web-based client. Now the app's finally ready to embrace those long-suffering Samsung-made Windows Phones -- it's apparently available to download from the phone-based marketplace. Unfortunately, the link has gone inert on the web store, so you'll have to hit up the dedicated Samsung zone on your phone to grab the messaging service. Let's hope Victoria Justice is still looking to party.
