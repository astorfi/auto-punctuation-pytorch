 Acer certainly isn't starved for laptop offerings these days, but that doesn't seem to be stopping it from expanding its arsenal even further, with the company now reportedly set to release a pair of new models boasting Blu-ray drives and some high res screens to match. While it's apparently still not entirely official, DigiTimes reports that the laptops will consist of a 16-inch and an 18.4-inch model, both of which will sport a "Full HD panel" (which we assume means 1920 x 1080, though you can never be sure about such things). Unfortunately, there's no other details on the laptops (which won't necessarily look like the one at the right, though the standard Gemstone design would seem to be a pretty safe bet), but they'll apparently ring up at between $1,900 and $2,240 when they land sometime in the second quarter of this year.[Via Electronista]
