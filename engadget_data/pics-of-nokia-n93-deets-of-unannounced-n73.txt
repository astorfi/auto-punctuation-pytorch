Supposedly the N73, as it's being called(sorry, no pics available yet), will add a million-odd pixels to its predecessor's camera, along with Bluetooth 2.0,S60 3rd Edition, and a "very special stylish design,' along with maintaining the 3G and video calling goodnessfound on the older model. As we suspected before, the N93 (successor to the N92) will sport Bluetooth 2.0, UMTS, WiFi, a QVGA screen,and like all new N-series phones, S60 3rd Edition. Also shown was the 6133, which is just the US version of the 6131 clamshell introducedlast month, although as with the other two models, none of that vital pricing/availability info is known.[Thanks, Jabar]
