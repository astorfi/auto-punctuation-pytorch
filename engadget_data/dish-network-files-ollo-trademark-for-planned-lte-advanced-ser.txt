Now, two recently filed trademark applications are tipping us off to a potential name for the satellite operator's planned 4G network, known as "Ollo." According to the company's filings, this brand would encompass both future equipment and services, huddling smartphones, tablets and a triple play of services under the same umbrella. The hybridized network still has significant hurdles to overcome before it gets a greenlight -- namely, a proven lack of LightSquared-like GPS interference. But, it appears the company's confident its newly acquired holdings will pass Go, delivering heretofore unseen downlink / uplink speeds to subscribers. As ever, we'll keep a close watch on this as it develops.
