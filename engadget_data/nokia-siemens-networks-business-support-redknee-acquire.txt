 There aren't too many surefire ways to get oneself focused in the business world, but completely detaching a corporation from a business division ain't a bad tactic. Just two days after Nokia Siemens Networks announced that it'd be selling off its optical business in order to focus on LTE, the firm has relinquished absolute control over yet another division. Dubbed a "planned acquisition" by Redknee CEO Lucas Skoczkowski, his company will be taking ownership of NSN's Business Support Systems. For Nokia Siemens Networks, it means 1,200 fewer employees to handle (they'll be moving to Redknee, not fired), and who knows how many saved headaches.

 The division is presently responsible for providing "real-time charging, rating, policy, and customer care solutions to more than 130 communication service providers, including half of the top 100 global mobile operators." In other words, precisely the type of baggage you'd hope to drop if looking to "focus on mobile broadband," as stated by NSN CEO Rajeev Suri. Nothing like a little spring cleaning in December, huh?
