Skype friends who would like to see your living room without actually visiting can take a peek in either 30fps VGA or 720p/22fps h.264 encoded streams, courtesy of any nearby video phone compatible VIERA Cast TVs this can mount on top of and plug into via USB. We're (probably the only ones) waiting for a Chatroulette couch surfing client, but if you prefer your internet face-to-face meetings without the PC then Â¥18,000 ($193) on June 11 will make it yours in Japan, no word on U.S. availability.
