   Imagine when the Bang & Olufsen Beolit 12 (label after the break) came through the double doors of the FCC's underground bunker. Seeing the golden honeycomb speaker and faux-Bakelite styling, the technicians all dashed home to slick back their hair and put on sharp suits before subjecting this particular iPod dock with AirPlay capabilities to the usual multimeter and rulers treatment we expect from our boys. The top area is hollow to keep your futuristic-looking iDevice from sticking out and ruining the illusion that you're living in 1964 (did you see the brown leather carrying strap?). Since it's been approved by the Government, we can only assume it's not long for these shores, and since it's a B&O device, we can expect it to retail for four or five times what you'd expect to pay.[Image courtesy AMC TV]
