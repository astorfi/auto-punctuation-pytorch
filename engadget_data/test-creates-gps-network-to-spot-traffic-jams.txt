We've seen a number of experiments that attempt to link drivers together, with goals like
music sharing and
social networking (which would really put the Mo
in MoSoSo), but here's one that might actually be
worth the effort: A $1.3 million study by New York's Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (funded by federal and state
highway officials) links GPS data from participating vehicles into a central database and spits back data on traffic
patterns. A driver with the right equipment gets realtime warnings if he's about to enter a congested zone, and can
then route around it. Sounds great, but we can't help but wonder: if everyone's connected, and they all follow the same
prompts to avoid congestion, won't the traffic just hit them all when they adjust their route â€” and again, when they
swerve to avoid the jam they've just created?
