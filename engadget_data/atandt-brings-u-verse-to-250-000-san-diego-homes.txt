Since launching in June of 2007, AT&T has delivered access of its fiber-based TV / internet service to over 250,000 domiciles in the Greater San Diego area. Granted, it didn't say how many actually took advantage and signed up, but it's still maintaining that it will have one million subscribers before 2009 dawns. We'll see, now won't we?
