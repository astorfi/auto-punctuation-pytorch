Got a feature list for your dream in-ear headphones? Get ready to screw it up in a ball and be ashamed at how short it was. Enter "The Dash," the name given to a pair of wireless smart headphones currently making waves on Kickstarter. The project is only a few days old, has already smashed through its $260,000 target, and is set to reach a cool million before the week is out. What's all the fuss about? Well that laundry list of features we mentioned. Of course they're wireless (Bluetooth 4.0, with support for aptX), have touch control (left ear for tracking, right for sound), 4GB onboard storage for media playback (or use your phone), audio training feedback, an accelerometer, heart rate monitor, oxygen saturation sensor, "transparent" mode (so you can hear ambient sounds without removing), oh and they're also waterproof to one meter. Most of that functionality is on the headphones themselves, though there will be a mobile app for expanded functionality (viewing your training logs etc.). Well, we mean it will be once the funds are released and the real work begins. While that's still another 45 days away, a new case that doubles as a chargeable battery pack has just been added to the project after meeting its first stretch goal. So the deal (currently $199 if you're quick), is looking better all the time.
