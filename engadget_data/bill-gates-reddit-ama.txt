 Ever wonder who made the call to not pursue the Courier? Or, why did Microsoft kill off the Kin so quickly? Maybe looking for someone who can tell you whether the post-PC era is really a thing? Here's your chance. Bill Gates is currently doing an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit, which, as the name implies, gives you the chance to get your questions answered. Get your best inquiry prepared and hit up the source link -- but don't get too excited. In just 45 minutes Gates' post has already received 4,400 responses, meaning you might have a bit of a wait before he gets to that most important question: yours.

 Update: Video of Bill answering the first few questions added after the break.
