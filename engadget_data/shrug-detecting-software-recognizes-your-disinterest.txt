The application works by looking for sudden movements of the target's shoulders towards his/her face, andis so sophisticated that it cannot be fooled even by covering one shoulder with a piece of paper, as the above picturehelpfully illustrates. Future iterations of the technology could be used to detect blinking, hand movements, facialexpressions, and other mood indicators, but for the sake of our enslaved decendents forced to toil in the siliconmines, we hope that they leave certain expressive gestures, such as the raising of the middle finger, out of thesoftware's lexicon.[Via The Raw Feed]
