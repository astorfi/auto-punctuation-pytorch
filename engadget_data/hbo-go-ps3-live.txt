It's been a long time coming, but today the HBO Go app is finally available on PlayStation 3. Sadly, those of us who moved last-gen's consoles out of the living room to make space for shiny new ones are still in the lurch -- the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions are still missing release dates. But for the rest of us, still enjoying The Last of Us' DLC or soaking up those delicious free PS+ games, there are episodes of True Detective to watch. That is, unless you have Comcast, since like Roku and Samsung's Smart TV platform, the PS3 is not on the provider's list of approved devices along with the Xbox 360 and Apple TV.
