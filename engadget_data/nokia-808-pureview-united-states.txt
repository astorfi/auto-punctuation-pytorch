If you've been patiently waiting for your opportunity to wield this highly competent cameraphone for yourself, just know that you can soon stake your claim in line: pre-orders are set to begin later this week, and you can sign up on Nokia's website to receive that all-important notification. As for price, expect to pay $699 outright for this bulbous beauty, which offers support for AT&T's 3G network here in the US.

 Update: Nokia has revised its spec sheet to clarify that the 808 PureView destined for US shores will include a pentaband 3G radio. This is significant for T-Mobile customers, who will also be able to access HSPA networks at 14.4Mbps.
