 Nintendo's Executive VicePresident of Sales and Marketing, Reggie Fils-Aime, had a chat with News.com recently, and laid it on the line aboutthe company's plans for the new year -- and about what Nintendo really thinks of the competition. Among other things,Fils-Aime dissed the PSP, saying that "the buzz for the DS is huge and growing, and the most anticipated handheldtitles are on our platform, not on Sony's." He also hit the Xbox 360 for being overpriced, insisting that afull-on 360 rig with accessories would cost customers $700, while the Revolution will run for under $300 (though wesomehow doubt Nintdendo will shy away from selling or endorsing high-priced Revolution accessories). Ah, not since Sim Wong Hoo have we seen such braggadocio; spin on, Reggie, spinon![Via DS Fanboy]
