 Lookslike some jobs are just too big for even the almighty Google. After saying for months thatthe company wanted to run San Francisco's proposed free citywide WiFi service, Google has now partnered with Earthlinkto submit a new bid for the project. Given Earthlink's experience wiring other cities including Anaheim and Philadelphia, the partnership could all butguarantee that the SF government will choose GooLink over other bidders, which include both local companies andbusinesses backed by heavy hitters such as IBM and Cisco.[Via the WirelessReport]
