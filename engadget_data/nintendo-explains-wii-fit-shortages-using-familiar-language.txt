 Well, it looks like all that experience Nintendo has half-explaining Wii supply issues isn't going to waste -- the company just issued a statement regarding shortages of Wii Fit that sounds awfully familiar. Seriously, follow along with us here:

Wii shortages, Nov. 14, 2007: "The demand for Wii hardware globally has been unprecedented and higher than Nintendo could ever have anticipated."
Wii Fit shortages, Aug. 28, 2008: "Nintendo had a substantial supply nationwide for launch, though some stores saw spot shortages due to unprecedented demand for this unique product."

Here's a thought, guys: if there's "unprecedented" demand for the console, the demand for arguably the biggest accessory for that console since launch probably isn't unprecedented as well -- and your PR people shouldn't be so well-versed in making excuses like this.[Via Slashgear]
