Well, if they get by Team Engadget using the
FriskerPRO all vigilante style, potential airport
ne'er-do-wells (and all of the hapless passengers who live in fear of them) might soon have one more safety check to
make it through: a walk-thorugh lie
detector test. The passenger puts on headphones and is asked yes or no questions as to whether they are planning
anything illicit; the GK-1 voice analyzer detects uncontrollable tremors in the voice of the baddies — or of people who
just get freaked out at airport security terminals — who are then taken aside for further questioning. The system is in
trials in Russia and out of 500 passengers the system pointed to the one who was planning something illegal. It should
cost around $10,000 to $30,000 when they start selling it, which is a real steal for airport security equipment, so
maybe they can install more than two or three and keep those lines moving.
