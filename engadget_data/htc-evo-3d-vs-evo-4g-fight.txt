As we'd mentioned in our hands-on, we immediately noticed that the EVO 3D didn't feel particularly heavy or bulky in the hand; in fact, we would've guessed that it was a bit lighter than the 4G. Well, turns out they're almost exactly the same weight -- holding the two one right after the other, we couldn't detect a difference.

As for dimensions, the 4G is actually wider -- the 3D's quite a bit more manageable when you're holding it, especially if you don't have giant paws -- and they're right around the same thickness. Pretty amazing that HTC was able to pack this much additional heat into a phone one year after the first model without adding any bulk, isn't it? Science!
