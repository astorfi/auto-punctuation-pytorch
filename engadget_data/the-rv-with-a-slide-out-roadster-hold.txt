 Recreational vehicle enthusiasts love to be able to bring their favorite mod cons with them on their annual road trips, so German RV manufacturer Volkner Mobile's idea to develop a motor home capable of storing an entire car in its underbelly is sure to be popular with those that can afford the undoubtedly high pricetag. All it needs is a green paint job, a big number "2" on both sides and you've set up every Thunderbirds fan in the country for a month of restless nights: this pointlessly excessive system definitely makes it the Tracy family's day tripper of choice. The car storage system itself consists of a 5 meter long movable plate that sits between the front and rear wheels, and is short enough to cater for low, roadster type cars. The motor home will be on display at the International Caravan Fair in Dusseldorf, Germany for the next few days: if you're at the show, just look for a stressed out attendant surrounded by hundreds of kids screaming at him to do the car storage thing again.[Via Autoblog]
