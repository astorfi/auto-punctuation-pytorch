Via's Isaiah processor is now official and re-dubbed Nano. The Atom-spanking (at least preliminarily), 65-nm processors come in U (ultra-portable) and L (desktop and laptop) classes with a maximum power rating pegged between 5W to 25W. The 1GHz U2300, 1.3+GHz U2400, and 1.2GHz U2500 pull just 5W, 8W, and 6.8W, respectively with an itty bitty 100mW idle draw. Products are expected to hit shelves (and your palm) sometime in Q3. We'll bring you the detailed Nano vs. Atom vs. Puma benchmarks just as soon as we get 'em.[Thanks, Ryan]
