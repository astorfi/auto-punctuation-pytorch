Basically this thing is a media streaming beta box to test out DivX's new connected hardware platform initiative, so it's safe to say that while a select few beta testers will get to play around with a GejBox, this device will most likely never make it to market -- at least not in its current form. (DivX is really trying to get harware-makers to pick up their platform, we don't think they want to be in the box business.) Still, it does have some interesting features, like S/PDIF, and HDMI, and because the platform is intended to be incredibly extensible, not only do you have the requisite home network video / picture / audio streaming, but it's also got support for live DivX Stage 6 high-def internet video streaming, and even a Google Video plugin not too different from the YouTube Apple TV plugin we saw debuted at D.
