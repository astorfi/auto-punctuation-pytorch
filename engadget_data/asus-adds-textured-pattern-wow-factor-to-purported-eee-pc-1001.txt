Granted, we've got Microsoft to thank for that, but it's still getting tougher by the day to keep all of these things from running together. Shortly after having a peek at the supposedly upcoming Eee PC 1201n comes this -- a smattering of hands-on shots of the purported Eee PC 1001HA. Slated to be available with Linux, Windows XP or no OS at all (saywha?), this here Eee could very well slot into the Seashell lineup given that bold pattern lathered on the chassis. Internally, you'll find the tired Atom N270, 1GB of RAM, a 160GB hard drive and an ExpressCard-to-Zzzzzzz adapter. But hey, at least that 3-cell battery means you'll be computing for days on end, right?
