Easy, a new 79,828 X 19,290 pixel GigaPan image has just been released for you to get pervy with as the MLB invites you to scour all 1,539 megapixels for friends and family or people whom you wish were your friends or family. The image was taken over a 17-minute span and consists of 280 photos stitched together into an ultra hi-res image. You can even link the site to your Facebook account and start tagging everyone you know. Now hit the source below and let the voyeuristic zoomfest begin!
