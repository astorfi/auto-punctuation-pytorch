Specifically, the 800MHz and 2600MHz bands are at play here, the former having come from the country's transition to digital TV; both will serve distinctly different roles, with 800MHz being better for building penetration and rural coverage and 2600MHz suiting urban areas better. Sadly, it means that we're moving even further away from global spectrum harmony, seeing how the US is using 700MHz and 2500MHz for 4G services so far -- so don't expect a single handset SKU capable of handling LTE anywhere in the world any time soon.
