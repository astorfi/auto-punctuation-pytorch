Prices will start at just $150 on a three-year contract, and jump to $350 on a two-year one, $400 on a one-year deal, and a full $450 if you don't want any strings attached at all. You can also expect to pay $15 a month for a basic email and IM plan, or $30 for email, web browsing and IM -- on top of your usual voice plan, of course.
