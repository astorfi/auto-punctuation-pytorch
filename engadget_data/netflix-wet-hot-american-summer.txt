Netflix's first shot at resurrecting a cult hit production  wasn't exactly flawless. However, it's apparently not afraid to give this everything-old-is-new-again strategy another try. Both Deadline and the Hollywood Reporter claim that the streaming video service has started filming a follow-up to Wet Hot American Summer that would turn the 2001 camp comedy into an eight-episode limited series. Moreover, it'll reportedly include "virtually" all the original cast -- that means Amy Poehler, David Hyde Pierce, Molly Shannon and more. Netflix isn't confirming any plans, but the company's Ted Sarandos already hinted that the service is "really excited" about the possibility of a Wet Hot revival. Don't be surprised if you hear a lot more about this '80s nostalgia piece in the months ahead.


Update (1/27): It's official! Netflix has confirmed the cast with a quick trailer (embedded after the break). Expect to see Elizabeth Banks, Michael Ian Black, Bradley Cooper, Judah Friedlander, Janeane Garofalo, Joe Lo Truglio, Ken Marino, Christopher Meloni, Marguerite Moreau, Zak Orth, Amy Poehler, David Hyde Pierce, Paul Rudd, Molly Shannon, and Michael Showalter back in Camp Firewood when it airs "just in time for summer."
