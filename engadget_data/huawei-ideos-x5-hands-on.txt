This device uses the same formula as the original IDEOS (also known as the Comet for T-Mobile) and aims to provide a decent product at a competitive price. Although we already knew the specs, this was our chance to play with the IDEOS X5 and gather more information. The phone looks elegant and feels solidly built, with a 3.8-inch WVGA capacitive display behind glass in front and 1500mAh battery behind soft-touch plastics in back, all wrapped in an 11.4mm-thin body. Take a look at the gallery below, and hit the break for additional details and our hands-on video.





On the hardware front, the 800MHz Qualcomm MSM7230 CPU is paired with an Adreno 205 GPU and 512MB of RAM. The radio is tri-band HSPA+ with support for AWS (900 / 1700 / 2100MHz). There's a second microphone in the back of the phone for noise cancellation, as well as SRS for audio enhancement and an FM radio. The 5 megapixel camera, which features autofocus and a single LED flash, also supports 720p HD video recording. There's a microSD card slot in addition to 4GB of built-in storage, as well as a video output capability. Regarding software, the IDEOS X5 runs vanilla Android 2.2 and features Flash 10.1, Swype, and hotspot functionality. While the phone won't break any speed records, it's sufficiently fast, scoring 1470 on the Quadrant test. Huawei didn't disclose any pricing information or carrier partnerships (although T-Mobile seems likely with AWS on board). Availability is slated before mid-2011 with -- sadly -- no plans for Android 2.3 at this point in time.
