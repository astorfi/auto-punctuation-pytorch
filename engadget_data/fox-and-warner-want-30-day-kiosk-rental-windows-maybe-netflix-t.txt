While Redbox has already filed suit against Universal and now Fox in response to them imposing a 30 day delay, starting in October, Warner will simply "change its terms". The interesting twist here is that the new 28 day delay from Warner also applies to "mail-order subscription services" -- but there is a new day-and-date revenue sharing option. This should be fun to watch play out, but we'd be shocked if Netflix and the studios didn't work something out, and hope that Netflix won't also have to involve the law in order to protect its first-sale doctrine rights.
