 NVIDIA execs have been talking smack about general-purpose CPUs for a while now, and it looks like Intel's ready to do some talking of its own -- speaking to CustomPC, Intel SVP Pat Gelsinger said that general-purpose GPU computing initiatives like NVIDIA's CUDA would be nothing more than "interesting footnotes in the history of computing annals." According to Gelsinger, the lack of a viable new programming model has held back similarly different architectures like the PS3's Cell because "years later the application programmers have barely been able to comprehend how to write applications for it." That's certainly an interesting point, but we'd say Gelsinger's not really taking stock of the big picture here -- fully utilizing the power of the GPU is the whole point of CUDA, after all, and OS developers like Apple are pushing OpenCL as a way to make GPU acceleration easier to for developers to access. Still, Intel has already said that discrete graphics are on their way out as hybrid tech like Larrabee enters the scene, and Gelsinger basically repeated the party line, saying that and "evolutionary compatible computing model" will be the "right answer long term." Those are some fightin' words -- it's going to be interesting to see how these competing chip strategies play out as other entrants like AMD's Fusion slowly make the scene as well.
