Laptop has just awarded Lenovo's recently announced X200 ultraportable an Editor's Choice award after determining that what it has is likely what you'll want. Reviewers deemed the travel-friendly machine an "excellent lightweight notebook for mobile professionals who demand the business essentials," noting that the omission of an optical drive wasn't really a deal-breaker for them. The Centrino 2 platform was also praised, and while performance wouldn't please the avid gamer, it should handle most everyday tasks without breaking a sweat. If you've got $1,200 or so burning a hole in your pocket, this might not be a bad way to remove that discomfort.
