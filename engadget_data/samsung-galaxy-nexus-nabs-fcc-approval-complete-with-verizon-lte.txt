The wait continues, but one more step in the regulatory process leading up to said launch is now complete -- the Samsung I515 just popped up in the hallowed pages of the FCC website. It offers the usual suspects of LTE band 13 (Verizon's particular flavor of 700MHz spectrum) and EVDO / CDMA, as well as the expected inclusion of NFC. Not included? US GSM frequencies, as far as we can tell. We'll continue to dig for more clues here, but at least we know it's one step closer to finally making it to your local store.
