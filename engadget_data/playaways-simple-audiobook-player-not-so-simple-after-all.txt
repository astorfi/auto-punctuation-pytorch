We weren't really digging the whole "buy a new audio player for each audiobook" concept for the
Playaway in the first place, but now that they're about
to land in stores we're hearing that they're having trouble making it easy to use anyways; kind of defeating the idea
of marketing these to people who lack the ability to even load up an iPod. The biggie is that the battery is very hard
to access, and with an estimated 12 hours of life off of the included triple-A battery, grandpa is going to need to get
in there sooner or later. The article details the rush, and many false starts, involved in getting these out the doors,
so no telling if they got the bugs out in time. They sure won't have us for beta testers!
