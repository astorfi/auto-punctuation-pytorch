If someone told us that Doom would run at full resolution—and freaking fast—on the
Nokia 770 that we've seen, played
with, and sincerely cast doubt upon, we probably wouldn't have believed them. Had we not watched the video. But damn,
does that Linux Doom port fly on that thing.
Just thought you might like to know—yes, there's a little hope left yet.
