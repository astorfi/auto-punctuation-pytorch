Speaking with Crave, a Sling spokesperson further added that the issues "were the result of a data migration process that, while carefully planned for a long time, still had a number of unexpected problems." The spokesperson went on to note that while things have gotten better over the last 24 hours, "they aren't nearly good enough for everyone yet" -- something confirmed by a number of Sling users who are continuing to report problems on the official support forums today. So hang in there -- things are getting better, slowly.
