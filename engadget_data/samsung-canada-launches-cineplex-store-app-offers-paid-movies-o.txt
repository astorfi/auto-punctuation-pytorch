The two companies have teamed up for a video-on-demand app, dubbed Cineplex Store, which will allow owners of "select models of Samsung's Smart TVs, Blu-ray players and home theater systems" to purchase or rent videos from the comfort of their couches. Pricing is set from about three to five bucks for 48-hour unlimited play rentals (from the time you hit play within a 30-day period), while buying titles outright will cost ya between $10 and $20 -- all without any pesky contracts. Notably, for those prices you'll also be able to store your content in a "digital locker" and rack up Scene points with Cineplex. While it appears that there's nary mention of which Smart devices are compatible, you can hit up the source link below and the press release after break for more details.
