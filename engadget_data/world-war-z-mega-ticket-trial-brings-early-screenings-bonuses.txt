Now that viewers can get excellent movie theater experiences at homes, studios and theaters are trying different strategies to keep bringing them in. Tomorrow night, Paramount will try a new tactic: offering buyers of its $50 "Mega Ticket" an early viewing of World War Z in 3D, plus a pair of collectible 3D glasses, a movie poster, an HD digital copy of the movie when it's available on Blu-ray, and a small (seriously?) popcorn. We're not sure if making it more expensive to go to the movies is the right way to go, but maybe it's worth it for those who are really hyped about the film. The viewing is only available at a few Regal Theaters, listed after the break if if you're interested in what's listed as $75 worth of value.
