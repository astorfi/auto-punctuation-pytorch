The service is different to Japan's other smartphone-TV network, One-Seg, which just relays terrestrial broadcasts to your mobile device -- not least because it lets you share snarky ripostes after watching a clip. It's backed by the country's major channels as well as NTT DoCoMo and it just needs the heavy rubber stamp of governmental approval before you can start hunting down condensed editions of Takeshi's Castle from April 2012.
