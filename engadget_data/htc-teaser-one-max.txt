Remember when HTC decided to add its own contributions to the One Mini rumor mill by using its own infographic? It seems the Taiwan-based company is following the same trend with the HTC One Max, a device that we've heard about for what seems like months. On its official Twitter account, it posted a teaser in the form of a six-second Vine, three simple words and a hashtag: "big things ahead. #HTChange." Take from that what you will, but it seems to us that this particular tease means we'll be seeing the larger variant of the One sooner rather than later.


Update: There's now a YouTube clip showing a similar teaser, but it's not clear whether the phone featured in it is actually the One Max. See for yourself after the break.
