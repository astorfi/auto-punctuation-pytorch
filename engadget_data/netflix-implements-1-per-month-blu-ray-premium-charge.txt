We learned in August that Netflix would be tacking on a $1 surcharge per month for unlimited access to Blu-ray titles, and now a flood of users are receiving e-mails confirming the fee. Starting on November 5th, the $1 charge will be added on each month so long as you're craving BD content, though we have a sneaking suspicion that won't force you back into the less detailed world of DVD. Gotta pay to play, they say. Check the full text of the e-mail after the break.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
      

 

As you may know, Blu-ray movies are more expensive than standard definition movies. As a result, we're going to start charging $1 a month (plus applicable taxes), in addition to your monthly membership charge, for unlimited access to Blu-ray movies.The additional charge for unlimited Blu-ray access will be automatically added to your next billing statement on or after November 5th, 2008 and will be referenced in your Membership Terms and Details. If you wish to continue getting Blu-ray movies for $1 a month more, you don't need to do anything. If not, you can remove Blu-ray access anytime by visiting Your Account at the Netflix website.If you have questions about this change or need any assistance, please call us anytime at 1-888-638-3549.-The Netflix Team
