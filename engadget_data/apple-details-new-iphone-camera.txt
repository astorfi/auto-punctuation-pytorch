Now that Apple's announced the new iPhone 5s, it's taking some time to detail the camera, which, as you'd expect, has been upgraded for 2013. The new module includes a five-element, Apple-designed lens with f/2.2 aperture and -- this is important -- a 15 percent larger active sensor area to help cut down on noise. Also, as rumored, Apple is adding high-speed, 120fps video recording so you can make slow-motion videos (in 720p only, it looks like). One rumor that wasn't true: the one about optical image stabilization. Yes, Apple says there's image stabilization here, but it appears to be just the digital kind. Hope we haven't disappointed you too much. 

Additionally, the camera allows for burst shooting at up to 10 frames per second -- just make sure you're holding down the shutter button. Wrapping up, other features include autofocus matrix metering, with the ability to let the camera automatically pick the sharpest shot. There's also automatic exposure adjustment in panorama mode and a new flash called True Tone. Marketing speak aside, the flash is comprised of 1,000 unique variations in flash tone to reduce clashing color temperatures. Curiously, despite going into good detail about the camera, Apple didn't mention the resolution of the camera -- normally a headline spec -- so we're wondering if it's still capped at eight megapixels. (We're going to go with yes.) If we hear anything else, we'll update this post, but for now, enjoy our liveblog, and get ready for us to revisit these camera tweaks in our eventual review.

Update: Now that Apple's posted the complete spec list for the iPhone 5s, we've been able to confirm this is indeed an 8-megapixel camera.
