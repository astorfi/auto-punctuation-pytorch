Not to be left out, Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel customers can also raise their collective BlackBerry hands since you all may be getting a CDMA rendition of the BlackBerry Pearl, also in May. RIM's been on a tear lately getting its hottest handsets out to both the GSM and CDMA camps, and this is yet another example. Apparently, there's plenty of RIM love to go around this lil' industry of ours.[Via Boy Genius Report, thanks Tarik]
