Nintendo's tenderfoot handheld finally hit the mark after 13 weeks, a snail's pace when compared to the original dual-screen wunderkind, which reportedly made the grade in a mere four. The 3DS' predecessors will undoubtedly forgive it for being a late bloomer, it's the competition it ought to worry about; the PSP sold its first million in about seven weeks. The 3DS could still plow its way to the top -- but with the PlayStation Vita looming large on the horizon, and the fledgling handheld having already lost a round the PSV's predecessor, Nintendo could be in for a rough ride.
