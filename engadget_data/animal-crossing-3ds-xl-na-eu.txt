 A new Nintendo 3DS XL portable game console is headed to North America and Europe this June (in addition to Japan), and it's got a fancy limited-edition body intended to entice Animal Crossing fans. The $219.99 console bundle includes a digital copy of Animal Crossing: New Leaf -- the upcoming 3DS iteration of the long-running sim series -- and the new white console. For those playing along at home, the game itself costs $34.99 and a new Nintendo 3DS XL costs $199.99, which makes this limited edition bundle a steal all things considered (even without dragons). It's also quite a pretty device, so that certainly doesn't hurt either.
