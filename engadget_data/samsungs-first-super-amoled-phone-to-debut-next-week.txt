If not then you'd better go back and brush up on your display tech because the first Samsung phone using the new 800 x 480 pixel "Super AMOLED" display is said to be getting a reveal next week at the big Mobile World Congress show. The panel is claimed to be five times "clearer" and offer 20% better visibility when used outside -- the biggest weakness of existing AMOLED devices like the Zune HD and Nexus One. We're also going to guess that the new device will be running Samsung's new Bada OS at the time of the reveal -- but that's not exactly a stretch.
