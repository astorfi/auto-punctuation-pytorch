The mind blowing cover (don't call it a case) pretty much stole the show during yesterday's iPad 2 press event, causing children to weep at the sight of our exploded bodies. Thing is, we've seen the design before. Oh sure, Apple improved upon it significantly, but there's no mistaking its InCase Convertible Magazine Jacket heritage. See the two slug it out on video after the break in some kind of weird reverse KIRF cage match. We guess 2011 really is the year of the copycats.
