We don't have any solid deets on specs for Canary, the RAZR's heir apparent, but the rampant speculation mill currently has her getting a 2 megapixel shooter, 17 measly megabytes of internal storage, a MicroSD slot, and the all-important Bluetooth 2.0. We're seeing conflicting reports on whether we'll get UMTS, but we gotta be honest, quad-band EDGE alone just isn't going to cut it for a high-end phone by the time Canary likely drops in 2007. More shots of Canary doing its thing after the break.[Thanks, dk]
