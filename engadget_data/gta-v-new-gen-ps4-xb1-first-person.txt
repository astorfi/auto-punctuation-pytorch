The re-release of Grand Theft Auto V on PS4 and Xbox One (PC version delayed until 2015) is just days away now. As a result, Rockstar is cranking up the PR campaign by showing and telling why it should get your hard-earned money (again). Yesterday it delivered confirmation of the leaked first-person mode that brings even deeper immersion to your criminal hijinks -- according to a comment on CVG's podcast, you can even watch the cutscenes in first person -- along with a video preview of what it's like (viewable on YouTube here and in higher quality, higher bitrate video at Gamersyde.) Today it has another highlight reel to present, showing the difference between the PS3 and PS4 version across scenes.



 The high-res 1080p / 30fps experience is just the start -- you can quickly see more detail in the buildings, environments and cars as a dashboard smear suddenly has working dials, a green blur on the ground becomes fully 3D-rendered foliage and more. The team has also talked specifically on its work for the PS4 version, as IGN says the jump to first person is controlled by the DualShock 4's touchpad, while police lights cause the lightbar to flash red and blue and radio chatter to come out of the controller's speaker. Peep the reflections on the helicopter and the realistic looking puddles for more evidence of the team's attention to detail, although there's some aliasing and pop-in evident in the videos too. Give them a watch and let us know if you're convinced it's time to make a return trip to Los Santos.
