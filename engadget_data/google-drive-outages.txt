If there's ever a great time for Google Drive to start having issues, it's first thing on a Monday morning. We've received a not-inconsiderable fleet of tips from readers saying their access to the cloud storage service has been flaky, and similar complaints can currently be found all over Twitter. Google's service website confirms that there's "an issue," but the company hasn't yet shared any specifics. We've reached out to Mountain View for more details, and we'll let you know if we learn more.
