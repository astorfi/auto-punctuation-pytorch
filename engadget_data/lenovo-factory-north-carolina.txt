The Wall Street Journal reports that the company is readying a PC production facility near its US headquarters which will kick off operations next year. Aside from securing bragging rights over competitors which no longer manufacture in the US, the factory is intended to satisfy stateside customers who "demand for flexible supplies and product customization." While it's initially a small operation -- employing slightly over 100 people -- the aim is to expand in the future, meaning that elusive "Made in America" sticker may become a little more commonplace.
