When Facebook became a public company in the summer of 2012, its initial public offering (IPO) didn't go quite as well as the company expected. It went poorly enough that the US Securities and Exchange Commission took action against the exchange which handled Facebook's IPO: Nasdaq. A civil suit filed against the exchange, alleging computer software errors that resulted in a lackluster IPO, was settled today -- the exchange will pay $10 million to settle the suit. The settlement, of course, doesn't mean that Nasdaq is confirming or denying the alleged issues its computer system incurred last year; said issues allegedly cost investors in the ballpark of $500 million. Probably best to un-friend Nasdaq now before things get awkward.
