If you're looking to send in an inquiry of your own, drop us a line at ask [at] engadget [dawt] com.

"I am looking to replace my 17-inch MacBook Pro. I am looking for a 17-inch ultraportable laptop, or as close as I can get to one. Key features: light, thin, good battery life, high resolution screen, no lap burn, no noisy fan and doesn't break the bank. Thanks!"
Seems as if Mac / PC isn't an issue, so we're assuming they're all on the table. Considering that he's leaving a 17-inch MBP, what else out there can compare given the needs? Any suggestions from 17-inch laptop owners out there? Go on, answer away in comments below -- you've got the time (and screen real estate) to spare.
