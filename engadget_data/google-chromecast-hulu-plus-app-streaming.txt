Launching in July with Netflix and YouTube mirroring, Google's $35 Chromecast streaming dongle now has another video streaming service adding support for the platform to its apps: Hulu. From today, Hulu will provide Chromecast streaming inside its Hulu Plus app, mirroring shows like New Girl and Modern Family on the big screen. Unlike Netflix, which allows subscribers to stream video from Chrome and its official apps, Hulu originally supported Chromecast via its tab casting feature. Today's extenstion will see a Cast button added to Hulu's iPad and Android apps (with iPhone support "coming very soon"). While we're still waiting for Google to open Chromecast to allow local media playback, the addition of Hulu Plus may tide us over until it does.
