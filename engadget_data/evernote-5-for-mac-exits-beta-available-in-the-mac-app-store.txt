 Back at the beginning of the month, when Evernote 5 for Mac launched in beta, the app's creators warned users that they could suffer data corruption, data loss and other such indignities if they tried out the unfinished software. If you chose to wait, you probably made the right call: just two weeks later, a final, more stable version of the note-taking app is live in the Mac App Store. All told, version 5 has 100-plus new features, with some of the bigger ones including: a left pane showing tags, shortcuts and recent notes; a redesigned note list; and a predictive search feature called Type Ahead. It's free, so you don't have much to lose by checking it out (unless, of course, you find subtle UI tweaks enraging). Or, if you're really that cautious, we've embedded a short "What's new?" video after the break.
