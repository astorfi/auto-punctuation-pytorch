As you can see, it's nearly identical to the original Torch in terms of appearance, but BGR says the device's 1.2GHz processor could "light a fire" when paired with BlackBerry OS 6.1, and that its 640 x 480 display "looks absolutely great." As with the Bold Touch it got its hands on yesterday, BGR says the Torch 2 will be making its official debut at BlackBerry World next month, with a launch on AT&T to follow in July. Hit up the source link below for a few more hands-on shots.

Update: N4BB has just posted a full spec sheet, which reveals a codename "Jennings" while JerukNipis has some more, clearer shots of the slider -- including a nice closeup of the textured battery cover.
