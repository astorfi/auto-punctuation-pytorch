Turns out Motorola has just announced that they will be releasing the Q "next week," a week which turns out to include May 22nd among its numbered days. The EV-DO phone will be out first for Verizon and Sprint, but there should be a Cingular UMTS version out by the end of the year -- a bit earlier than they previously stated -- and possibly even a HSDPA version if we're really lucky. They're billing the Q as a "BlackBerry killer," which is fine, but we're just glad they finally realised that releasing a product is an important part of the BlackBerry killing process.[Via Phone Scoop]
