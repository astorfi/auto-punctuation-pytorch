 We're going to assume you're well versed with the RIAA, just about the most god-forsaken industry group that ever did roam the earth (much like its unofficial partner in crime, the MPAA); and more importantly for the purposes of this post, Warner Music, one of the four major labels, which all, incidentally, back the RIAA. So what did Edgar Bronfman, CEO of Warner Music, have to say when questioned as to whether any of his seven kids pirate music? "I'm fairly certain that they have, and I'm fairly certain that they've suffered the consequences." Funny, we haven't heard about any inter-familial lawsuits involving Bronfman sr. v. Bronfman jr. concerning definitions in fair use and music piracy. In fact, given that he knows what pirates live in his house using his internet connection, it should only follow that he sue his children into eternal debt (not before having Warner Music shut off their household internet connection at the ISP level). After all, what's good for the goose is good -- ah forget it. Every time we try to apply logic and reason to the executives behind the RIAA our brains do a zero divide.You, Bronfman! Monday at four o'clock, after school. Be there, punk.[Thanks, Josh]
