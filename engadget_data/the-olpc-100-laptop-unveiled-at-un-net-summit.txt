We've finally got some pictures of the new concept design for the
$100 laptop that was unveiled at
the UN net summit in Tunis. As mentioned before, they had
to make some changes to increase the durability of the machine, for which they have finally produced a partially
functioning prototype. Encased in rubber and sporting a 500MHz processor, mesh networking capabilities, and four USB
ports, the incredible hype behind the OLPC (One Laptop Per Child) project only seems to be building â€” who are we to
stand in its way? More pictures after the break.
