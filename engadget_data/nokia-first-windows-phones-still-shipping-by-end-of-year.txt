But Nokia at least took to the Twittersphere to reassure the masses that the company is still aiming to release a Windows Phone by the end of the year, though we likely won't be seeing it ship in large volumes until early next year. Curiously enough, Nokia Australia's Twitter account was included within the short message, which makes us wonder if they're tossing a little clue our way. We're hoping to have another entry on our Black Friday shopping list -- not that it's short as it is, of course.
