The Engadget guesstimate: maybe it's that Xbox 360 first person shooter controller we'd heard rumors about? Then again, maybe it's not, but of all these friggin' viral campaigns, we're heartily recommending you really don't get your panties in a twist over this one.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
