First up is the V350 smartphone shown above, a dual-SIM creature with a 3.5-inch HVGA capacitive touchpanel, Android 2.2, five megapixel camera, a microSD card slot, WiFi, Bluetooth 2.1 and A-GPS to boot. By supporting a pair of SIMs, it allows jetsetters to carry two SIMs from two operators in order to take advantage of different plans and networks for voice / data in different countries. 

Moving on, there's a highly intriguing new tablet in the waiting -- the ViewPad 10Pro. This 10-incher (shown after the break) is a "professional" slate with dual-boot functionality, enabling users to tap into Android 2.2 or Windows 7 Professional at their leisure. It's also one of the first tablets to utilize Intel's long-awaited Oak Trail platform, and it'll ship with a 1024 x 600 LED-backlit capacitive multitouch screen, inbuilt 3G, WiFi, Bluetooth and a battery good for six or so hours of life. Finally, the ViewPad 10s -- which was just unveiled at CES -- is seeing a gentle update in Barcelona, with the ViewPad 10s 3G (predictably) gaining integrated 3G functionality. Mum's the word on pricing and release, but as always, we'll be prying for more once we touch down at BCN.
      

 

Show full PR textViewSonic Europe targets prosumer market with Dual-SIM Android Smartphone and Windows/Android dual-boot Tablet deviceDevices to be previewed for the first time in Europe at Mobile World Congress on stand 2B77 Hall 2.Mobile World Congress, Barcelona, 11 February 2011 – ViewSonic Europe, a global provider of computing, consumer electronics and communications solutions, today announced the launch of its new Dual-SIM Android Smartphone, the V350 and its new 10 inch professional tablet PC, the ViewPad 10Pro. Both products have been designed to enable users to easily access both their work and personal life via just one device and will be previewed for the first time in Europe at Mobile World Congress (2B77 Hall 2) on 14 February 2011.The V350 Smartphone with 3.5 inch display is an active Dual-SIM device running the Android 2.2 Froyo operating system, enabling the use of two network services at the same time. Its Dual-SIM capability is ideal for businesses wishing to provide staff with a mobile device that can offer separate numbers and bills for both personal and business use. This feature also enables travellers to carry just the one phone whilst still be able to take advantage of different pricing plans and network offers for voice and data in various countries. The V350 however does not compromise in other areas, with Android 2.2, a HVGA capacitive touch screen, 5-megapixel auto-focus camera, Micro-SD expansion, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth® 2.1 and assisted GPS navigation.The ViewPad 10Pro is a 10" professional tablet PC with dual boot functionality, offering a quick switch capability between Windows® 7 Professional for business use and Google Android 2.2 for personal and social entertainment. Dual-boot enables users to access business software that only runs on Windows and investigate Android without switching completely. Many users enjoy the familiarity of Windows but want to get to know Android and configure their preferences before using it more widely. The ViewPad 10Pro is one of the first tablets to have the Intel Oak Trail processor combined with support for flash 10.1 and the new interface provides an excellent navigation experience. It has a 1024x600 LED backlit capacitive multi-touch panel, is fully connected with 3G, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and has at least six hours of battery life. "Last month Deloitte predicted, in its annual sector forecast, that UK companies will buy more than 10 million tablet devices in 2011. ViewSonic is well placed to capitalize on this market and offers users the best of both worlds from one device" said Derek Wright, Product Marketing Manager at ViewSonic Europe."Our V350 Smartphone is one of the most functional Dual-SIM phones on the market. With Android GMS for access to more than 200,000 Google applications, it has powerful multimedia capabilities and with both SIM cards active, you can place and receive calls on each at any time. The Dual-SIM proposition is compelling and will generate considerable market uptake this year." Wright concluded.For the first time in Europe, ViewSonic will also show its ViewPad 10s 3G. Launched at CES in January, the ViewPad 10s now benefits from 3G functionality that enhances current features that include GPS, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g and Bluetooth 2.1+EDR.About ViewSonicViewSonic® Corporation is a leading global provider of visual display and computing products.
