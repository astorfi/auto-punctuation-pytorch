And the raw specs of the laptopcertainly sound impressive: 17-inch widescreen display, GeForce Go 7800 GTX for graphics, Pentium M at up to 2.26 GHzand up to 2GB RAM. But how does it fare in the real world? BIOS took one for a spin, and found it to be "about aspowerful as mobile gaming currently gets." The review cited the 17-inch display, great sound, and solid gamingperformance as major pluses. Downsides? The lack of a DVD burner or an internal TV tuner (after all, the box comes withWindows XP Media Center Edition) and "mediocre build quality." However, these complaints weren't enough tostop the reviewer from declaring it a "powerhouse of a laptop that will appeal to high-end multimedia users."
