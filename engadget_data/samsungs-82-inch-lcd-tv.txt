Samsung is showing off the world's largest LCD TV, an 82-inch behemoth that currently ranks as the world's largest
(and totally blows away the previous title holder, a 65-inch
LCD TV from Sharp), at least until LG or whoever decides to spend a few hundred million in R&D to top them with
an 85-inch or 100-inch LCD TV. Won't go into production for another 18 months, which is probably for the best
sinceÂ you're going to probably need at least a year and half of scrimping and saving to even have a shot at
affording this bad boy.
