Twitter must have taken a few lessons from Facebook on how to launch its IPO this morning. TWTR's value on the New York Stock Exchange has nearly doubled as of this writing, jumping from the initial $26 price to $46 -- two bucks shy of its social networking rival. The day is still young, so early investors won't want to plan their retirement funds just yet. However, the rush is good news for a company that's constantly searching for new sources of revenue, especially when there may be patent royalty payments in its future.
