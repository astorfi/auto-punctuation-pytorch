 If you're expecting to see future BlackBerry devices with larger (or smaller) screen sizes, Thorsten Heins has got a bucket of ice water ready to throw over your dreams. At the BlackBerry 10 launch event, he confirmed that the next set of smartphones would stick to the same screen sizes and resolutions that we've seen in the Z10 and Q10. The company wants to avoid fragmenting its ecosystem and, as such, will stick to having two hardware strands -- one with a 4.2-inch, 1,280 x 768 display and the other with a 3.1-inch, 720 x 720 screen. When questioned about when we'd see follow-ups to both BlackBerry 10 handsets, Heins said that the company was looking at product cycles of between 12 and 15 months, but wouldn't be drawn on specifics.
