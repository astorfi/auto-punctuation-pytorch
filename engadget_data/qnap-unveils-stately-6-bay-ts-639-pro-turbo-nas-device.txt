The TS-639 Pro Turbo checks in with six bays, a 1.6GHz Intel CPU, 1GB of DDR2 RAM, gigabit Ethernet and support for RAID 0/1/5/6/5+spare configurations along with built-in iSCSI target service with Thin Provisioning. There's no mention of a price, but that's likely because you just aren't ready to handle the truth.
