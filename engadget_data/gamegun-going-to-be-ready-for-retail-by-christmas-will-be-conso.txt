 
Remember that RedneckTechie and his insanely great GameGun idea? Well, he's back with another "slick" demo video, along with some news for us: he's putting together a retail version that will be ready by Christmas. The gun will also be compatible with Xbox 360, PS3, Wii and Windows and a plug-and-play device. We're incredibly short on details, and the pre-order page isn't live just yet, but if Mr. Redneck can pull this off, we're gonna fall all over ourselves to nab one no matter what the price is. New vid is after the break.
