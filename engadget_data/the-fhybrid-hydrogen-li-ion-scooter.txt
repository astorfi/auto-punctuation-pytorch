Oh sure, they could have just made it easy and gone with the reliable old NiMH batts, but where's the fun in that? Crijn Bouman, who designed the Fhybrid at the Delft University of Technology, claims it'll hit up to 40mph and has a range of 124 miles. In other words, plenty far enough to get a mouth full of bugs.[Thanks, Fernando]
