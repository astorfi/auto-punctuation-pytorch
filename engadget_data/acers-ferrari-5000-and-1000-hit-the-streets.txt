 It hasn't been long since we saw AMD pop up with their own dual core mobile processor, the AMD Turion 64 X2, and the first round of products are already beginning to appear. Ladies and gentlemen, say hello to Acer's Ferrari 5000 and 1000, the former a 15.4-inch carbon fiber desktop replacement, outfitted with a 1.3 megapixel camera, 802.11a/b/g, Bluetooth 2.0, gigabit Ethernet, and a dual-layer slot loading DVDÂ±RW drive -- or, eventually an HD DVD drive (what, no Blu-ray?); the latter is a 12.1-inch widescreen machine that weighs in at 3.7 pounds. We're not clear yet on price, availability, or what it'll look like up in the face, but we are definitely interested to see how this machine will stack up against the slew of Core Duos already on the market.
