Well, we now have an idea of when you might actually have a chance of getting a car. The most recent estimates we heard indicated deliveries starting in late 2010, but that obviously didn't happen. Now Fisker is indicating that full production is set to begin in March, about two months from now, with people getting their rides "soon after." Initial examples of the car are to be produced in Europe, Finland to be exact, and they'll need the services of a fairly substantial boat to get across the Atlantic before they become available here. But, still, a potential release date just a few months away is a reasonably encouraging thing -- and you can't deny the car is still quite a looker.
