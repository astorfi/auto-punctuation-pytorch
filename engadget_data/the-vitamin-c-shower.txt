Wow, we totally had no idea that by releasing the "correct" amount of ascorbic acid (aka
vitamin C) into your tap water, you could
effectively neutralize chlorine or chloramine, transform alkali water to weak acid-water, and, uh, "anion radiation".
According to Sejong Sonaki Corp., who make the Vitamin-C Shower, what we've got here is an effective treatment for
"skin disease," "shining your hair", "asthma sufferers," and "atopy skin and allergy sufferers". How about instead of
getting busy with Vitamin-C Shower, we just take a nice long relaxing soak in a tub full of Tropicana? Some
pulp, s.v.p.
