It's actually looking like a pretty hot piece of kit in addition to the geotagging features, with a 12 megapixel sensor with ISO 4800 sensitivity behind a stabilized 5x zoom lens, 3.5-inch touchscreen with gesture support, face detection that prioritizes the most-common faces, and WiFi support all cooked in. The rumor says we're looking at an August 13 launch, so we should know more soon -- hopefully the Â£349 ($580) price tag is a bit more reasonable when it officially comes Stateside.
