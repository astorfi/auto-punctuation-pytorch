Crave UK has gotten wind of an upcoming revision from iriver already in the works that will get rid of that built-in speaker and redo the casing in aluminum -- which would certainly be a nice switch from that weightless plastic of the E100. The lackluster screen is also getting swapped out for a "much brighter" version. No word of slimming the device down, but hopefully that's in the works as well. Word is we can expect the E150 and E200 sometime later in the summer, but obviously none of this is official just yet.[Thanks, T.I.]
