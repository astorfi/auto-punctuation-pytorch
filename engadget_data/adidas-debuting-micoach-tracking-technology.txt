   While it's been a few months since Adidas launched those intelligent F50 miCoach cleats, it finally looks as if the German outfit's ready to test the tech on the football pitch. Adidas announced earlier today that its adizeros will be a part of the "world's first smart soccer match," during the MLS All-Star Game on July 25th in Philadelphia. With the help of the miCoach's tracking system, coaches are able to measure a player's speed and acceleration, how much ground was covered, the intensity of play, as well as spotting weaknesses and strengths. Naturally, the end results can then be analyzed on a computer or directly from an application on one of Apple's slates. Adidas says this is only the beginning, as it plans to bring the technology -- detailed in video form just after the break -- to other leagues around the world in the near future.
