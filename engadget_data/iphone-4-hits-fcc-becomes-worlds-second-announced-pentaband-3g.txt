So what do we find out from the disclosure? The Commission identifies the fourth-gen iPhone as model number A1332, and also confirms that it carries a Bluetooth module, that precious 802.11n capability that's still missing from most phones, and -- here's the good bit -- five bands of 3G internet compatibility: UMTS I/II/V/VI/VIII (evidence after the break). Which is all sorts of interesting, since Apple omits one of them -- the 800MHz band VI, most commonly used in Japan -- on the iPhone 4's specs page. Feel free to speculate away on what that might mean. Sadly, the reports grow rather dry from there, with nary a word on how banging the new IPS screen is or how well the FaceTime video chat works -- guess we'll just have to figure those things out for ourselves. Oh, and the first announced pentaband beastie; why it's the Nokia N8.
