 Yesterday was AT&T's turn, and today it's Verizon revealing its earnings for the first quarter of 2011. The company has reported $27 billion in consolidated revenue from its wireless and wireline businesses, which is up 5.3 percent year over year (on a non-GAAP basis), while profits rose to $1.4 billion. Fueling that growth was 1.8 million net additions to its wireless customer base, which now totals 88.4 million customers (and 104 million connections). It also saw 207,000 net additions to its FiOS internet business and 192,000 net additions to FiOS TV, which bring those total customer bases to 4.3 million and 3.7 million, respectively. As for that little iPhone 4 launch, Verizon says it's resulted in 2.2 million activations -- that's quite a bit less that AT&T's 3.6 million iPhone activations for the same quarter, as you've no doubt noticed, although it does also have the benefit of a much cheaper iPhone 3GS in addition to the iPhone 4. Verizon also said that demand was "strong" for its new LTE devices (including 260,000 HTC Thunderbolt activations), and that deployment of its LTE network remains on track, with it expected to be available in more than 175 markets by the end of the year -- in fact, that's actually up a bit from the 147 figure we last heard. Head on past the break for the company's full earnings report.

Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, NASDAQ: VZ) today reported strong first-quarter 2011 earnings, as industry leader Verizon Wireless continued to effectively balance customer growth and profitability, while growth in FiOS and strategic enterprise services contributed to another quarter of improvement in wireline margins.Verizon reported 51 cents in EPS in first-quarter 2011, compared with first-quarter 2010 earnings of 16 cents per share. There are no adjustments to first-quarter 2011 earnings results. Adjusted first-quarter 2010 earnings, excluding the impact of divestitures and non-operational charges (non-GAAP), were 48 cents per share.On Track to Meet Revenue and Earnings Objectives"In the first quarter, Verizon Wireless solidified its industry leadership with results that once again showed sustainable, profitable growth," said Verizon Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg. "We are executing on our business plans and building momentum, and we are on track to meet both our revenue and earnings objectives for the year."Seidenberg added, "Wireline EBITDA margins expanded for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by continued strength in FiOS revenues and disciplined cost management. Our strategic acquisition of Terremark, which closed earlier this month, improves our ability to provide integrated, enterprise-class cloud solutions and accelerate growth."Consolidated Revenue Growth AcceleratesOn a consolidated basis, Verizon's total operating revenues were $27.0 billion in first-quarter 2011, an increase of 0.3 percent compared with first-quarter 2010. Last year's results included revenues from operations that have since been divested.On a comparable basis (non-GAAP), first-quarter 2011 total operating revenues increased 5.3 percent compared with first-quarter 2010 -- up from growth of 2.3 percent on the same basis comparing fourth-quarter 2010 with fourth-quarter 2009. Approximately 77 percent of first-quarter 2011 revenues were generated by higher-growth wireless, FiOS and strategic enterprise services, compared with approximately 72 percent of comparable first-quarter 2010 revenues.As previously stated, Verizon is targeting comparable top-line revenue growth rates in the range of 4 percent to 8 percent for full-year 2011. The company is also targeting EPS growth of 5 percent to 8 percent in 2011, over a comparable adjusted base of $2.08 per share in 2010.Verizon continues to expect 2011 capital spending to be essentially flat, compared with the 2010 investment of $16.5 billion. In first-quarter 2011, Verizon's capital expenditures totaled $4.4 billion, compared with $3.4 billion in first-quarter 2010, as the company aggressively invested in growth opportunities, including the deployment of Verizon's nationwide 4G LTE (fourth-generation, Long-Term Evolution) wireless broadband network. With 4G LTE deployment well under way, Verizon's capitalized interest will be lower in 2011, resulting in higher interest expense of about $150 million for each quarter this year.Cash flow from operations totaled $5.0 billion in first-quarter 2011, down from $7.1 billion in first-quarter 2010. Operating cash flow from higher net income in first-quarter 2011 was offset by the launch of the iPhone and satisfaction of Verizon's full-year 2011 pension funding obligation of $392 million. In addition, the first half of last year included cash flows from since-divested properties.Verizon said its cash flow outlook for 2011 remains strong, and there is no change regarding the anticipated 2012 timing of a Verizon Wireless dividend to its parent companies.The effective income tax rate attributable to Verizon for the first quarter was 30 percent. For full-year 2011, Verizon anticipates an effective tax rate to be in a range consistent with the past three quarters, post the Frontier and Alltel divestitures.Verizon Wireless Delivers Strong Operational and Financial ResultsVerizon Wireless delivered strong growth in revenues, retail customers and other connections; increased retail postpaid ARPU (average monthly service revenue per user) and smartphone penetration; and delivered a strong EBITDA margin.
