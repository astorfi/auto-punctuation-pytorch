 Ready for a bevy of new Panasonic TVs? 2012's lineup shifts almost entirely to LED, with 14 out of the 16 new sets using the tech. There's a metric ton of info packed into one release, but highlights for this year include larger IPS LED TVs and a 25 percent reduction in power consumption across the line. Most impressive are the 47 and 55-inch DT50 and WT50. Differentiated primarily by design -- the WT50 has a super-narrow metal frame and a crescent stand -- they're both IPS LED panels with Viera Connect and can convert 2D content into 3D. And both have four HDMI ports and three USB ports. PR detailing all awaits you after the break.

The advent of Smart VIERA HDTV centers on five main points: Networking, Easy Operation, Picture Quality, Eco and Design elements. The 2012 series focuses on larger screen sizes and LED based HDTVs, with 14 of the 16 models incorporating LED technology. Adhering to its long standing focus on providing products that consumers ask for, Panasonic added 47 inch and 55 inch screen sizes to its LED/LCD family and its 3D line up. 		The 2012 line-up continues to benefit from the addition of the IPS LED LCD Panel (In Plane Switching) technology. The IPS LED LCD Panel delivers a wide viewing angle with almost no picture degradation at off angle viewing, a super high speed 1920 Backlight Scanning for higher moving picture resolution during fast action scenes, reduction of afterglow and a smooth, crisp image. The high performance, high speed, high transmittance panel materials contribute to the wide viewing angle, high contrast performance and fast response time, which in turn dramatically reduces artifacts and 3D crosstalk. 		Panasonic is committed to producing HDTVs that are mindful of the environment. The new and improved high efficient LED LCD Panels reduce targeted power consumption up to approximately 25% over last year's models. 		VIERA Connect(1), Panasonic's proprietary internet functionality is integrated into 12 of the new models with a new robust platform that provides easy access to such sites as Amazon Instant Video™, Netflix™, Pandora , Facebook, CinemaNow, VUDU, Hulu Plus™, Skype™, Ustream, sports sites – MLB, NHL, NBA, MLS(2), Fox Sports, gaming and health and wellness sites. 		"Panasonic's priority continues to be an absolute pledge to provide the consumer with the highest quality entertainment options," said Henry Hauser, Vice President, Panasonic Marketing, the Merchandising Group. "Panasonic has always followed the philosophy of listening to the consumer and producing products that meet the consumer's needs and desires, as well as providing entertainment choices. We recognize that a consumer's decision to purchase a TV entails a myriad of factors, such as viewing environment, type of programming and price. This is precisely why Panasonic is technologically agnostic and why our 2012 line up features increased screen sizes, as well as three TVs that use polarized 3D technology."
