 
Like blurry future product shots do ya? Well, these rank with the best. Four new handsets were accidentally on purpose shown to Mobile Phone Helpdesk today in Amsterdam during a discussion with Motorola. Kicking things off is the device code-named "SKARVEN;" a ZOOM-series kick-slider which might feature an 8 megapixel camera and 2.8-inch screen. The TEXEL is another ROKR musicphone due in February or March of 2008. It features a morphing keypad like that found on the ROKR E8 which allows the keypad icons and functions to change in support of music or cellphone modes. The X PIXL is a Kodak-Motorola mashup which should bring a 5 megapixel camera to market under a Motorola Z12 product name. Rounding things out is the entry-level GENGHIS QWERTY device for non-business types. While there's not much to call home about, at least none of these future looking devices looks like another played-out RAZR.[Via Unwired View]
