Aereo's streaming television service is coming to your game console of choice as well as Google TV and Android devices starting on July 10th. The service kicks off in New York City, Boston and Atlanta on July 10th, with 20 more cities planned for expansion this year (including major locations like Baltimore, Chicago and Philadelphia). It won't arrive in the form of a standalone app, however -- the service is launching through an existing channel: PlayOn. Live TV fans who want to cut their cable cord can access Aereo with PlayOn by using their PC to get things set up; you'll also need an $8-a-month Aereo subscription to access the 60-plus live TV channels available. Oh, and a PlayOn subscription ($50 for life or $25 / year). Nothing quite says "simplicity" like a puzzle of subscription plans!


Update: Aereo emailed us to say, "Aereo has no business relationship with PlayOn." Apparently PlayOn's announcement this morning came without any heads up to the folks at Aereo, and it's unclear just how well Aereo's service will work using PlayOn. We've reached out to PlayOn for a statement as well, though we've yet to hear back.


Update 2: PlayOn got back to us with the following statement: "PlayOn does not have an official relationship with Aereo, just as we don't have official relationships with most of the channels we support. PlayOn is an award-winning software product that runs in the background on your PC and allows you to then stream content from supported sites to your set-top boxes (such as Roku), gaming consoles, and/or mobile devices. It is a solution that does not require a relationship with content providers as all PlayOn does is shift which screen you are using to watch content which is, for free or via a subscription, already made available to you through your PC Browser. To utilize PlayOn's Aereo channel users still need an Aereo subscription and to live in one of Aereo's coverage areas."
