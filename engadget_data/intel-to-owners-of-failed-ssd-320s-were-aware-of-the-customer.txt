That's exactly the situation reported by users of Intel's SSD 320 series for over a month on the company's support forums, as well as on Amazon reviews. One disappointed (to say the least) user describes that very scenario, and he's not alone. According to several forum members, the problem seems firmware related and shouldn't require a recall, while Intel says it's "aware of the customer sightings." Short on meaningful details, the statement promises an update is coming with more information -- bite-sized consolation for the owners of byte-sized drives.
