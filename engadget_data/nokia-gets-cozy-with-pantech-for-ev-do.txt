Say you're the world's largest cellphone manufacturer. Maybe you made a few bad decisions along the way; threw your weight behind the wrong technologies, caught the wrath of CDMA's keeper, and now you're missing out on the EV-DO party. That's precisely the quandary Nokia has found itself facing, and as we've already seen with the 6315i, they're turning to Korea's Pantech to bail them out. In exchange for a pair of rebranded Pantech EV-DO handsets, Nokia will dish out $129 million. That's a lot of zeroes after the 129 there, when we've yet to see a Pantech headed to these shores we'd even pay $129 for.
