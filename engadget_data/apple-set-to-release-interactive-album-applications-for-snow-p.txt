The first artist in the cue is Snow Patrol, scheduled to release their latest studio album next month. According to a Polydor production manager, the downloadable, "interactive" application (via AppStore or iTunes or the rumored iTunes version 8?) will offer additional content such as artwork, behind-the-scenes images, and lyrics for iPhone and iPod touch owners -- "A digital booklet that will take you into the videos and content," if you will. Now who says that digital music can't be profitable?[Via MacWorld UK]
