The all new, very pebble-like DVD-H1080 touts the company's Touch of Color design, weighs just over two pounds and is only marginally bigger than the DVDs it will one day play. As expected, the deck features 1080p upscaling to go along with the USB host function which adds support for DivX, MP3 and JPEG files. There's nary a word on price, but it should be landing at your favorite (and least favorite, for the record) retailer in the first half of 2009.
