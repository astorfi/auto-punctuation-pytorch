Based on the ongoing Image Comics series from writer Brian Michael Bendis (Ultimate Spider-Man) and artist Michael Avon Oeming (Judge Dredd), Powers is a police-procedural set in Chicago where two homicide detectives investigate cases involving citizens with superhuman abilities.

The series stars District 9 standout Sharlto Copley as Christian Walker, a former superhero who becomes a detective after he loses his powers, and his partner Deena Pilgrim, played by The Following's Susan Heyward. Eddie Izzard portrays the villainous character Wolfe. Watch a trailer for the series after the break.
