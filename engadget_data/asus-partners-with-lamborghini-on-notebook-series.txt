 Add another to the long andillustrious list of luxury car-themed laptops in Asus's newLamborghini Notebook Series, the result of a partnership between the computer and automotive companies. The pressrelease provides an overdose of flowery marketing lingo on quality, performance, speed, power, blah blah blah -- but isincredibly short on details pending its "official debut" tomorow. We do know the Lamborghini Notebook Serieswill be available in yellow and black, though, and we all know that in this world it's what outside that counts.
