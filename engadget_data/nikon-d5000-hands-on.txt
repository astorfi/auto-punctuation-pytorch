Our own unit just arrived courtesy of an altogether suspicious unmarked white van, but rather than questioning the driver, we figured it prudent to just give you a closer look at what exactly comes in the box. Obviously, we got ahold of the D5000 Kit, which runs $849.95 and comes bundled with an 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Nikkor lens. Initial impressions are as follows: it's lightweight, it's sexy and the articulating display is downright spectacular. Sure, it lacks some resolution compared to the D90's fixed LCD, but it sure shines bright. Expect a more thorough rundown in the not-too-distant future; till then, enjoy the gallery below!
