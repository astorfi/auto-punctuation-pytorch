The two new members of the PZ850 family are both internet enabled and can receive web streams (video, in particular) without a separate set-top-box. More specifically, users can see YouTube blown up to ungodly proportions and check out digital photos hosted up on Google's Picasa website. The pair will also boast a 30,000:1 contrast ratio (read: not dynamic), 24p native reproduction, Game Mode, an SD card slot, RS-232C port and four HDMI sockets. The pain? $3,999.95 for the TH-58PZ850, $6,999.95 for the TH-65PZ850 (i.e. the Grand Poobah).
