Well, technically, it's a third of the story if you count Classic, which we don't -- Classic is to Pocket PC what Standard is to Smartphone, and it's not the phoneless Pocket PCs that get our hearts pounding these days (our apologies, Axim). Instead, it's Professional that's the real prize here, filling Pocket PC Phone Edition's shoes. Revolutionary it ain't, but for folks who love (or own and merely tolerate) Windows Mobile devices, this sucker's fresh look makes it the new king of the hill on the Microsoft side of the fence. Enjoy the eye candy!
