 In what we might onlycharacterize as a (rare) moment for the man, looks like last week Stevie J. let his guard down long enough to fire offan email to the All Apple Employees list regarding his company's market cap (now $72.13 billion) surpassing that ofDell's ($71.97b):"Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future.Based on today's stock market close, Apple is worth more than Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be differenttomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today. Steve."Naw, we wouldn'tcharacterize this as outright gloating, and bear in mind unlike Dell, Steve didn't air this laundry publicly(at least not directly, though we're sure he must've known this email would get out in the open). Hey, we can evenimagine it must've felt pretty vindicating after Dell's '97 statement suggesting Apple shut down and "give themoney back to the shareholders," but damn people, can't we all just get along?
