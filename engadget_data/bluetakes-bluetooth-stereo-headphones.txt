Bluetake has a new pair ofÂ  Bluetooth stereo headphones which come with a Bluetooth adapter so you can use it
with virtually any MP3 player (or Walkman or portable CD player, for that matter). Since it requires a dongle, the
BT420 isn't hugely better than using regular wireless headphones, but it does give you the option of using it in
conjunction with your Bluetooth-enabled cellphone so that when you get a call the music is automatically paused so you
can answer. Anyway, until Bluetooth shows up in the iPod itself, these headphone will have to do.


 One caveat: the battery life on the headphones is listed at only six hours, so your headphones will probably die
before your player does.
