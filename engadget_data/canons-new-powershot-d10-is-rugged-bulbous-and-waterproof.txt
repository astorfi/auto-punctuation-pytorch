Obviously, since it's aimed at the "sport" set it has to be available in "camouflage," and since it's waterproof it has to be sort of bulky. As for the stats, this guy rocks a 12.1-megapixel sensor, DIGIC 4 processor, 3x zoom, image stabilization, and a 2.5-inch PureColor LCD II display that's said to be twice as bright as the company's standard LCD II. In addition, the camera is waterproof up to 10 meters, shock resistant, and the display sits behind a 2mm shield -- if you should happen to drop this off the roof of an evil genuis's high-tech lair (or into a pitcher of beer), no worries. Going for about $329, available at the end of April. Hit the read link for the pics.
