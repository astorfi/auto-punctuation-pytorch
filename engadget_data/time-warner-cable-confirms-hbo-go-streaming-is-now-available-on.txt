As seen on the new activation pages for Samsung Smart TVs and Blu-ray players, Xbox 360s and Roku boxes, TWC and Bright House Networks are now among the available options (sorry, still no word on ESPN3 for the Xbox 360). The only bad news? DirecTV and Comcast have not (yet) followed suit, so for those customers HBO Go streaming on the TV is still a hit-or-miss affair. We're not sure what is behind the change of heart or policy, but while Comcast reportedly had authentication issues to resolve before switching on the Xbox 360's HBO access, it's worth noting that Time Warner Cable could have its app coming to some or all of these platforms very soon. An official blog post indicates it may take a few hours for things to switch on every where so if you don't see this in your neck of the woods just keep checking back.

 Update: Cablevision too, as noted by a post on the Roku blog.  [Thanks, Ben]
