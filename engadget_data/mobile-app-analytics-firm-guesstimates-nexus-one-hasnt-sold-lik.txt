Sure, you could argue that seeding the phones to employees ahead of the announcement was an effort to build buzz -- but it didn't really make any attempt to capitalize on the move, and last week's subdued press conference in Mountain View (sans the holy trinity of Eric, Larry, and Sergey) wasn't the wild, crazy event it could've been had Google wanted it to be. That's why we're not particularly surprised to see that the app analytics peeps over at Flurry are estimating (based on usage of the apps that it instruments) that just 20,000 Nexus Ones were sold in the first week of retail -- a far cry from its 250,000 figure for the Droid, much less the iPhone 3GS' staggering 1.6 million. As Flurry notes, Verizon pumped (and continues to pump) millions upon millions of dollars into advertising the Droid in print, television, and the web; that alone boosted broad consumer interest, something Google earned to a far lesser extent through media coverage alone. Furthermore, the Droid instantly relieved much of the "if only the iPhone were on Verizon" pressure that had been building over the prior year, whereas the Nexus One brought nothing fundamentally new to the table for T-Mobile -- and many folks on other networks either won't or simply can't switch to the number four carrier for business or coverage reasons. The bottom line is that we suspect Google isn't sweating the Nexus One's sales figures one bit, no matter how high or low they may be; whether that's a smart strategy for Android as a platform in the long term, though, remains to be seen.
