Normally we try to keep our coverage of gimmicky Star Wars gear to a minimum, but the Voice-Activated R2-D2 by
Hammacher Schlemmer seems like it could actually provide a modicum of fun. Standing 15-inches tall, miniature R2 is
fully mobile and able to either track or avoid obstacles thanks to his infrared sensor. Of course no R2 replica would
be complete without the swiveling dome, blinking lights, and indecipherable beeps and boops, and the HS model delivers
on all counts. Along with guiding R2 around and watching him dance to the classic cantina music, you can even coax him
out of an occasional bad mood by commanding "R2, behave yourself!" Even though we've yet to see this little droid in
action, the fact that he requires a boombox-like eight batteries to function (more power=more fun, right?) makes us
sure that he's worth the $120 pricetag.
