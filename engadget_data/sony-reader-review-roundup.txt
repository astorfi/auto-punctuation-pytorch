Sure, the Sony Reader packs a quite exciting new display technology, allowing for long usage times and easy-on-the-eyes viewing, but so do paper books. The main actual benefit the Sony Reader offers you over traditional pulp is that you can store books aplenty in a quite small amount of flash memory, and you can buy the titles online at your leisure. Otherwise, the Sony Reader seems to take quite a few steps back, offering awkward controls, a hard to use online store and a few other baffling functional limitations. Online prices aren't great (luckily, Sony will be including a $50 gift certificate if you buy a Reader before the end of the year), despite the virtually complete elimination of production and distribution costs, and while the Sony Connect app works well enough with pushing around RSS, TXT, RTF, DOC and PDF files, traditional 8.5 x 11 PDF files are pretty much unreadable on the Sony Reader's low-res 6-inch screen. Other funkiness includes the 10 percent skipping buttons -- there's no way to go directly to a page number or search a book text -- and an annoying 1 second refresh between each page turn. It looks like the final word on the Reader is that you should probably hold onto those dead tree editions of your favorite novels at least until some 2nd generation eBooks start popping up.Read - APRead - Walt MossbergRead - David Pogue
