The folks from GMotors recently managed to catch the pint-sized car doing a bit of drifting at the same cold weather test location in Sweden that the i8 was spotted at, and it certainly looks like the 150 horsepower vehicle could be a fun little car to drive. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like you'll be able to take one for a spin yourself anytime soon, as it's not expected to go on sale until 2013 (at a cost of around $40,000). Head on past the break for the video.
