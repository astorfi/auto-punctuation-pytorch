The $199 pricepoint for the 8GB, Exchange support, A-GPS and 3G data all make an extremely compelling case, but Apple still has plenty to improve on -- there's still no physical keyboard, if you hadn't noticed (a dealbreaker for some), and Apple has yet to confirm things as common-sensical as copy and paste, video recording and MMS. There's also another little problem for a few folks out there: the resale price on your iPhone is now approximately nil, so good luck offloading that sucker. But enough about what we think, what's on your mind?Poll after the break.
