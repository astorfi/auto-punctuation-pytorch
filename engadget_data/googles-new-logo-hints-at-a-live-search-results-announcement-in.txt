Now Google's logo has undergone a radical transformation on its US landing page, hinting at what we might hear announced. Open Google.com and you're greeted with a dull, monochrome (did somebody say Chrome?) logo. Start typing in the search field, however, and the logo begins to fill with color. A hint, perhaps, that Google will be announcing live search results that automatically update as you type -- something it's been testing in the wild for a few weeks. The event, which we'll be covering live, kicks off at 09:30 Pacific time. Until then, you can click through the break for a sneak peak at both the live-updating logo and live-updating search results.
