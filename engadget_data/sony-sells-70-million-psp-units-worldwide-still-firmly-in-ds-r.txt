 Sony's PlayStation Vita is obviously the company's handheld of tomorrow, but it's the PlayStation Portable that's being credited with the assist. The PSP has been a flagship device for Sony since December 12, 2004, and during its time on the market, a grand total of 70 million have been moved globally. That's the number belted out here at E3, which sounds downright ginormous at first listen. Unfortunately, that's nowhere near the 100 million DS units that Nintendo had shipped... back in 2009. It's worth mentioning that this tally includes the original PSP-1000, the slimmer / lighter PSP-2000, the not-too-different PSP-3000 and the critically panned PSP go, and we're guessing the Vita will eventually be lumped in here as well at some point. So, Mario's still laughing, but hey -- at least Sony's sold 298 million UMD units, right?
