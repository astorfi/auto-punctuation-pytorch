At the recent "NTT Group Communications EXPO," the companydemonstrated a technology called "Virtual Humanoid," where a human-shaped figure appears to be nothing butgreen to the naked eye, but a (creepy) woman's features appear to be on the figure when the viewer is equipped with aspecial Head-Mounted Display unit, . The possibilities are endless -- NTT looks to bring robotics into the formula sothe figure can move and interact even further. Right, move and interact. NTT's final goal for the project is to enablepeople to have a game of baseball with Ichiro, so it looks like they'll be at this one for a while.
