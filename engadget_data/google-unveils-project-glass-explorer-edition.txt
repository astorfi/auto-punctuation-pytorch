How much it's changed from the prototypes isn't yet known, but Google has said that it's been steadily working on refining the hardware along with the software. Sadly, the first crack at the wearable technology isn't coming to the broader masses just yet. Orders are only available to Google I/O attendees, and they cost a pretty hefty $1,500 for their release sometime next year.
