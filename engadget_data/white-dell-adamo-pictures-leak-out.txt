Still no more details than before, but bub.blicio.us was also allowed to boot the aluminum ultraportable, so at least we know that there's chips in that box. We're actually headed back to check out the Mini 10, so we'll dig for even more (and try to get pictures in a better-lit room), but for now check these latest Adamo pictures in the gallery.
