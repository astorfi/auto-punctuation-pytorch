 Despite a strong showing of slates in 2012, ASUS showed precious few tablets at CES last week. Missing from the show? Its latest MeMo Pad -- a 7-inch 1024 x 600 tablet rocking Jelly Bean, 16GB of storage, a Mali 400 GPU, 1GB of RAM and a 1MP front-facing camera. ASUS didn't name the tablet by model number, but it's a dead ringer for the ME172V that slipped through GLBenchmarks last month, and fits the bill of a recent federal authorization. The new slab isn't quite as nice as the Nexus 7 its predecessor became, but at $150, it's a little easier on the wallet. ASUS also cautions buyers that the MeMo pad is a "tablet-only product," clarifying that it won't be getting a Transformer Pad-like keyboard dock -- assuming you could type on a 7-inch keyboard, that is. Check out the slate's official press release after the break.
