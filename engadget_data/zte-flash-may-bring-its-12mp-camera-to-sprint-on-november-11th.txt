 Over the summer, word surfaced at TalkAndroid of Sprint carrying the ZTE Flash, a surprisingly potent mid-tier smartphone that would bring a 12-megapixel camera into a category all too used to mediocre photography. Its then-rumored October launch has come and gone, but we may just have firmed-up details thanks to an anonymous tipster. According to some purported internal documentation at the carrier, the smartphone could show up on November 11th simply billed as the Sprint Flash -- we imagine the network doesn't want to broadcast a controversial name -- and carry a reasonable $130 contract price after a rebate. For the money, it might be hard to top. While we're not expecting wonders with that 8GB of storage, so-so 1,730mAh battery and slightly creaky Android 4.0, the 4.5-inch screen, dual-core 1.5GHz chip (likely a Snapdragon S4) and LTE could provide some savings to those who don't need a device quite as large as the Galaxy S III.

 Don't worry if you're not budgeting for ZTE's latest, either. If the full price list available past the break is accurate, November 11th could be a busier day than expected -- the Flash and LG Optimus G could be joined by an LG Mach costing $100 after a rebate. This and a new titanium-colored Galaxy S II for the budget crowd could have Sprint's roster completely freshened just in time for the busiest sales of the year.
