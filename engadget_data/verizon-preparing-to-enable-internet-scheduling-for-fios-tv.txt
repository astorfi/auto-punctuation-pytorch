Currently, the newly launched portal "allows customers to use any desktop or laptop computer to review their local TV schedules and information about video-on-demand (VOD) and pay-per-view offerings." All that's well, fine and good, but the real meat is in the future. "Soon," customers will be able to program their DVR from the web, ensuring that you'll never miss a recording should you remember ahead of time and be anywhere near an internet connection. C'mon Verizon, stop teasing!
