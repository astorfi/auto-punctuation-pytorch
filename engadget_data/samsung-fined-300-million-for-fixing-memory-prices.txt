Some majorly bad news for Samsung: the company, along with its US subsidiary Samsung Semiconductor, has agreed to
pay a massive $300 million fine after being charged with price fixing by the Justice Department. Turns out that over
the course of several years the company, along with several other memory chip suppliers, had conspired to fix the
prices and gouge PC manufacturers like Dell, HP, Apple, IBM, and Gateway.


 P.S. - Note that this is actually a totally different case than
the one they're potentially facing in South Korea over
the memory modules they supplied Apple for use in the iPod nano, but proof of bad behavior like this probably isn't
going to dissuade the Korean FTC from launching their investigation.

UPDATE: The AP has updated their story (for the fourth time, apparently) to clarify that this
covers just DRAM, not other kinds of memory.
