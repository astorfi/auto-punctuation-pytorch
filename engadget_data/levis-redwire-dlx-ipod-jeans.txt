 Ok, yeah, we get it already, we getit. The iPod's popular, bajillions and gamillions sold, etc., andÂ  the final frontier for iPod accessories isclothing. Who's the latest to jump on that particular bandwagon? None other than Levi's, of course, whose forthcomingRedWire DLX jeans will have a built-in docking cradle (front or back pocket, we wonder?), and retractable headphones --all of which we assume will be detachable if they have any intentions of letting you wash them. Then again, jeans dolook best when never, ever washed, so who the hell knows.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
