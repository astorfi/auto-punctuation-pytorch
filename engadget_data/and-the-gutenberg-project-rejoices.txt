We've all seen hand scanners before, but none this thin and unobtrusive, and
none that you swipe down a page like a photocopier.  The DocuPen scans at either 100 or 200 dpi, and can store up
to 100 pages internally, which is very decent.  Of course, for $199 US this is really going to sell with the
ever-dwindling type who actually tries obtaining information without Google—the philosophy major—but somehow we think
it will be a success otherwise, too.
