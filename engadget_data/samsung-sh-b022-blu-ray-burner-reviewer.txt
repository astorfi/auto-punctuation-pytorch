The burner, whichdoesn't have AACS copy-protection, was able to burn a 25GB disc in about 43 minutes, and had no trouble playing a rangeof CDs and DVDs. The reviewers also found that the drive didn't generate as much heat as some other models they'vetested; it reached a manageable 107 degrees after a burn. The final model is due out in April for about $500, and willinclude copy protection, along with the ability to write double-layer 50GB discs.[Via I4U]
