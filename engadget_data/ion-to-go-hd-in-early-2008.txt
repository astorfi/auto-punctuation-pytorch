 The ION Television Network has announced that they're upgrading all 60 of their digital stations throughout the US to HD in the first quarter of 2008. But unfortunately, there's no way to tell how much of the programming will actually be presented in HD, as the release treats upconverted content and real HD, interchangeably by saying "The network will feature native and up-converted HD programming." Sounds like someone needs to tell them that there's nothing HD about upconverted programming.
