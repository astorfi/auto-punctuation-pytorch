That's what Man & Machine, maker of the other Mighty Mouse, believes is happening, and they're suing Apple and CBS over use of the product name, since their hospital and lab-friendly mouse came out a year before Cupertino's model. Turns out that CBS -- who have owned the cartoon of the same name since 1955 -- sold the name rights to Apple, but Man & Machine are contending that the name in the context of computer peripherals belongs to them. Man & Machine want money damages and a court order blocking Apple's use of the name. They should have just called it Danger Mouse. Oh, wait.[Via The Inquirer]
