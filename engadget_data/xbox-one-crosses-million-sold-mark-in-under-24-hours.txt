Microsoft's Xbox One launch has seen some bumps in the road but the company has announced it's already sold more than a million consoles worldwide. Last week, Sony announced the PS4 sold more than one million units in the US and Canada in less than a day, but at this point, Microsoft has not made any such regional distinctions. Still, the "biggest launch in Xbox history" is well under way and already outpacing its predecessor's initial numbers -- day one download and all -- so let us know if you're one of the 1 million strong with a Day One Achievement on your record, or if you're looking elsewhere for gaming this holiday season.
