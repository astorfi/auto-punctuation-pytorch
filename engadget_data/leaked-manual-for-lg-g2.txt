The LG G2. We already know plenty about its rear-mounted volume controls, funny cases and passion for classical music. We've even seen a video of the 5.2-inch 1080p handset in the flesh. But a question mark has remained over a couple of basic specs until today, when pages from a supposedly leaked manual appeared at reputed surprise-spoiler Nowhereelse.fr. Assuming the info is legit, which it seems to be, we can say that the thing between the volume buttons on the back of the phone is not a fingerprint reader, as some had hoped -- it's just a power/lock button. Also, the phone will follow in the footsteps of the iPhone 5 and Moto X by housing a nano-SIM slot. But unlike those two handsets, the G2 will offer microSD storage expansion, not to mention a removable 2,610mAh battery. At this point, there's really nothing left to discover except some availability info -- oh no, wait, we have some of that too.
