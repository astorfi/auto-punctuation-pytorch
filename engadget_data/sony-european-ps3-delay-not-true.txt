 Well, apparently Sony caught wind of the reports of possible PS3 delays in Europe and has vehemently denied them. According to an unnamed Sony spokesperson quoted in GamesIndustry.biz: "Any reports of a further delay to the launch of the PS3 in Europe are categorically not true. We are still fully committed to a March 2007 launch date. Ken Kutaragi has not done any media briefings since the Tokyo Game Show, and the story is not true." So there you have it Europeans, you can rest easy now -- you've still got only five months to come up with those 500 euros ($627).
