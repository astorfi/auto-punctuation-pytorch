 Still waiting to see a Kindle in the wild before you pull the trigger? Hate shopping online? Need to pick up some toilet paper and a huge barrel of pretzels? You're in luck, because Amazon's finally going to be spreading Kindles out in retail nationwide through Target stores. After a trial run in April that got the e-reader into Target's flagship store and 102 brightly lit retail paradises in south Florida, the $259 e-ink device will be available all over as of June 6th. The press release points out that the Kindle is still Amazon's bestselling product, and we can't see a retail push like this hurting its prospects -- though with rumors flying about an imminent Kindle update, it might not be the absolute best time to buy. PR is after the break.
