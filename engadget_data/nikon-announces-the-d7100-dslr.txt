You might take interest with the company's new D7100, a lightweight DSLR with a brand new DX-format (APS-C) sensor and a handful of other goodies to boot. The 24.1-megapixel cam's imaging technology follows a now-commonplace industry trend by dropping the optical low-pass filter in favor of enhanced resolution. Naturally, the D7000 successor includes a sensitivity range of ISO 100 to 25,600 (Hi 2), along with improved noise reduction for better results in low-light. There's a D4-like EXPEED 3 processor with support for 6 frames-per-second shooting in any mode, even when capturing 12- or 14-bit RAW images. A unique 1.3x DX crop function boost that rate to 7 fps, however, while capturing a maximum of 15.4-megapixel stills and 1080/60i or 50i video, compared to 1080 30/25/24p in the regular mode. There's a 3.2-inch 1.229M-dot LCD, an OLED display inside the viewfinder for crisper data readout, and plenty more if you read on!



  Speed improvements reach beyond consecutive shooting. Nikon claims a startup time of 0.13 second, with a 0.052-second shutter lag. The focusing system is boosted as well, with 51 AF points and 15 cross-type sensors in the central area, including one that's even compatible with f/8 maximum aperture optics, such as an f/5.6 lens paired with a teleconverter. On the connectivity front, there's two SD card slots, with SDXC and UHS-1 compatibility, a mic input jack, headphone jack, and an HDMI port that supports uncompressed 1080p output without an info overlay (for clean streaming to an external recording device). You can add GPS with the GP-1 accessory, Ethernet with the UT-1 Communication Unit or wireless control capability with the WR-1 Transceiver. The magnesium-alloy body is weather sealed of course, and it's both lighter than the D7000 and slightly narrower and easier to hold. 
 Nikon reps were unable to share pricing for the new WR-1 Transceiver, which acts as both a transmitter and receiver, enabling shutter speed, ISO, aperture and other settings control from a distance of up to 394 feet. We do, however, have the camera's MSRP: the D7100 is set to ship for $1,200 without any extras, or $1,600 if you opt for a kit with an 18-105mm lens. It's scheduled to hit stores in late March and we reckon it'll be worth the wait.
