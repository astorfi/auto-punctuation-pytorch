Apparently, the drives make use of three different power saving modes to reduce power consumption by up to 75%, which the company says will also extend the life of the drive itself. Further adding to the drives' eco status is their RoHS compliance, which certifies that they contain a minimal amount of hazardous chemicals. Otherwise, the drives look to be pretty standard as far as USB drives go, available in sizes from 80GB to 750GB and costing between $95 and $350.
