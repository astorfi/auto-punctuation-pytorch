 We have few details as to what'sreally going on here (namely because these guys are being a little stingy on the info right now), but Sanyo and Nokiahave announced they're setting up shop together with a joint cellphone venture to make CDMA 3G devices. What kind, whatthey'll look like, how much they'll cost, who gets them, whether they'll be badged Nosanyo or Sanyokia-- we knownothing, just that the two handset giants will be signing off on this enigmatic new company in Q2, and the doors opento Nokanyo HQ in Q3.
