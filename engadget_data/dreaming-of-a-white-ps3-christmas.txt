 If you've been holding back on buying a PS3 because its black finish doesn't quite fit in with your white Xbox 360 and/or white Wii, you're in luck (though you may want to speak to someone about your, uh, predilections): An outfit by the name of PS3Center.net is offering up a 60GB PS3 for sale on eBay that's been customized with a glossy white finish. You'll pay handsomely for the privilege of owning one of the few white PS3s out there; there are still six days left and already the bidding is up to a healthy $1,125.[Thanks, nino]
