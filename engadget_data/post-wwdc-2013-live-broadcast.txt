Phew! Wasn't that fun? After months and months of abundant speculations, the opening keynote at WWDC 2013 finally allowed us to see some of the things Apple's been working on since its last major event. Still, we can only imagine how keeping track of today's announcements can become a slightly complicated task -- especially with E3 happening as we speak. The good news for you is that, as they did earlier in the day, Tim Stevens and Darren Murph will be hosting a live video broadcast right across the street from where the conference is taking place. So, head on past the jump, where you'll be able to watch along as the Engadget duo goes over the new stuff Apple just unveiled.
