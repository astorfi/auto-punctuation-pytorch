 BenQ falls in line with LG, Samsung, and Nokia among others by announcing their firstDVB-H handset. Developed by the good folks at Siemens, the handset not only allows punters to view that sweet, sweetdigital TeeVee but record it as well. Expected to launch in June just in time for squinting at the FIFA World Cupacross Europe and the rest of the non-US world for that matter. Sorry, no pics, but the device will be on display atCeBIT (which starts Thursday) where we’ll try to catch a hands-on for ya’ll. Afterall, there's always thechance that it'll showup here.
