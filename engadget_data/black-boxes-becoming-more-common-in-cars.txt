Think your car is spying on you? If you're driving a late-model GM car, as well as a handful of cars from other
makers, you may just be right. According to a detailed report on News.com, automakers are continuing to add
airplane-style black boxes to cars, with GM leading the way. Analysts quoted by News.com estimate that up to 65% of all
new vehicles sold last year had black boxes, which typically store a few seconds of data about a car's speed, direction
and other vitals. In the event of an accident, the data can help determine liability. However, privacy issues have been
raised by groups like the Consumers Union and the Electronic Privacy Information Center, since automakers are not
currently required to tell consumers that the boxes are there. However, given that the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration has recommended that the boxes be required
on all new vehicles, you should just assume one is there, and drive accordingly. Either that or next time you're
getting your ride pimped, have them check for the box while they're at it.
