 MediaTek may have only just reached quad-core smartphones in earnest, but its aims are expanding -- in a more literal sense. The company's Xie Qingjiang says that plans are underway to build a tablet-specific processor that would ship in the third quarter of the year. While other details are scarce, it's safe to say the chip will take advantage of all the extra breathing room for more performance. The real questions surround just who will use the new creation: there's no guarantee that Acer will find a fit for the design inside of its future 8- and 10-inch budget slates, for example. When MediaTek is seemingly making generational leaps in a matter of months, though, we suspect that there won't be a shortage of customers.
