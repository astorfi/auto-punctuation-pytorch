Between us, you and the wall, we suspect a sequel is on the way in the shape of the Contour 200i Air that's just been escorted out of the FCC's underground bunker and dumped unceremoniously on a Washington highway. It's packing the same setup as this year's model, except now it's packing Airplay chops for when you wanna stream music from your couch-based iDevice. Stay tuned, we'll try to get our hands on one of these in a fortnight's time.
