Sony may be focused on Europe right now, but it still has some news for Americans: the company just launched a variant of the Xperia Tablet Z with unlocked LTE for both AT&T and T-Mobile. The Android device doesn't offer any other advantages over the 16GB WiFi version, although that's not necessarily a bad thing in our books. If you're interested in the 4G model, you can buy it today for $629.
