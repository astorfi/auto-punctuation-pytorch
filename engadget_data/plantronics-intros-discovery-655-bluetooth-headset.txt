 Plantronics is feeling the ergonomic vibe as they introduced a new flagship Discovery headset at their Body and Form event in New York. The Discovery 655 is a form-focused Bluetooth headset with a distinctly different look than the 645 / 640 models. The design is intended to fit the "contours of your face" and shouldn't cause any ear fatigue weighing only 9 grams. Similar to other Discovery models, the 655 comes with a headset storage jacket -- which could be mistaken for an aluminum cigar case -- that performs double-duty as a charger (AAA powered), and a vibrating ringer to alert users of incoming calls. You also get a mini-USB adapter, which was notably absent on the Discovery 640, to charge from your PC or mobile phone's power supply. As in the 645, this unit includes DSP to block out unwanted noise (or certain managers' voices) and adjust the volume level based on your surroundings. Although there's really nothing groundbreaking about the 655 in terms of specifications, the change in style and lower price standout on an otherwise uninspiring offering -- you can give the Discovery 655 a listen when it drops in August for $150.
