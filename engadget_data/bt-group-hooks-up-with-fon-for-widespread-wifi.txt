Announced today, Britain's top fixed-line carrier will be teaming up with FON to allow "more than three million UK broadband customers to use hundreds of thousands of hotspots for free." BT customers who agree to share a pinch of their broadband connection(s) will be eligible to surf away gratis on any of the "190,000" FON hotspots worldwide, and BT Group apparently hopes that this deal will eventually lead to "every street in Britain" being covered by WiFi.
