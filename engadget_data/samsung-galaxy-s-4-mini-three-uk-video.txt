Can't wait to get your hands on a Galaxy S 4 mini? Samsung has yet to announce its price and availability, but until then you can imagine you're Three UK's Brendan Arndt in the video below. Arndt shows off the much-rumored baby S 4 for us, as the phone poses for close-up shots in various angles. While the clip merely reiterates all the specs Samsung confirmed, it also shows how relatively tiny the S 4 mini is compared to its full-sized sibling and the gargantuan Galaxy Mega. That, despite the device boasting a 4.3-inch screen, which is even bigger than the iPhone 5's. Check after the jump to watch the S 4 mini in all its not-so-Lilliputian glory.
