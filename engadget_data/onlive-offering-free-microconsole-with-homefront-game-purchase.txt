Here's another thought -- pre-order THQ's Homefront on OnLive instead for $50, and get a voucher for a free MicroConsole (and a free game) in the bargain. That's the deal OnLive announced the other day, which runs through March 14th, though the fine print says supplies are limited, shipping costs extra, and you won't actually receive the hardware until after the deal expires no matter when you pre-order the game. We're not sure what it says for OnLive's ongoing viability that the company finds itself having to give hardware away for less than half its worth, but we won't look a gift horse in the mouth!
