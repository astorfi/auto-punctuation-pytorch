As we expected, the 900X1A sports a Core i3-380UM processor, 2GB of RAM, and 1366 x 768 resolution, but instead of the anticipated 64GB of memory, it's rocking the same 128GB SSD as its older sibling. We've yet to hear when the new 9 Series will make it across the pond, but it should be available in Europe starting April 1st for â‚¬1,200 -- and, if you like 'em small and skinny, you can check out a video of the 900X1A after the break. 

[Thanks, Marco]
