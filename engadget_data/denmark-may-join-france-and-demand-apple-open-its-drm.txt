 Denmark's largest telecom company, TDC, andthe Maersk shipping giant, have joined the French call forApple to open up its DRM to all players, with TDC's CEO saying that "we can only press for something like theFrench, because it gives the consumers as many opportunities to shop for music." We're not sure if such callsresonate with the Danish government; last time we checked, the Prince was still wandering around muttering somethingabout ghosts, and his pals were warning him that "something rotten" was going on at the top. And chances areSteve Jobs isn't losing any sleep over this -- unless he's seeing ghosts as well -- since Denmark's population of about5.4 million makes it one of Europe's smaller markets. Regardless of whether the corporate pronouncements translate intoactual law, they do seem to point to a growing trend in Europe to demand greater DRM interoperability. Elsewhere inEurope, Apple's long-running battle with the surviving Beatles over the use of the name "Apple" is due backin court this week, as Paul and Ringo continue to insist that the iPod and iTunes violate the terms of a 1991settlement in which Apple agreed to stay out of the music business. Apple has defended itself by insisting that theagreement with the Beatles' Apple Corps publishing company applied only to physical media and not "datatransmission," as Apple defines its products. Maybe Apple should try the same excuse on those melancholy Danes andsee if it'll be enough to get them to put down their slings and arrows.Read - DenmarkRead - Beatles
