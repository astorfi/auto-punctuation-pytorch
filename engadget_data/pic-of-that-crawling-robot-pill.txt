Near Near Future found a pic of that "swallowable"
multi-legged robot pill we wrote about the other day that
is supposed to crawl around in your intestines and do something or other that's helpful. Unless they seriously shrink
that sucker down, we're guessing a lot of people would probably rather stay sick than have one of those things
wandering around inside of them.
