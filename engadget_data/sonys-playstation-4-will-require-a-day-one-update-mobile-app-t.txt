Sony's PlayStation 4 US launch is now less than a month away and -- surprise, surprise -- it's going to require a Day One system update. The company just announced today that a significant software patch (about 300MB in size) will be necessary to enable a slew of functionality, like Remote Play on PS Vita and the Share button, that Sony's been championing through the year. Also going hand-in-hand with this patch is the release of Sony's second screen PlayStation App, which will be available on November 13th in the US (just two days before launch) and on the 22nd in Europe on both Android and iOS.



With the PS4's version 1.50 update, gamers will be able to record and upload gameplay highlights via the Share button, as well as livestream sessions using the inbuilt Twitch or Ustream options. And if you happen to pick up an PS4 Eye at launch, you'll also be able to take advantage of that camera's voice commands and facial recognition features. Crucially, this update also turns on Sony's "Play as you download" function, which leverages the company's Gaikai-powered cloud tech so you don't have to wait half a day before playing recent PSN purchaes.

Since it's made to work with the PlayStation App (or PS4 Link on Vita), the update also transforms mobile devices running the app into second screen controllers for supported titles, a remote for control/keyboard for navigation of the PS4 and makes Remote Play over WiFi on the Vita a reality -- all on day one. Beyond its gameplay functions, the PlayStation App functions essentially as an extension of PSN, letting PS4 owners access their Friends List, send messages across PlayStation platforms (i.e., PS Vita and PS3), edit their profiles, buy games, view Trophies, as well as send and view notifications and status updates within the What's New feed.

Online multiplayer via PS Plus and multiple account PSN account log-in are also bundled into this Day One update, in addition to Blu-ray and DVD support, the ability to play background music while in-game and Party chat. So, basically, everything you've ever heard Sony talk about in the lead up to the PS4's launch will be part and parcel of this very necessary software patch.

But there is one thing Sony's not yet making available to early PS4 adopters and that's the "suspend/resume" feature; a low-power state that means you never have to shut the console off -- you can just pause, walk away and then pick up right where you left off. Sony's hasn't given a timeframe for when gamers can expect this to go live, only saying that gamers can expect further updates on this and other unannounced features "in the near future". Until then, you'll just have to make do with manually shutting off the system. That's rough, we know.
