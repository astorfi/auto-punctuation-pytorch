 Indifferent souls may have no qualms just snapping up the first digiframe they see, but that sect isn't the target market for Parrot's latest. The Andrée Putman-designed device is being shown around the UK at the moment, and aside from boasting a 7-inch display, a glossy black motif, rear-mounted buttons, auto-rotation, 10MB of built-in storage, an SD expansion slot and integrated Bluetooth (but no WiFi), you also get to hand over £250 to take it home. Right now, the piece is only available in London's Few and Far store, but the company may try to roll it out nationwide if demand necessitates.
