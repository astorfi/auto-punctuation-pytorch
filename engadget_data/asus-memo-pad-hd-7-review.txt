To some extent, ASUS is a victim of its own success: it gave the budget tablet category a boost with the original Nexus 7, and it now faces a legion of competitors in that space. The company is taking a two-step approach to maintaining its relevance. The new Nexus 7 tackles the higher end, with top-tier specs that include a 1080p display and wireless charging. Right now, though, we're more interested in ASUS' low-end solution, the MeMo Pad HD 7. While it's one of the cheaper name-brand tablets at $150, it promises some of the quality we typically expect from more expensive products. But is the HD 7 good enough to fend off other entry-level tablets? And can it attract customers who'd be willing to pay the premium for a new Nexus 7'? Let's find out.




HardwareDespite its name, the MeMo Pad HD 7 bears little in common with the older 7-inch MeMo Pad. The nondescript black front and curvy profile are familiar, but ASUS has replaced the textured backing with a smooth surface that's either matte on the dark blue model, or glossy on the green, pink and white versions. Consider getting the HD 7 in white if you want to keep it pretty -- the back is prone to showing fingerprints and other smudges. ASUS' build quality is reasonably solid too, although some slight creaking under strain is enough to remind us this is an entry-level product we're dealing with.

The HD 7 is comfortable to hold, with plenty of grip and a moderate weight of 10.7 ounces (303.3g). It's also a compact device at 7.7 inches tall and 4.7 inches wide. That said, its 0.43-inch thickness makes it as chunky as the old Nexus 7 or the Hisense Sero 7 Pro. As reasonable as that is for 7-inch devices, we can't help but covet slimmer tablets like the new Nexus 7 or Samsung's Galaxy Tab 3 7.0.

A closer inspection reveals some conspicuous improvements to the MeMo Pad formula. The 1.2-megapixel front camera and left-side microSDHC slot remain in mostly familiar places, but there's now a slightly protruding 5-megapixel camera (albeit without a flash) on the back. ASUS has replaced the small mono speaker with a larger stereo unit. Curiously, ASUS has moved the micro-USB port from the bottom to the top, next to the headphone jack and microphone; accessories made for the earlier MeMo Pad may not work here. You should find a basic stand in the box, though.


We're not big fans of the buttons. Like its sibling, the MeMo Pad HD 7 puts the power button and volume rocker on a back corner. They're easy to reach, but they're both hidden from sight and nearly flat, making them hard to identify by feel. Even now, we still occasionally have to double-check what we're about to press to avoid inadvertently putting the tablet to sleep.

You also won't find many luxuries beyond the ones we've already mentioned so far. The HD 7 covers basic wireless with dual-band 802.11n WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 LE, but there's no NFC. There's also no hardware-based video out, whether through HDMI (as on the Sero 7 Pro), MHL or SlimPort. ASUS does offer Miracast wireless display support as a consolation prize, however, so those with suitably modern TVs can skip the wires altogether. Like the earlier MeMo Pad, there's 16GB of built-in storage in the US model, 11.8GB of which is usable.

When tablet designers want to cut corners, display quality is frequently the first to go. Exhibit A: the lackluster screen on the HP Slate 7. Thankfully, the MeMo Pad HD 7 doesn't fall into that trap. ASUS is using an IPS 1,280 x 800 LCD that produces accurate colors and very wide viewing angles. The panel is even bright enough to use outdoors in some situations. There's no question that we'd notice the Nexus 7's higher resolution in a direct comparison, but the HD 7's display is more than crisp enough for books, games and movies.

There are a few quirks. Black levels aren't superb; you're more likely to see dark gray than black in poorer lighting. The front glass is also glossier than we're used to, which didn't help our attempts to read near a window, or outside on a sunny day. Even so, the HD 7's screen doesn't feel like a significant compromise. It's at least appropriate for the price, and it trumps the 1,024 x 600 displays in rivals like the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0.

Sound from the tablet isn't quite so impressive. The speakers are loud and largely distortion-free at high volumes, but their bass output won't compete with HTC's BoomSound. Moreover, having both speakers so close to each other negates the advantages of stereo separation; you won't hear panning effects or the virtual surround sound of the Nexus 7. It's easy to partly obscure the speakers in the middle of an enthusiastic gameplay session, for that matter. We'll still take the HD 7 over competitors with single-channel sound. It just feels like a missed opportunity, particularly when the Nexus 7's audio is so well done.

Software
The MeMo Pad HD 7 faces an immediate problem on the software front. It's shipping with Android 4.2.1 at the very moment that another ASUS tablet -- you guessed it, the Nexus 7 -- is launching with Android 4.3. While the new OS doesn't represent a night-and-day experience, it does offer perks like guest profiles, better OS-level Bluetooth support and modular DRM that allows for 1080p Netflix streaming. ASUS tells us it will upgrade the HD 7 to Android 4.3 in the near future, but that still leaves the tablet ever-so-slightly behind the cutting edge.
