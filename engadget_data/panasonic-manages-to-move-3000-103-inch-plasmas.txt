If our math is even close to correct, that means that Panny has managed to move around 130 of these bad boys each month, which isn't too shabby given the original $70,000 sticker. If you're curious as to where these things actually go, you'll probably be disappointed to hear some rather expected answers: nightclubs, sports arena, resorts, universities, casinos and high-brow offices in big name cities. Looking for the most in one place? Head on down to Las Vegas' own Sam's Town Hotel & Gambling Hall, where 15 of these beasts were placed in its newly remodeled $20-million Race and Sports Book room.
