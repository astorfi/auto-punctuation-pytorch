As promised by Jon Rubinstein yesterday, the Pre 2 (sans the lovely Palm branding) is today available to pre-order at $100 on a two-year Verizon contract. Unsubsidized and contractually liberated pricing is $450. webOS 2.0, a "Vivid" touchscreen and, of course, that familiar portrait slider keyboard await those brave enough to own a HP smartphone.
