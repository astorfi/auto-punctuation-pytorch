Any parent will tell you that getting kids to groom their pearly whites is all too often like, well, pulling teeth.
Some Hasbro executive had the brilliant idea of keeping kids entertained while scrubbing those molars: enter "Tooth
Tunes," a toothbrush that plays a two minute riff to span the ideal amount of brush time recommended by dentists. The
clip, stored on a microchip "no bigger than a dot atop the letter i," (that's rich) is triggered by a button on the
brush. A minicomputer uses bone conduction to send sound waves first through the front teeth, then to the jawbone and
into the inner ear (not unlike the Jawbone,
SwiMP3, etc., incidentally). Hasbro is currently chatting
up several pop stars for the rights to their songs, but will any of them bite? And will the kids complain that it
has no screen?
