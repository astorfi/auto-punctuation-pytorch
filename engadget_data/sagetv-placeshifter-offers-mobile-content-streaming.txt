 Those of you who do the home theater thing fromyour PC and are for some reason unhappy with the free streaming service offered by Orb now have a new way of "slinging" your content to a remote computer withSageTV's Placeshifter add-on. The $30 software, which requires the $80 SageTV media center package, offers remoteaccess to videos, music, photos, and if you have a TV tuner card or USB device, both live and recorded programming.Cnet got a "first look" at Placeshifter in action, and reports spotty but acceptable performance, with thedelays and artifact-infested video we've come to expect accept from these remote streaming services.While we're pretty happy with our free Windows Media Center and Orb setup, if you already own SageTV, the one-time feemight be worth it to free your content with the knowledge that someone's there to troubleshoot the inevitableproblems.[Via PVR Wire]
