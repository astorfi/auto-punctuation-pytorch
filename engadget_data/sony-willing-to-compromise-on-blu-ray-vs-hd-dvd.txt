Is Sony opening the door to some sort of truce between
Blu-ray and
HD-DVD? It's seems way late in the
game to be talking about unifying the two warring high-def disc standards, esp. considering how much HD-DVD and Blu-ray
hardware is already in the pipeline, but incoming Sony prez Ryoji Chubachi said an interview earlier today that they
"haven't totally given up on the possibility of integration or compromise," and that Sony, which is backing Blu-ray
hardcore, understands that having "two rival formats is disappointing." (You can say that again, brother.) This is
actually the second time this year that a top Sony exec has indicated that they're willing to work things out with the
companies that are backing HD-DVD (like Toshiba and NEC), but the question is, what are they going to do to make it
happen? If there was an easy or obvious compromise to be found it probably would have happened already. Where was all
this conciliatory talk two years ago?
