It's been months since reports suggested Twitter would shut down its #Music app and service, but now it's actually happening. The service announced its iOS app is disappearing from the store today (download it now for that suddenly vintage feel), although anyone actually using it can continue until the service is shut down April 18th, a year after it originally launched. In a followup tweet, the team mentions it will "continue to experiment with new ways to bring you great content based on the music activity we see every day on Twitter." In October, AllThingsD reported the service's fate was sealed both by "abysmal" download numbers and project head Kevin Thau leaving for a job with Jelly.



Later this afternoon, we will be removing Twitter #music from the App Store. If you have the app, it will continue to work until April 18.
