Nevertheless, if a date prominently listed on Microsoft's own Support Lifecycle website is to be believed, WHS will be "generally available" on August 27, 2007, and it also lists the mainstream support retirement date as October 9, 2012. Of course, we wouldn't place our bets on pre-fabricated boxes to start shipping with the software on the 27th, but if you hunt hard enough, you're likely to find it in one channel or another. Circle the date folks, yet another new flavor of Windows is nearly here.[Via I Started Something]
