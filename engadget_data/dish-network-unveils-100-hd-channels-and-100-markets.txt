 Although we're still waiting to start our live coverage of the DISH Network press event on Engadget (not to be confused with Engadget HD) at 11am PST, the releases are already starting to flow. With DirecTV stealing all the limelight at last year's show, many have great expectations for DISH this year and it appears DISH is up for the challenge. According to the release, DISH has plans to launch three new birds in 2008, which will help it maintain the status as the "top HD provider." Marketing department wars aside, DISH plans to extend the national HD channel count from 76 to 100 and expand the local HD service from 65 markets to 100. The first eleven local markets to get HD includes: Austin, TX; Baltimore; Cleveland; Columbia, S.C.; Flint, Mich.; Greenville, S.C.; Huntsville, Ala.; Jackson, Miss.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Orlando, Fla.; and Richmond, Va. After these are online, DISH will be providing local HD to 80% of the US. Unfortunately, it's not all good news, as there will be changes to the pricing structure as well, with the HD packages starting at $10 a month.[Via SatelliteGuys.us]
