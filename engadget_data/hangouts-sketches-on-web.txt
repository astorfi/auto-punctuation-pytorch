Ever threatened to draw someone a picture because they didn't understand you in an online chat? It's now easy to act on that threat. Google has started rolling out an update to Hangouts' web interface that lets you sketch your ideas. If you have access, hovering over the camera icon will reveal a pencil button that launches the new tool. While it's extremely simple, the mini-app should be enough to annotate a picture or whip up a quick diagram. We've reached out to Google for more details regarding its new doodler, including the possibility of a mobile launch; we'll let you know if there's more to add. For now, you'll just have to keep checking Hangouts' web client to see if you can craft your own visual aids.
