 The Raspberry Pi has been on sale for just over a year. Key distributor RS Components wants to celebrate the tiny computer's first birthday with more than just a greeting card, though. It's producing a limited edition Model B, the Blue Pi, with a blue circuit board and a suitably-hued case. The mini PC is guaranteed to stand out in any hobbyist project, provided it's not hidden in a box. There's only one catch: you can't buy one. RSC is donating a batch to good causes, and only 1,000 are up for grabs in giveaways running between now and June. Those who make a convincing argument for Blue Pi ownership will accordingly be part of an exclusive club -- and the envy of any Raspberry Pi owner who's been bored with plain green.
