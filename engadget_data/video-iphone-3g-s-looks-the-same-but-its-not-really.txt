The glory's in the higher performing guts (that will remain a mystery until teardown and possibly beyond). We're still not 100 percent clear what features will be 3G S only (we're sorting that out now), but video recording seems to be one of 'em even though jailbreakers have been recording video on iPhones for ages. Must be a quality thing. See Apple's first iPhone 3G S ad after the break.
