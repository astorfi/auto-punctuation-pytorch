Like the service itself, the compatible handset lineup is extraordinarily limited at the moment; only the SYNC, A717, and A727 from Samsung are being officially advertised, though we know the LG CU500v should work as well. Pricing remains unchanged from before: a stiff $4.99 monthly for 25 minutes of usage, $9.99 for 60 minutes, or 35 cents per minute.[Via Phone Scoop]
