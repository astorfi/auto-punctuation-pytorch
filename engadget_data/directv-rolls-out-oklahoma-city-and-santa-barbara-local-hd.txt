       Slowly but surely, DirecTV is rolling out local HD markets nationwide. Next up is the Oklahoma City and Santa Barbara area, which makes 60 local markets if anyone is keeping track. Oklahoma City subs can receive KOCO/ABC and KOKH/FOX but it looks like there are talks to add KWTV/CBS and KFOR/NBC sometime soon. Santa Barbara subs can now receive KEYT/ABC, KCOY/CBS and KKFX/FOX with the hopes of adding KSBY/NBC soon. Keep in mind that your old DirecTV equipment will not work and you'll need the new HR20 box along with a Ka/Ku capable dish. Oh, and the new stations are up as of yesterday.Read: Oklahoma CityRead: Santa Barbara
