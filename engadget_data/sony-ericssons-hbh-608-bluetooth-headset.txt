Before worrying about making their already minuscule Bluetooth headsets any smaller, perhaps they should concern
themselves with making the damned things adjustable and ergonomic for more than just a few ears. That said,
Sony Ericsson's pimping their new HBH-608
as a VoIP solution in conjunction with their new BX series
laptops we saw a couple days ago. Ok, we're kind of feeling that angle, but let's stick to the message here:
tiny Bluetooth headset, aw yeah. Ahem.
