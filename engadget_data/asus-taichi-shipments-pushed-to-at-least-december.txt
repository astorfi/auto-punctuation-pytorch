ASUS originally planned for its dual-screened TAICHI laptops to ship in November, but a company spokesperson tells PCWorld at the last minute that the Windows 8 showcase won't ship sooner than December, and could slip further still. The PC builder doesn't say why we'll be twiddling our thumbs that much longer. Online retailers certainly aren't waiting around for an answer -- they've simply listed the myriad TAICHI variants as unavailable for now. Yes, there's a definite sense of d√©ja vu when ASUS is yet again delaying a touchscreen device during the holidays. We're just wondering if the trip down memory lane will lead to the same fine outcome.
