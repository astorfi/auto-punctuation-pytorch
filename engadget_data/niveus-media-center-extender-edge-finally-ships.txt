Nevertheless, those anxious to get their hands on one finally can, but you'll have to fork over $1,499 to a Niveus Authorized Dealer in order to do so. Interestingly, we are told that the EDGE has become "the first Windows Media Center Extender to receive the prestigious Imaging Science Foundation (ISF) Video Quality Certification," so yeah, there's that, too.
