That's a good $70 less than the two-instrument Guitar Hero World Tour package, but of course you're paying for a more single-player setup. Again, we haven't heard word one from Activision, and with over four months until this supposed date, things are likely subject to change (assuming these even came from the publisher in the first place, and weren't just magically pulled out of a large, black cap with frilly edges). We wouldn't be surprised to see this being the final price, though, and either way, it serves as a nagging reminder that the life of a fake plastic musician doesn't come cheap.[Via Joystiq]Read - Gamestop listingRead - Amazon listing
