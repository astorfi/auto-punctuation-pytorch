 A lot of people like/need to do their computing away from the actual computer, and for most applications up to several hundred feet, a regular old wired or wireless KVM extender will do, but if for some reason you'd like to situate your machine up to six-and-a-quarter miles away, only the DVI3000HD from Gefen is up to the task. This new 1,280 x 1,024-capable extender uses single mode fiber optic cables to connect a transmitter situated by your PC to a receiver box located next to your workspace, and sports USB 1.1, DVI, and RS-232C ports for breaking the signal out to your keyboard, mouse, monitor, and/or serial devices. As you might expect, super-long-distance computing like this doesn't come cheap, so both boxes and the included cables -- available now for pre-order -- will set you back a cool two grand.
