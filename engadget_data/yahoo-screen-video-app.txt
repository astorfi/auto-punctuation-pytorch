Armed with a fresh new logo, Yahoo's getting down to business. Today, the company unveiled its first major mobile product: a video-discovery app for iOS called Screen. The service lets users browse trending videos and swipe through channels to watch clips from The Daily Show and Saturday Night Live, in addition to Yahoo Originals programming. The company says it currently has "over 1,000 hours of comedy" on offer -- and thanks to a deal with Viacom, that includes plenty of clips from Comedy Central shows. Those using Apple's mobile OS can download the free app via the second source link below.
