Yeah right, like that really happened; actually, the bad blood between the world's number one and two DAP manufacturers continues to flow unabated, with Wednesday seeing Creative move one step closer to the permanent cease and desist order it's seeking against the iPod, thanks to a probe intiated by the US International Trade Commssion. The ITC agreed to look into's Creative's complaint that several iPod models violate its Zen patents, which was the impetus for Apple filing two countersuits of its own. A ruling on the complaint is not anticipated for at least twelve months, during which time we can expect Apple to sell a lot more digital audio players than Creative, who will probably have to shift even more of its R&D budget to the overworked legal department.
