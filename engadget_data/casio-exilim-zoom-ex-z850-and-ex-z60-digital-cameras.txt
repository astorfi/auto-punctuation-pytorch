First the Z850 (pictured) whichis pretty much the Z750 with anincremental bump to 8.1 megapixels, an improved shutter lag of just 0.003 seconds, and inclusion of a much neededanti-shake DSP. Otherwise, it's the same 3x optical zoom and 2.5-inch LCD we've seen before. The 6 megapixel EX-Z60does away with the glass viewfinder on the Z850 yet fails to increase the LCD beyond 2.5-inches or lens beyond a 3xzoom in attempts to keep the all-metal package slim. Even though it's small, Casio claims to keep out the blur withimage stabilization and near instant image recording via that low 0.002 seconds shutter release lag. Both camerasfeature SD expansion. Still no word on pricing or availability. Z60 snaps after the break.[Thanks, Khuram]
