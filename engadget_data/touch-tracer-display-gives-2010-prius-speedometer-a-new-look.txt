Autoblog has pointed out that Toyota's next-generation hybrid will sport an all new Touch Tracer Display that will enable steering wheel commands to appear atop the speedometer whenever a button is pushed. The upside? Rather than glancing down at your wheel (and thus, away from oncoming traffic), you'll be able to see the options while keeping your head up and eyes on the road. Naturally, we'd expect this little innovation to spread far and wide across Toyota's fleet in the not-too-distant future.
