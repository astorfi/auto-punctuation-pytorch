That was recently done on the as yet unreleased PocketBook 360 Plus e-reader, apparently in an effort to demonstrate its new Pearl E Ink display and Freescale processor. Head on past the break to check out the results for yourself -- and, no, Doom 2 unfortunately won't actually be included with the e-reader.
