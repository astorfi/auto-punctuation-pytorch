 We've long since noticedDell's lineup of hard drive-based portable audio players have vanished from their site, but this they officiallycommented on the death of the drive-based segment of their Dell Pocket DJ (Digital Jukebox) line and made it officialthat those devices were phased out over the last two months. Apparently the DJ Ditty is doing just fine though, and theyhinted at being a flash player-only shop from here on in. Can't says as we're surprised, but we're still alwaysdisappointed to see another iPod competitor drop off the map.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
