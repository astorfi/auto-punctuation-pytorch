 Microsoft just trimmed 13% of the price from its Xbox 360 console in Japan. The move comes on the heels of Sony's own PS3 slash and bare-bones 40GB PS3 console launch -- a move resulting in a dramatic uptick in sales for Sony. Nintendo Wii pricing has thus far remained unchanged for the holiday season. While we'd love for Microsoft to extend the discounts to the rest of the world -- we doubt they'll do so. This move is meant to shore up demand in Japan where Xbox 360 sales struggle against the homegrown Wii and PS3. Of course, we're more than happy to be proven wrong. [Thanks, Tris]
