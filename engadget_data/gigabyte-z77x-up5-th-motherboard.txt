Fear not, dear peripheral addict, because Gigabyte's latest Z77X-UP5 TH motherboard is equipped to feed your addiction with double the number of Thunderbolt ports as we've seen from other manufacturers. The company is taking to the floor of Computex to show off its latest creation, which features two Thunderbolt ports that are each capable of 10 Gbps throughput. Better yet, the implementation leaves the PCIe 3.0 lanes untouched, as the Thunderbolt controller is powered by an additional chip from PLX. Sadly, neither pricing nor release date has yet been let out of the bag. For additional views of this novel creation, be sure to hit up the source link below.
