Well, the official site's appeared, and though it gives us no information about the actual game itself, well, you get the idea, right? Please, please let the above setup work in cooperation with Guitar Hero so that we can finally fulfill our dream of playing the part of Mr. Hahn with the rest of our band, Linkin Park. [Thanks, John D.]
