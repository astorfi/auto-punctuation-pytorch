Roc A Fella was able to smuggle out some marketing photos today and let us tell you, she's quite a sweet phone. Expect external music controls (yep), Bluetooth 2.0. microSD, a 1.3 megapixel camera, and V CAST music (1.2). Word on the street is that this one just may come out this month. As we eagerly anticipate the newest edition to Verizon's lineup, we'll just have to wait and see as more details surface.
