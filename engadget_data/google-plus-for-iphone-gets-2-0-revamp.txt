The TLC level just got a boost today, as a Google+ 2.0 update has remade the app in style: it now has a more immersive "carousel" for streams, with stylized fonts, a greater emphasis on profile photos and a whole lot less of that humdrum white. Actions like a +1 vote are more prominent at the same time. If you're of the Apple-owning persuasion, you can get the updated app now; Android users are also being teased with a future update that will bring some "extra surprises" within a few weeks.
