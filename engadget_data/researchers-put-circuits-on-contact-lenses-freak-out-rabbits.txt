That's apparently possible thanks to a combination of lights and circuits, which they've managed to cram onto lens no larger than your average contact -- though it doesn't even do so much as light up in its current state (that's promises "soon"). Naturally, the researchers have tested the lenses on rabbits instead of themselves, which they say have shown "no adverse effects" after wearing the lenses for upwards of 20 minutes, although we'll just have to wait and see if they feel the same way after the researchers flip the switch on 'em.
