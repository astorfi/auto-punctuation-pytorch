That was the closing remark of then-CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo as he wrapped up Nokia's 2010 CES keynote, and while the words ring true today, we're guessing that what has transpired in Espoo between then and now wasn't exactly on his radar at the time. After laying low through the 2011 episode, Nokia will be making a triumphant return at next year's Consumer Electronics Show, even going so far as to reserve a block of time for a Metro-themed press event. The fun kicks off at 3:00PM PT on January 9th, and if you couldn't tell by the invite, we're guessing Windows Phone will be somewhere in the discussion. Naturally, we'll be bringing you every moment of it right here on the site -- nothing wrong with blocking out some vacation time to be here, you know?
