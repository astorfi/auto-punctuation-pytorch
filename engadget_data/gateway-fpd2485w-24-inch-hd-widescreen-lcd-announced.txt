Their new 24-inch HD Widescreen FPD2485W -- mentioned with their FX530 desktop lineup and appearing on their support site -- gives you another three inches on top of that FPD2185W 21-incher of theirs, and features a 1920 x 1200 resolution panel with 450cd/m² brightness, 1000:1 contrast ratio, 6ms pixel response, 178° viewing angle, DVI with HDCP, two component, composite, S-Video, and VGA inputs, a four port USB 2.0 hub, touch sensitive controls, picture-in-picture, and Faroudja DCDi. Unfortunately there doesn't appear to be an integrated media reader like the Dell 2407WFP has, but it's still a way better than Apple's stripped down 23-incher, and at $679 the FPD2485W's MSRP is lowest as well. (Tack on another $70 for their add-on speaker accessory.) We'll be sure to let you know when this guy becomes available. [Warning: PDF link]P.S. -Gateway says it should be officially announced and available within a couple weeks, so for those fearful you might not have it in time for this holiday season, worry not.
