Sure, the only flavor of the Galaxy Note 8.0 currently lining US shelves is the version just packing Wi-Fi, but it appears that the LTE variety is getting ready for a trip stateside. The FCC just inspected a version of the tablet carrying a 850 / 1900 GSM radio along with support for LTE Bands 2, 4, 5 and 17, which are all tell-tale signs of hardware that plays nice with AT&T's network. For those in need of a refresher, Samsung's tablet runs Jelly Bean and boasts a 1.6 GHz quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, A-GPS, GLONASS, a hefty 4,600 mAh battery, WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0. With one of the final hurdles for availability on American shores cleared, you're that much closer to laying your paws on a slate that can moonlight as an unwieldy cellphone.
