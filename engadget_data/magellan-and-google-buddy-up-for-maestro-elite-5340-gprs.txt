That wireless data's going to be put to good use, enabling things like real-time traffic (see ya FM traffic receiver of yore) and creepy Google functionality like pointing out the closest proctologist (just around the corner!). But all this fancy technology isn't coming cheap: the unit will retail for $1299, not to mention an as-yet-to-be-determined monthly GPRS fee. At that price, they oughta program in directions to your local poorhouse. [Thanks, Rich]
