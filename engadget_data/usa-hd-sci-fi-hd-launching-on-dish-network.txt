Apparently, the satellite provider has already uplinked Sci-Fi HD and USA HD, and according to Scott Greczkowski over at SatelliteGuys, the two channels could go live to customers Friday -- as in, tomorrow. If all this pans out, it should be quite a nice weekend in front of the set for Dish customers.[Thanks, Daryl and Matt]Read - SatelliteGuysRead - HighDefForum
