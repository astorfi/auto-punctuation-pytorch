Of course -- in the tradition of all things leaked -- the video's got a good amount of blurriness, but it's not like we haven't seen it before. Apparently this 'Berry's rocking OS 4.7.1.10 -- not 4.6 like its sibling the Bold -- but it's got a "very likable Bold keyboard" albeit with a bit smaller keys. The back battery cover looks to be a piano-like carbon fiber plastic with a new hinge design to prevent dust accumulation, and it's described as being very light and sleek. Unfortunately, the OS was super buggy, and the videographer couldn't even get the device fully powered on for a tour of Verizon's presumably tweaked software -- but with this latest torrent of information over the past few days, we're sure that we'll be seeing a lot more of this bad boy in the not-so-distant future.
