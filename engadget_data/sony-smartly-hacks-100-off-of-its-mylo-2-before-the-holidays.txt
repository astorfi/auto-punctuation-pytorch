To that end, the outfit is hacking a full Benjamin from the purchase price, bringing the handheld down to an entirely more palatable $199.99. Both the black and white versions are being sold right now with the instant rebate tacked on, and the offer is good until January 31st of next year -- which definitely means the mylo 3 is due for a February 1, 2009 release.[Via Pocketables]
