Yup, it's the pic we've all been waiting for (or at least it's the pic we geeks here at Engadget have been waiting
for): the new Nokia E61 side-by-side with the Treo 650.
The E61 is definitely wider and a bit longer than the Treo, but it's also thinner and has a larger display (albeit one
with slightly lower resolution 320 x 240 vs. 320 x 320). Unfortunately, we weren't able to spend enough time with the
E61's keyboard to come away with much of an opinion either way. Click for another shot.
