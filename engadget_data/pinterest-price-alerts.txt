Pinterest has been a boon for digital scrapbookers, and today, the company is rolling out a new feature to appeal to its bargain-hunting user base. When the price drops on an item you've pinned, an email will be zapped to your inbox to alert you to the discount. If you're the kind of person who uses the site to sort out your shopping needs, it might be right up your alley, but not all pinners will appreciate the influx of messages. The feature can be switched off from the account settings menu, though even when it's on, Pinterest insists that emails will be bundled to avoid clutter. Discount alerts are set for a gradual roll-out, so if you're not seeing the option under settings yet, sit tight.
