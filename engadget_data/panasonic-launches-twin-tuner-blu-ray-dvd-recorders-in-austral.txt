For whatever reason, Panny has decided to roll out a June-bound 500GB twin-tuner BD recorder along with a handful of lesser recorders in the Australia region before any other locale save for Japan. The model numbers have been gently tweaked (DMR-BW500, DMR-EX88, DMR-EX78 and DMR-EZ48V, for starters), but everything else looks to be the same.
