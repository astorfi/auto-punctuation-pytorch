Sony has a ton of PlayStation VR content lined up at its PlayStation Experience gathering, but there's a truly special title in that mix: a modern version of Rez. The upcoming Rez Infinite will bring immersive visuals to the legendary (and borderline hallucinogenic) music shooter, including 3D audio and brisk 60 frames per second gameplay at 1080p. There's a whole new area, too, which will help tackle gripes that the original was too short. There's no word on a ship date, but it's safe to say this is good news if the game's mix of iconic graphics and memorable dance tracks (Adam Freeland's "Mind Killer," anyone?) is still etched in your brain.
