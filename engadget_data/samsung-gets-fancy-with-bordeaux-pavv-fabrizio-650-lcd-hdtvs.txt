All jesting aside (sort of...), the Bordeaux PAVV Fabrizio 650 lineup that just landed in Korea contains two newcomers: a 40- and 46-incher, both of which sport full 1080p panels and 120Hz dejudder technology. They also include DLNA support and an integrated USB port alongside four HDMI 1.3 sockets and your favorite glass of wine. There's no mention of a price or US release date, but those with friends in high places probably needn't worry.
