   Google may have had to deal with some less-than-positive Google Wallet news last month, but it was able to announce some progress of a different sort in the past couple of days. The first is an update to the Android app, which adds the ability to handle PO Boxes for prepaid card top-ups, along with a number of other fixes and improvements. The second, more significant news comes out of Mobile World Congress, where Google Wallet and Payments VP Osama Bedier revealed that the mobile payment service would be heading to "at least 10 additional phones" on Sprint this year -- no word on those specific phones, though. Details on any expansion plans beyond that also remain a bit light, with Bedier only saying that Google remains in talks with other carriers and device manufactures.
