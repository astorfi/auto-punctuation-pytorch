 After debuting them on iPad and Android, DirecTV has finally brought "Everywhere" features to the iPhone. That includes video on demand access to a number of shows and movies no matter where you are, as well as the in-home only live TV streaming feature previously seen on the iPad (but not on Android, yet.) DirecTV has also added its own exclusive Audience Network to the list of streaming channels which should add additional content to watch. The one drawback? Like many other TV provider apps, we're hearing this one isn't meant to work on jailbroken devices and after users update it won't even open, cutting off other features like DVR scheduling. If that's not a problem, grab version 2.2 at the source link below and input your DirecTV account info to get started.  [Thanks, Brian]
