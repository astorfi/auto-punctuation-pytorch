First the good news: Nearly two years after being announced, the ZD is here, and is making its wayinto the dealer channel. The bad news? Nearly two years after being announced, the ZD is here, and is making its wayinto the dealer channel -- at a price of about $12,000. Lens not included. Is it worth it? Let's just say that if youwant a 22-megapixel SLR with a full-frame CCD and compatiblity with Mamiya lenses, you don't have a lot of otherchoices (other than a digital back, that is). And we assume you've been using the last two years to save up for this,so laying down that cash should be no problem, right?
