 Forgive us if we are a little nostalgic of the days when companies would announce the availability of features, instead of just being certified to provide those features, but this is starting to be a trend. Maybe the BDA's certification process is so vigorous that the companies are more proud that it was able to achieve this certification, then to actually bringing the feature to their customers. Regardless, sometime during early 2008 -- isn't that today? -- PowerDVD customers will join the elite group of PS3 and Panasonic DMP-BD30 owners who can enjoy the latest Blu-ray titles with Picture-in-Picture.
