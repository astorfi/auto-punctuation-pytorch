Expected to garner fingerprints from every nationality at CES 2009, the LH95 will check in at just 24.8-millimeters thick (0.976-inches) and boast a 2,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio and the outfit's 240Hz TrueMotion Drive dejudder technology. No word on a price or release date (or panel size, oddly enough), but hopefully we'll find out more in just under a fortnight.[Via Boy Genius Report]
