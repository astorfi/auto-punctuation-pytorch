       Wired is reporting that according to a research study by iSupply, for the first time ever, the prices for LCD panels that are used to make all the LCD TVs we love, actually increased this past April. The sizes affected were on the TVs under 32-inches, and while we expect larger models to continue to drop in price, $500 for a 27-inch TV seems pretty cheap. Of course it is not as cheap as a CRT, but they have had 40 years to drop in price. So while we agree that we don't expect to see LCD TVs under 30-inches to drop in price by 50% per year anymore, we think that in the long run there is still some room for additional savings.
