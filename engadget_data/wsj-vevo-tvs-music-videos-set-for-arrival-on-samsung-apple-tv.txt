Internet music video provider Vevo launched its linear channel on mobile devices, Xbox 360 and Roku back in March, and according to the Wall Street Journal, it may arrive on the PS3, Apple TV (directly, AirPlay support came last week) and Samsung's Smart TV soon. After a rumor earlier this month from AdAge, the new report indicates deals with both Samsung and Apple are signed with a launch on the latter possible this week. That most of the people watching the streaming channel do so on TV-connected devices which, along with the desire to sell higher-priced TV ads is apparently behind the new push. The next moves for Vevo? Rolling out new channels that focus on specific genres or live music, renegotiating licenses for content, and off in the distance, perhaps a cable TV channel. For now, we'll just pencil in a shift to reality TV shows, dramas and other non-music programming for 2019 or so.
