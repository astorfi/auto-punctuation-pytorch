So far, only Three UK (after the break) and O2 have confirmed they'll be carrying the device when it arrives later in the year, while T-Mobile and Orange said they didn't have any details for us yet. Most cryptically, Vodafone's response was that it "isn't involved in this," so we figure we'll have to sit tight for more concrete news. If anything changes. we'll let you know. 

 Update: Vodafone's got back in touch to say they will be stocking the device when it lands on British shores.
