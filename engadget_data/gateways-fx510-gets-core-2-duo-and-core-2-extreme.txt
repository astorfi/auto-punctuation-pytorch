 So all of a sudden Gateway's FX510 series is getting the Core 2 boost (like any number of other boxes being announced today), with new models launching today featuring ATI Radeon x1900 CrossFire graphics options (wait, aren't those guys owned by Intel arch-rival AMD nowadays?) with a 2.93GHz Core 2 Extreme X6800 processor on the FX510XG or a 2.13GHz Core 2 Duo E6400 on the FX510XT, for $4,000 and $2,200, respectively. But that ain't all, you've got your RAID SATA II drive options, Creative X-Fi audio, gigs of RAM, bundled 21-inch FPD2185Ws, 16x dual-laer DVDÂ±RW drives, Viiv certified Media Center Edition 2005 installs, and so on, and so forth. In other words: meet the new high end, everybody.
