Apparently, Dell is toying with the idea of a 16-inch XPS laptop, and it's brought a concept version of the device to the floor of this year's show. What you're looking at above is a full HD laptop based on the M1530 design. The screen sports a stunning 1920 x 1080 resolution, which is powered by an NVIDIA 8600M graphics chipset. The folks at Notebook Review managed to get some pretty handsome photos of the new design (which is as-yet unannounced) before being "ushered away" from the display. Hopefully we can glean some more information as the CES wheels turn -- so stay tuned.
