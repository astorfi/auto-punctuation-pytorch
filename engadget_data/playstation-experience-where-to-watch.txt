       Sony's big PlayStation Experience event kicks off in San Francisco in less than an hour -- but if you're not in attendance, it'll still be easy to follow along. The whole event will be streamed on the PlayStation website or over on the PlayStation Twitch channel (you can find the video stream below!). We're not sure what exactly Sony will be announcing just yet, but we're expecting to hear a lot about PlayStation VR and hopefully some new games -- it's a two-hour keynote, so it seems safe to say Sony has a few big announcements up its sleeve. We'll also be reporting straight from the keynote and the show floor all day long, so stay tuned for all the news from PlayStation Experience today.
