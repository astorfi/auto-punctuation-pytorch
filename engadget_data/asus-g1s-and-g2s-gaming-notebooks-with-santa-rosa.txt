The Asus G1S and G2S are updates on the G1 and G2, and will come with Santa Rosa Core 2 Duo processors up to 2.2GHz. Both models get bumps in screen resolution, with the 15.4-inch widescreen G1S moving to the G2's 1680x1080 resolution, and the 17-inch G2S going for 1920x1200. Powering those multiple megapixel displays is an Nvidia GeForce 8600M with 256MB of video RAM, which gives these models the DirectX 10 compatibility which all the kids seem to want these days. Rounding out the specs is all the usual high-end laptop gear -- 2GB RAM, 160GB and 200GB HDDs, DVD burners, Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth -- which is just what you'd expect with the €1700 and €1900 ($2300 and $2560) pricetags. The source says that these numbers will hit on May 21, and judging by the Euro pricing information, we'd guess that they'll remain Europe only for now.
