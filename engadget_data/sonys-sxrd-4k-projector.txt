        So you've got all the friends over on Monday Night, but you're not watching the game, oh no, you're watching live broadcasts from the sea floor. Why?  Because it's in 4K fool, 4 times the resolution of high definition TV. The only way you could be doing that is if you have one of these.With an incredible resolution of 4096x2160, it's designed for screens up to 40 feet wide, so you may want to invite your neighbors since it's their house you'll be projecting on. Since you can't even find 1080p content yet, good luck finding something to watch. No price listed, but its intended for theater use and they're only making 100 of them a month, so I guess if you have to ask......
