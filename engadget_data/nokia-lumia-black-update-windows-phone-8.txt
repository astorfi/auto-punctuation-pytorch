Nokia, now under the Microsoft umbrella, will combine an incoming Windows Phone update with its own smartphone upgrades. Lumia Black is its name, and it'll bring the new, unified Nokia Camera, alongside Storyteller and Beamer apps found on the new Lumia 1520 and 1320, to existing high-end Windows Phone 8 (namely the 920 series and the 1020) -- soon. The company didn't specify a roll-out date, however. According to Elop: "This will happen later on, it won't happen immediately. Some of the key updates for Windows Phone are in GDR3, so the notifications... will come through across all devices and be combined together with the Black update."
