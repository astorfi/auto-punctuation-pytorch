Let's see, a new 8GB iPhone for every Apple employee, both full-time and temporary. That's 17,787 plus another 2,399 (according to Wikipedia) or so for a grand total of $12,091,414 retail. A bit less since only those temps who have been with the company for a year qualify. Still, nice one Steve. Sure, we've seen you do it before, but man, that's a lot of dough. We're just wondering who's going to cover the 2 year service costs?
