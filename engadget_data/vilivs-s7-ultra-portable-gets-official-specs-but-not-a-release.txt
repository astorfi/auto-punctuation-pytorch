Now at CES we're still in the dark about price (and availability), but are finally hearing just what's going on under the keyboard; Atom processors in 1.3GHz and 1.6GHz flavors, a 7-inch, 1024 x 600 screen, 1GB of RAM, and either 16GB worth of SSD or 60GB served up on platters. Wireless connectivity is handled over 802.11b/g, WiMAX, and HSDPA, and the device promises "blueray HD video playback" -- which we're taking to mean it can display 1080p footage without completely choking, but we're not sure just where that video would come from given the lack of optical drive. But, hey, look at that sexy picture! Rest assured we'll prop this up against a VAIO P as soon as we can get our hands on one. [Via UMPC Portal]
