The long-foretold i880 has finally graced Sprint-Nextel's pages, looking every bit as nifty as the blurry, covert spy shots that preceded its official introduction had us believing. Notable features include a 2 megapixel camera (particularly notable for Nextel, of all carriers), an MP3 player with stereo speakers, dual color displays, and external music controls. Sadly though, the i880 doesn't adhere to military specifications, so don't even think about taking this burgundy-colored beauty into a war zone.[Thanks, Nino]
