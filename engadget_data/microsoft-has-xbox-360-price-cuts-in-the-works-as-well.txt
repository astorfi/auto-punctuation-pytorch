Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter doesn't think so, and he's come out with predictions of price cuts across the board for the Xbox 360, in response to Sony's impending $100 PS3 slash. Michael expects the Elite to drop from $479 to $399, the Premium to sink from $399 to $349, and the Core to fall from $299 to $249. He seems to think it's connected with the Xbox 360 shipment shortage of late -- which could just as well be caused by a potential heatsink revamp, but his price-cut logic probably isn't far off either. Unfortunately for those of you waiting for a Nintendo console to make less of a dent in your wallet, Wedbush Morgan doesn't expect the Wii or DS prices to move by the end of the year, as sales remain strong for those two.[Thanks, Pachter]
