Another day, another phone gets update post. But this time, it's a smartwatch -- Samsung's Galaxy Gear -- that's party to a software refresh and it's going to bring you closer to that Go! Go! Gadget dream. According to Sammobile, an update to the Gear Manager app now lets you add nearly every type of notification for display on your wrist. So, you won't need to trawl forums any longer for an unofficial workaround. There's even an option to open a particular notification on your associated smartphone. In all, it's really nothing revolutionary and it in no way makes the case for a smartwatch purchase. But if you took the plunge and bought a Gear, it's just one more thing you can do for $300.
