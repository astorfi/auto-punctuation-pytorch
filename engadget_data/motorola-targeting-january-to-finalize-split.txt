 Though Sanjay Jha is clearly the more visible of Motorola's two co-CEOs, it was his stealthier counterpart, Greg Brown, who mentioned during an analyst conference today that they're looking to wrap up the company's split in January of next year. Brown had already been tapped to head up Motorola Solutions -- one half of the post-split aftermath with $5.3 billion in cash and $2.9 billion in debt -- and he's saying that his company's independent identity "effectively starts today." The handset guys over at Motorola Mobility, meanwhile, have been filing devices with the FCC under their post-split name for a while, but let's be honest: we're still going to know all this stuff as "Motorola"... and that's probably exactly how they want it.
