He saw a concept pair of pants with a functioning keyboard, and proceeded to make his very own. Essentially, he chopped a keyboard in half, then used a laser cutter and some good old fashioned sewing to get the keys into the trousers. Because the board had been cut in half, only the left side of it still functions, but, as you'll see from the video after the break, that's good enough for a game of Tetris.
