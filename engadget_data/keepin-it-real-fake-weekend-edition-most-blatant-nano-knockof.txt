Well meet the $200 "iPod nano 2GB," whosestriking differences from Apple's product of the same name arehelpfully delineated by its Chicago Craigslist seller, all [sic]: "Note that the wheel for these nano is notoperated by touching the wheel, the wheel is actually bottons and must be clicked for selecting files and video or evenfunctions you will be clicking the wheel to navigate within the nano. Also, The earphone connect from the side and notfrom the bottom of the nano." So besides the headphone jack "upgrade," this i-Bob lookalike also plays back video, and may even come inwhat seems to be a genuine Apple nano box. Thanks, guys, but even video playback and a resituated jack could never breakSteve J.'s incredibly powerful hold over us.Update: The read link is apparently dead now, which is fine by us. Apple lawyers (or Newmark'sarmy): 1 (yes folks, just like us, they work weekends), Shady resellers: 0.[Thanks, Michael]
