 Linksys busted out a new pre-N wireless router today, the WRT350N Wireless-N Gigabit Router with Storage Link. They're claiming wireless throughput speeds of up to 12 times 802.11g with this thing (your mileage can, and almost certainly will, vary), but if you're pushing high-def video around the house you'll take all the bandwidth you can get, right? To sweeten the deal, the WRT350N also includes a wired Gigabit switch (which is still somewhat rare in a consumer-grade router) and a USB port that'll let you turn any external USB mass storage drive into a plug-and-play Network Attached Storage device. Looks like they're shipping this thing now (or at least very soon) with a street price of $120.Update: Whoops, we knew that price sounded too good to be true. The actual MSRP is $249.Update 2: Geez, you wouldn't think that pricing on a router would be this hard to nail down. Now the word from Linksys is that the WRT350N will set you back only $229. Stay tuned for more price corrections as we receive them.
