She also confirmed the previous October ship target -- that being the timeframe that consumers can expect to pick up a Windows 8-equipped machine, or presumably upgrade from a previous version of the OS. There's not much to report beyond that -- manufacturers will see Windows 8 next month, while the rest of us will need to hang tight until the fall.
