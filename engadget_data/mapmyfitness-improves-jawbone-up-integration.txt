There are almost as many ways to monitor your fitness these days, as there are ways to get fit. While most hardware trackers come with their own solution to present your (hard-earned) data, some users prefer to keep it elsewhere. If that happens to be MapMyFitness, then good news -- there's full two-way sync for Jawbone UP, as well as Nike FuelBand support. Jawbone's UP has had API hooks with MapMyFitness for a while, but now workouts etc. can be pushed in either direction, so all those steps can be viewed online (though not your sleep, or manually logged workouts). It's a similar story with FuelBand, while the Nike+ app and watch have played nice with the services, the wearable was notably absent -- until now. Set up is easy, just head to the import section of your account and link them up. Sadly, so easy, you won't earn any fuel points.

Austin, TX – August 15, 2013 – MapMyFitness is excited to announce a 2-way integration with UP by Jawbone, a wristband and app system that helps you know yourself so you can make smarter choices and feel your best. This integration will allow you to import workout data from UP directly into MapMyFitness. MapMyFitness was selected as one of the first apps to be welcomed into the UP Platform. Now you can seamlessly sync workout data both ways – from the MapMyFitness app into UP, or directly from UP into MapMyFitness.Importing workout data from UP is as simple as connecting your UP account to your MapMyFitness account. Visit the import dashboard, then enter your login credentials for UP. Once you authorize the connection, you'll see your workouts from UP populate into your workout history. This import will populate entire day's worth of steps as a single 'Walk' workout. Once you have connected UP to MapMyFitness, your activity will be pulled into your MapMyFitness account each night.Also added to our list of supported devices is the Nike+ FuelBand. The Nike+ FuelBand uses a sports-tested accelerometer to measure your movement throughout the day. With the recently updated Nike+ API, MapMyFitness is one of the first platforms to allow users to import data from both the Nike+ app and FuelBand.

Similar to other devices, you can link your Nike+ account to automatically import your workouts into MapMyFitness. Visit the import dashboard, log in to your Nike+ account and authorize MapMyFitness to retrieve your Nike+ workouts (the same process as the Jawbone UP). Once connected, your workouts will automatically sync nightly. For users who log both runs with the Nike+ app and also import FuelBand points, these will import into the MapMyFitness platform as two separate workouts. One specifically attached to your workout (steps, distance, pace) and then an all-day 'Walk' activity highlighting your steps throughout the day.

All-day activity tracking is a feature our users have requested, and partnering with innovators such as Jawbone and Nike has allowed us to now populate all of your daily steps into one workout. This information (now populated into your MapMyFitness workout history) will help keep our users motivated and aware of their progress. These integrations highlight how MapMyFitness continues to promote an open platform, allowing our growing community worldwide to use the devices they love as they monitor and improve their health and fitness.MapMyFitness has an active community of over 18 million members and is the largest social fitness company allowing users worldwide to create and meet goals, compete with each other and engage in new ways through innovative web and mobile technology. With an open platform, MapMyFitness recognizes the importance of device variations and allows each user to sync whichever device they are using into our ecosystem. Incorporation of these devices will add to the over 700K activities routes and nutrition logs submitted each day.*At this time we do not currently support importing sleep data or manually logged workouts from the Jawbone UP. We also will not store "fuel points" from the Nike FuelBand; rather we will convert this activity into steps.
