Good, then sit down for a moment: we're hearing from a trusted source that the thoroughly-leaked Motorola Droid 2 for Verizon will be launching on August 12 -- although it seems to be something of a soft launch, because marketing efforts aren't scheduled to kick in until a week and a half later on the 23rd. What's even more interesting, though, is that there'll be a Star Wars edition of the phone launching with a white R2-D2 on the back. For the record, this isn't the first time Verizon has toyed with the Droid line's Star Wars origins; Motorola actually had to license the name from Lucasfilm, and to promote the original phone, Big Red sent around remote-control Artoos last year to various media outlets. What we don't know is whether the special edition will be launching at the same time as the stock version -- so if the plain-vanilla Droid 2 comes out first, that might automatically make the decision of which to buy for some folks. What about you?
