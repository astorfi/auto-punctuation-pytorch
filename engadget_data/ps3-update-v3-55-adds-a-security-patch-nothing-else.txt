 
Another day, another annoying distraction when you turn on your PlayStation 3. Prepare to be prompted to update your machine, version 3.55 hitting the internets and offering a single thing: "a security patch." No word on exactly which holes are being spackled over or how long it'll take for modders to drill them back out again, but be sure to pledge your allegiance and update today, so that you can be better prepared to update again tomorrow.
