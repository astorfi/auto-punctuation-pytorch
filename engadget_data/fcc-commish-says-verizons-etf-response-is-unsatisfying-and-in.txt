Her choicest quote is that she found Verizon's answers "unsatisfying and, in some cases, troubling," noting that customers are already paying "high" monthly fees and suggesting that the public interest isn't being served when someone gets slammed with a three-digit cancellation charge mid-contract. She also straight-up calls the company out on its claim that customers aren't being inadvertently charged when the press the web button on their phone without an appropriate plan, saying that "press reports and consumer complaints strongly suggest otherwise." Commissioner Clyburn's conclusion? "I look forward to exploring this issue in greater depth with my colleagues in the New Year." Dum dum dummmmm. Follow the break for the full text of the letter.

[Thanks, Daniel P.]
