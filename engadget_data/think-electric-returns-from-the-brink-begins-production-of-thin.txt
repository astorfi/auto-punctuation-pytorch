Well, kids, dreams do come true -- or production lines can be started again, at least -- and after securing some funding earlier this year, the company has now announced that its two-seat Think City electric vehicle is now back on track for a release by the end of the year. That initial production run will apparently consist primarily of 2,300 cars that have already been pre-ordered in Europe, but Think Electric says it also plans to begin selling the car in the U.S. sometime next year, and license its electric power train to other automakers looking for a readymade option.
