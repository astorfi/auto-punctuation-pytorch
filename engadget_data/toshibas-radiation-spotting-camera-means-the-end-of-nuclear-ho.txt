Since the deadly particles / waves gather together in clumps, cleanup crews have to hunt around blind using geiger counters. The "Portable Gamma Camera" overlays data from a radiation sensor onto a live picture -- areas shaded with red pixels have high radiation, yellow and green is medium and blue is low. Simply point it where you think the trouble is and it'll show you exactly where to avoid. A prototype was used during the initial stages of the Fukushima cleanup and this model's around half the size and it can even run on batteries -- giving you three hours of lifesaving radiation detection.
