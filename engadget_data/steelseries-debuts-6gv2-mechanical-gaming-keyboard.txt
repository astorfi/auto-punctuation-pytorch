 
The clickety-clack of a mechanical keyboard may not be for everyone, but there's a sizable group that will accept no substitute, and SteelSeries now has yet another model for them to consider in the form of its new 6Gv2 gaming keyboard. Nothing but business here, with the keyboard passing over things like media keys and a USB hub in favor of more performance-oriented features like 18-karat gold-plated mechanical switches, and "anti-ghosting" technology to give gamers every possible advantage. Still no firm word on a ship date, but you can get your pre-order in now for $99.99.
