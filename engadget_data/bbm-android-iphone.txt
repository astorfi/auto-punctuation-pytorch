A new dedicated page with the banner "BBM for Android and iPhone is here," appeared under the company's Canadian domain this morning, along with an inactive link to download BBM for Android and another for iPhone. Further down the page are references to additional features that won't be included at launch, such as BBM Voice, BBM Video and screen sharing features, which instead are expected this fall. The page has since been removed, but it may reappear any minute/hour/day now at the source link below.

[Thanks, Felix]
