We don't know. We tried spoofing the iPhone user agent to no avail, so it looks like we'll have to wait another couple of days before we find out whether Apple's rolled out a web RSS reader for mobile Safari users, or whether this is all just a big tease. But man, this might almost be as good as the RSS button on that Samsung phone.[Thanks, Sean]
