The lack of HD Star Trek broadcasts is simply because most stations don't have space to store the episodes before they're aired several days later, but whenever the equipment is ready, the episodes will be as well. They're promising to remain faithful to the original series, and not to change any key elements in the programs, just adding things like a missing phaser beam, a new CGI Enterprise for external shots, and an updated picture of Earth. The show will be broadcast in 4x3, with 40 episodes shown each year. It will take about a year to remaster all 79 episodes, which begin airing September 16th, with "Balance of Terror".[Thanks, Tom]Read - Enterprise Wasn't Bumped for Trek, Says Nogawski - Broadcasting & CableRead - TOS Remastered - The Trek Movie Report
