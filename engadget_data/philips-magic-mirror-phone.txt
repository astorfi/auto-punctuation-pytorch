For the narcissists in the house, Philips new 639 cellphone has a
special PolyLED external screen that transforms into a mirror and can also dispay animations and caller ID:



Philips has applied PolyLED technology in the Philips 639's sensational 'Magic Mirror' display screen on the
 outside of the phone's clamshell design. With the phone in standby mode, the display provides a clear mirror – ideal
 for consumers who need to check their appearance on the move. As soon as the phone receives a call or a message, the
 mirror becomes the display. This can be further discovered on the phone's primary high-resolution 65K colors TFT
 display. The Magic Mirror is also a versatile display screen, capable of showing a variety of animations. The display
 also provides a unique 'window' on incoming calls: the Mirror feature or the identity of a caller can be seen through
 the mirror with the phone's new IconCall feature which allows fast, easy identification.
