The good lads over at NewGadgets have managed to secure one over in Germany, and while their version doesn't ship with an extended battery, it's still worth taking a look at. Trust us. It's waiting for you after the break, and if you're new to all of this, that giant "Play" button that'll appear is what you'll want to press.
