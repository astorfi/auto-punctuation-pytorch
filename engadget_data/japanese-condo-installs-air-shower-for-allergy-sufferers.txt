 We've seen condominiumsoffer numerous perks to attract different demographics before -- gyms for the fitness-minded, hot tubs for theparty-minded, laundry services for the dirty and lazy -- but we've never heard of one playing up a feature to targetallergy sufferers. Well Japanese complex Riche Tamagawa Riverside has had enough of the sneezing, congestion and rednoses that must have been running rampant throughout the building, as employees recently installed an"air-shower" near one of the entrances that blows dust, pollen and other allergens right off residents'clothing. Frequent travelers may be familiar with these compressed-air showers from certain airport security screeningstations, where the machines are used not to keep your flight sniffle-free but to ensure that you weren't playingaround with explosives before boarding. The 12-nozzle system at the Tokyo location has proven so popular that buildingowners are considering deploying the units to other housing developments as well, causing hay fever sufferers torejoice but those with high-maintenance hairdos to recoil in horror.
