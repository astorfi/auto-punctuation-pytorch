 It doesn't look like any open letter to the industry by Jobs is going to halt the unrelenting European pressure on Apple to open FairPlay and make iTunes interoperable, especially not now that the matter has officially caught the attention of European Union consumer chief Meglena Kuneva. Joining in the cacophony of dialogue ranging from end users to European nations France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, Kuneva told German rag Focus, "Do you think it's fine that a CD plays in all CD players but that an iTunes song only plays in an iPod? I don't. Something has to change." While it's been said that Kuneva's quote only represents her personal opinion on the matter and not an official stance or EU policy, we don't think it really matters a whole lot. It's pretty clear where Europe (and now the EU) is going with all this. The tides are shifting, and now we're all just waiting for the first shot to be fired. (No, we're not really counting France last year.)
