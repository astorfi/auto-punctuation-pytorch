The E7 is running a stout $679 -- and that's not through a third party, that's Amazon's direct price for an official American version of the phone with a full manufacturer warranty. Feels pricey to us, but Amazon's pricing tends to fluctuate fairly regularly, so we wouldn't be at all surprised to see this fall a bit by the time the phone actually ships -- and if Espoo announces the rumored MeeGo-powered N9 by the time the E7's available, they might need to discount it a whole lot.
