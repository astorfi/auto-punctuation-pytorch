The Quantum Break tagline is, "Time is the fire in which we burn." The teaser video opens with a live-action family preparing to leave their house, and a little girl with some sort of special power. The game footage shows a ship as it crashes into a large bridge â€“ and then time stops and reverses.

"The actions you take and the choices you make shape your experience as the story unfolds," Spencer said.
