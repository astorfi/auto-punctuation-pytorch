 During today's shareholders meeting, RIM CEO Thorsten Heins threw out terms like "streamlining," noting his plans to help make the Canadian smartphone maker a "lean, mean hunting machine." The plan includes limited the company's production sites, decreasing the workforce (with earlier layoffs he referred to as "an incredibly difficult decision to make" during the meeting) and focusing on a smaller number of devices. BlackBerry 10 will launch with a touchscreen device aimed at addressing the needs of the North American market, to be followed shortly after by a full QWERTY device.
