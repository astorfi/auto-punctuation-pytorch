And moreover, something that has never, ever worked out. Every single Windows 7 tablet that we've tested has suffered a similar fate: too bulky, too sluggish, not longevous enough and too difficult to to operate sans a keyboard and mouse. That said, Lenovo's providing a darkhorse option for those uninterested in its duo of new Honeycomb tablets, with the IdeaPad Tablet P1 bringing Windows 7 into a familiar 10.1-inch shell. Within, you'll find a 1.5GHz Intel processor, a 1280 x 800 capacitive touchpanel, up to 2GB of DDR2 memory, up to 64GB of SSD storage, built-in Bluetooth / 3G / WiFi, a USB 2.0 connector, microSD card slot and a docking port.

You'll also get an integrated 2 megapixel webcam up front, support for stylus input and an enclosure that's 14.5mm thick; for perspective, the absolutely delectable Galaxy Tab 10.1 measures just 10.9mm from top to bottom. The company's giving you the option of snagging this in silver-gray or "Clementine Orange," the latter of which is obviously the frontrunner in the race to awesome. The sealed two-cell battery is said to be good for six hours of use, compared to the 8.7 hours that the same cell gets while situated in the Android-powered K1. Lenovo's not serving up pricing details on this one just yet, but you can look forward to not looking forward to its Q4 2011 arrival.
