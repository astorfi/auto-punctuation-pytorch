Acer's new Iconia Tab A500 doesn't really stray from the Tegra 2 norm when it comes to internal specs, but it does have that brushed aluminum back, a full-sized USB 2.0 port, and a sane $450 price point going for it. You'll get 16GB of storage and 802.11b/g/n WiFi connectivity for your money, though ASUS' similarly outfitted Eee Pad Transformer should also be prominent on your radar as it'll ask for an even humbler $399 when it makes its slightly delayed US launch tomorrow. Let's hope the arrival of these Taiwanese cousins nudges other Android tablets makers into engaging in a bit of price competition, eh?
