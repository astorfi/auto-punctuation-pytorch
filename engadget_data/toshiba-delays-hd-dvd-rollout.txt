 The biggest surprise here, is that the "no sh** Sherlock" reaction to the delay of Sony'sPlaystation 3 has already been trumped twice in two days. We can't decide if this is more obvious than Microsoft'sso-predictable Windows Vista delay(yep, they're still Microsoft), but Toshiba has decided to wait to ship their HD-DVD player until there are actuallyHD-DVD movies to play on them. Now this is where you show how surprised you are, don't worry, we'll wait.Ready? Ok, although Toshiba has not announced a new date, Warner expects to have titles on store shelves April 18th,so through the power of the cosmos, telekinesis and Google, we predict we'll see players.....April 18th. Sometimes wesurprise ourselves with our abilities.
