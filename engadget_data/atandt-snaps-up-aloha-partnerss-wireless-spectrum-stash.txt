 It looks like AT&T sure is serious about expanding its network, with the company now following up its recent purchase of Dobson Communications with an acquisition of a stash of spectrum from Providence, R.I.-based Aloha Partners LP, the largest owner of 700MHz spectrum in the US (and parent company of mobile TV firm HiWire). According to The Wall Street Journal, the deal totals some $2.5 billion, and includes spectrum covering 72 of the United States' top 100 markets, covering about 196 million people in all. No word on how this will affect T-Mobile's current arrangement with HiWire, or HiWire itself, for that matter, but we suspect there'll be some rather, um, interesting discussions going on behind the scenes.
