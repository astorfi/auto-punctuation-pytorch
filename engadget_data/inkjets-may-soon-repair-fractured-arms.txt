Scientists at the University of Manchester in England think they'll soon be able to repair fractured arms and help
other medical conditions by using inkjet nozzles that spray live human cells onto the patient.  The technology is
being developed in cooperation with British inkjet manufacturer Xaar who are refining their equipment for human cell
delivery.  While bone replacement will likely be the first application put into use, they are also working on
tissue engineering cartilage and blood vessels.  They are cautious to point out, however, that a lot more work
still needs to be done in order to ensure that the cells are not altered in some way by the delivery process.
