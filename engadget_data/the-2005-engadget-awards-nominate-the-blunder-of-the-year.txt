 
It’s time for the 2005 Engadget Awards, and we’re askingfor your nominations for the Blunder of the Year. Nominating is easy. Just leave a comment as you normallywould with what you're nominating for this category (remember, comments must be validated!). You don’t have toinclude your reasons for nominating it or any of that stuff, just leaving the name is fine. Limit yournominations only to corporate, device-related, or otherwise, that occurred in 2005. Also, these blundersonly need to be nominated once to be in the running, so if you’re planning on suggesting something, please make aquick scan to see if someone’s already beat you to it (i.e., please don't nominate anything more thanonce!). Thanks!
