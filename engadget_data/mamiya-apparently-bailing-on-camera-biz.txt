  It looks like another venerable Japanese camera company is about to exit the business, just weeks after Konica Minolta produced its last camera. According to reports out of Japan (which we've confirmed with our Japanese bureau), Mamiya, best known for its high-end pro equipment, will be selling off its film and digital camera business to focus on other sectors. The company apparently has had "stagnant sales" of its digital models, including its 22-megapixel, $12,000, Mamiya ZD, which was released in Japan in December and in Europe just last month. The buyer is apparently Cosmos Scientific, a Japanese company better known for its IT business than for any expertise in digital imaging. As of now, it looks like the deal is set to close on September 1. We'll keep you posted as we get further details.
