The folks in Mountain View have been adding new tools to Google Now, like suggesting another flight if yours is delayed. The search company's Field Trip app has been suggesting local points of interest since its launch in 2012, and now the two are in cahoots. Now already displayed a list of nearby sights, but with a recent update, the other app's more detailed info on art, architecture and more is automatically beamed to your mobile device. So when you're out of town, expect to see a few more recommended cards in that feed to entice you to change those plans.
