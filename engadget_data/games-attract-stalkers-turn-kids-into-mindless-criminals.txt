As explained in thebreathless tone common on TV news programs, the WiFi networking built into the Nintendo DS can "lure unsuspectingchildren to dangerous places." According to a report aired by ABC-TV's Action News in Philadelphia, an 11-year-oldgirl using the DS's Pictochat program was propositioned several times by men asking questions about her age and gender.An "internet safety expert" warns viewers: "Predators are using Nintendo DS anywhere in the world."Action News does point out later in the broadcast that anyone chatting via PictoChat on a DS needs to be within range,and must also be using a DS, making it potentially easier to nab potential stalkers than it is via, say, online chatrooms (though we do have to admit that it is a little creepy, since the stalker is right there with the kid, as opposedto being thousands of miles away). Gamers facing opprobrium can at least take some comfort in the fact that the fear ofgames is a global phenomenon; a recent report out of Korea warned that games are turning kids into antisocialcriminals. An article in the Chosun Ilbo newspaper warns that gamers "can become incapable of discriminatingbetween reality and virtual reality, and thus tend to be more violent and, in the end, more likely to commitcrimes."
