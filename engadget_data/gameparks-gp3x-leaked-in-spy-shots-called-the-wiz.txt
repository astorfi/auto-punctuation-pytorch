According to a post on GP2X News, the new system (which is being called the "Wiz") isn't set in stone, but will contain some form of a system-on-a-chip, and apparently will allow GP2X emulators to run after a bit of recompiling. There's not a whole lot of information available right now, but we'll keep you posted -- in the meantime, enjoy the photo.[Via GP2X News]
