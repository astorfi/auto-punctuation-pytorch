 It's hardly news thatDell has been bundling Google software with PCs, or that the default home page for browsers shipped on some Dell PCs isa co-branded version of Google. Now, however, the two companies are reportedly about to get chummy in an even biggerway. According to reports, Google is hoping to get its software, including the Google Toolbar and Google DesktopSearch, preinstalled on up to 100 million Dell PCs, and may be willing to pay as much as a billion dollars for theprivilege. Given Google's previous denials about the possibility of rolling out a G-PC, this might be asclose as you're going to get to that Google-branded box you've been dreaming about (and, yes, it'll be running Windows,rather than Goobuntu).[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
