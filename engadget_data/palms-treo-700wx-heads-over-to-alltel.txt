 Okay, we'll spare you the pictures, videos, launch materials, and Sprint's bragging rights -- the Palm Treo 700wx is coming to Alltel. Aside from knocking the Sprint logo off the top right corner, and upping the Windows Mobile version from 5.0 to 5.2, everything else remains the same on this sucka. Per usual, this one plays nice with CDMA, touts 1xRTT / EV-DO connectivity, and rocks a 1.3-megapixel camera, Bluetooth 1.2, QWERTY keyboard, MMC / SD / SDIO expansion slot, 128MB of built-in memory, speakerphone, IR, and support for DUN. Alltel also throws in ActiveSync 4.2, Microsoft's Office suite, and Picsel's PDF viewer as well. Interestingly, Alltel's saving new customers an extra $150 right off the bat, as it only charges $349.99 (compared to Sprint's $499.99) with a two-year agreement, but those looking to pick this up at retail will be forced to throw down $669.99.[Thanks, Steve]
