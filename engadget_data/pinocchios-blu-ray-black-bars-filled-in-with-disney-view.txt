       The 70th Anniversary release of Disney's Pinocchio on March10 marks yet another first for the studio, as the Blu-ray edition fills in the widescreen frame with (optional) decorative bars dubbed Disney View. Since simply picking up an ultra widescreen LCD wouldn't help, Disney has opted for 16 sets of watercolor artwork to frame the picture, depending on the scene. Next up for the treatment is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and given the positive reviews for Pinocchio's picture quality, it looks like a good way to compromise between those of us who are happy to watch the movie the "right" way, and those who can't stand empty space caused by the the film's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio.Read - Disney spruces up Pinocchio Blu-rayRead - SoundtrackNet Review
