The Palm Pre Plus will ship with twice the internal memory of the original (up to 16GB), a standard induction cover for Touchstone charging (it was an option before), an omitted navigation button on the front panel (to keep it clean, we guess) and a Big Red logo. You heard right, this one's hitting Verizon Wireless on January 25th! We're still waiting to hear back on a price, but we'll be sure to pass it on as soon as that goes official.

Update: Video's after the break!
