We're not keeping score, but we believe that Verizon's FIOS is the last hold out. Only the most devout HD baseball fan would switch providers just to watch the playoff in HD, but we're sure there will be a few; especially if Verizon continues to extend this six month HD dry spell while every other provider is adding HD channels at a record pace.
