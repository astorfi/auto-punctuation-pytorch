  While those lucky beta testers managed to get a healthy lump of extra Dropbox storage for their efforts, the mobile app's new auto-upload feature has officially arrived. The update is now available on Android devices and we're promised that the Apple-flavored update will appear very soon. We've been playing with the beta for the last few weeks, and it's pretty simple stuff, maintaining the file size of your mobile shots and delivering them to Dropbox's storage in the sky. You can toggle the auto-upload feature, or assign it for use only when there's an available WiFi connection. For anyone that hasn't got into the free cloud storage race game just yet, you can hit up the Android Market link below.
