No, this Tegra 2-powered slate has been rebranded as the Camangi Mangrove 7 for a mid-August Japanese release, sporting an estimated retail price of 49,800 yen (about $615). Aside form the name, not much is new here, but you can expect 8GB of storage and 1GB of DDR2 RAM. Here's hoping the Mangrove 7 outperforms Camangi's last 7-inch affair. Unfortunately, there's still no word on when the ViewPad 7x will make its American debut, or how much it will cost when it arrives, but we'll keep you posted.
