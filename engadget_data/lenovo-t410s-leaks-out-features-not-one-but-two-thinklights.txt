 
Two Lenovo leaks in one day? Our cup runneth over. It feels like we just played with the T400s and the T400s touch just yesterday, but we did see some leaked slides forecasting a T410s for January back in June, so these images are basically right on schedule. Big changes include a couple more USB ports here and there, some cleaned-up design, and -- big news -- the addition of a second display-mounted ThinkLight keyboard light. That's simply decadence, friends. No word on specs, pricing or a release date, but we've got a feeling we'll be finding out more real soon.

[Thanks, Adam]
