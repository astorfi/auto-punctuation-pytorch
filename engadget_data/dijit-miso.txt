 Having already declared war on the grid, TV remote / guide app maker Dijit is taking GoMiso under its wing. The company announced via its site that it's in the process of acquiring the social TV developer. The move will incorporate more discovery into Dijit's offerings. The company has announced intentions to keep the Miso and Sideshow apps around, as well as GoMiso founder, Somrat Niyogi, who is coming on as an advisor. Quips, on the other hand, is now on the chopping block -- at least it'll have some clever last words, no doubt.
