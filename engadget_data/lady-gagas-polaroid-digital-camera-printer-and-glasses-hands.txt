The Haus of Gaga-designed Grey Label product is indeed coming out, but the prototype at the company's CES booth lacked the ability for the wearer to see anything out of it -- then again, it's not clear we're ever supposed to, even after its release later this year. The GL30 digital camera was also non-functional, so all we can say right now is it's a design great for making a big, conspicuous statement. On the other hand, the GL10 printer does work, but it's a printer -- eh, nothing else we can say. Curse us for succumbing to a Lady Gaga pun in the eleventh hour and check the pictures below.
