 
Like the steady hand on your wristwatch, Sharp is arriving at CES with a handful of new television sets... so let's get on with the show! This year, the Aquos LED LCD TV series is touting an impressive 1.6-inch thin frame, Energy Start Version 4 compliancy, and "four primary color technology" -- in a nutshell, it's a "RGB-meet-Y for yellow" world. The LE920 flagship series comes in 52, 60, and 68-inch models with Aquomotion 240 and edge-lit LED; those are due in May with prices listed firmly as TBD. The LE820/810 series hits the slightly tinier, 60, 52, 46, and 40-inch screen size markets and boasts 120Hz frame rate conversion and 4ms response time. They're slightly more within your reach, debuting in March with prices ranging between $1,800 and $4,000. Looking for something even faster? Meet the 60-inch E88UN with a 240Hz refresh rate alongside a X-Gen panel -- mum's the word on pricing, but it'll be the first of these out, in February. Presser after the break.

Premiering in the U.S. in early 2010, this next-generation set of UltraBrilliant Edge-lit AQUOS LED LCD TVs unveils a revolutionary technology, introducing never-before-seen colors to the TV industry. Unveiled by the company at the 2010 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Sharp's proprietary four-primary-color technology enables more than a trillion colors to be displayed for more sparkling golds, Caribbean blues and sunflower yellows."As a pioneer in the LCD industry, Sharp continues to advance the technology, introducing it's first LED-backlight LCD TV on the market less than two years ago and paving the way for larger screen sizes, thin designs and Internet connectivity," said Mikio Katayama, president and chief operating officer, Sharp Corporation. "We have changed the way an LCD TV produces an image with the new four-primary-color technology, allowing us to broaden the visual experience and immerse consumers in a new world of color."Four Primary Color TechnologyThis four-primary-color display employs a four-color filter, for the first time in the industry, that adds the color Y (yellow) to the three colors of R (red), G (green), and B (blue). This combination expands the color gamut, faithfully rendering nearly all colors that can be discerned with the unaided human eye. Four-primary-color technology enables the display to reproduce colors that have been difficult to portray using conventional LCD displays, such as the golden yellow color of brass instruments.When combined with Sharp's 1080p X-Gen LCD panel, which incorporates UV2A Technology, the displays offer dramatic reduction in energy consumption compared to conventional fluorescent-backlight LCD TVs. Continuing Sharp's history of innovation and originality, the new AQUOS LEDs offer a stunning new contemporary design that pushes the envelope for flat-screen television artistry. At only 1.6-inches thin, the full-front panel glass (on the LE920 and LE820 series) extends to meet the slim border for a subtle edge that befits the elegance of a modern home theater.These advanced AQUOS LED LCD TVs also include Sharp's newest version of AQUOS Net, which delivers streaming video with Netflix®. AQUOS Net gives users instant access to customized Web-based content as well as AQUOS Advantage Live real-time customer support. The new AQUOS LED LCD TV product lines are all compliant with Energy Star® Version 4.0 standards which become effective in May 2010 and are equipped with Sharp's OPC function that automatically adjusts the unit's brightness based on the lighting of the room.
