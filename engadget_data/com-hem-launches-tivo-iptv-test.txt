The box promises participants the usual suite of TiVo features, including support for TiVoToGo and simultaneous DVR recording of up to three HD channels. The handful of participants who were at the launch event seem pretty jazzed, though updates quickly came to a halt as they settled in for some weekend TV time. Care to read up?
