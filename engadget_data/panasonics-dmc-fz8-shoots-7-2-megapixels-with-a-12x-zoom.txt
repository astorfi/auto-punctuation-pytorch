We'll brings you all of 'em later but let's get busy with the biggest news of the bunch first, the DMC-FZ8 -- heir apparent to the hotly reviewed DMC-FZ7. Positioned right in that gap between high-end compacts and DSLRs, the new FZ8 features Panny's Venus Engine III image processor and delivers a 7.2 megapixel CCD sensor, 12x LEICA DC VARIO-ELMARIT optical zoom lens, optical image stabilization, RAW file format support, ISO 1250 sensitivity, an SDHC memory card slot, and the ability to shoot 848 x 480 video at 30fps. It's at the ready with a 1.8 second startup time, 0.005 second shutter release lag, and a burst mode that shoots at a rate of 3 frames per second at full resolution until your memory card is full or the 380-shot battery gives up the ghost. Available in March for a righteous $349.[Via LetsGoDigital, Thanks David]
