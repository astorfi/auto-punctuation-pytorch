 It's only been about a week since the Ascend D2's official debut at CES, but according to Huawei's latest announcement on Sina Weibo, the manufacturer will already be offering its unsubsidized 5-inch 1080p flagship at its online store right after 5pm local time tomorrow. Specifically, this will be a China Telecom (CDMA2000) variant with dual-SIM support, so Huawei fans outside China may want to wait for the WCDMA flavor (there's always the Oppo Find 5 as well). If you happen to be in China and don't mind using China Telecom, then feel free to fork out Â¥3,990 or about $640 to be one of the first handful of owners of this 32GB, 1.5GHz quad-core device. That is, if you manage to get your order through "while stocks last."
