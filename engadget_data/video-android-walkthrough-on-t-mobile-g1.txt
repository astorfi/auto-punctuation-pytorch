This includes Search, Maps, Gmail and Contacts, Calendar, Google Talk and You Tube all enabled with a single sign-on -- no further logins are required. The fact that these are fully synchronized to the web negates the need for a desktop application. Nice. Amazon MP3 store, IMing, Street View compass mode and plenty more highlighted in the videos posted after the break.
