We're back in Japan for this year's Tokyo Game Show, and obviously we'll be getting intimate with the closer-to-final PlayStation Vita along with, hopefully, some of its just announced launch titles. While Nintendo's absent as usual (though it did throw its own party on Tuesday), we're still expecting some fresh goodies from the Xbox and PlayStation folks that should keep us entertained for awhile, plus we'll be scanning the show floor for the eccentric peripherals and other odd pieces, so wish us luck. Oh, and be sure to also check out our sister site Joystiq to get your extra dosage of TGS -- you know you want it.

To follow all the action from TGS, use the tag TGS 2011.
