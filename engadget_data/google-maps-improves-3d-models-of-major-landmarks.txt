  Google Maps has long sported 3D models of major world landmarks. Some of them, however, left something to be desired. For example, the Piazza del Duomo in Florence was missing its signature domes. Now it's been drastically improved with a series of smooth shaded roofs. Plenty of other landmarks have also been revamped, including the Sydney Opera House, White House and the Petronas Towers. Sadly, there's word as to when or if the new models will land in the mobile version. To check them out yourself hit up the source link.
