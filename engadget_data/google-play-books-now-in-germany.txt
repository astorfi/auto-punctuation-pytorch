Yes, those in Deutschland may now buy and read titles from Google Play Books on their Android or iOS device of choice, and access the service via the web. In addition to Germany, Google's online bookstore is currently open for business in Australia, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. While the company has yet to disclose future markets for expansion, we hear the Bordeaux region is quite beautiful this time of year.

 Update: They say Spain is a lovely destination too.
