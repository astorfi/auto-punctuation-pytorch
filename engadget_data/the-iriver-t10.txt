All we had before were some leaked specs and cruddy illo
pulled from a presentation, but iRiver has finally launched the T10, a new wearable flash-based MP3 player with a
1.1-inch, 64,000 color LCD screen that comes complete with a clip so you can attach the player to your belt or bag or
wear it around your neck like a pendant. Comes in three fruity flavors: Lime Green (256MB), Cherry Red (512MB), and
Orange Yellow (1GB).Â  Also has a built-in FM tuner, support for playback of WMA, OGG, and MP3 audio files, and a
battery life of as long as 53 hours. Goes on sale in South Korea on May 20th, no word on when it'll drop over here, but
it probably won't be more than a few months.
