According to a "confidential HP product brief" sent anonymously to PreCentral, HP is on track to launch a new 64GB TouchPad next month, complete with a white glossy cabinet and a "processor bump," along with support for AT&T's HSPA+ network. The company just started shipping its 16GB and 32GB TouchPads, but even August wouldn't be too soon for a speed boost, considering the tablet's disappointing performance during our review. The presentation also lists the Pre 3 for a "fall" launch, along with that mysterious Opal tablet. Despite the so-called leaked confidential presentation, this rumor should be approached like any other -- but on the other hand, with the Pre 3 making recent appearances at the FCC in both AT&T and Verizon flavors, HP's latest webOS smartphone could easily be on-track to hit stores by autumn.
