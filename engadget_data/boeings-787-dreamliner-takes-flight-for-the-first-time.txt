Over 55 airlines including Continental and Northwest / Delta have already purchased some 840 of the next-gen planes, with All Nippon Airways scheduled to take the first delivery. The test flight is scheduled to land in a couple hours -- we're assuming work to mount Boeing's airborne laser system on the nose in order to defeat hackers will begin shortly thereafter.
