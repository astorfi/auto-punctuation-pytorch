Apparently, version 3.15 adds three new games to your device, the ability to record FM radio as an MP3, new repeat functions, control over the speed of music playback (which we think is totally boss), and EmoTure 1.5, which has a handful of improved features (or so we're told). The whole shebang is available right now for your downloading pleasure... so go grab it.[Thanks, Evan]
