 Canon announced a quartet of camcorders earlier today at CES 2013, and while Vixia G20 is a tweaked version of the previous model, the R40 and R42 bringing a raft of new features like WiFi connectivity to the game. All the new camcorders pack a 53X zoom, DIGIC DV IV image processor and a 3.28-megapixel full HD CMOS image sensor, along with full HD at 60P and 35Mbps AVCHD recording. The R40 and R42 add an interesting twist, however, with WiFi and compatibility with Canon's new CameraAccess app, which brings streaming and remote control features.

 We took the R40 for a quick spin, and for a $400 camcorder, we were impressed with the solidity of the unit, light weight and decent specs. The WiFi component is a welcome option as well, opening the door to low-budget remote shooting and streaming, which could be especially handy for solo bloggers or vacationers. 60fps Full HD capability is also a nice touch, although action shooters would do well to not mistake the unit for a dedicated sports shooter and let it clatter to the pavement. For more info, check the gallery below, or go after the break to let a Canon rep give you a quick video tour of the new model.
