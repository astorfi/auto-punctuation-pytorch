 
 A slide detailing a Dell Latitude 10 tablet running Windows 8 surfaced late last month, and today more information about that slate has hit the internet. Neowin's "insider source" provided additional slides pertaining to the Dell Latitude 10, rounding out the product's specs and adding its time-to-market to the picture. According to the leaked roadmap, the 10.1-inch device is slated to ship between mid-November and mid-January, and it looks like Dell will offer a docking station with four USB ports, Ethernet, HDMI, built-in mobile broadband and even an optional stylus. Specs match up with those in the previously published slide, though Neowin says Dell may also release a Windows RT tablet around October.
