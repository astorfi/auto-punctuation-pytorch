While there doesn't seem to be a game included with this particular bundle, you will get a matching carrying case, a 22-minute Pokemon Mystery Dungeon DVD, a Grovyle poster, and a Pokemon t-shirt that we're guessing anyone buying this will never want to take off. All for the usual price of $129.99.[Via DS Fanboy]
