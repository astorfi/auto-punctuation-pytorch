It's not as though we haven't seen enough of these Core 2 Duo machines already this week (and truth be told, we still don't see a C2D option on their site), but we assume the new dv9000t will be configurable with the same as their previous dv9000 release (the one that featured an AMD Turioun 64 X2) with a 17-inch 1680 x 1050 or 1440 x 900 widescreen display, dual SATA RAID drives, 256MB GeForce Go 7600 graphics, 5-in-1 media reader, 802.11a/b/g, Bluetooth, dual-layer DVD burner with LightScribe, ExpressCard/54, HDMI, and the like. Weights start at 7.8 pounds, thickness at 1.57-inches, and prices at $1,200.[Via Laptop Mag]Update: did we mention that the dv6000t with Core 2 Duo is out, too? Because it is, and Laptop mag even has a review of one. We think you know what to expect, yeah?
