 
We're a little hesitant to call a Zune that has a tiny little Halo 3 decal on the front a "new Zune," and therefore we're assuming that isn't, by some sort of cosmic corporate joke, the Zune update that we've all been expecting. Nevertheless, this is definitely going to be of some interest to the Halo addicts out there (the same kind of addicts that are looking at the $130 Halo 3 Legendary Edition with anticipation). There's no word on whether this special edition Zune will ever get a commercial release -- as far as we know it was just a one-off for a recent Halo 3 event in New York -- but we won't be waiting around for it. We'll be busy losing at Halo 3.
