Yesterday, the company unveiled new images of the USB-powered peripheral, confirming that it's in "early production" and slated for release later this year. True to its name, the latest addition to the Optimus family features six LCD shortcut keys, though pricing and precise availability remain a mystery. As for that pricey Optimus Popularis keyboard we saw exactly a year ago, its release has been delayed until 2012 -- which, in Lebedevese, means "anytime within the next decade." In the meantime, you can feast your eyes on an extra image of the Mini Six, waiting for you after the break.
