 The nation's top wireless dog has told the Federal Aviation Administration's head that it should "enable greater use of tablets, e-readers, and other portable devices" during flights, according to the Hill. That was the gist of a missive sent from Julius Genachowski, chairman of the FCC to the FAA's chief, Michael Huerta yesterday. He went on to say that doing so would let individuals "stay informed and connected with friends and family," while helping large and small businesses be more productive, which would "boost US competitiveness." While it sounds like not doing so would be un-patriotic with a pitch like that, the FAA has already formed a committee to revisit its current portable electronics policies and hasn't arrived at any decisions yet -- safety first, after all.
