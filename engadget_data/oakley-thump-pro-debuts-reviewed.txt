Featuring capacities of 256MB, 512MB and 1GB, the new set does manage to be the best equipped and least ridiculous member of its illustrious crew, and we're sure a select crowd might find these an attractive and convenient alternative to the armband MP3 player for active pursuits -- but that doesn't mean we can't point and laugh all the same. As expected, the THUMP PRO player is based on Oakley's BOTTLECAP line, and features "Unobtanium" nose and ear pieces to fight sweat and keep the player firmly perched on your face. CNET found 'em to be plenty comfortable, and while lacking a screen and PlaysForSure subscription support -- though regular purchased WMA tracks do work -- there were plenty enough features to be getting on with. Sadly, the audio is just OK, the 6 hour battery life might be a deal breaker for most, and the rest might be put off by hefty prices: $249, $299 and $349 for the three respective capacities. If the shades do strike your fancy, there are plenty of color options to choose from, and Oakley should be offering 'em for sale any day now.[Via acquire]
