Yum, so Epson just announced their P-4000 Photo Fine Player. Besides the bump to an 80GB drive, nothing really seems
to have changed over the award winning P-2000; it's still
being billed as a multimedia storage viewer for the hardcore digital photographer who requires the ability to store
images in either RAW or JPEG formats via integrated support for CompactFlash and SD memory cards, the ability to verify
JPEG exposure and Exif information for both RAW and JPEG files, and features a 16x display zoom to check picture
quality. But like its predecessor, owners will quickly find that it also makes for a tasty PMP with its 3.8-inch VGA
resolution display, MPEG-2/4, MP3, and AAC playback, and the ability to pump the video out to your TeeVee. No price
deets yet but we know it'll drop on October 6th.
