This latest batch of leaked screen shots over on PocketNow show off the tab's skinned homescreen where a clearly visible AT&T widget indicates a missing SIM card, and the Settings menu which points us to the product's possible release name -- Jetstream. The 10-inch slate, said to pack a dual-core 1.5GHz processor, 8 megapixel rear-facing camera and Scribe functionality, appears to have a "true" 4G LTE AT&T destiny ahead of it, with a potential launch coming before the close of this year. Make sure to hit the source below for an additional look at this Android slate.
