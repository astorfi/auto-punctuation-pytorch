With less than a month to go until Fallout 4's November 10th release, Bethesda has debuted a new live-action trailer to whet your appetite for some post-apcocalyptic wandering. Fallout 4 will feature the series' most in-depth character creation yet, Bethesda said earlier this year, and it'll sport a new dynamic dialog system that actually lets you walk away from dull conversations. The blend of real-world environments with Fallout models works really well for the trailer. Really, though, it just makes us long for the days when actual game environments can look that good. We'll get there, someday.
