We're kinda chuffed about Sony Ericsson's showing this year at MWC, and between the three launched sets -- Vivaz pro, X10 mini, and X10 mini pro -- this little QWERTY stands out as the best of the bunch. The idea behind the X10 mini series, of course, is to have all the features and functionality of the larger X10 in a small package designed with one-handed use in mind. The keypad is surprisingly pleasant and not cramped (provided you aren't equipped with baseball bat-sized fingers) as it looks and the key feedback is really great. The UI is generally snappy in most apps we saw, though we did see a bit of sluggishness while playing with the Timescape feature; with some months til launch, we can at least hope for some improvement there. The phone's back is soft touch plastic -- the mini is a smooth plastic, by contrast -- and the face is the glossiest finish imaginable. As you can guess, that means it's a fingerprint magnet -- so if you worry about that type of thing, bring a cloth to keep it lovely. We're absolutely stoked to get our hands on one of these for review for you as soon as possible, but until that fateful moment arrives, the gallery and vid after the break will have to do.
