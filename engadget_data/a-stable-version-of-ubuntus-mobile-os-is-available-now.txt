After a long period of developer (and enthusiast) previews, Ubuntu 13.10 for smartphones, as well as desktops, is finally available as a stable release. The gesture-heavy, Linux-based mobile OS still doesn't have an official hardware home -- if you'll remember, Canonical's Indiegogo bid for the Ubuntu Edge failed to meet its lofty goals -- but there are a couple of devices that can run the OS. Google's Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4 are both officially supported, so owners of those handsets with the right know-how can head to the company's site now for instructions to flash the OS. That doesn't mean we won't someday see a dedicated Ubuntu device -- the company's still in talks with OEMs. For now, though, you can at least enjoy the fruits of Canonical's mobile labors while holding fast to the Edge of hope.
