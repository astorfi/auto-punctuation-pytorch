As just revealed in an official blog post by VP of Business Development Diarmuid O'Connell, Tesla will also be using the platform for a range of other "derivatives," including a minivan, a cross-over utility vehicle and, yes, a full-fledged utility van for both industrial and civic use. Unfortunately, O'Connell didn't have much to say about anything like a launch timeframe or any other details, for that matter, but we wouldn't let that stop you from your starting to plan out some van art. Trust us. It's coming back.[Via Autoblog Green, image courtesy dcdan]
