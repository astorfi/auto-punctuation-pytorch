Those will let you attach any number of Leica, Nikon or Canon lenses to the compact shooter, although you'll expectedly have to make do without autofocus if you decide to venture beyond Sony's own lenses for the cameras. They also won't come cheap, with the adapters set to run ¥19,950 to ¥25,200, or roughly $220 to $275 -- although that could be a small price to pay if you've already invested in some serious glass.
