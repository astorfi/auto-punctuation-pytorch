 We're still quite a few days months away from our official analog-to-digital cutover, but the lads (and dames) in Britain aren't wasting any time. Reportedly, the nation is already preparing to begin the switchover, starting in the northwest English resort of Whitehaven with BBC2. This initial move will affect around 25,000 households, and it was noted that the "other analog channels" would be switched off on November 14th. 'Course, Britain as a whole isn't scheduled to go 100-percent digital until 2012, but that didn't stop kiddos at a local primary school from "burying an analog time capsule to recall how television was before the change." Kids these days... they've got it good.[Image courtesy of BBC]
