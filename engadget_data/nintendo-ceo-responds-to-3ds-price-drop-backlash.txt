Generally, however, such shifts take time, so Nintendo caught us all a bit by surprised when it announced that it will be cutting the cost of the 3DS from $249 to $169 in mid-August. The gaming giant was quick to mend fences, offering 20 free virtual console games to those who got burned by the discount. Nintendo's CEO Satoru Iwata followed up the announcement with a more formal apology to consumers, noting that they may well feel "betrayed" and "punished" for their early adoption. Iwata added that early buyers are still "important" to the company, and that the decision to drop the price was due to concerns on the part of retailers and designers that Nintendo hasn't released a worthy followup to the ultra-popular DS.
