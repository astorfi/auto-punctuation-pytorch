Theoretically, this will enable any Vista Extender to play nice with Netflix, but for those with an Xbox 360 laying around already, there's no need to go out and purchase a standalone unit. There's a plethora of additional information and near daily updates with changes and bug fixes going on in the read link, so be sure to give that a look if this sounds like something you'd be interested in.[Via Thomas Hawk's Digital Connection]
