Good, as that'll make it easier to understand why the two have created Airtime, a heavily hyped new peer-to-peer video chat service. The aim is to offer a one-on-one conversation that helps people understand each other, with shared interests and the ability to quickly fling that LOLcat video to a friend or significant other. It's launching first on Facebook, which is nothing new for video chat, but the absence of any in-between servers and special plugins beyond Flash eliminates a lot of the usual hurdles. More features are coming in the near future, including a decidedly Flash-free iOS app, music streaming and games -- leaving us with considerably more things to do while we reconnect, or at least a more engaging way to reminisce about the Napster days.
