But the truth is that even if you are watching a Blu-ray movie via HDMI with the latest player set to 24p, there's a good chance it's all for naught because your HDTV is just converting the signal to another frame rate. But not all TVs do this, some can actually do it right and instead of using 2:3 pulldown it can do something like a 3:3 conversion and display the signal at 72hz -- for example. The problem of course is how can you tell which TVs do it right and which do it wrong? Well, thankfully a resourceful member of the AVS Forum -- with some help of other members -- has comprised a list to save you the hassle. So if you're in the market for a new HDTV and you just have to watch your movies at the native frame rate, then head on over and pick one from the list of front projectors, rear projectors, LCDs, or plasmas.
