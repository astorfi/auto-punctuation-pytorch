 Not to be outdone byNikon, who recentlyannounced a nearly complete exit of the film-based camera business, Konica Minolta has just announced that they'repulling out of the camera biz altogether. The company announcedthat they were scaling back consumer operations in November, especially killing off their film line and mainlyconcentrating their DSLR line. Now they're ceasing operation altogether, along with ending their film and photo paperproduction. Sony will be continue to manufacture cameras compatible with Konica Minolta lenses, which furthers apartnership the two companies formed last year, and willreceive some of Konica Minolta's DSLR related assets.[Thanks, Jason]
