 
 CBS has pulled back the curtain on just how many eyeballs were glued to its Super Bowl XLVII coverage, and it claims that its live stream netted 3 million unique viewers, up 43 percent from last year's game. With so many fans watching the action via the internet, CBS managed to whip up almost 10 million live video streams, which is more than a 100% uptick from the previous year. If you're wondering just how that translates into time spent watching the Ravens forge their path to victory, CBS says it broke a record by streaming 114.4 million minutes. According to figures collected by a trio of research groups, the game was the most "most-social event in the history of television," racking up more than 52.5 million mentions of it around the web in a single day -- three times that of 2012's Super Bowl and Grammy Awards. Sure, CBS' online viewership numbers for Super Bowl XLVI are impressive, but they're still eclipsed by the record-breaking 164.1 million viewers who caught the Ravens and 49ers duke it out on television.
