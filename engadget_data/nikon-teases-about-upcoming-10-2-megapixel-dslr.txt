Beyond the usual marketing hyperbole of "More power," "More control," "More versatile and "More excitement," Nikon lets slip the megapixel count: 10.2, and the release date: 20 days from now. Word on the street is that the mystery cam will be a replacement to the D70/D70s series, and the 10.2 megapixels will be one welcome improvement from the 6.1 megapixels of the D70.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
