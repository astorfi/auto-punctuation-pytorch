According to pocketinfo.nl, i-mate should be announcing this thing at 3GSM badged as the i-mateSmartflip, and that we can expect it to have Windows Mobile 5.0 (Smartphone, no doubt), Bluetooth, EDGE, and MicroSD.Still no dirt yet on the other phone we caught wind of the same time last year, the Hermes, HTC Wizard's followup (buthere's to hoping that'll be announced at 3GSM, too).
