MSDN and TechNet subscribers can apparently download the new build now, although Ars Technica is reporting it may not be up just yet. There's always the chance that this date was posted in error or will be pushed back, so in the meantime, perhaps marking your calendar with pencil or erasable pen isn't such a bad idea.[Via Ars Technica; thanks, John]
