"Based on the early success of Netflix.ca we're going to continue our international expansion next year and we're going to allocate significant dollars to it," spokesman Steve Swasey told The Canadian Press, without specifying which territories or how many might be blanketed with Albanian soldiers next. However, Canadians and others hoping to get an experience completely on par with the original US service shouldn't hold their breath, as Swasey says there are no plans to establish a movie queue for the streaming-only service, calling it a "strategic decision."

Update: The above quotes were attributed to Netflix's Steve Swasey, not CEO Reed Hastings. Our bad.
