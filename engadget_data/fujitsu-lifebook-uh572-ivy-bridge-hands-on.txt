  We've seen plenty of laptops here at CeBIT, but not so many with an Ivy Bridge processor inside. Yep, that Fujitsu you see coyly sunning itself in the Intel business center above is a fully paid-up member of that most exclusive of Intel gangs. Predictably, as we're a few months out from any official unveiling, the normal pre-production caveats apply, but we can't deny it's nice to finally see some Ivy Bridge action. We only had a limited time with the 1.5GHz notebook, and neither Intel or Fujitsu were able to share any more about what might actually make it out to market, but part number spotters (you know who you are) might want to jot down Intel IVY 2c 4MB 17W GT2 in your journals, as this is what we found on the underside.As for the rest of the notebook, well there's a pair of USB 3.0 ports, ready to serve, as well as HDMI and other essentials (power, headphone and USB 2.0). The 320GB hard drive and 2GB of RAM are as likely to change as the weather, but that's what was in the machine before us. Needless to say the form factor is small, light and the build was typical of the Fujitsu laptops that we've seen before (considering this is a prototype). Will we see this exact model make it to production? Our magic 8 ball says "only time will tell." Be sure to check the video after the break for our hands-on.
