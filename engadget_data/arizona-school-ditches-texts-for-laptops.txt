An Arizona high school is set to become one of the first
   ebook-only schools, as it preps to hand out laptops to 350 students this fall. The cost for the laptops at Vail
   High School will be about $850 per student, compared to about $600 for textbooks. The school plans to supplement
   electronic versions of traditional textbooks with online articles assigned by teachers. Meanwhile, we assume the
   students are already planning for in-class LAN parties over the school's WiFi network. (Oh, and that's Vail,
   Arizona, not Colorado, so don't even think about moving there if your plans are to get a free lappie
   and hit the slopes.)
