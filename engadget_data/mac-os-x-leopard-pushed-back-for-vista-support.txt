 Given that the last Leopard rumor we heard was that it'd actually be shipping early (like, this month), we're not sure how much stock should be put in this latest one, but according to DigiTimes, the word from "industry sources" is that the OS has now been postponed, all the way 'till October. Supposedly, the delay is necessary in order to add support for Vista to the integrated version of Boot Camp, which those same sources say Apple wants so it can increase its chances of grabbing more of that coveted PC market share. While we can't say if that's true or not, we are fairly confident that this won't be the last Leopard rumor we hear before its release, whenever that may be.
