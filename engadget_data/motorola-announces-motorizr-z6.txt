The upgraded device adds a so-2006 glossy black finish and features Motorola's new Linux- and Java-based platform, but perhaps more importantly to users, it integrates seamlessly with Windows Media Player 11 and rocks support for Windows Media DRM. Other features of the music-heavy handset carry over from the Z3, including a 2 megapixel cam, Bluetooth with A2DP, and expansion via microSD; sadly, there's still no mention of 3G on board. Expect the Z6 to be available by the end of this half of the year, with pricing to be announced closer to launch.
