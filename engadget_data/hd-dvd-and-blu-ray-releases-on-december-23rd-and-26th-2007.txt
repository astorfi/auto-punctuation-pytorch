 The holidays always get us out of whack, not only are movies released on two different days, but the post is in the middle of the week. Either way, there aren't that many titles, but all those with a new HD DVD player for Christmas yesterday will be happy to enjoy the biggest title this week; The Kingdom. Meanwhile, new Blu-ray fans can laugh in HD at the latest installment of Rush Hour -- while red has to wait to see it, presumably due to the lack of region coding on HD DVD. This competes the list for HD DVD going into CES, but blu has a few more next week, as they push the first profile 1.1 title to just before the big show.
