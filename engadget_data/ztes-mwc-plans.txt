It's not unusual for companies to pre-announce stuff that they're going to announce at trade shows, and let's face it -- ZTE does it more frequently than most of its competition. The company just sent out word that we can expect at least two new devices in just a little under a week from now: the Grand Memo II LTE with a 6-inch screen, and a smartphone called the Open C, which will run Firefox OS 1.3. It also made mention of a new version of its MiFavor UI, which likely will debut on at least one or more Android devices at the show. Sadly, ZTE leaves a lot to the imagination for now, but it gives us at least a little bit to chew on for the moment.
