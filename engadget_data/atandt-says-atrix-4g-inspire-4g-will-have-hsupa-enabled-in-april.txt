That should dramatically increase upload speeds on the phones (up to 5.76 Mbps), and make them more "4G" than ever before, but still not quite as "4G" as some other "4G." Incidentally, the Samsung Infuse 4G has also been confirmed to be shipping with HSUPA enabled, although it's still not clear exactly when it will ship.
