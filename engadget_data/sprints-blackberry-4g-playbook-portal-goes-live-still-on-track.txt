For those in need of a refresher, this guy will boast a 1GHz dual-core CPU, Adobe Flash / HTML 5 support, "true" multitasking, rear- and front-facing HD video cameras and a price that's still to be determined. What's most interesting here, however, is the dearth of information about a WiFi-only version -- we're hoping that it'll slip out a bit earlier than the WiMAX variant, but we're intentionally keeping our expectations on the low side. No one enjoys a bursting bubble, you know?
