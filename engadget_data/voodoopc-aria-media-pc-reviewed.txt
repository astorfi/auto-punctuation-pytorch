VoodooPC's Aria media center PC
might be expensive at close to $4,000, but you get a lot for your money, according to PC Magazine. Among the features
highlighted by the magazine are the Aria's built-in touchscreen LCD display, two 250GB drives, AMD Athlon 64 FX-57
processor and nVidia GeForce 7800GTX graphics card. However, the most interesting feature — and one of our faves as
well — is the Aria's built-in DVD-ripping function, which lets you archive your DVDs to its hard drive. Sure, as PC Mag
says, this may be a DMCA violation. But are you gonna let that — or a $4K price tag — stand in the way of a pure
entertainment experience?
