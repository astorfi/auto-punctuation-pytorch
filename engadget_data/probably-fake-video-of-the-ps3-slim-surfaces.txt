Nothing particularly amazing here -- it's a blurry video of a black plastic box with that new rounded-off logo style from the PSPgo on it -- but if it's real it's certainly interesting. So, what say you -- KIRF, or the real deal?Update: So this video was originally posted in the PS3 News forums, along with the nicer high-res pic above, which pretty much matches the box art we've seen. Anyone changing their minds?[Thanks, Khattab]
