Sales have been so brisk in the first week that AT&T claims to have "sold more iPhones than in the first month of any other wireless phone AT&T ever offered. That's how good it's been." However, neither Apple nor AT&T have released any figures. Anecdotal evidence from readers who ordered on-line or at AT&T stores suggests that a replenishment might come as soon as Friday -- the date many hopefuls were told they'd receive shipment. Based on previous Analyst calculations, we're guessing that Apple has crossed the 1M unit mark. A milestone which surely garners some kind of Apple announcement. Oh, hey Apple, how 'bout clearing up all those rumors in Europe while you're at it? K, thanks. Update: waitingforiphone claims to have a leaked memo from ATT Mobility claiming more than 1 million iPhone activations since launch.
