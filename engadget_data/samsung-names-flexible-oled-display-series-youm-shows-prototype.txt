 Samsung wasn't done with CES. During its second CES event, it just announced that it will brand its new series of flexible OLED displays Youm. Better still, the company brought on a handheld prototype that was all sorts of flexible. We then got a glimpse of a quick concept video where what appeared to be a phone proceeded to fold out to transform into a tablet. The prototype Youm device also had a screen that stretched beyond the front of the device, meaning that you'll be able to see notifications and widget content even when the device is laid down flat.
