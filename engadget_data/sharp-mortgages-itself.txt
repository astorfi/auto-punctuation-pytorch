It's cut a deal with banks for nearly $2 billion in short-term credit secured on its assets -- including the factory that reportedly produces displays for the iPhone. Sharp had pinned its hopes on cash from Hon Hai, but the Chinese giant is apparently delaying the money with the aim of gaining more control over Sharp's business. In response, Sharp has pledged to send president Takashi Okuda to meet Hon Hai's Terry Gou in Taipei -- just as soon as it's scraped together the air-fare.
