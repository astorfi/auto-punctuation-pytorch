Plus they took that hawt Hermes-style keyboard and gave it the MDA-style oval keys, not our idea of a nice changeup. Still, you'll have tetherable Rev A EV-DO, 128MB flash memory, 96MB RAM, microSD, Bluetooth 2.0, and a 2 megapixel camera. Big ups to Roc A Fella and HTC Kid on landing this, the third hot Verizon leak today.See also: Samsung i760, UTStarcom XV6800
