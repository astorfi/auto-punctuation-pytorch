 We told you there would be more titles tofollow! We didn't expect it to be this soon, but we sure are glad it did and I am sure the next few days there willmany more. Lionsgate is bringing somegreat titles to the party including: Lord Of WarÂ  and The Punisher. In the months to follow they will release moreincluding: Reservoir Dogs, Total Recall, and Stargate. The newer movies will have a suggested price of $40 and $30 forolder titles. I am a little disappointed to see the suggested retail price, I had hoped they wouldn't costthat much more than DVDs, but I suppose that was just wishful thinking. I can see I will have to wait some time beforeI start to replace my DVD collection. I wonder when Netflix will start to let me addthem to my queue?[via Zatz Not Funny]
