Unlike we'd previously heard, though, Toshiba's pricing the 16GB, 10.1-inch Excite at $449.99 -- which is 50 bucks less than what we were told back when it was announced. Meanwhile, if you're looking for the more spacious 32GB and 64GB models, you'll have to drop about $530 and $650, respectively. In exchange for that cash, you'll be getting an NVIDIA Tegra 3 SoC CPU and a taste of vanilla-flavored Android 4.0, among other things. We know Toshiba's got you excited, so head over to one of the source links below to pop your order in. Otherwise you can wait until the other two slabs go on sale next month.
