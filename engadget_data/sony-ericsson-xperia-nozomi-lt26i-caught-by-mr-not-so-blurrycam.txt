The LT26i is still rocking Gingerbread, but steps it up in the display department by moving to a 1280 x 720 panel, just like the Rezound and Galaxy Nexus. Most reports peg the Nozomi a having a 4.3-inch screen, but after some quick math it looks like its actually packing a 4.6-incher (Update: or... 4.3 inches, if the DPI reported is API related and not a hardware reference after all). The Quadrant score of 1,800 (which would put it in the realm of the Xoom and Galaxy Tab 10.1) also doesn't quite jibe with the rumored dual-core 1.5GHz chip that's supposed to be powering this device. The front facing camera is clearly visible, so it'll be ready for all your video chatting adventures. Price, release date, carrier? It's all up in the air, but we can tell you it's a very handsome device. Check out the source link for more pics.
