That's at least the word according to AppleInsider, which just noticed that Moscone West is mysteriously booked from June 28 to July 2 by "Corporate Event," which has signified upcoming Apple events in the past. If you'll recall, the original iPhone was released in June of 2007, followed by the iPhone 3G at WWDC 2008 and the iPhone 3GS at WWDC 2009, so the smart money is on another refresh this year -- and you can't have whispers of an iPhone refresh without rumors about it coming to Verizon, so there's tons of chatter in the air. We're staying out of that for now, since we haven't heard anything new or particularly interesting, but we'd like to point out that we're also due an iPhone SDK event in March on Apple's campus if Steve holds to pattern -- anyone care speculate on what iPhone OS 4.0 might bring to the table?
