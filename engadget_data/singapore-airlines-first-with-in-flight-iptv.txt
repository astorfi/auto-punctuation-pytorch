Singapore Airlines launched the very first in-flight IPTV service this past weekend, using Boeing's Connexion
in-flight WiFi technology to offer passengers four channels of programming over the plane's wireless network.Â 
Before you get too excited (assuming you even get excited about the prospect of in-flight IPTV), note that you do need
to use your own WiFi-enabled laptop to access the service (plans to integrate the service into seatback displays are in
the works), and it's not clear whether they're pulling programming live over a satellite connection or just streaming
content that's stored (or perhaps cached) on a media server on the plane (like the
video on demand system Microsoft developed earlier this
year). Either way we ain't gonna knock it, anything that gives us an alternative to paging through the SkyMall
catalog for the 100th time is fine by us.
