We're particularly interested because we actually saw an extremelysimilar looking (if not the same) device in the DIRECTV booth at CES as shown above; our original thought was that thiswas an Intel Viiv powered satellite receiver and DVR. We're not sure how far off we were, but apparently there's moreinfo to reduce the mystery. This little box sports a 2.5-inch hard-drive, a dual-core Intel processor, wirelesscapability, integrated Intel 945M graphics and various output jacks like USB and FireWire. There's plenty more in thesmall boxÂ  that measures 230 x 197.5 x 42 mm) so is this the precursor to Intelleaping ahead into our home entertainment rooms?(via Hexus)
