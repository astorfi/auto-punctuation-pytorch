Fortunately, if they're toting 'round ASUS' new Eee Pad Transformer Prime, it won't matter. Instead they can use the eight megapixel, f/2.4 aperture auto-focusing snapper to capture the carnage in glorious HD, with a back-illuminated CMOS to ensure that color enhancement is 30 percent better than similar devices. We've got some sample shots from the company to show off just how good your pictures will be (if you've got the backing of a major hardware corporation, a world-class lighting rig and Photoshop) if you start capturing life with just this handy transforming tablet.
