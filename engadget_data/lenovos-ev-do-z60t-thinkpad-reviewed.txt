PC Magazine got to play with the slightly heretical
Lenovo ThinkPad Z60t and found that
while the titanium cover and aspect ratio might not be exactly IBM-esque, the Z60t is a pretty sweet laptop that should
offend few and provide built-in EV-DO and widescreen glory to many well-heeled consumers. The battery life is pretty
strong at 4.5 hours, the keyboard is even better than the old ones, and the included card reader is a nice touch; but
while the multimedia features are pretty sweet for a ThinkPad, they don't really stand out, and the integrated graphics
aren't going to blaze through Doom 3 in any acceptable manner. You can get yours for $2300 or you can sit in the corner
and pout about the optional titanium cover. We recommend option number three: Steal it.
