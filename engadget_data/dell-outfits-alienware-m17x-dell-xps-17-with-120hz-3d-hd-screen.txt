It seems Round Rock came across a few shipments of a 17-inch, 1080p panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, perfect for interfacing with NVIDIA's shutter glasses, and is including it (along with a new NVIDIA GeForce GT 555M for the XPS 17) as premium options. They'll also both sport Intel's new Sandy Bridge processors. Dell's press release doesn't specify if a set of 3D glasses will come with the new laptops, nor how much the upgrade will cost, but a 3D-capable M17x will start at $1,499 starting January 10th, and a stereoscopic XPS 17 will run $1,449 on February 1st. You do the math.

Updated: We got to check out the XPS 17 3D after the presser. Those looking for 3D in the XPS chassis won't be dissapointed -- Alice in Wonderland looked pretty great in three dee. We also got to check out the M17x -- hands-on with that one here.
