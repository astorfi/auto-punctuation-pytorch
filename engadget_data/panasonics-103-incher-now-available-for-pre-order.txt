Sure, the TH-103PF9UK's gonna cost ya, but you'll have it just in time to kick it with Bing as he croons his way around in those snappy yuletide sweaters at full, 1080p HD resolution. Well, almost. See, that massive 95.0 × 55.9 × 5.0-inch (2,414 × 1,421 × 127.5-mm) frame sports just one UXGA-capable DVI-D input, one component video in, and a couple of D-sub 15 and D-sub9 RS-232C jacks for your PC. That's right, for $69,999.95, you get 1600 x 1200 resolution out of the box. If you want to see this thing perform at that 1920 x 1080 resolution so often touted, then you'll have to drop even more cash for the optional HD-SDI expansion board. Hell, while you're at it, you'd best take their advice and pony-up for the professional installation -- 'cause at 474-pounds (215Kg) nobody wants to see a flat Santa.
