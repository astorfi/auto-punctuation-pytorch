Israeli site DTown has published what appears to be legit press photos for the DSLR, with its articulating display vividly highlighted. Also take note the lens being shown is a 18-55mm VR, which is Nikon's term for image stabilization -- it looks like this might be what comes packaged in a bundle. Between this and the product page from earlier today, we think it's safe to conjecture this little guy might be making an appearance at tomorrow's Nikon press event. Check out another picture after the break, or hit up the read link for the full gallery.
