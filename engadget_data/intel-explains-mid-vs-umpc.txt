Fortunately, Dan Monahan, Intel's Global Internet Segment Manager of Ultra Mobility and the man who showed us (and the world) the UMPC for the first time at CeBIT took the time to set us straight. This is how it breaks down.UMPC

Business-class device for enterprise users
Runs a "heavy" OS like Vista
Optimized for office-use applications like Excel, Word, etc.

MID

Consumer-class lifestyle device
Runs a 'lightweight" OS with quick startup like Linux
Optimized for things like media playback and web surfing
In 2009 (or so) Moorestown-based devices will be classed as MIDs only

So there you have it from the man who knows. Now use the term correctly please, especially you dear OEM/ODMs.
