Since launch, the GoPro App has primarily served as a remote control; it hasn't been much good for reviewing the day's shooting. That won't be an issue with the newly launched GoPro App 2.0. Both Android and iOS users can now browse their action camera's memory card, save and play media on a mobile device, and share any saved clips through email, MMS and social networks like Instagram. Windows Phone users aren't in line for the update right now, but their Android and iOS counterparts can grab both the new app and corresponding camera firmware upgrades at the source links.
