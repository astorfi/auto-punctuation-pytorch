It's not a laptop, it's not a desktop, it's, well, something in between which isn't always the best place to be. The XPS M2010 is pretty much spot-on to those leaked specs, meaning this roughly $4000 (about $8,000 fully spec'd) Windows Media Center PC maxes-out with a 2.16GHz Core Duo T2600, up to 4GB of dual-channel DDR2 memory, a 20.1-inch 1680 x 1050 LCD driven by a 256MB RADEON X1800 graphics card, up to 240GB of RAID 0/1 capable disk, 802.11a/b/g WiFi and a host of other features including a detachable Bluetooth keyboard with mouse, 1.3 megapixel cam integrated into the display bezel, and 8 built-in speakers with subwoofer and integrated high-definition audio. Portable? Well, this hog folds and has a handle but at nearly 20-pounds, you won't likely be taking it any further than the nearest LAN party. [Thanks, Andrew G]
