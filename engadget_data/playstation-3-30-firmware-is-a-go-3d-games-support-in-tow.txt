 When the PlayStation blog said firmware 3.30 -- you know, the one that "preps" the console for added 3D support (games for now, not movies) -- was "coming soon," we figured that meant some indeterminate day or week ahead. Not so; we just turned on our Sony consoles and, lo and behold, we got a new update sent our way. There's nothing you can do with the third dimension at this point, but take solace in a handful of Trophy enhancements. And Linux support? Don't be silly, it's not coming back.
