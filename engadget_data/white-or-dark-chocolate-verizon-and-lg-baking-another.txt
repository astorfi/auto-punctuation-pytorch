       Just as all of you Chocolate lovers are updating your phones with the latest software to enable speakerphone, LG and Verizon Wireless have something new up their sleeves. It's not an entirely new Chocolate, or even the VX8600 flip we've been anticipating -- the success of LG VX8500 in the current black color has prompted LG to rethink their current lineup and want to be "Moto-esque" with a re-release of the phone in white. The word on the street is that we are looking for this to be released for before the Thanksgiving promo, giving all of you current Chocolate owners plenty of time to save your cash.
