Instead, it'll see duty as a regional outpost of the Big Red behemoth, according to Verizon Wireless CEO Lowell McAdam -- and regional outposts don't exactly need the 3,000 employees currently employed there. Though it's not clear exactly how many jobs will be trimmed, rumor has it executives and mid-level managers will be the first to get the boot; the silver lining in the news is that McAdam says Verizon's going to try to find jobs for some of the affected folks elsewhere within the corporate footprint if they're not needed in Little Rock. Atlanta, perhaps?
