Then we're afraid you'll have to update your scorecards again, as Apple has now amended its complaint with some even stronger language than before, and broadened the scope of the devices involved in the suit. According to Apple, the Droid Charge, Infuse 4G, Nexus S 4G, Galaxy Tab 10.1, Galaxy S II and a handful of other Samsung devices are all also infringing on the patents in question, which now total eight in all (two previously included have been thrown out, but three new ones have been added). As for that stronger language, Apple's now saying that Samsung "has been even bolder" than other competitors in copying its products, and that it's created "products that blatantly imitate the appearance of Apple's products to capitalize on Apple's success."
