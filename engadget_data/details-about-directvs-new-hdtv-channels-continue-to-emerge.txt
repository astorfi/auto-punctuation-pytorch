You know, It's one thing when you're waiting for new channels to launch, but when there are so many expected all at once from your provider, well, it's more than most of us can handle. We don't know about anyone else, but we're ready; we got our MPEG4 hardware, our 5 LNB dish and even our B-Band converter, all there is to do now is wait. No one seems to know, exactly which day is the day, but our best guess is about Sept 15th. The other thing that still seems to be up in the air, is exactly how many channels will be available. DirecTV only says there will be 100 this year, and while some networks seem to be ready whenever they are, others have yet to make an announcement. Satellite guys has received a list, also without dates. CSRs have also been telling customers what they can expect at launch -- we know how reliable they can be. While the list of 57 channels is certainly impressive and will make them the new HD leader -- assuming DISH doesn't add the same channels, it is still a far cry from the 100 promised.Here is the list DirecTV customer service reps have reported, the full list from DirecTV after the jump.
