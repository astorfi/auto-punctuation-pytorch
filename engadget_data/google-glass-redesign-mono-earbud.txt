Just yesterday, Google revealed that Glass Explorers will soon be able to to swap out their current hardware for a new version, which will work with future shades and prescription frames. Although Page and Co. didn't divulge just what the next iteration of its wearable will look like, it's only taken a day for them to show us the new kit. The most -- and potentially only -- visible change is the addition of a mono earbud sporting the Glass logo, which appears to connect via the device's micro-USB port. Mountain View's kept mum on what other revisions it's made, but with the hardware scheduled to arrive in the hands of beta testers shortly, more details can't be far off.
