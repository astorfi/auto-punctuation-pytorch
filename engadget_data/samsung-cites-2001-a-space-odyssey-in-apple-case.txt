As noted by FOSS Patents' Florian Mueller though, that's just what Samsung has done in an opposition brief filed last night, which cites the tablet-like devices pictured above as an example of prior art for Apple's iPad-related design patent. Of course, that's just one small part of Samsung's overall defense, but it is certainly one of the most interesting we've seen so far. Head on past the break for the film clip in question.
