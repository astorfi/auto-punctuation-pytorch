       While T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless have both stated all along that they aren't supplying phone records to the NSA, it took a $50 billion lawsuit to pull Verizon (the landline provider) out of the woodwork. The suit, which was filed last Friday, is claiming $1000 per customer for turning over phone records, as per the Telecommunications Act of 1934. Its allegations are based on a USA Today story that ran on Thursday and which claimed that BellSouth, AT&T and Verizon had been forking over records of millions of phone calls to the government ever since 9/11. Now Verizon and BellSouth have gone on record to state that they have done no such thing, and that the NSA hasn't even requested such records. This calls into questions the USA Today piece, which cited anonymous sources, and (for now at least) should hopefully help those customers sleep a little bit sounder knowing that the NSA probably doesn't have proof of how infrequently they call their mothers.
