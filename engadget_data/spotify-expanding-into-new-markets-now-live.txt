 Rumors around the web have pegged Spotify for an impending expansion into more countries, with an official announcement purportedly slated for tomorrow. But it looks like the company's jumped the gun, as tips have begun to trickle in reporting the service as currently operational in Malaysia and Singapore. And it could be live in even more territories right now. A quick glance at Spotify's country selection page lists working sites for Mexico, Iceland, Hong Kong, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. We've reached out to the company for official comment on the rollout and will update when we hear back. Regardless, if you're living in any of those nations mentioned above, your streaming music options just increased by one.

 Update: Spotify just tweeted the happy news, thereby making it official.  [Thanks, Firdaus]
