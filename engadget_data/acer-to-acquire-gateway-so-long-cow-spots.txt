The acquisition has been approved unanimously by both boards and is expected to close by December 2007. You know, following the usual international, anti-trust approvals. Sure seems like a win-win what with Gateway steadily losing market share (but still tied for third largest PC maker in the US) while finally giving Taiwan's Acer a dominant position in the Americas to match their aggressive growth in Europe and Asia. From the looks of the press release, it would appear that the Gateway (and eMachines) brands will continue under Acer's new "multi-branded company." Fine, but could we now get rid of the cow spots, please? It's not 1985 anymore. [Via Notebooks]
