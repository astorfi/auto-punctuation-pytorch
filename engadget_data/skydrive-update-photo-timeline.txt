Perhaps to celebrate passing the 250 million user mark, SkyDrive is rolling out an update which introduces some nifty time-saving features. Now, you'll be able to view all your photos -- across folders and albums -- in a timeline view, with images grouped by event and date for easy searching. There are also filmstrip and slideshow modes, and, according to Microsoft's Inside SkyDrive blog, photo-upload times have been improved at least twofold. The update brings a few other goodies too: full-resolution camera uploads for all Windows Phone 8 devices worldwide, and new thumbnails for PowerPoint and Word files. The update will begin rolling out today and should make its way to all users within 48 hours.
