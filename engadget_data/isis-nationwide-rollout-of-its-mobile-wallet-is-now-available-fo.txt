After announcing plans for nationwide deployment back in July, and nabbing commitments from both Chase and American Express in the process, Isis is now available for the masses. Customers on AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon who wield one of over 40 capable handsets can snag a free enhanced SIM and download the app via Google Play to begin using the mobile wallet in all of its NFC payment glory. Of course, in addition to credit and debit cards, the platform also supports loyalty cards, so free drinks at vending machines thanks to MyCokeRewards are a swipe away. How's that for an afternoon pick-me-up?
