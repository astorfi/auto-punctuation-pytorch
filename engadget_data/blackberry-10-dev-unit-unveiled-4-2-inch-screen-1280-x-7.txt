 Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. In this instance, it just leaves us wanting more. The image you see above is RIM's official dev unit for its just launched BlackBerry 10 platform. If it looks familiar, that's because you've seen it not too long ago when leaks of the much anticipated device began to hit the world wide rumor-mongering web. Waterloo's still keeping us in the dark as to the glorified guts this austere fella's packing, but it did confirm these alpha units will feature a jaw-dropping 4.2-inch, 1280 x 768 display that bests the 720p panels found on other similarly-sized handsets -- there's no word yet on if it's PenTile, though it likely doesn't matter much at that resolution. We've also learned the device sports 16GB internal storage and 1GB of RAM. No, this isn't your mother's BlackBerry and for good reason too, as the beleaguered mobile titan's got quite a bit of its continued prosperity riding on this QNX-based slab. Wondering where its QWERTY cousin is? We are too, but without any official announcements, you'll just have to stay tuned to see what fruits this week's BlackBerry World will bear.
