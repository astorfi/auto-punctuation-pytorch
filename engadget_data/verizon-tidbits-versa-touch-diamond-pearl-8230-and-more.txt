       We've got a handful of juicy morsels coming out of Verizon today -- actually, that sounds a little unpleasant, but you know what we mean -- and we wanted to pass along what we've heard. Follow the break for all the action!
      

 

 The LG VX9600 Versa and HTC Touch Diamond are slated for launch sometime in early to mid-March. The CDMA version of the BlackBerry Pearl flip -- the 8230 -- will have WiFi when it launches on Verizon. As CDMA BlackBerrys go, that's pretty friggin' rare. Unfortunately, we don't have a launch date for this one just yet. The carrier is promising to launch a device "unlike anything anyone has seen before" this year, but beyond that, we don't know what it could possibly be -- your guess is as good as ours. The Omnia will be reduced to $99 on contract in mid-March, though we don't know whether this is a temporary discount or a permanent cut. Either way, it seems like a really good deal considering what you're getting.So, what say you, Verizon subscribers? Anyone seriously ready for an Omnia / Touch Diamond deathmatch?
