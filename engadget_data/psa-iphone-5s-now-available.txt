You've had a couple of days to mull over our review, but now it's go time: the iPhone 5s is now available for order in Apple's online storefront (if you're not seeing it on the web yet, the official app is usually the way to go). The new handset appeared on the store after the typical pre-release downtime, listed in 16, 32 and 64GB flavors for $199, $299 and $399, respectively. Impatient buyers can also find the iPhone 5s at their local brick and mortar store, assuming they're willing to brave long lines and potential stock shortages. Not ready for a whole new phone? Check out iOS 7 -- it's available right now and it won't cost you a dime.
