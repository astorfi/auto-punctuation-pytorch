It's been a little while since we've heard much about iRobot's
PackBot—we understand they've been busy making
those things that have been scrubbing and
vacuuming our floors—which since we first checked
it out over a year ago has since been recruited by the armed forces for Iraqi and Afghani military ops. Their latest
version of the PackBot, the Explorer, doesn't seem too different from the original modular machine, but has a variety
of surveillance and intelligence options including three cameras. Well, nice to check in and hear it's doing well for
itself—just don't get all blowed up, ok PackBot?
