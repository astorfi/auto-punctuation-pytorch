 Samsung -- not satisfied with people using their TVs and set top boxes to, y'know, watch TV -- has announced its See'N'Search set-top box. Separate from its Media Center Extender and RSS-enabled HDTVs, this box pores over channel guide info and closed caption metadata to find and suggest accompanying video or websites from the internets to go with your episode of Bold & the Beautiful. This is better than actually getting up and using a computer to find Youtube spoofs, because it's automatic, and accessible via the remote's "More Info" button, which can then send said info to a phone or PC via Wi-Fi. With a press release short on details of how this tech will get out of Samsung's R&D center and into our home theater, we're not throwing out our HTPCs just yet.
