Per usual, it'll be the homeland that's treated to the NINOKUNI Magical Edition PS3 console, a decidedly wizard-approved bundle that'll include a copy of Ni No Kuni. The only edition available will boast a 160GB hard drive, a single Dual Shock controller and a glorious icon on the lower-left of the machine. It'll be available in Japan this November for Â¥33,780 ($440), but only in "limited quantities." So much for magic that lasts forever, huh?
