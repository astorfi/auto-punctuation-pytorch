Short for UnLimited possibilities (groan), the UL series offers up a variety of models, all of which rely on Intel's CULV platform for juice and can squeeze up to 12 hours of claimed battery life thanks to having both discrete and integrated graphics onboard. The 1-inch thin machines arrive in either black or brushed aluminum, with room for up to 8GB of DDR2 RAM, a dual-layer DVD burner, a Core 2 Duo CPU and hard drives as large as 500GB. Both 14- and 15.6-inch models are available, though your guess is as good as ours when it comes to pricing and availability.[Via HotHardware]
