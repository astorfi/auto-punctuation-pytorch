Mindball is a tabletop game that rewards you for being
relaxed.Â  Players put on headbands that track Alpha- and Theta waves, you know, the kind that occur during deep
chillitude. The EEG readings correspond to the ball's movement, and the most-relaxed player will make the ball move to
the other player's goal. The game is available from Interactive Productline for a slim $20,000. Um, after spending
$20,000 on pong with a brain strap, how does one relax? Ever? Obviously by playing their
Pongmechanik (that would be Pong 2.0, by the way),
duh.
