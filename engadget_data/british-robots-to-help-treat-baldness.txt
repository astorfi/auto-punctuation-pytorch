 A British firm has just secured government funding from the "Technology Programme" to build a robotic system aiming to speed up the process of multiplying hair cells to help treat baldness in males and alopecia for both genders. The firm, Intercytex, extracts hair follicles from the neck, multiplies the cells, and then reimplants them in bald spots three weeks later. The Â£1.85 million grant ($3.48 million) will be used to process various cell samples using robots in a "reliable, effcient" way.Read - Intercytex press releaseRead - BBCRead - Reuters
