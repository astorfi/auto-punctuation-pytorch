Too bad that's not the case: according to a recently-posted Apple support document, switching graphics modes requires a trip to System Preferences and then a logout. Sure, it's slightly better than a total restart, but it's still a huge pain in the ass, and one we just don't understand -- if Sony can get Vista to handle it without issue, Apple should be able to get their own OS to deal. Here's hoping Apple fixes this particular bag of hurt soon -- we can't see mobile pros flocking to this feature until they can seamlessly switch between graphics modes when going from the office to the road.Update: We took a quick video of the machine switching modes, check it after the break.
