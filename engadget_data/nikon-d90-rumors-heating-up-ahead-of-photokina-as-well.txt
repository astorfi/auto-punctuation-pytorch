At least we're getting specs this time around, and they're not bad at all: 12 megapixels, Live View, video mode (necessitating a built-in mic), HDMI out, optional GPS, and a new 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 VR lens. Sure, it's a worthy successor to the D80 -- but we'll believe it when we see it.P.S.- Yes, that's another old, probably Photoshopped image that's been floating around, so don't get crazy -- like we said, these rumors aren't exactly new.
