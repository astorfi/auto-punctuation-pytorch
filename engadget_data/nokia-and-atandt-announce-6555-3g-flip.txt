Nokia and AT&T today have announced the immediate availability of the 6555, a rather attractive flip -- "smoothback design," as they call it -- sporting UMTS, a QVGA primary display, microSD expansion in case the 30MB onboard ain't enough, and the full spread of GSM / EDGE bands for global dominance. It hasn't shown up on AT&T's site just yet, but we're told we can get it today for $49.99 on a two-year agreement.
