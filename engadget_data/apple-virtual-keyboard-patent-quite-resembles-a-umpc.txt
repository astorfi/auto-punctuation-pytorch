It does seem that Apple didn'tget that "two thumbs are better than one" memo, but they seem to have stuck with their usual conceptualartist for the mockup, and are bent on teasing us with touchscreen ideas. Thepatent also mentions some ideas for learned pressure sensitivity for the keyboard based on what you usually type, whichsounds interesting, if a bit too smart for our tastes. Apple also has a recent patent for the iPod that have thedevice's screen mirrored onto a larger screen, and also allows for remote control and wireless file transfer betweenthe devices. It's all well and good, but Apple has had a patent for wireless file transfer for a while now, so it's nothing to gettoo excited about.[Via MacRumors]
