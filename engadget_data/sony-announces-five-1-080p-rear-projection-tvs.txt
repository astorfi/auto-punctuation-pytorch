Each of these sets is part of the Grand WEGA line and features three SXRD chips along with the proprietary WEGA Engine HD and Digital Reality Creation Multi Function Version 2.5 systems, three HDMI inputs, and a full 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. The 70-inch, $7,800 KDS-R70XBR2 (pictured) and 60-inch, $5,300 KDS-R60XBR2 both trump the 60-inch, $4,500 KDS-60A2000, 55-inch, $4,000 KDS-55A2000, and 50-inch, $3,500 KDS-50A2000 by including native CableCARD support and integrated speakers, but the cheaper models will be available this summer, while you'll have to wait until fall to pick up either XBR set.
