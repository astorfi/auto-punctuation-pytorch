The fashionable S1 and S2 hard drives include 1.8- and 2.5-inch HDDs (respectively), with the former arriving in 80/120/160GB capacities and the latter in 160/250/320/500GB sizes. The compact drives are entirely USB-powered and include a handful of expected backup / data protection features. As for colors, you can expect these in piano black, snow white, red wine and chocolate brown this month in Europe, while South Koreans will be asked to wait until November. As for the rest of ya? Hope you know a good importer.[Via I4U News, thanks Luigi]
