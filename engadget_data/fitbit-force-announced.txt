Well, Fitbit had a little trouble keeping the wraps on its Force activity tracking watch. But the company is ready to officially unveil its latest wearable and plans to launch it in the coming weeks for $129.95. The Force borrows heavily from the aesthetic successes of the Flex, with its clean rubberized design and small dark display. That display, though, is where it sets itself apart from its more affordable predecessor. The Force is able to deliver detailed tracking information -- not just represent your steps as dots -- like the time and even (pending a firmware update) caller ID information when paired with an iPhone 4s or newer running iOS 7. Despite including an OLED screen and adding an altimeter to the mix to track how many steps you've climbed, like the One, Fitbit still claims the Force can last up to ten days on a single charge. Of course, we'll put that claim to the test when we get our hands on a review unit.


Otherwise, you're looking at all the same features you've come to know and possibly love from Fitbit products: it counts steps, tracks the quality of your sleep, has a silent alarm and syncs wirelessly via Bluetooth 4.0. The only question that remains is when exactly you'll be able to buy your own. The press release (embedded after the break) simply says you'll be able to buy it through Fitbit's online shop in "two-three weeks."
