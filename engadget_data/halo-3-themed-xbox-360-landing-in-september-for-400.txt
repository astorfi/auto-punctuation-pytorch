Yep, Microsoft's special edition console will be landing sometime in September for $399.99, and will include "an authentic Spartan green-and-gold finish," matching wireless controller, a 20GB hard drive, headset, a Play and Charge Kit, and "more" -- though we're not exactly sure what the latter may be. Get in line early folks, we've got all ideas this will be a fairly hot commodity.[Via Joystiq]
