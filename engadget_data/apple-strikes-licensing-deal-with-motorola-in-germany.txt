	It's a minor thing, perhaps, but Motorola and Apple seem to be coming to a limited set of terms in Germany regarding the ongoing patent battles there. Very few details have emerged, but Engadget says, "The terms seem to include only 'cellular standard-essential' patents, which means the company's claims regarding WiFi and video codecs could still be used as an avenue of attack."



	The agreement includes an admission by Apple of previous infringement, although German courts could also determine the outcome based on FRAND rules. No royalties have been announced, and this is but one skirmish among many. But after Apple v. Samsung, any hope of patent disputes winding down are welcome relief.
