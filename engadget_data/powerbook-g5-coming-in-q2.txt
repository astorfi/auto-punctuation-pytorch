It's on! We knew that Apple was having a heck of a time getting the PowerBook G5 out the door (the G5 processor
presents some mighty heat and power consumption issues to overcome), but we've got some good news to report. For
whatever reason they sort of bury it in a chart that accompanies the story, but Digitimes says that Quanta Computer,
the Taiwanese contract manufacturer that builds the PowerBook for Apple, has received a massive order for the PowerBook
G5. Delivery date: Q2. Start saving now.
