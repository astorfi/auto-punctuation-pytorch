If you ever needed a better example of why patents for obviousness shouldn't be granted, a company called Antor
Media is suing a variety of cellphone makers, including Nokia, UTStarcom, Audiovox, Kyocera, Sanyo, Sharp, NEC, RIM,
Virgin Mobile, LG, palmOne and Panasonic, for violating their patent on a "Method and apparatus for transmitting
information recorded on information storage means from a central server to subscribers via a high data rate digital
telecommunications network." So basically they're suing going to sue anyone who transmits data from a server to another
device. They already sued Apple, Microsoft, MP3.com, and RealNetworks back in 2003.
