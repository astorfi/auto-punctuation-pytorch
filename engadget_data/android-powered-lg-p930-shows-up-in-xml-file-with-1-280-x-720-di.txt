In the case of LG's mysterious P930 device, though, our search for clues starts at the opposite end. According to an XML file on the company's website, it's cooking up an Android-powered device with 1,280 x 720 resolution and GPRS / EDGE / HSPDA / HSUPA connectivity. One question this string of code fails to answer: just what is this thing anyway? A smartphone? A tablet? Given the information available, we're inclined to say this will be a slab, joining the inaugural G-Slate. It's not that handsets with 1,280 x 720 resolution are out of the question, but we do notice that the file mentions 15 x 13 character size. When you compare that to devices such as the HTC Sensation 4G, which has a 25 x 21 char size, you'd imagine this mystery device has a lower pixel density than a phone with the same resolution. Until LG comes clean, of course, your guess is as good as ours.
