Fans of online role-playing games haven't had much to do on the PlayStation 4 so far, but that's all changing today. Square Enix has just opened up Final Fantasy XIV's PS4 beta test to everyone; from now until the morning of April 7th, you can battle monsters and ride Chocobos just by grabbing a free download from the PlayStation Store. This new beta phase runs on the same servers that PC and PS3 players use, so you should get a feel for real-world gameplay involving thousands of other adventurers. FFXIV doesn't officially arrive on the PS4 until the 14th, but don't fret about having to wait another week to play again -- if the game enthralls you so much that you've pre-ordered (or already have an account), you can start playing on the 11th.
