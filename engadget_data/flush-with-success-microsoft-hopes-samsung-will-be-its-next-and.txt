Microsoft has found plenty of corporate entities willing to be wooed with its patent-waving ways, and the company hopes the next notch on its bedpost will be a big one: Samsung. Reuters is reporting that Microsoft is after a $15 bounty per Android handset sold, which, if already in place, would have put Sammy $45 million in the hole thanks to the Galaxy S II's successes. Why would Samsung agree to such terms? It's possible Microsoft is requiring that this agreement be put in place for companies that want to produce Windows 8 tablets. Or, maybe it's just because everybody else is playing along. Nobody likes a follower, Samsung, nobody.
