On September 1st (as in, less than a month), the cool kids in Boise, Idaho, Bellingham, Washington and eight Texas markets (Abilene, Amarillo, Corpus Christi, Killeen / Temple, Lubbock, Midland/Odessa, Waco and Wichita Falls) will be able to laugh heartily at friends in other locales as they struggle to upload their latest YouTube clip over 3G. Each market should expect their own retail store opening as well as all sorts of other launch day shenanigans, some of which involve "promotional offers" that'll undoubtedly be too good to pass up.
