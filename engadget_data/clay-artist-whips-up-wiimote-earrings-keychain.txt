The artist claims to use Sculpey clay along with a single coat of satin glaze finish to construct each of the items, and so far, there's Wiimote-based cellphone charms, keychains and earrings for you to pick up. Best of all, these oh-so-cute items aren't outrageously priced, ranging from just $6.50 to $15 before shipping. Check out the rest of the gang after the jump, and be sure and hit the read link if you're scoutin' a gift for your favorite nerd.[Via Technabob]
