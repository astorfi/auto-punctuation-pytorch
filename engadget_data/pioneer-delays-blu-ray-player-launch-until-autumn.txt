The company didn't announce exactly what's holding them back, but we wouldn't rule out lack of content as at least part of the cause. Don't worry Pioneer, we still love you for your BDR-101A, but for right now we have to go sit and stare longingly at the online manual for Samsung's upcoming BD-P1000.
