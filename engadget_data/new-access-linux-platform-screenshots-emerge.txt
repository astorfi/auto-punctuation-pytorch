Admittedly, a few of the captures look mighty similar to those we saw back in February, but the new "User Experience" demonstration vividly depicts the screens found when visiting your Contacts, Photos, Music Player, Dialer, Home / Incoming Call screens, and Launcher. Go on, hit up the gallery for some high-resolution footage.[Via Treonauts]
