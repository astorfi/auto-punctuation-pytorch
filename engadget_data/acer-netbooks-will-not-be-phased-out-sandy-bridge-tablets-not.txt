Stop ordering the caskets! Clearing up yesterday's somewhat shady reports, Acer's PR team has issued an official press release stating that company has no intentions to halt production on its Aspire One line of netbooks. Instead it claims that its new array of Android tablets "will find their space next to netbooks and notebooks." In addition to that, Acer's taking on the Sandy Bridge tablet rumor that also spouted up, and clarifying that tablets based on Intel's new laptop / desktop platform "are not yet foreseen." That syncs up with what we had heard yesterday -- that Acer's announced 4.8-, 7-, 10-inch Android tablets will launch in April in the US and that it would likely wait for the forthcoming ultra-low voltage (ULV) Sandy Bridge parts if it were in fact going to put Intel's next generation Core processors into tablets. That certainly clears up a lot -- hit the break for Acer's official statement.
