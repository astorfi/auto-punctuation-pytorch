After nearly being banned in India in 2010, BlackBerry has finally reached an agreement with the Indian government regarding surveillance in the name of security. According to a leaked document from the country's Department of Telecommunications that was obtained by The Times of India, it'll soon be possible for the government to see who you're emailing, who you're BBMing, the read-states of your BBM messages and even which websites you're visiting (hello!). An unnamed BlackBerry spokesperson is emphasizing that this is all legal, adding that those who use BlackBerry Enterprise Server will not be monitored -- which makes for an eyebrow raising sales pitch. There's no official date as to when this system turns on, but the report says the required equipment is "ready for use."
