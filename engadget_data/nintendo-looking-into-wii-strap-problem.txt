All the same, Satoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto came out of the woodwork the other day to poke fun at these exuberant gamers, and to promise investigation of the issue. Iwata spun it all as a positive thing: "Of course before the launch of the Wii hardware Nintendo had a number of tests on the durability of everything, including the strap, but our understanding right now is that even beyond our expectations people are becoming more and more excited playing with the Wii." In comparison, Shiggy was a bit more down to earth: "We are encouraging people to understand that you really don't have to be so excited, but rather you need to understand the control and then you're going to be the best player. We are looking into the situation to see if there are additional methods to encourage people to kind of calm down so they would never throw away the controller itself." Nintendo also is offering a no-slip glove to help out, and of course that advisory email, but we're pretty well convinced by now that with that many of these things out there, somebody, somewhere is going to be stupid or clumsy enough to hurt themselves, others or the furniture.Read - Iwata and Miyamoto tell gamers to calm downRead - Wiimote replacement strap looks beefy
