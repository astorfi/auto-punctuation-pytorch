 

We already took a fresh look at the Vizio Tablet due this summer, but the company's main business is HDTVs and there it's on top of US LCD sales again, with more than 20 percent of the market in Q1. Of the top five selling TVs in Q1, four are Vizios priced at $698 or less, while the other is a $1,699 MSRP Samsung LCD. Vizio launched its lower end E3D line earlier this year, the next series on the way are edge-lit M3D models due in August and September that up the refresh rate to 240Hz, come with four pairs of passive 3D glasses instead of two and have a Bluetooth remote. Up next, the 21:9 ultrawidescreen sets we saw at CES are real and will ship in October as the Cinemawide series in 2560x1080 58- and 50-inch models. Finally, the top of of the line XVT 6 series will feature the new VIA Plus Google TV platform and are going to be available in 47- and 55-inch sizes, but won't ship until December There's still no prices for any of these yet, but we're going to guess they'll go low as they usually do. Check the press release for all the details after the break including a glancing mention of the Vizio Phone.
      

 

 		Show full PR text 		VIZIO Brings Theater 3D™ Technology to All with a Full Lineup of Bright, Flicker-Free 3D HDTVs Including Three 21:9 Cinemawide HDTV Models 		- VIZIO announces Theater 3D HDTVs in all three product groups -- E Series, M Series, XVT Series and the new 21:9 Cinemawide models, with screen sizes ranging from 32" to 65" 		IRVINE, Calif., and NEW YORK, June 22, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- (CEA Line Shows) -- VIZIO, America's #1 LCD HDTV Company*, revealed today their full line up of Theater 3D™ LCD HDTVs, including the ultra-sleek M Series models. All of VIZIO's new 3D HDTV models use Theater 3D passive 3D technology to achieve superior performance with a bright, crystal clear, virtually flicker-free 3D picture. Available in each of VIZIO's product series, E, M and XVT, in screen sizes ranging from 32 to 65 inches, Theater 3D technology will be available in 11 models at a wide range of performance and price levels, making the entertainment freedom of VIZIO's 3D technology available for all.

"VIZIO's early commitment to this direction, with its superior viewer experience, has enabled us to develop the industry's most comprehensive range of 3D HDTVs, ranging from introductory price levels to the most advanced cinematic displays available today." 		VIZIO Theater 3D HDTVs use a revolutionary new technology to deliver crystal-clear, flicker-free 3D that's up to 2 times brighter than current active shutter LCD TVs, with significantly less crosstalk, a wider horizontal viewing angle, and much less blurring with fast motion. Theater 3D eyewear produces far less eyestrain and headaches than active glasses, and is battery-free, lightweight and comfortable. Up to four pairs of Theater 3D glasses are provided with each set, and they are also available in a rapidly growing range of styles and colors from brand name designers. They even work in most 3D movie theaters! 		"Passive polarized 3D TVs will appeal to many consumers for a variety of reasons, and products at a variety of price points are possible too," noted Insight Media President, Chris Chinnock. "By 2014, sales of passive sets will outpace shutter glasses sets, according to our forecast." 		VIZIO's passive Theater 3D technology utilizes circular polarization, producing superior performance that results in a better viewing experience. This technology uses Polarizer Filters built into the TV, enabling viewers to use lighter and more stylish glasses instead of the bulky, heavy and uncomfortable active shutter glasses used for other 3D TVs. VIZIO's technology team was an early champion of this approach for 3D TV, which has led to VIZIO taking a market-leading position in the adaptation of Passive 3D technology for the home. 		"DisplaySearch is forecasting that North America 3D TV shipments will increase by more than 300% in 2011 to 7M units**, driven by a range of new 3D TV types, including circular polarizer filter systems like VIZIO's Theater 3D," stated Paul Gagnon, Director of North America TV Market Research, DisplaySearch. 		Each Theater 3D™ model supports the widest range of 3D encoding formats, ensuring compatibility with Blu-ray, broadcast, cable, satellite, and gaming sources. These formats include Frame Packing, Side-by-Side, Top and Bottom, as well as those with SENSIO® HiFi 3D and by RealD. 		VIZIO Smart Dimming for Leading Picture Performance 		VIZIO's Edge-Lit Razor LED™ technology with Smart Dimming™ is featured on the M Series models and the Cinemawide 50" and 58" HDTVs. VIZIO Smart Dimming™ intelligently controls each set's array of LEDs, which is organized in zones. Working frame by frame, based on the content being displayed, Smart Dimming adjusts brightness in precise steps down to pure black (where the LED is completely off). This cutting-edge technology minimizes light leakage and enables a Dynamic Contrast Ratio of 5 Million to 1, for blacker blacks and whiter whites. 		The XVT Series models at 47" and 55" will utilize VIZIO's Full Array TruLED™ backlighting with Smart Dimming™ technology. With over 160 zones across the entire display, TruLED backlighting is able to control specific areas of the image to a much finer degree than edge-lit sets, resulting in even better blacks and higher contrast with life-like images that "pop" off the screen. 		VIZIO Internet Apps Deliver More Entertainment Freedom 		All of VIZIO's new Theater 3D models feature the VIZIO Internet Apps® (V.I.A.) Connected HDTV platform. VIZIO Internet Apps deliver unprecedented choice and control of web-based content directly to VIZIO televisions or Blu-ray players without the need for a PC or set-top box. 		VIZIO's new XVT Series models will include the next generation VIZIO V.I.A. Plus platform, which delivers a unified and intuitive user experience across multiple devices, including HDTVs, Blu-ray players, tablets and more. 		Navigating VIZIO Internet Apps is simple, using the QWERTY keypad built into the included remote control (most models). State of the art wireless Internet access is available through built-in 802.11n Wi-Fi (many models with Dual Band Wi-Fi), allowing viewers to enjoy the convenience of on-demand movies, TV shows, social networking, music, photos and more with just the push of a button. 		Audio for a Home Theater Experience 		The stunning 3D video of the Theater 3D™ sets is matched by the latest high performance audio technologies from SRS Labs. SRS technologies help deliver an immersive, virtual, high definition surround sound through StudioSound™ HD -- the ultimate all-in-one audio suite designed specifically for flat panel TVs. Years of excellence in audio, practical experience, and patented technologies allow StudioSound HD to deliver the most immersive and natural surround sound ever using built-in TV speakers. The suite also delivers remarkably crisp and clear dialog, rich bass, an elevated soundstage and consistent, spike-free volume levels. StudioSound HD features optimized audio presets for movies, news, sports and music while also providing a built-in EQ toolset for peak audio performance. 		Experience M Series Theater 3D™ at Home 		VIZIO's newest Theater 3D™ set to hit the shelves this summer is the sleek and stunning M Series. At only 1.2" thin*** (42" and 47" models. 55" model is just 1.6" thin***), this HDTV makes the most incredible technology on the market available at the best value. Not only will you have beautiful LED 2D picture quality at 42", 46" and 55" sizes, but the latest addition of VIZIO's Theater 3D technology to this series will make this the perfect centerpiece to any family room. Pair that with four pairs of stylish Theater 3D™ glasses and built in VIZIO Internet Apps, and make your family room the number one summer destination. 		Cinemawide HDTV Ultra-Widescreen 		VIZIO's Cinemawide HDTV™, 21:9 aspect ratio TVs are the ultimate display for cinema enthusiasts. Its unique ability to display films created in the CinemaScope 2.35:1 aspect ratio on its full screen, without any black bars, means viewers will see each frame of the movie as the director intended, providing an immersive movie experience at home. On traditional HDTV models, prime screen real estate is taken up by these black bars, forcing home theater enthusiasts to stretch and zoom in. Now instead of a stretched and distorted picture, VIZIO's Cinemawide sets ensure movie buffs will never have to miss an inch of the action. 		Most HDTVs have an aspect ratio of 16:9 (sometimes called 1.78:1), with a native resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 (Full HD). This aspect ratio was selected as the ATSC HDTV standard as a compromise between television's original aspect ratio (4:3 or 1.33:1) and the wider 1.85:1 aspect ratio selected for the many Hollywood movies. Big-budget Hollywood blockbusters, though, are usually filmed in the much wider 2.35:1 or 2.39:1 aspect ratios. VIZIO's new Cinemawide HDTVs accommodate these "CinemaScope" or "anamorphic" aspect ratios well with a 2.37:1 (21:9) aspect ratio. So you'll be able to watch classics and today's best movies in the film's original aspect ratio and without black bars. 		Cinemawide HDTV also takes VIZIO Internet Apps to the next level, making its use more seamless than ever. While watching a pixel-perfect 16:9 full HD image, full size and in the correct aspect ratio on the right side of the screen, users can simultaneously browse and use VIZIO Internet Apps on the left side of the screen -- with both images presented with no compromise in resolution or size. 		"Connected TVs are expected to account for 20% of Global TV Shipments in 2011, rising to 122 million units globally by 2014**, representing one of the most exciting areas of growth in the TV industry and ultra-wide aspect ratio TVs, such as 21:9, and will enable consumers to view their TV content and Internet content simultaneously without overlap," stated Gagnon.
