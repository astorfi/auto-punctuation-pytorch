Designed to care for the elderly or the physically less-able, it sprays water, shampoo and conditioner over your bonce while 24 robotic fingers knead at your scalp. The company claims that it offers a more satisfying and relaxing experience than a wash from a human, unless you remember what happened when Mr. Kinney tested ED 209. If you're in the Osaka region, you've got until June 10th to get down there and have a go yourself -- for everyone else, there's a video after the break.
