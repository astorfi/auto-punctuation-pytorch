The latest version of Firefox (22) is full of big new features. Most notably, the latest update adds support for 3D gaming (care of Epic Games), for video and voice calls as well as file sharing "without the need to install additional software or use third-party plugins," and for a new version of JavaScript that Mozilla's calling, "supercharged." Mozilla's even got a 3D game for you to play called BananaBread, so you may put the company's claims through the wringer.


Should that not be enough for you diehard Firefox devotees, there's also a thrilling update that'll show download progress on OS X directly in the Dock icon. Take a breath and a seat, and maybe download the latest Firefox build right here when you've cooled down.
