 If you managed to grab a Wii U ahead of today's festivities, you'll now be able to fall into carb-heavy slumber while watching your favorite YouTube hits. Users can browse through the GamePad but also beam the video content through to their big screen, all in a navigation setup resembling its predecessor's YouTube client, although shortcuts are now more visible along the left edge. Download the app for free, direct from your Wii U menu, starting today.
