While they were tinkering, Sony went ahead and slapped in a 2.16GHz Core 2 Duo T7400 processor and gave the graphics a needed bump with an nVidia GeForce Go 7600. These additions to Sony's all-in-one PC with integrated TV-tuner will drive the cost up to Â¥359,800 or about $3,058 when it hits the shelves in Japan starting November 6th. What, you do want Blu-ray don't you? [Via Impress]
