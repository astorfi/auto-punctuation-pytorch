Windows Phone users have been waiting years to have all their notifications in one convenient place, and over the past few months, there have been multiple reports that a notification center will come with WP 8.1. Today, a video showed up on Unleash the Phones that appears to confirm those earlier rumors. The feature apparently will be called Action Center, and packs many of the same capabilities that Android and iOS users have enjoyed for some time now -- namely app and system notifications available via a swipe down from the top of the screen.


Additionally, users get quick access to four shortcut buttons for often toggled settings (WiFi, Bluetooth, screen brightness, etc.). The best part is, those shortcuts can be tailored to users' preferences, unlike the set-in-stone settings toggles in Android and iOS. Oh, and speaking of WiFi settings, the folks at Windows Phone Central revealed that 8.1 will also allow users to switch it off for a set amount of time, after which WiFi will turn back on automatically. We aren't sure exactly how such capability benefits users, but we're sure you fine folks will figure it out, assuming it's still around when WP 8.1 rolls out to the public.
