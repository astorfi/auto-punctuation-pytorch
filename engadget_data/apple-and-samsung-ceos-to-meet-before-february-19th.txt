Previous attempts by Apple and Samsung to negotiate a truce in the patent wars haven't exactly panned out, but they haven't given up hope yet. The companies' CEOs have just agreed to attend mediated settlement discussions no later than February 19th, potentially averting a trial in March (and likely future legal action). We'd like to believe that Apple and Samsung will finally reach an understanding, but we're not optimistic given how long the two have been at each other's throats.
