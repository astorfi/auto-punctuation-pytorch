It was a late night of counting (and recounting) votes (just kidding, we didn't count all those thousands of votes-our interns did), but we've tallied up the final voting in the 2004 Engadget Awards and are ready to announce the results. Thanks to everyone who voted and/or submitted nominations. Our congratulations go out to everyone who won, you should be receiving a very heavy "e"-shaped statuette sometime in the next six to eight weeks.


And now, on to the winners!
