We're a little worried about that drive-on-drive configuration they've got going on, but if you were curious to check out more of the intricacies of the M1730's chassis, both internal and external, here's your shot. Of course, there's nothing more we can tell you in terms of the specs this laptop's going to have, every single detail is already out there. All we can do is wonder what it's going to cost and whether they'll keep that September 21st launch date.
