Well we've made it to our tenth show, and it was nothing short of explosive! For our entry into the world of double digits, we sat down with Late Night host (and all around awesome dude) Jimmy Fallon for a lengthy and hilarious conversation about games, gadgets, "The Wizard," and much, much more. Then Microsoft's Kudo Tsunoda joined the team onstage for a demo of the company's Kinect -- including a look at how the underlying tech actually works. Finally, Josh, Nilay, Paul, and Joanna sat down to rap about -- and play with -- the latest and greatest gadgets (including some unreleased gear). Oh yeah, and then we had a near riot during the giveaways! It was one crazy party, and if you couldn't be in the crowd, this is the next best thing. What are you waiting for? Watch it now!
