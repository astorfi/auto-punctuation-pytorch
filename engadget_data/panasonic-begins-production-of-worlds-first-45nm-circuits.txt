More specifically, they've started manufacturing a 45nm-based UniPhier (Universal Platform for High-quality Image Enhancing Revolution) at their new semicoductor factory in Uozu, Japan. In other words, we're due to see more powerful A/V gear from Panny capable of processing a pair of 1080p displays in parallel, H.264 encoding, symmetric multi-processing, and high-performance 3D graphics from circuitry consuming about half the power and surface area of traditional 65nm-based processes. Really, what's not to love?
