At first glance, this one sure seems to hit most of the right marks, with it packing 100W of power, two four-inch woofers, two one-inch tweeters, and Bongiovi Acoustic's     proprietary Digital Power Station processor, which iHome says helps make this the most advanced speaker system they've ever developed. You'll also get a standard AUX input to accommodate your other devices, plus an A/V output and, of course, a remote control. Unfortunately, there's no word of a price or release date just yet, but we're guessing iHome won't be holding onto those details for too much longer.[Via iLounge]
