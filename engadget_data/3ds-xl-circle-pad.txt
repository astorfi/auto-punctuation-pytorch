  Nintendo rather quietly announced that it'll be bringing the Circle Pad Pro to its colossal 3DS XL handheld. The release doesn't go into the specifics beyond confirming the eventual arrival of the accessory, which adds a second analog stick (and a few more centimeters of heft) onto the already roomy device. There's no word on pricing or availability, with both currently marked as "undecided," but hopefully the company will make its mind up before the start of the holiday season. The original Circle Pad add-on cost Â¥1,500 ($19.50), so we expect this will run about the same amount. It's unclear thus far if the device will launch outside of Japan, but we expect to hear more shortly.
