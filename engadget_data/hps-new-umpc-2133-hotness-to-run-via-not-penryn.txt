UMPC Portal has word from a supposed industry insider that the computer is not running an Intel chip as previously suggested, but instead will rock the range of VIA processors. That means the computer could fight it out with Eee PC in the low-end with a C7 processor, or adopt one of those upcoming Isaiah chips and duke it out with Penryn ultraportables. If this is true it'd be a big win for VIA, and consumers might just get some budget-friendly excitement out of the deal as well.
