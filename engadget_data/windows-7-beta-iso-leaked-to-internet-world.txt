That is, if you're willing to, you know, break the law and download the ISO that's floating around on BitTorrent trackers all over the place. The good news here is that the leak is apparently a quite stable, newer beta version (build 7000) than previously spied (6801). We wouldn't know, of course (we try to walk the straight and narrow), but let us know if you've got your hands on it... how's it treating you?[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
