 The MicroSolutions LockBox updates your good old, well, lockbox
(you know the one you stash in the back of your closet with some cash, passport and any special keepsakes you may have
accumulated) for the modern era. Since all your incriminating photos financial documents are now
digital they've made a box to match. Nothing too special here, it's just a USB2.0 hard drive (80GB, 100GB, 120GB
versions, with "larger sizes" available) with a fingerprint scanner that can store up to eight users, each with two
fingerprints. The drive can be one big block or can be partitioned into seven different drives, each with different
access control. A nice touch, that, since it allows the thing to be realistically used by more than one person who may
not want to share everything. The price information on the site can't be
correct, since it says $199, regardless of which one you choose, so we assume that's the cost of the 80GB one and that
prices go up with size.
