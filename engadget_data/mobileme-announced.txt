       Today Apple demoed the much anticipated MobileMe application that we were tipped to last month. Currently, we were correct in what we thought would be the features list:

Web version of mail, calendars, and contacts (look similar to desktop apps)
Old .Mac users will be transitioned over to MobileMe when it launches
Launch in early July
Same $99 /year price that we've all come to expect 
Sync between iPhone, iPod touch, Mac, and PCs

As soon as we have more information, we will post about it. Be sure to stay tuned to TUAW as we have continuing coverage of WWDC.
