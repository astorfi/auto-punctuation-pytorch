So who's going to be the successor to the BlackBerry throne? Well, according to Good's latest report, Apple devices have fast become the preferred companions for its customers, and it looks like the iPad's leading the way. The enterprise provider shows that in Q2 2011, users activated more iPads than Android smartphones and tablets combined. What's more, iPads made up 95 percent of tablet activations, with Android tablets taking in only 3.1 percent. Smartphone adoption was a slight bit more balanced, but Apple still came out on top with 66 percent over Android's 33 percent. That's all well and good, but what we really want to know is who's got the stuff to win the three-legged race at the company picnic? For those of you visual learners, a representative bar graph of Good's results awaits you after the break.
