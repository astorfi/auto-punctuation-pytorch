He's calling it a big update with the promise of fewer dropped calls, big battery improvement, and faster backups. Is this a dream? We'll find out when it's released this Friday.P.S. No mention of copy and paste.Update: 2.1 will be available for iPod touch owners for $10. Come on, you didn't really expect it to be free did you? There's a "buy now" button at the end of that link but it only downloads v2.0 at the moment.Update 2: Fine print says free to those who paid for iPod touch 2.0 update. Lucky you. [Thanks, Foad]
