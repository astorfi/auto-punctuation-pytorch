 At this point we've heard so many predicted launch dates for Amazon's Kindle ebook reader we're a little jaded about the whole thing, but CNET is reporting that their always-reliable "industry sources" have confirmed a Monday launch for the device and service. The specs will apparently remain consistent with what we've been hearing for so long now -- $399, 6-inch screen, no integrated backlight, WiFi, EV-DO on Sprint for OTA book purchases, and a big ol' dose of the ugly -- but rumors are rumors, so don't get too mopey if Monday comes and goes with no announcement.[Thanks, Brian]
