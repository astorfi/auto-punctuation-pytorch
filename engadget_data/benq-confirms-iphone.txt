 The good folks at Morgan Stanley have alreadydone all they could to convince anyone who wants to believe that Apple's working on an iPhone. Now another source has apparently come forward tobuttress the claims. According to the Australian site Smarthouse, an executive at BenQ has confirmed plans for the phone, saying that "BenQ willnot be making it ... however several of our suppliers have been approached to manufacture parts. Among manufacturers inTaiwan it is common knowledge." While we have no way to confirm the alleged exec's account, it does jibe withMorgan Stanley's claims that various Taiwanese manufacturers have been contacted to work on the project. If it's truethat this is "common knowledge" in Taiwan, though, we expect that Stevie J. will be sending his minions tothe island any day now. Apple's been pretty good about avoiding leaks from manufacturing partners, and if tongues arewagging in Taiwan, some of these contracts may just end up getting shifted across the Strait. (And, yes, the pic is oneof the many iPhone fakes out there; we sort of like this one, since it's based on the original iBook, a design Appleabandoned years ago.)[Thanks, Mike]
