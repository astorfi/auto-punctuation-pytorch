 Last week we put a Slingbox AV out to give away, and we've got a winner! Randy P is taking home that AV, but today we're giving away the new top of the line Slingbox, the Slingbox PRO. This thing pretty much does it all, including high def, so today in order to have your chance to take home a PRO we want you to leave us a comment telling us what kind of phone (or laptop) you have that you're planning on using this thing with. You'll have until next Wednesday (the 18th), then we'll pick the winner at random, assuming s/he follows the rules:

You may enter other Engadget contests, however...
You may only enter this contest once; if you enter more than once on this particular contest post you'll be automatically disqualified and barred from all future giveaways. (Yes, we have robots that thoroughly check to ensure fairness.) You may enter future Engadget relaunch giveaway contests though!
You can only win once. (If you win and then try to go for a second prize during our relaunch giveaways, you'll be automatically disqualified, etc.)
This contest is open to the US only, sorry!
You will be shipped your PRO when all the contests are up, so sit tight!

Good luck, and be sure you've entered our other contests, as well!
