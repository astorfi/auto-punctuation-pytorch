But, this isn't a loss for MakerBot Industries, because it's being replaced by the Replicator 2, the newest model of 3D printer from the company. This is a big boy version of its previous devices that were aimed more at tinkerers than serious designers, and that's reflected in the $2,199 price. The build plate is significantly bigger, with the ability to spit out creations that measure 11.2 x 6.1 x 6.0 inches (410 cubic inches). That's a full 37 percent larger than the original Replicator, but the machine itself is the same exact size. The frame is no longer assembled from laser-etched wood, instead there's a powder-coated steel frame with PVC plastic sides to help shield the various moving parts and lend an air of professionalism to the affair. The extruder is designed specifically for use with MakerBot PLA, a new plastic material based on corn, that Bre Pettis claims wont expand when exposed to the heat -- which means it wont contract when it cools, leading to smoother printed objects and less cracking. The new printer has a resolution of 100 microns, by comparison, the original Replicator had a layer resolution of 270 microns. Now each layer of plastic is as thin as a sheet of copy paper, resulting in smooth printed prototypes.
