 If you thought March was far away, be prepared to thumb your calendar to an even further date for the BlackBerry Q10. According to AP, CEO Thorsten Heins has said that the physical keyboard iteration of BlackBerry's new OS will arrive around 8-10 weeks after the Z10 makes its eventual appearance on American shores. Heins added that release dates would vary between the major carriers, but the company maintains that the Q10 will arrive in other markets (likely including parts of Europe) some time in April. Guess we'll hold onto our aging Bold until then.
