 A new study conducted by CarnegieMellon University says the use of cellphones on airplanes can "impact a plane's navigation or other systems."This study wasn't conducted in a lab, but on actual flights across three airlines in the Northeast and found that"several" cellphone calls are typically made on commercial flights during takeoff and approach (no surprisethere; that's when you get the best signal)Â  -- the most critical stages where accidents occur. Seems that withthe assistance of the cellphonehating FAA, researchers were able to stow a broadband antenna attached to a portable spectrum analyzer in a piece ofcarry-on luggage. The FCC, remember, is conducting its own independent study of in-flight cellphone usage which shouldwrap up by year-end. Whatever, let's be clear, we don't want to sit tethered to some blowhard detailing the advantagesof English style knitting over Continental, mkay? This isn't just an issue about safety.[Via TheWireless Report]
