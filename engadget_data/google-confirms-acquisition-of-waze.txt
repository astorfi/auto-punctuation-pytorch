One of the more persistent acquisition rumors as of late has come true: Google just confirmed that it bought Waze. As many expected, the deal will see Waze largely operate independently of its new parent while supplying Google Maps with traffic update features. The stand-alone Waze app, meanwhile, will receive some of Google's know-how in search. While the two sides haven't discussed the much ballyhooed (and reportedly $1 billion-plus) purchase price, we suspect it was just large enough to snub Facebook.
