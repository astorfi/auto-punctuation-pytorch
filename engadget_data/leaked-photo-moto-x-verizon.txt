What's said to be the Moto X has been breaking cover left and right, and now it's made yet another appearance. Android Central has scored a new photo of the device in question, and while it looks nearly identical to an earlier snapshot, a keen eye will notice a Verizon 4G logo sitting in the status bar. The outlet also notes that the soft navigation keys are slightly translucent like those in the previous leak, which may point to an unreleased version of Android. Paired with an internal document from Big Red that pegs the hardware for an August 23rd arrival, it looks like the Moto X is a sure bet on the carrier.


Update: It bears mentioning that an unknown Moto phone we saw way back in March may be the same model. Head past the break to check out the video.
