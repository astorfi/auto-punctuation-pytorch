But for the budget-conscious globetrotter, there's a strong case to be made for its awkwardly named Gallant Duo's serviceable specs, dual SIM support and affordable Â£149 ($230) off contract price tag. The 4.3-incher, available now for pre-order on Expansys, packs a qHD display, single-core 1GHz MTK 6575 processor, 4GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD), a 5-megapixel rear camera and 1,500mAh battery into an unassuming chassis. Sure, this slightly above average handset won't garner the envy of the quad-core crowd, but it'll at least let you sit confidently at the ICS table. Check out the source below to reserve your claim for this under the radar offering.
