Nothing more to see in specs land, but a few highlights are the 256MB GeForce Go 7400, 4GB of RAM and built-in camera that you can configure the 12.1-inch WXGA M1210 with (which has a pretty reasonable base configuration going for $1300) and those NVIDIA Quad SLI and PhysX cards you can get squeezed into the XPS 700.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]Read - XPS M1210Read - XPS 700
