Before the start of season two on Valentine's Day, Netflix has a gift for the legions of House of Cards fans. Deadline reports that the streaming outfit confirmed that it has renewed the political drama for a third season. When the series started, it was planned as a two-season run with a $100 million investment in tow, so this marks the first renewal for Kevin Spacey & Co. Of course, it's no secret that the show has continued to gain momentum while amassing a respectable trophy case. And don't forget: it'll even be in 4K.
