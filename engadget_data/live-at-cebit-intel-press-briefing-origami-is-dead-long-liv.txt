 So we hitthe Intel press briefing this morning and Intel, did indeed give Microsoft their 30 seconds to standhand-in-hand and announce those three new UMPCsfrom Samsung, ASUS, and Founder. Ok, it was more like 5 minutes but that's it, which is actually just about right.Afterall, nothing new was revealed, only that their contribution to the new UMPCs is theinclusion of the Microsoft Touch Pack. Intel also told us they will increase UMPC performance by a factor of 10"over the next 5 years." The rest of the briefing? Well, do you really want to hear about Viiv and Core Duoall over again? Didn't think so. Money shot after the break of two execs holding UMPCs apparently for the first time.
