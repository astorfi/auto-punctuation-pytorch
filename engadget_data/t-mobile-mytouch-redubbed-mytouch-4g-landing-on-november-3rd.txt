T-Mobile just announced the launch details for its latest HSDPA+ handset, with a November 3rd touchdown date (possibly to go along with new data plans?) and a $200 pricetag (after $50 mail-in rebate). But just to spice things up a little bit, T-Mobile also swapped names on the phone: what was previously known as the myTouch -- a back-to-basics follow-up to the original myTouch 3G and myTouch 3G Slide -- is now the myTouch 4G. In fact, it looks like T-Mobile has had this name for a little while, but was just waiting for the right moment to spring it on us. Wait, you didn't know HSPA+ was 4G? Ah, welcome to Sprint / Verizon / AT&T's branding nightmare.
