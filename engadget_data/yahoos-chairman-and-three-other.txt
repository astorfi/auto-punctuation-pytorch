  Out with the old, in with the new, eh? Yahoo certainly subscribes to that philosophy, as it's already shuffled out Jerry Yang in favor of Scott Thompson as its CEO, and now the company will be adding four fresh faces to its board. Among those departing Yahoo is Roy Bostock -- which ends his four year reign as Chairman of the board -- who is perhaps most well-known for having a hand in turning down Microsoft's money in 2008. With this most recent shuffling at the top, Yahoo's down to just seven board members, but the search is on to find replacements for the departed directors. Who will be the lucky chosen ones? No one can say for sure, but given Yahoo's declining status, whoever joins up will have their work cut out to get the company back on top.
