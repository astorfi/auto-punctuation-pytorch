No big surprises in the filing, although it looks like the PSP Jr. will only be able to output game video via component, while UMD and Memory Stick movies get composite output as well. Other than that, the PSP 1.1 seems ready to go -- those of you too anxious to wait until September can hit the read link for the full FCC file.
