 This evening, Sony launched an update the Vaio XL2, predictably named the XL3. As we told you earlier, this newcomer has a Blu-ray burner, NTSC and ATSC tuners (with CableCARD support), four flash card slots, four USB ports, two FireWire ports, and Ethernet, plus HDMI, component and S-Video jacks. But what about the true belly of the beast? How about an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, a NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GTL graphics card, 2GB of RAM and a so-so 500GB hard drive -- definitely a solid foundation. Oh, and did we mention that there's liquid cooling embedded inside this little bundle of joy? Intrigued? You've got until March to gather up $3,300. Check out the next page for a shot of the rear ports.
