 
Panasonic is going at it from all angles today, with three new 12.1 megapixel LUMIX cameras with surprisingly distinct aims: 

LUMIX FZ35 (pictured) - The requisite "superzoom" of every lineup, the FZ35 doesn't disappoint on features, but the $400 pricepoint certainly pushes the limits of "consumer" camera. Features include 18x zoom and HD video recording, including a Creative Movie Mode with shutter speed and aperture settings for video. It also expands on typical facial recognition functionality with a "Baby mode" for... finding babies.
LUMIX FP8 - While it can handle HD video, the FP8 is more about looks. Still, the 12.1 megapixel sensor and 4.6x zoom aren't bad for the form factor -- though the $300 pricetag isn't nothing.
LUMIX ZR1 - Featuring the "world's first 0.3mm thin aspherical lens," the ZR1 manages a full 8x optical zoom while keeping its girlish figure when extended. There's also room for a 12.1 megapixel sensor. The cam goes for $280.

All the cameras pack optical image stabilization and facial recognition, and the ZR1 and FZ35 have a "High Dynamic Mode" which presumably emulates HDR photography to some extent. All three will be out in September. Full PR is after the break.





NEW PANASONIC LUMIX, 18X OPTICAL SUPERZOOM DIGITAL CAMERA FEATURES HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO RECORDINGLUMIX DMC-FZ35 Features New POWER O.I.S. and HD Motion Zoom Video CaptureSecaucus, NJ (July 27, 2009) – Today, Panasonic announced the new LUMIX DMC-FZ35, a digital camera featuring AVCHD Lite, High Definition (HD) video recording capability, combined with a powerful 27mm wide-angle, 18x optical zoom LEICA DC lens. A successor to the popular FZ28, the FZ35 packs enhanced creative features combined with the power to shoot HD videos, including motion zoom capabilities to take full advantage of the 18x zoom. The operational layout of the FZ35 includes a dedicated video record button, making it a true hybrid – a single model that performs seamlessly at capturing both still and motion images – while still providing smooth and easy operation in either mode. "The LUMIX FZ35 is truly unique as it includes advanced features like HD video recording, but still resembles and functions like an intuitive point-and-shoot with the ability to capture beautiful photos and video," said David Briganti, Senior Product Manager, Imaging, Panasonic Consumer Electronics Company. "This model's versatility makes it a great choice for a new or advanced user who wants a hybrid device that shoots high-quality still and motion images."For users looking for increased creativity while shooting both video and still images, the LUMIX FZ35 delivers. New manual controls and creative options, include:Creative Movie Mode – Allows the user to set the shutter speed and aperture manually to make even more impressive movies. Changing the shutter speed brings special effects to movies, which is especially suitable for shooting fast-moving subjects. The ability to control the aperture is convenient when there are several subjects at different distances. My Color Mode – This special option gives free reign to the user's creativity. The color, brightness and saturation parameters can be freely adjusted while seeing how the adjustments affect the picture, live on the monitor. High Dynamic Mode – Helps to capture a scene with moderate exposure even though the scene may contain both bright and dark areas. The 12.1 mega pixel-FZ35 features the upgraded POWER Optical Image Stabilizer (O.I.S.), which allows for double the repression power compared to the conventional image stabilization system, MEGA O.I.S., and ultra high-speed Auto Focus (AF) for capturing action scenes as they happen. Additionally, with the super-powerful 18x optical zoom lens, it is easy to capture subjects that are far away or take dramatic close-ups. With the enhanced energy-efficient image processing LSI – the Venus Engine HD* – the FZ35 has an extended battery life of approximately 470 pictures, making it the ideal choice for active photo enthusiasts. As with all Panasonic LUMIX cameras, the FZ35 features Intelligent Auto (iA) Mode, a suite of intuitive technologies including Face Detection, Intelligent Scene Selector, Intelligent Exposure and Face Recognition. With the improved Face Recognition, the FZ35 recognizes up to three faces simultaneously while taking photos** and allows users to specify the age of the registered subject. When babies under 3 years-old are registered, the camera will automatically switch to Baby mode if the baby appears to be in the frame. The LUMIX DMC-FZ35 will have a suggested retail price of $399.99 and will be available in September 2009 in black.*Based on a CIPA standard.**Turn Face Recognition item ON and register the person with full-face portrait on the shooting menu in advance.PANASONIC INTRODUCES NEW LUMIX DIGITAL CAMERA SERIES WITH AN EYE ON STYLISH DESIGN AND FUNCTIONALITYNew LUMIX FP8 has a 28mm wide-angle lens, 4.6x optical zoom, and records High Definition video Secaucus, NJ (July 27, 2009) – Today, Panasonic announced the new LUMIX DMC-FP8 digital camera as part of its new FP-Series, which pursues excellence in both design and function.
