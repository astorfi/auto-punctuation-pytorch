 Pioneer has just taken the wraps off its Inno XM2go player, and it sure does look like a big improvement over thefirst generation of XM2go devices. For starters, it's a lotsmaller and lighter at 3.7" x 2.2" x 0.6"n and just 4.5 ounces.  It'll also give you both live XMsatellite radio content and the ability to store up to 50 hours of XM content, or you can fill it up with your own MP3sor WMAs. The Inno also has a built-in FM transmitter that'll let you shoot that satellite signal to any radio. The unitalso has a full color 180x180 TFT that you can use to get stock quotes, sport scores and, of couse, song info. The one thing they haven't given deets on is battery life, which could make the deal a little less sweet. Look for itsometime this quarter at a MSRP of $399.
