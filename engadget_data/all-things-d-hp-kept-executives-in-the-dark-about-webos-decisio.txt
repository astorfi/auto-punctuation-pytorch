 If you thought the saga surrounding HP's decision to cease production of webOS devices was over, you may be mistaken. All Things D reported yesterday that key executives -- specifically Todd Bradley of the currently-in-limbo Personal Systems Group and former Palm CEO Jon Rubinstein -- weren't informed of the move until Sunday night. The blog's inside sources say the two plan to remain at their posts for the time being, however, that could change dependent on what happens next with webOS. Those sources also noted that Rubinstein wasn't exactly thrilled about the timing of the TouchPad's release, saying CEO Leo Apotheker had failed to make good on a public promise to ship the tablet only when it was "perfect." So will they stay or will they go? It's anyone's guess at this point, but you can bet we'll keep you posted.
