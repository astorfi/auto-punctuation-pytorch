When asked by the Financial Times, Microsoft's Robbie Bach said the $279 console was designed to draw in gamers who are "more casually focused, they're looking for a new family experience or they're more price focused." Robbie might want to tell the rest of Microsoft that the cat's out of the bag though -- their PR reps are still telling our buds at Joystiq that they don't have anything to announce.
