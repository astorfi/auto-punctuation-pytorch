 For Tesla owners looking at taking their electric vehicles out for some long haul driving, a plan to line the highways and/or byways with fast chargers should be welcome news. After mentioning the Supercharger Network as early as January, company founder Elon Musk tweeted tonight that it would officially be unveiled September 24th. So, what will it actually look like? Musk claims it will "feel like alien spaceships landed at highway rest stops," where owners may be able to enjoy amenities like charging that takes their batteries from ten to 90 percent in just 45 minutes or fast battery swaps. We've marked our calendars, check out AutoblogGreen for more speculation on just what Supercharging may entail, including the potential that the stations themselves will be solar powered.
