It's looking just the same, but this time Japanese site ITmedia has managed to get a cloeseup with the device. As far as anyone knows, the EyeToy is still due for September, but the picture does reveal the camera to be a 1.3 megapixel model. Sony has been pretty mum about the capabilities of the camera other than a new video chat service, which is due for October, but we're sure they'll find a way to put all that faux-chrome goodness to good use.[Via Gotakon]
