We caught a glimpse of Samsung's MM-A920 the
other night (along with the Blade, er, we mean the A900),
but it took a good, reliable tipster to get us the real deets on what to expect from the forthcoming device. Basically,
expect similar specs as the A900: EV-DO, a 1.3
megapixel camera, MicroSD slot, and Bluetooth. Certainly not as desirable as its slimmer counterpart, but we have a
feeling it won't hit the pocketbook as hard, either.
