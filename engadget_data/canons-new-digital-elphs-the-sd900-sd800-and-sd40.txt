 Three really is the magic number, or at least Canon seems to think so: the company has just unveiled three new Digital ELPH cameras (Digital IXUS in Europe) with the SD900, SD800 IS, and SD40 all featuring an array of new features. Starting with the highest spec camera, the SD900 is a 10 megapixel 3x zoom jobbie, with a 2.5-inch LCD screen and 18 shooting modes, including that 1024 x 768, 15fps video capture mode that the G7 recently acquired. Stuck in the middle with you is the 7.1 megapixel SD 800 IS, the first ELPH to carry an image stabilized wide angle 28-105mm 3x zoom lens. Finally there's the SD40, the smallest model in the range that packs a 7.1 megapixel CCD and a 2.4x zoom lens into four differently colored titanium cases. All three new cameras feature the Digic III image processor, which means they'll all reap the benefits of face recognition (even higher definition warts 'n' all!), faster start up and general response times, as well as lower power consumption. Each one is also capable of super sensitive ISO 1600, although Canon's press release mentions that there's an ISO 3200 shooting option somewhere in the special scene modes. Pricing is set at $499, $399, and $349 for the SD900, SD800, and SD40 respectively, and all three should be available in October.[Via Dpreview]
