 
 Stop us (oh, oh, oh stop us) if you've heard this one before (you have): SpaceX has announced that it won't be able to make that May 7th launch date. The company hasn't disclosed the cause (the static fire tests seemed to go okay) but spokesperson Kirstin Grantham said that the company is working through the "software assurance process" with NASA. A new launch window hasn't been set, but the company says it'll tell all before the end of tomorrow -- they'd better, since the ISS crew have been waiting for these space-rations since November last year.
