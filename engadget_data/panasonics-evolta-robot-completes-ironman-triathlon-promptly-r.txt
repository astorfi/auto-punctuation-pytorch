After crawling out of the Grand Canyon and walking all the way from Tokyo to Kyoto, Panasonic's Evolta has finally conquered that Ironman Triathlon -- and it did so in impressive fashion. It all began on October 23rd, when the bite-sized bot and its AA rechargeable batteries embarked on the 230 kilometer (142.9 mile) race with the goal of finishing it within 168 hours. The Evolta ended up reaching this objective with time to spare, completing the run-bike-swim combo on October 30th, in just 166 hours and 56 minutes. The robot reportedly celebrated the achievement with a stiff erythropoietin cocktail. Re-live the magic after the break, in the full PR.
