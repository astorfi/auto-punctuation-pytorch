The folks at [H] Enthusiast got to see the chip in action, and were most impressed by the 1.8GHz bugger's ability to run Crysis. Apparently the folks at Via are fairly certain their chip can best the upcoming UMPC-friendly Silverthorn chips from Intel, and it seems like Crysis is about as good a benchmark as any. We're sure to hear more about this little rivalry in the coming months, but we like the way things are headed.  [Via Wired]
