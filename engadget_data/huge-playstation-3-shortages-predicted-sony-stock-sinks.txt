 There's been a lot of speculation that Sony won't hit its PlayStation 3 launch targets for 2006 (which includes 2 million units at launch, and another 2 million units by the end of the year), but it sounds like they were dealt a pretty severe blow by Japanese brokerage Mitsubishi UJF Securities. The Japanese investment firm predicted major component shortages that would hamper sales by as much as a million units (trust us, that's a lot of units), and lowered its rating, causing Sony's stock to drop 3%. It's a harsh day in the office for Hirai, Kutaragi, and Stringer, but there's no doubt about it, and Sony's once again going to have to seriously prove itself come this holiday season.[Via GamesIndustry.biz]
