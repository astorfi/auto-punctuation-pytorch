 This is going to be huge. Unfortunately, we're talking size not marketplace impact when Dell's 17-inch Precision "mobile workstation" rolls out this fall. This portable desktop replacement promises up to 1TB of storage configured in a dual-drive RAID configuration, quad-core processor, and 16GB of graphics memory (1GB for graphics) with enough oomph to power a pair of external 30-inch displays. It also includes a number of unidentified media slots and an integrated jog shuttle controller -- a pretty good hint at the mobile media types this laptop is targeting. Watch it all go down in the video after the break.Update: Heh, this is the same Dell leaked last month carrying the M6400 moniker.[Thanks, Gaurav S.]
