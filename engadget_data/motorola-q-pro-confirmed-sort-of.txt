 Details are WAY sketchy (for now), but buywindowsmobile.com has what appears to be the first confirmed evidence of an upgraded version of the Motorola Q called the "Motorola Q Pro". No word yet on specs (HSDPA fans keep your fingers crossed), but they're reporting that it will come in black and sport Motorola's MOTOPRO Mobility Suite, which is a software package aimed at enterprise users. We had heard some earlier rumors about an HSDPA-enabled Q getting out the door by Christmas, but according to these guys the release of the Q Pro is set for the first quarter of next year.
