We're hearing from TmoNews that one HTC devices leaked today -- the Sapphire -- is the G2, while another source is telling us that the Rhodium is the Wing II, giving T-Mob solid, high-end Windows Mobile and Android devices alike in the new year. The original Wing is older than your grandmother (bless her heart), and as for the G1... well, let's be honest, these guys can take as much Android gear as HTC will give 'em right now. Bring it, fellas.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
