The man once again returned with his Android-powered 5-inch display of choice, showing it off on stage at the Citrix Synergy conference this morning. Sure, we've seen the handset ad nauseum at this point -- we're even a proud owner of one prototype -- but here's the quote that piqued our interest: "this [phone] will be available starting next month, first with our partner 02 Telefonica [sic] in Europe, then later this summer with our pretty good partner here in the United States, AT&T." He couldn't be much more direct, and we couldn't get it from a more knowing source. Excited for the near future yet?
