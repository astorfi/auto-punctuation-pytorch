The most interesting of the bunch are the big, "quick to charge" BG-604 stereo cans with AVRCP remote control over your Bluetooth 2.0 equipped audio device. Expect 'em to go global in Q3 for a bit less than €140/$187. The wee 11.3-g, BH-803 and the 11-hour talk (5-hours after a 15-minute charge) BH-602 headsets are priced for less than €160/$214 and €90/$121, respectively.
