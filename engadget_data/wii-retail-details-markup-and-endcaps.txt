We got our hands on the CompUSA hardware / software markup sheet for Nintendo's new console, as well as some spy pics of some Target Wii endcaps and the variety of accessories those will be stocking, as well. No, we're not that hard up for stuff on the console, but we do think that $12.50 is a pretty weak margin on the console, while, as expected, games, and accessories have a much fatter profit for retailers. Anyway, check it out (price on the left is, of course, retail; price on the right is cost):WII CONSOLE - 249.99 / 237.50WII REMOTE CONTROLL - 39.99 / 32.00WII POINTS CARD - 24.99 / 17.00WII CLASSIC CONTROLLER - 19.99 / 14.50WII NUNCHUK CONTROLLER - 19.99 / 14.50WII GPAK ORGANIZER&TRAVEL - 29.99 / 18.95WII RAYMAN RAVING RABIDS - 49.99 / 41.2WII THE LEGEND OF ZELDA:TW - 49.99 / 40.00WII RED STEEL REVOLUTION - 49.99 / 41.22More pics after the break![Thanks, Los and Ian]
