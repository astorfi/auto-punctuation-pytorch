Now that the nation's second largest carrier has been granted a stay in its pending and publicly messy T-Mobile acquisition, vocal opponents like Sprint and C Spire are withdrawing their respective suits (and fangs) to block the merger for the time being. But don't take this latest courtroom move as a supportive change of heart -- both wireless companies will likely lawyer up again in the new year when these M&A wheels begin to roll anew. So while this potential AT&T&T deal appears to be dead in the water, there's always a chance it'll resurface with an extra face.
