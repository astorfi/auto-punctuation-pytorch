 While
a full list of backwards compatible at launch titles has still not been
released, Bungie posted some pics yesterday of what we can expect when
running Halo 1 & 2 on the Xbox 360. Both games will be capable of
running in 720p widescreen with full screen anti-aliasing which should
give a much cleaner look than is currently available. Backwards
compatibility doesn't really matter to me, because I'll be keeping my
Xbox to mod and run Xbox Media Center, but at least I won't have to
worry about how I want to play Halo 2 on Live anymore. Now if they'll just do the same for Rallisport Challenge 2,
check the link for some pictures from one of the games designers
showing what it would look like if upconverted to 720p w/ FSAA.
