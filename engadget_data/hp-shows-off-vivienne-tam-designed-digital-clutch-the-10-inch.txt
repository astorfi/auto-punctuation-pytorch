Not much is known about the internals, but the case sports an Asian-inspired peony flower design, and the screen fills the entire lid with very little bezel. If we had to guess, we'd say that it's more likely that there's a VIA Isaiah chip in there instead of an Atom, given the C7M found in the current Mini-Note, but we'll see -- and hopefully soon, since at least one HP rep apparently confirmed that the machine is the next generation Mini-Note.
