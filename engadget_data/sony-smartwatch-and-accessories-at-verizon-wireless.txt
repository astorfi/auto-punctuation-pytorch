 By and large Sony's wrist-born Android info center, the SmartWatch, has given enough utility to end up on a few of our wrists. Connecting to any Android 2.1 or higher smartphone via Bluetooth, the device has a capacitive screen for input and acts as a notifier for calls, messages or social networks. With a new SDK under its belt, it also supports 60 apps so far including an open-source music player and eight new games. Now you can grab one for $149.97 at Verizon Wireless' online or brick and mortar stores, along with accessories for it like extra straps and chargers. So if you've been looking for a way to stay on top of your social life at a glance, find your phone when it gets lost -- or even just check the time, believe it or not -- hit the source link below for more info.
