In an apparent attempt to bypass efforts to make phones more resistant to water seepage, certain cellphone makers have resorted to placing "water detection stickers" just within the phone's casing. These tell-tale pads turn to alternate colors if any moisture makes its way in, giving companies the perfect excuse to nullify warranties regardless of whether the malfunction was actually water-related. While we certainly imagine that waterlogged phones are among the highest claimed for replacement, this tiny sensor makes voiding a warranty an exercise in simplicity, as even a brief call while scurrying through the rain could eliminate any future coverage. While it has been said that placing a piece of "satin finish scotch tape" over the pad will forestall the colors from a-changin', just be sure to remove that extra bit of evidence before pleading your case.[Via Gadgetopia]
