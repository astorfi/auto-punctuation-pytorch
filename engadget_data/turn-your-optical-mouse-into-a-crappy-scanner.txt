Such is the case with the opticalmouse scanner hack, which uses the sensor inside the mouse to make a "ghetto b&w handscanner." Simplywiring the optical chip to a parallel port and installing the linked sofware allows you to patch together an absolutelyterrible looking scan. Still, we can never get too harsh on any device repurposing, no matter how pointless and uselessit is.[Via Hack-A-Day]
