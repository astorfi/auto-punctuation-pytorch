In a bid to capitalize on the positive momentum behind its excellent One smartphone, Bloomberg reports that HTC will be recruiting no less than (an actor who plays) Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. will allegedly feature in promotional campaigns as himself (not the aforementioned Avenger or even a time-travelling Holmes) and will even claim final say over creative elements -- hopefully ensuring any appearances Downey Jr. does make aren't as awkward as some recent efforts.
