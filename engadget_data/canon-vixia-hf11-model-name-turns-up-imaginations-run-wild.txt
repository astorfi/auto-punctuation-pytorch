When taking a peek at the Drivers & Downloads section for the DC320 DVD camcorder, you'll find a link for a PDF brochure of the VIXIA family that supposedly includes the HF11. Upon opening said file, however, you'll discover nary a mention of the mysterious item. A new model waiting just around the bend? A simple typo? A devilish trick played by the suits at Canon? The world may never know.  [Thanks, Dan]
