  Samsung's follow-up to the Galaxy SII is one hotly anticipated release, and amongst the swathes of design student mock-ups and plain old rumor, is the occasional word from the horses mouth. Speaking at Samsung Forum 2012 in Beijing, chief exec Kim Young-ha let slip that we'll possibly see the phone land in April, and not May as initially believed, stating "In order to increase sales of the Galaxy S3 as well as the Galaxy Note which is already very popular in China, the company is considering rescheduling the roll-out of the Galaxy S3 from May to April." So if your impatience was making you consider alternatives, it might be worth holding out just that little bit longer.
