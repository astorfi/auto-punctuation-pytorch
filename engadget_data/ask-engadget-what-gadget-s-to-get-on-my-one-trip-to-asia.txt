       We'll be honest -- Dave has run into a magnificent problem to have, but it's still an issue in need of an answer. And before you get too engrossed, may we remind you that you can send in questions of your own to ask at engadget dawt com. "I live in Canada and have relatives visiting Taiwan in the near future. What hawt Asia-only, non-igloo-related gadget should I ask them to grip for me? Thanks!" We're going to take the liberty of expanding this question to involve all of Asia, given that quite a few others are probably headed to Akihabara in the foreseeable future. So, what's the best gizmos(s) to pick up if heading over to the other side for what may be the first and last time ever?
