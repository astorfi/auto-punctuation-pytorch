 
So, that Apple-1 we saw a while back was auctioned off today, for a winning bid of Â£133,250, or roughly $211,535 -- not bad, considering that the original sale price was (believe it or not!) $666.66. According to the Wall Street Journal, a spokesman for Christie's in London called it "a record for a personal computer sold at auction." Besides the machine itself (with its 8-bit 6502 microprocessor and 8K RAM), the lot included a letter from a certain "Steven Jobs" with his parents' return address. If you happen to be the person who won the auction, we know a guy with a copy of Apple-1 BASIC.
