At the I/O developers conference this morning, Google announced that its low-cost VR headset, dubbed Cardboard, is now available for (official) use with the Apple operating system. The system has only been available for the Android OS since its debut at last year's I/O conference. Its associated app, however, has been downloaded more than a million times since then.



This year's headset iteration also sports some additional design improvements. The unit, for example, now accommodates phones with screen sizes of up to six inches. Its assembly has also been streamlined from 12 steps to just three. The unit's magnetic "switch" was revamped to work with all phones (and is now actually made of cardboard as well). You can download Cardboard for iOS from iTunes right now.
