Why roll out just one phone when you can add an L and make it two? The S75 and SL75 are successors to the
S65 and
SL65, respectively, and both are aimed towards business
users. The S75 (above) is a tri-band EDGE phone with 132 x 176 TFT 262k color display, 1.3 megapixel camera, USB 2.0,
Bluetooth, Infrared, and a media player that'll do MP3/AAC. Its two color variations ("Piano Blacl" and "Zirconia")
will both ship in October. The SL75 (pics after the jump) is a tri-band slider with the same screen, media player and
camera specs as its sans-L brethren, with an added 5x zoom. Two colors ("Onyx Black" and "Pure Silver") will start
shipping in Q3, but if you're dead set on "Polar White" to match your handbag, you'll have to wait til December.
