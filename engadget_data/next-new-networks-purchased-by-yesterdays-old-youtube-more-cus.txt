How about some rather more professional looking but still potentially unfunny content? Welcome to YouTube Next. That's what Next Now Networks is calling its new focus, "supercharging content creator development on YouTube" after being bought by that company, which itself is still a fairly recent Google acquisition. The Next New Networks goal was to work with independent "talent" to develop their online following, helping them find "paths to revenue." Along the way that company found itself somewhere south of $50 million dollars, according to The New York Times, and has lost its CEO in the progress. What's next for the two? More YouTube superstars, naturally.
