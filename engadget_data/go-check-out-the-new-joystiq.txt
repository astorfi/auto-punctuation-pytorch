Thrill to a completely redesigned and streamlined site, chill on the stunning new games database, drill... down into the archives of fantastic features and uproarious reviews, now all easily accesible with a deft move of the mouse or trackpad. In all seriousness though, the cats over at Joystiq have done an amazing job, and you should reintroduce yourself to the site. There's a ton new (detailed in a easy-to-digest blog post), so jump on over and read all about it!
