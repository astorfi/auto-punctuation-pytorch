It's the freakin' weekend, baby, and Vine has an app update for its most loyal Android users. (Actually, any Android user that has access to v4.0 or higher.) Semantics aside, the outfit's app has just been updated with push notifications and more sharing options... or so says its Twitter account. The Google Play link is still showing a prior description, but we're guessing the new build will percolate through momentarily.


Update: The refreshed version has arrived on Google Play, and mentions the sharing enhancements include the ability to share any public post to Twitter or Facebook.
