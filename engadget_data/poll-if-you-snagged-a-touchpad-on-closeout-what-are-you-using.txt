 

So, you've done the deed. You've purchased an HP TouchPad, despite having no intentions whatsoever to do so just a week ago. But hey -- a $400 discount can change perceptions. Now that you've got one (or have one en route), we're curious to know what you plan on doing with it. We've heard such far-flung ideas as using it as a digital photo frame, keeping it wrapped up for eBaying in 2049 or just stashing it nearby for those late-night couch surfing sessions. The future of webOS development may be lost (at least on these consumer devices), but there's still fun to be had with a hundred-dollar tablet. Share amongst yourselves in comments below -- we could all stand to hear a tip or two!
