Today, however, the handset gets its opportunity to bask in the spotlight, since it's the first of the group to obtain the FCC's nod of approval. No huge revelations were given, but the docs confirm quadband GSM and pentaband HSPA+ / WCDMA, a welcome treat for AWS fans. As always, we can't assume any carrier affiliation here, but at least we know the unlocked versions will work on AT&T and T-Mobile without a hitch. It looks like Huawei's still on track for a Q2 release -- let's hope the same is true for the D1's older siblings.
