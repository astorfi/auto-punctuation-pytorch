Remember how Samsung promised American Galaxy Gear owners an update that significantly improves third-party notification support? That update is at last rolling out -- three weeks behind schedule. Early stateside adopters can now read the basic content of Facebook Messenger conversations, Gmail messages, Hangouts messages and Twitter mentions from their smartwatches. The upgrade should also improve battery life, connection quality and S Voice search performance. While we'd prefer to receive upgrades in a more timely fashion, it's good to know that the Galaxy Gear is now much more useful to US wearers.
