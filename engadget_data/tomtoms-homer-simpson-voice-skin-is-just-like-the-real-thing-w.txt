 
Well, let's be frank. The Knight Rider GPS, while brilliant, is a bit of a stretch. Isn't it a little sad to be living out your boyhood fantasies of excitement and danger vicariously, behind the wheel of your '92 Buick Roadmaster station wagon? On the other hand, perhaps you're ready to put away your childhood dreams and hit the road in a manner more befitting your average schlub. The official Homer Simpson voice skin for the TomTom GPS features the voice of the iconic cartoon dad, including such gems as "Take the third right. We might find an ice cream truck! Mmm...ice cream." Psyched? We bet you are. Priced at $12.95 -- check out an audio sample after the break, and then hit the read link to pick it up it for yourself.
