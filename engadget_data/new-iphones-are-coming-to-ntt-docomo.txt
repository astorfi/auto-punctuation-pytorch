KDDI and Softbank already enjoy the fruits of Apple's labor. Now, according to a report from Nikkei, NTT DoCoMo could be joining the party later this month. When Cupertino takes the wraps off its latest iOS handset(s) on September 10th, its expected that DoCoMo will be added to the list of Japanese carriers selling the device. Rumors were circulating in late August that the two parties were in talks to bring the iPhone to Japan's largest mobile company, and now it appears to be a done deal. Unfortunately, there's not much detail beyond that. DoCoMo subscribers will just have to wait patiently for Apple to brighten their day.
