 Or at least thats what the Sports Video Group's survey hasuncovered (big surprise, with that name I really doubt the result was going to be most people get high definition forDiscovery channel). The "Inside the mind of the HD sports fan" uncovered several statistics that willprobably surprise very few of you.

39% of sports viewers are extremely disappointed when anevent they want to watch is not in HD
22% will watch an event they otherwisewould not have watched because it is in high definition
Nearly 50% of HDTV owners cited sports as thereason for their purchase

Hopefully the NBA is paying attention to studies like this, far too many timesthis season I've had to watch games in SD because they were not broadcast in high definition, or were not broadcast inHD nationally.
