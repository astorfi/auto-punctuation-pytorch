 It might not be the biggest nab of all time for Verizon, but a phone's a phone, and in this case, a phone isPantech's new PN-315. It's got all the trimmings of a low-frills clamshell, including hip T9 text input and a VGAcamera. There is, helpfully, an external display, but that's about all this phone has to boast about. Luckily it shouldbe cheap, but no word on when it will be out.[Via Slashphone]
