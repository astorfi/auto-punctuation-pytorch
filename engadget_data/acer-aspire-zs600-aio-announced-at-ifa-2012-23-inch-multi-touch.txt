At Acer's press conference here at IFA 2012, the company unveiled its new all-in-one PC: the Aspire ZS600. At first glance, the AIO's adjustable aluminum frame enclosure didn't much strike us "contemporary" per the company's claims, as it seemed to blend into the vast array of similar PCs showcased at the booth. And without any available keyboard dock to help us navigate that vibrant 23-inch full HD display, we were left to make use of the screen's 10-point multi-touch which proved a tad frustrating, bordering on ineffectual -- at least on this demo model. We also witnessed a considerable amount of glare in our brief time testing the product, though it's worth noting we were surrounded by a multitude of showroom lighting.

 Powering this multimedia-focused family AIO along is Intel's 3rd generation chipsets (up to Core i7) joined by Dolby Home Theatre 4.1 for superior sound and AcerCloud for convenient personal media streaming. The company's offering users the ability to configure it with up to 8GB of DDR3 RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GT 640, as well as a generous 2TB SATA hard disk. As far as optical options go, consumers can choose from a Blu-ray player or standard DVD drive. You'll have to sit tight for this fella to head to market, but rest assured you should see it on retails shelves before year's end -- we hope.
