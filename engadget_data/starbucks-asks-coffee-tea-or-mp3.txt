Starbucks, which already sells CDs in most of its stores, and which hasexperimented with CD-burning kiosks, plans to set up what the company calls "device fill-up" terminals in itsstores. The company says it is in discussions with several companies about developing the service. While it's too earlyto speculate about whose software or DRM the service will use, it's worth noting that the Starbucks CD-burning kiosksare powered by HP hardware and Microsoft software, and the two companies (which happen to be neighbors of a sort) havealso collaborated on wireless services in the past.
