That'll get you 21.5 inches of screen real estate, along with a full 1920 x 1080 resolution, a fast 2-millisecond grey-to-grey response time, a 50,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio, both HDMI and DVI ports, four USB 2.0 ports, and even a built-in 2 megapixel webcam that supports facial recognition in Windows Vista. Sold? Then hit up the link below to get your order in.[Thanks, ALCie]
