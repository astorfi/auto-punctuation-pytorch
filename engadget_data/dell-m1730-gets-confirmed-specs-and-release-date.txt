The new 17-inch, 10.6 pound entry will rock the much-loved Intel PM965 Santa Rosa chipset, a Core 2 Duo T7300, T7500, T7700, or X7800 CPU, an NVIDIA GeForce Go 8700M GT, up to 4GB of RAM, an optional Blu-ray drive, 802.11 (in varying configurations), plus an ExpressCard 54 slot, Bluetooth 2.0, and a slew of ins and outs (USB, DVI, Firewire, S-Video, etc. Additionally, Dell is going to a lot of trouble to "trick out" the laptop, offering customizable external LED lighting, adjustable keyboard lighting, and "flashy industrial design with color customization options." The laptop also curiously features a small "gaming LCD" display above the keyboard, for providing "additional information about the system or applications." Also of note is the fact that an Ageia PhysX Controller will be available as an add-on, as well as 2-megapixel, built-in webcam, and a variety of SATA hard drive options. The system will be available on August 27th worldwide, so stay tuned.
