Rock your world they won't, but Twelve South's BassJump might just add that low-frequency kick your unibody workhorse has been missing. The solitary speaker connects via USB and, through an analog-styled tuning app, augments the built-in speakers of the laptop with much-needed bass. If the styling didn't clue you in this is only for MacBooks and, at $80, seems to come at quite a premium over your average set of portable speakers. It's certainly nicer looking.
