  It wasn't too long ago that SugarSync overhauled a couple of the apps it serves on different platforms, but for whatever reason the iOS version wasn't included in that round of updates. Today, though, the cloud-based storage service is releasing a new version of its application for Apple devices that brings a fair bit to the table. Chief among the improvements is a completely redesigned UI that, according to the company, aims to provide a more consistent experience across all the apps it currently offers.

 iPod touch, iPhone and iPad users will also now see a new feature which allows any saved file on SugarSync to be searched from within the app, while "Open In" integrates deeply with the OS to make it easier to open / save docs via other services. SugarSync is also quick to point out that there are many more iOS features in the works (such as labels for folders), but we'll have to wait until a future release for those.

   · New Cloud Search added for quick access to any file or folder

   · "Open In" functionality allows users to save files from other apps directly into SugarSync

   SAN MATEO, CALIF., April 15, 2013– SugarSync, a premium service that lets you access, sync and share all of your files and folders across all your computers and mobile devices, today introduced a new iOS app addressing customers' most highly requested features for enhanced productivity on the go, and a completely redesigned interface. The latest app makes it easier than ever for Apple users to access and share files and folders from any computer or device directly from an iPhone or iPad. The free SugarSync for iOS app is available today and can be downloaded directly from the App Store.

    The newest features to SugarSync's iOS app include:

    New Simplified Design and Navigation - Today's update to the iOS app includes a simpler design and more intuitive navigation, allowing users to quickly access and share their files and folders. The new nav includes a device filter, which provides the ability to either view all of the folders in a user's SugarSync Cloud or only the folders syncing to a specific computer. Managing and accessing shared content has been simplified with the "Shared by Me" and "Shared with Me" sections.

    The redesigned iOS app brings a streamlined, modern user interface-creating a consistent UI design across all SugarSync platforms, including the SugarSync 2.0 desktop and Web applications.

    "Cloud Search" to Easily Navigate the Mobile Cloud – SugarSync's ability to sync any PC/Mac folder to an unlimited number of devices often means users have a ton of files and folders synced to one's personal Cloud. As a result, one of the most requested enhancements to date has been delivered upon with "Cloud Search." This feature allows for easy search and discovery of any file or folder synced to the SugarSync Cloud from any computer or device. Search results are grouped into different categories such as folders, documents, photos, videos, etc. making it even easier to navigate all the content.

    "Open In, From Anywhere" Feature – The new iOS apps includes an "Open In" feature that allows users to open and save files from other apps directly into their SugarSync app. For example, if a Word document is received via email, there's now the option of saving this document to the SugarSync Cloud straight from an iPhone or iPad (versus the desktop), as well as the option of selecting the folder to save it to.

    "With our ever-increasing mobile jobs and lifestyles, we not only recognize the importance of enabling people to access all of their data anytime, anywhere, but also how we can make it easier for people to be more productive when they're on the go," says SugarSync CEO Mike Grossman. "We've kept the same powerful features our users have come to rely on in the original iOS app and enhanced this version with some highly requested new features such as Cloud Search and "Open In" functionality."

   SugarSync has always offered the ability to sync any folder on any computer –versus boxing content into one specific syncing folder-allowing the flexibility of having all important folders and files synced to one's SugarSync Cloud. This unique and essential feature will always be the foundation of SugarSync and is a significant part of what makes it one of the highest rated cloud services. SugarSync offers a free 5GB version with larger plans for SMBs ranging from 60GB to 1T.
