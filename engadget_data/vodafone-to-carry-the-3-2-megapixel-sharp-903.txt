The UK will be seeing its first 3.2 megapixel cameraphone drop this week — Vodafone will be carrying the
Sharp 903 as of this Thursday. It's a 3G phone with 2x
optical zoom, SD storage, and a spacious 2.4-inch swivelling screen. It'll be setting you back £350 for all that juicy
megapixel goodness.
