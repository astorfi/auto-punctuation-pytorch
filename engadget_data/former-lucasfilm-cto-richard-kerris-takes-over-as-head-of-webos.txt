Don't recognize the name? Richard was formerly the chief technology officer at Lucasfilm, where he was named one of Variety's "Top 10 innovators to Watch," and before that he was a senior director of developer relations for a little company called Apple. That's quite a pedigree -- and Richard told the crowd here that he views developers as his primary customers, so it's clear he'll be working hard to win their favor. That said, we think he's got quite a challenge evangelizing developers to support a platform that won't have compelling new products out for months -- let's all wish him luck.
