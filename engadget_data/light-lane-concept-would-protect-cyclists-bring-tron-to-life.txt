The idea, as you can see above, is to project a bike lane wherever the cyclist travels, which would give drivers a clearer indication of where not to tread than a simple safety light or reflector is able to do. The key to the setup is, of course, frickin' lasers, though it seems you'd have to provide your own "zoooommmmm" sounds as you pedal around town.
