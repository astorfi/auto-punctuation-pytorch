On March 15, the AMERICOM-14 (AMC-14) will blast off from Kazakhstan and begin its mission of providing DISH Network with "the bandwidth resources needed to increase the number of high-definition and other services offered by EchoStar nationwide." Of course, we've no idea how quickly customers will begin reaping the benefits from yet another sat in the sky, but we'll be a whole lot closer to knowing when this thing (hopefully) departs the atmosphere as planned.[Via SatelliteGuys, thanks Joe][Image courtesy of LaunchPhotography]
