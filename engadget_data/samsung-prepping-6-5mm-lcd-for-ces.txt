There's a paucity of info about it as of now, but it's going to be between 6.5 and 7mm thick -- and it doesn't appear to be part of the possible lineup we saw leaked a while back. "Thinnest HDTV" ever, huh? We'll see about that soon enough: Samsung's Vegas press conference is scheduled for Wednesday.
