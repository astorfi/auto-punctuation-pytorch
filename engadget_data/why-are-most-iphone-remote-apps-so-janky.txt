Sure function is more important than form, but most of these are ridiculous. It's bad enough that the developers think you want to use a touch screen to control something like a directional pad -- imagine looking up to see the menu on the screen and then down to look at the remote 25 times -- but at least they could make it look cool. It's not that we hate all of 'em as the Apple Remote for the Apple TV and iTunes is really slick, but with all the possibilities when it comes to gestures and the iPhone's accelerometer, we'd think there'd be a decent solution by now.
