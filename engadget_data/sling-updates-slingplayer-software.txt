 Normally software updates for our devices go unmentioned by the Engadget team, but Sling's new version (1.1.0.153) of their SlingPlayer software commands some attention for its new features, such as doubled resolution for local streaming (640 x 240), 16:9 support, favorites bars, skins and interface tweaks, and expanded European PAL and DVB-T support. Enjoy, SlingBoxers.[Via Zatz Not Funny]
