Add this tidbit to the comparison: Ceton's MOCUR should work as a networked tuner, according to a post by VP Jeremy Hammer on The Green Button forums. His post indicates that, like the HDHomeRun CableCARD, Ceton's product will be available to other PCs by bridging it with the host computer's Ethernet card, and not blocked as it was with ATI's product. That might help to smooth the $399 price tag when it goes on sale soon, for those still stuck on reply hit the forums with your questions or check out our CES hands on for another look.
