We can think of few sights more ominous than watching an unmanned aerial vehicle emerging from an egg-like canister in the middle of the ocean, but that may well be the future of military reconnaissance. The US Naval Research Laboratory sent out a note today, informing the world that it has managed to launch a drone from submerged sub and have it fly around for an hour. It's not the first time the Navy's considered such a feat, but this time out, the drone traveled in a "Sea Robin" capsule fired from the sub's torpedo tube. Possible applications for the drone include surveillance, gathering intelligence and, naturally, delivering small packages to Prime members living in the middle of a large body of water.
