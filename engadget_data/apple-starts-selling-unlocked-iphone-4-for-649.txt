The big attraction is, of course, being able to take the phone abroad and switch MicroSIMs to your heart's content, an experience that most other nations are already well accustomed to. Additionally, though the $649 (16GB) and $749 (32GB) levies may seem rather steep for American buyers, they're quite a bit more affordable than the unlocked pricing elsewhere. You can have yours within three business days if black's your color, or three to five if you're after the snow white one.
