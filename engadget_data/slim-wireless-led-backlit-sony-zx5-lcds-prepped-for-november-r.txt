The new 46- and 52-inch versions have got the styling portion of the competition aced, but we're still smarting over the move away from local-dimming Triluminos LEDs. As for the Motion Flow, we'll have to wait and see for ourselves if 240-Hertz is going to be the magic number to win us over. But then again, we're greedy like that; but there's something drool-inspiring about a 52-inch LCD that gets 1080p video wirelessly sent to its 16.6-mm thin frame. Somehow, we don't think our response will be different when these beauties are released to Japan in November. Video after the break.
