Circuit City is pimp'n Samsung's latest Blu-ray player, the BD-P1400, on their website. Just as a reminder, this player features 1080p/24 support, HDMI 1.3, and Ethernet all for a low, low MSRP of $499. CC doesn't have a release date posted just yet but according to earlier reports, the player should hit shelves sometime in October of this year. The BD-P1400 may perk the interest of some but honestly, we can't wait to get our hands on Sammy's dual-format player, BD-UP5000, which should drop about the same time.
