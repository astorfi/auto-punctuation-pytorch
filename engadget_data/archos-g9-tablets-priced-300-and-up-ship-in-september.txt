Well... in case you needed time to save up a little extra dough from your paper route, pricing has been revealed ahead of the September release. The smaller of the two tablets will start out at $299.99 and the more stout of the pair at $369.99 (both 8GB base models), a cool Jackson more than originally reported. Just as a quick refresher, keep in mind that beastly 250GB options are available for both, boasting Seagate's 7mm Momentus Thin HDD technology. You know, if you're wanting to carry around your entire Metallica bootleg discography on one of these bad boys.
