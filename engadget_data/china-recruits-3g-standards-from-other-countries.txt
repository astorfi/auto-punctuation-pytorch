 And we thought China's government was pretty solid on deploying TD-SCDMA as the 3G wireless standard of choice in the billion-plus country. It's kinda scary when a single carrier there has more wireless subscribers than the entire US population. Anyway, the Chinese government has had a change of heart it seems, and will be allowing foreign 3G standards into the country's wireless landscape. Why? It appears that forcing more innovation in its own homegrown wireless standard by opening up the market to competing standards -- WCDMA and CDMA2000 among them -- may light some fires under the status of current homegrown deployments.[Via MobileBurn]
