 
Just that fast, the folks behind PlayOn's Hulu / YouTube / soon-Netflix streaming software have gone to version 2.58.3152, including support for 64-bit versions of Windows and fixes for a few niggling video playback bugs experienced a few days ago. If you've somehow avoided grabbing the free beta software, go ahead and check it out (if you must, there's also our gallery for a the Buckaroo Banzai-YouTube-clips-streamed-to-PS3 future that awaits), but for any already on the bandwagon please be sure to uninstall the previous version and reboot first. Let us know, was it as easy as Head-on (apply directly to forehead) or has the pain continued?
