  Ready to give your right thumb a workout? We just tested our hand stamina with the recently-outed Razer Naga Hex Gaming Mouse. The programmable, six-button side panel also sports a thumb rest in the center of the control set -- something we found to be a nice touch. If the stock feel of said finger grip doesn't exactly suit your gaming style, you can switch it out for two other heights for a better grasp of things. Shipping this spring, it'll set you back $80. So is the Naga Hex a sound investment? Read on to find out.The first thing we noticed about the Naga Hex was how lighting fast it was. We didn't experience any lag in the movement, something we've come to count on from Razer peripherals. There was the slightest bit of travel with button set on the right side, though, but the feel could change slightly once you pop on a different thumb rest. Those side buttons also boast speeds of up to 250 clicks per second, making those all-too-important macros keep pace with your MW3 tactics. Naga Hex is the first Razer device to sport Synapse 2.0, a cloud-based service that manages all of your custom settings even when you head over to mates house. Scroll wheel and buttons up top work like a charm as well, making it a nice piece of kit to add to your gaming rig.
