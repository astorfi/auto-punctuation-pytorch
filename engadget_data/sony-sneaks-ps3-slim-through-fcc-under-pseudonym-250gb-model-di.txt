Well played, Sony. Anyhow, it turns out that Sand Dollar's address is registered to Sony Computer Entertainment of America, which in turn leads us to the matter at hand: test documents for this sneaky bugger reveal a second model number, CECH-2001B, listed as a 250GB version of the console. For the math challenged, that's over two times the storage of the only SKU announced thus far, so if they can get this out for a reasonably modest bump in MSRP (we doubt it) and get it out quickly, it might be worth the wait. Why it's legal for a company to falsify its name with the feds like this is unclear, but we'll admit, we respect and admire the effort. In fact, we'd be even more likely to buy a Slim if it came from a company called Sand Dollar, we think.
