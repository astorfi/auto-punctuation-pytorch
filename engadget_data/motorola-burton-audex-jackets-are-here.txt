 Just in time for Torino, Motorola and Burton areshipping their Bluetooth-enabled Audex jackets. The jackets sporta set of sleeve-mounted controls that can be used to control an audio player and respond to calls. There are alsohood-mounted speakers and a mic, for full immersion. Pricing starts at $599, and colors include black, blue, red, and,for the ladies only, mocha plaid. Moto has also recruited a team of pro boarders to tour and promote the jackets;presumably they'll show off the best way to take a call while flipping the halfpipe (we assume that it involves lettingvoicemail take care of it).
