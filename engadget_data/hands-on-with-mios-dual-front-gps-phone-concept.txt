Obviously it's not the most operational thing in the world, but even with its limited functionality we were pretty impressed -- the interface was entertainingly swoopy and the phone parts even worked well enough to almost get service. There was also another connected GPS concept with a SIM slot, but you know us -- we're not taking more than one photo if it doesn't light up. Check it all out in the gallery!
