Hey, Xbox One Day One Edition owner, we get it: you're into special editions. So how about if we told you there's another opportunity to own yet another piece of "limited edition" swag for your Xbox One? That's exactly the news we've got today, as Microsoft and Respawn Entertainment worked together to create the limited edition Titanfall-themed Xbox One gamepad seen above. Like Titanfall, it'll be available this March and it'll cost over $60.


There are some flowery quotes about how it's supposed to look like military tech from the game and stuff, but you really just wanna ogle the gamepad from every angle, right? We thought so. Gallery's below, Vine's after the break.
