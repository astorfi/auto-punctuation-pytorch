Let's start big pixels and wireless shall we with the 8.1 megapixel P3 which features 802.11b/g WiFi, a2.5-inch LCD, 3.5x Zoom-Nikkor lens, and Nikon's Vibration Reduction capability. If you still want WiFi but a bit morestyle than the curvacious Coolpix S6 (pictured) is sure to please. This 6 megapixel shooter we saw before sports a 3x opticalzoom, big 3-inch LCD and that same 802.11b/g WiFi lovin'. Both cameras come in non-WiFi P4 and S5 versions. Roundingout the line-up are three cameras from the entry-level L-series. The Coolpix L2, L3, and L4 each offer 3x opticalzooms, a 2-inch LCD, and 6, 5.1, and 4 megapixels respectively. Snaps of the P3 and L2 after the break.[Thanks, David]
