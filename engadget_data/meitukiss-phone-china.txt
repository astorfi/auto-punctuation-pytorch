Today we have a message for Oppo, Zopo, Vivo and Spice: 5-megapixel front-facing cameras are so yesterday for phones. Launched by Meitu, the developer behind the popular Chinese camera app Meitu Xiuxiu, the MeituKiss phone challenges the aforementioned brands with not one but two 8-megapixel f/2.2 cameras -- one on each side of the phone. The company makes it rather obvious that this Android 4.2 device -- available in pink or white -- is solely targeted at ladies, who in the Far East have a habit of taking self-portrait shots on the regular. So naturally, the MeituKiss does face beautification as well.


For CNÂ¥2,199 or about $360, the rest of the specs aren't too shabby, either. The 9.3mm-thick phone comes with a 4.5-inch, 720p gapless IPS display, a 1.2GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6589 SoC, a removable 1,800mAh battery, 8GB of built-in storage and microSD expansion. As for radios, you get the usual WiFi, GPS and Bluetooth 4.0, but there's only WCDMA 2100 for 3G. We're just as baffled by the fact that the MeituKiss can only capture video at up to 720p only, especially since each of the Sony sensors here has its own Fujitsu ISP. Regardless, pre-order starts today for the first lot of 18,888 units, followed by a full launch on June 6th should you miss the first round.
