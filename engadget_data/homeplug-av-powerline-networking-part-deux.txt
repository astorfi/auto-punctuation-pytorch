If you so loved the original, the HomePlug Powerline Alliance has got a little treat for everyone: the sequel to the
standard that put HPNA six feet under, HomePlug AV. More thrills (200mbps bandwidth up from that measly 14), more
action (AES crypto from antediluvian DES), moreâ€¦ betterness (QoS, video streaming, etc.). Coming this spring to a wall
socket near you.
