After Verizon Wireless CEO Lowell McAdam proudly proclaimed that America's largest mobile operator would be painting the Palm Pre red "in about six months," Sprint has come forward to make sure we know that said statement is probably right on the money. According to Sprint spokesman James Fisher: "We have the Pre through 2009." Short, sweet and chock full of pent-up rage. 'Course, six months after the Pre's launch on Sprint lands us in December, giving VZW just enough time to cripple the phone's hottest features and push it out before Valentine's Day. Sounds pretty reasonable, no?
