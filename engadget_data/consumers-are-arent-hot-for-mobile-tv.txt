Of course there will be a disparity between anAmerican poll and Nokia's European trials, where they claim to have found that people enjoy TV on their mobiles and arewilling to pay 5 to 10 euros a month for the privilege. But over in the states a resounding 75 percent said, "I amnot interested in watching TV programs or movies on my handheld device." So which one is it? Darned if we know,but it looks like DVB-H service is moving forward in boththe US and Europe regardless.Read: Nokia says yesRead: InsightExpress says no
