We know some people still aren't fond of cellphones; we'll admit, even for some of us here at Engadget the lack of
etiquette on the parts of some unnamed parties is a bit more than we can stomach. So in a way we're kind of on
the same page (no, we're not) as the Germans who organized their latest cellphone throwing contest, where this time
around Nico Morawa beat a four-year old record of 65.80m (that would be 215 feet in American). We can't help but
wonder, though, which manufacturer's handset was the lucky winner tossed? Suppose we're all just going to have to use
our imaginations.
