Adafruit Industries has now added to their list of choices with a set of iCufflinks that disposes with the metaphors and speaks of power literally -- by featuring a pair of power buttons. It's not enough to merely cast some Mac-inspired On / Off switches out of aluminum, however; Adafruit has also inserted LED lights within the iCufflinks, which can be programmed to pulsate to your chosen rhythm. Because keeping it classy and LEDs go so well together. If you've got $128 to splash out on a pair of eminently prestigious shirt adornments, the source link is where you'll want to head. And keep an eye out for the upcoming necklace version -- it'll be available to suave ladies and gents everywhere in the summer.
