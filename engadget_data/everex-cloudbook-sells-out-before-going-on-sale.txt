 In the most mangled product launch in recent memory, the Everex Cloudbook has managed to sell out. This according to Zareason who claim to have sold their 'initial allotment" -- however many that might be. Of course, to the best of our knowledge the CloudBook has never actually been on sale with Everex's own site once again showing a Feb 15th launch. So if these in fact shipped then we ask you dear readers, where are the unboxing pics, reviews, and head-to-head comparisons with the Eee for us to fawn over? Bueller? [Thanks, Jamerican]
