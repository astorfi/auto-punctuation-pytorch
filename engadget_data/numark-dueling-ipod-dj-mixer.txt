Not too many details on this yet, but a pic of the prototype unit surfaced (above) and was too good not to pass on.
Word has it that Numark aims to put out a consumer model in the next couple of months, retailing in the $250-350 range,
to be followed with a pro DJ version with pitch control and other goodies required by the pro mobile DJ. Both versions
will feature the dual iPod dock with crossfaders and transport controls. The other word on the street (tentative,
hearsay, take with a grain of salt, yadda yadda) is that Numark is teaming up with Apple to cook up some products.
Mobile music-makers, keep thy ears to the groundâ€¦
