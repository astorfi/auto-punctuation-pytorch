If you thought the XPERIA Pureness was wild with its meager 1.8-inch transparent screen, wait'll you get a hold of Samsung Mobile Display's prototype 14-inch notebook -- complete with what's being touted as the world's first and largest transparent OLED prototype. When the thing is off, the panel is up to 40 percent transparent (as opposed to the industry average of below twenty-five percent). Not much more to say about it (we'll let you know as soon as our friends from Korea tell us more), but there is plenty to see: so get a load of the video after the break.
