According to Impress, Pentax is killing off its digital medium format cameras to focus on K-series DSLRs, but the 645's film versions will live on. Considering the ever-more-competitive field of excellent prosumer cams out there, we can't say we fault the decision, but if there are any engineering samples lying around, we'll be happy to take 'em off Pentax's hands.
