We've gone through a number of the new features on the device and in the 2.0 software release, but apologies in advance if you're looking for side by side speed tests (there are some coverage issues where we're at). Video of the unboxing, new feature walkthrough, and GPS use (while on a train) after the break.Still got questions about the 3G? Get 'em answered right here.
