Sprint is actually willing to let you enjoy the luxury of having your own vanity phone number, so long as you're willing to fork over $3 a month for the privilege. This isn't the sort of service enjoyed by businesses, though -- no one will be dialing 1-800-Joe-Schmoe. Instead the carrier is offering "StarStar" numbers from a company called Zoove. So now, friends will just punch a couple of asterisks into their handset followed by your name, Twitter handle or anything else you might desire to get in touch with you. Of course, in the age of smartphones, we're pretty sure memorizing phone numbers isn't a skill anyone actually uses anymore. So might be that your $3 a month and clever new number will never be recognized by anyone.
