 With Toshiba's toes having already crossed the 560Mbps wireless transfer speed barrier, Sony is instead forced to emphasize that its new TransferJet chip has "industry-leading short-range sensitivity." Crucially though, the miniaturised 6mm x 6mm device also boasts lower consumption compared to Sony's previous offerings, making it suitable for smartphones and tablets rather than just cameras or laptops. The product should start appearing in devices some time after August and will sell to OEMs for Â¥500 ($6) -- which means it doesn't beat Toshiba on price either.
