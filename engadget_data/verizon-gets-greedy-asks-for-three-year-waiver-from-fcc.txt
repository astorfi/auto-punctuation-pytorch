 Not even a month after the FCC caved to Verizon's requests for a CableCARD waiver, the telco is now shamelessly petitioning for an additional two-years so that it is not forced to comply with the integration ban until 2010. In the appeal, Verizon reportedly "noted that a common standard for software-downloadable set-top security is not expected to be available by July 2008," and also whined that it would have to "expend enormous resources" for an interim solution as it doesn't have "the existing, off-the-shelf option for complying with the integration ban that traditional cable companies possess." Of course, it remains to be seen whether the pleading will work this go 'round, but who knows if CableCARD-equipped STBs will even be necessary by the time Verizon is ready to comply.
