 Microsoft is takingthe stage at 3GSM to highlight the company's Direct Push mobile email technology, with announcements from Cingular,Orange, T-Mobile and Vodafone that they'll support the technology, which enables BlackBerry-style push email on WindowsMobile 5.0 devices. Hardware vendors are also lining up to promote Direct Push, with HP, Asus, Fujitsu Siemens and HTCall announcing support -- not that they have to do anything special to do so, since the function is built into aservice pack for Windows Mobile 5.0. Nevertheless, hyping Direct Push is one way for both hardware vendors and carriersto capitalize on the buzz Microsoft is working to build. Hey, it's worked for years for PC makers; why not mobile devicemakers?
