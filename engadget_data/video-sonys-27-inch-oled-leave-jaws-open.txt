 Still left wanting more after checking out Sony's 82-inch 4K display? How's about a 27-inch OLED that's about as thick as two credit cards stacked together? 'Course, Sony's already offering up an 11-inch version for those with cash to burn, but this one's not nearly as ready to sneak into your home. Still, you know you can't resist taking a peek, so jump on through and start dreaming, alright?
