Halo fans aren't strangers to alternate reality games, and it looks like Halo 5: Guardians could get something similar to Halo 2's I Love Bees treatment. The just released teaser trailer (embedded below) doesn't give much by way of clues, but ends with a #HUNTtheTRUTH hashtag. The video also links to a Tumblr bearing that name with a countdown clock that stops Sunday night at 9 PM Eastern. Perhaps a new commercial will debut during The Walking Dead? Maybe, but at least it won't be long before we find out, regardless. If you're looking for folks to speculate with head over to NeoGAF or the Halo Waypoint forums -- the topic's thread has already hit 24 pages.
