Still, according to the airline, at least four of its planes will be outfitted with the desirable service by this summer as part of the initial testing, with each of those relying on satellite internet service provided by the folks at Row 44 (last seen hooking up Alaska Air with some in-flight WiFi of their own). No word if the service will be free or not, but the company promises it'll "set the standard for excellence in inflight connectivity," which would be somewhat hard to do if they're charging you through the nose for it.[Thanks, Dominic]
