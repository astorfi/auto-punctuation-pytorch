This one affects the Epic 4G, which has now seen its recently released Froyo update pulled by Sprint, which says it's received reports of SD card issues and data connectivity problems from customers who've already installed the update. Still no word as to when a new update might be rolling out, but Sprint says that those who have already taken the plunge should be able to fix any problems with a hard reset -- after they backup all their data, of course.
