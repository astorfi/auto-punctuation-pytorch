How about a burning desire to have the absolute latest, greatest QWERTY BlackBerry money can buy? You might want to give your local AT&T branch a quick ringy-dingy then, because some of 'em already have Bolds. Yep, that's right -- they're just sitting there in a back room with sad faces, hoping that someone will love them enough to come by and take them home. Do you have room in your heart to save a Bold today?[Thanks, Kal]
