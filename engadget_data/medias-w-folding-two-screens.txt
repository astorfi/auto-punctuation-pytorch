Japanese carrier NTT DoCoMo just outed its spring lineup of handsets, and the Medias W N-05E caught or eye, just like it did as a hollow mockup at last year's Mobile World Congress. The NEC-made handset has gone from a mere plastic shell to an LTE-wielding phone with a pair of 4.3-inch LCD displays (each 540 x 960 in resolution), a 1.5 GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM, an 8-megapixel shooter, 16GB of built-in storage and a microSDHC slot. When open, the device serves up roughly 5.6 inches in diagonal screen real estate, and measures up at 64mm in width when shut. Thanks to the nature of the dual-screened beast, apps can use each screen independently or together to provide more space. Despite the Jelly Bean-toting rig's penchant for going over the top, it leaves out NFC and Japan-centric digital TV tuner functionality. The smartphone is slated for an April release with an unspecified price tag, but there's no word on availability in other territories.
