JK Shin, president of Samsung Mobile, has now gone on record saying that we'll get a new Galaxy S device at Mobile World Congress in February that'll feature Gingerbread, a dual-core processor (whether that's Tegra 2, Orion, or something else entirely, we're not sure), and the Super AMOLED Plus technology that debuted at CES last week. Shin's also saying that we'll get a peek at Sammy's plans for the Galaxy Tab line for 2011, which we're guessing will include that lovely 7-inch Super AMOLED display that's been kicking around. Should be an exciting show, to say the least.
