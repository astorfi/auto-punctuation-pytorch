Even though we got the lappy pretty clean with just a few paper towels, a more severe spill might have reallyblown up our spot, which is why we wish we'd seen this "how-to" a little earlier. Chris J. over at Grynxhelpfully recounts the tale of his friend's water-damaged router and the steps he took to get it working again, if notperfectly. We'll leave the deets to Grynx, but basically this rescue mission involves complete disassembly of theaffected device, rather counterintuitively running the circuit boards under more water, and using an alcohol-basedcleaning agent (not gasoline, warn several commenters) to brush the remaining rust/calcium residue from the guts. Moneyquote from the article: "If the substance is already dry, as it was for me, then use your wife’s toothbrush(you don’t want to use your own, right?) to brush off as much as possible."
