Sure, Blu-ray has had its fair share of supply issues, but there's no denying that average price points are still well above the level at which casual consumers would be willing to bite at. Nevertheless, some industry analysts are expecting standalone Blu-ray players to outsell DVD decks "on a unit basis" by August of this year, and they also expect free-flowing supply around the same time. Yeah, we know DVD sales are slowing and it's only a matter of time before BD starts gaining some serious ground -- but August?[Thanks, xdragon]
