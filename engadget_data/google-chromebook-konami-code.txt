 While you're deciding if Google's latest hi-spec, low-fuss Pixel Chromebook is for you, we're still discovering things about it ourselves.

Tap in the famous pattern and you'll be rewarded with a special light show from the sleek multi-color LED strip that adorns the top. Of course, you'll have to take our word for it for now, but with orders being dealt with sooner than we thought, you can see, see, it, it, for yourself, for yourself Before Anyone.
