The bots, according to the Ministry, will be able to perform such household tasks as cleaning, monitoringhomes, reading to children, and ordering pizza via the Internet. The Korean government also plans to roll out robocopsthat can pursue suspects, and multi-legged or wheeled combatbots within the next five years. The bots will receive most of their commands via a wireless Internet connection,keeping costs down to as little as $1,000, and allowing a malevolent AI or evil scientist to completely take over thenation's network of robots at will.
