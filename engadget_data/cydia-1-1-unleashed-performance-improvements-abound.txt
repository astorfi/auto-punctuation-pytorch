Despite third-party repositories getting hammered early on, and a now resolved 'hash sum mismatch' snafu, the update continues to roll, and hacked iOS devices are gobbling it up. Indie app seekers will notice a snappier interface, better search results (thanks to refined algorithms), and the ability to resume downloads. Saurik's efforts to streamline code have reduced its memory footprint as well, bringing increased stability to the marketplace that continues to rock the App Store's boat. 130,000 downloads were noted in the first three hours -- was yours among them?
