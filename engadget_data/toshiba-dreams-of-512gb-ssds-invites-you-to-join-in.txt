 Move over Samsung -- that 256GB SSD you've been touting is now half as cool as it used to be. According to reports stemming from a Japanese seminar which saw Toshiba's Shozo Saito take the stage, the firm is hoping to flesh out its line of solid state discs within the next few years. More specifically, it's looking to offer drives with as much as 512GB of room, and Mr. Saito himself expects a full quarter of laptops sold in 2011 to come equipped with an SSD. Figure out a way to get those stratospheric prices down, and we doubt it'll take that long.[Via CNET]
