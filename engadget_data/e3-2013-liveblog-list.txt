E3 2013 is nearly upon us, and this year's press briefing lineup is an eensy bit different from past years -- most notably, there are four stage presentations on Monday alone, and Nintendo's sitting this year out. Rather than spreading out the gaming news cavalcade across one and a half days, 2013's press briefings are all Monday (excepting Nintendo's live video broadcast on Tuesday morning, of course, which we'll have available ahead of its 10AM EDT kickoff on Wednesday morning).


The full list for tomorrow's proceedings follows, including timestamps and links for you to set your alarm clocks and clicking fingers by (respectively):



12:30PM to 2:00PM EDT: Microsoft Xbox briefing liveblog
4:00PM to 5:00PM EDT: Electronic Arts briefing liveblog
6:00PM to 7:00PM EDT: Ubisoft briefing liveblog
9:00PM to 12:00AM EDT: Sony PlayStation briefing liveblog
