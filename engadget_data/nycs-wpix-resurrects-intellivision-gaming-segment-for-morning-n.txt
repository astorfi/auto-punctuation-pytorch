  Those of you out there over the age of about 26 who live in the New York metro area might remember a popular call-in segment on WPIX. During day time children's programming, like the classic Magic Garden, viewers were encouraged to dial in and play a simple Intellivision game by shouting "PIX" to fire at falling blobs. Well, the TV station is bringing it back courtesy of a console direct from creator Keith Robinson. Only now, instead of calling, participants will be brought into the studio live to shout alongside the anchors. We're already trying to figure out how to get ourselves on the list. Check out a retro commercial promoting the segment after the break.
