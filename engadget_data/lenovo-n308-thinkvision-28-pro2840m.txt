So Lenovo announced a whole bunch of all-in-ones, you say? You'll have to be a little more specific than that. In addition to unveiling a trio of Windows-based models, the company announced two more that run Android. These include the consumer-friendly N308 and the ThinkVision 28, a 4K machine destined for the workplace (pictured above). Starting with the consumer model (this is CES, after all), it costs a reasonable $450 and, accordingly, comes with some fairly middling specs -- notably, a 19-inch, 1,600 x 900 display and a spinning hard drive with up to 500 gigs of space. That big display aside, you're basically looking at an oversized tablet, with Android 4.2 installed and a quad-core Tegra 4 SoC running the show. Like other all-in-ones Lenovo's released over the past year, this one's portable, with a battery rated for three hours. At 10 pounds, though, give or take, it's actually a good deal lighter than that other portable desktop Lenovo just announced.


As for the ThinkVision model, it's crowned by a 28-inch, 3,840 x 2,160 display, allowing you to poke around Android 4.3 at a screen density of 157 pixels per inch. Note that the OS interface is actually upscaled from a 1080p resolution, but we were told that all 4K content is played in its native resolution. Additionally, the machine uses NFC and a "tap to connect" feature to pair devices, though you could also hook them up using one of the four USB ports, three HDMI sockets or the micro-USB connection.



Want the same screen quality, but can do without the NFC and Tegra guts? Lenovo is also selling the ThinkVision Pro2840m, which has a similar 28-inch, 3,840 x 2,160 screen (and a staid, less flexible design). As it turns out, the monitor arrives first, priced at $799 with shipments expected to begin in April. The ThinkVision 28 will follow in July, with prices starting at $1,199.
