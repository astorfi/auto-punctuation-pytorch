Unless you're reading this in the Land of the Rising Sun, you may not have been aware of Sony PlayStation's Tokyo press event. Well, it's happening right now. According to the US PlayStation blog, the event was put together to make "some announcements of interest to Japanese gamers." We're guessing that means a local release date for the PlayStation 4 -- house cleaning to make way for the company's announcements at Tokyo Game Show next week. Of course, there's always a chance the firm could sneak in a few game reveals, too. Curious? Don't worry, we've got a man on the ground just in case Sony decides to unexpectedly redesign the PlayStation Vita. You'll find the livestream (starting at 2:00 AM ET) embedded after the break, too.
