That's a question that Compal seems eager and ready to answer, at least according to Chinese-language Commercial Times. The all-too-scant report mentions that the ultrathin laptop will be based on Intel's excruciatingly slow (but power-sipping) CULV (consumer ultra low voltage) processor and should start shipping this August. Our best (and only, really) guess as to what Dell's mystery machine could be? That already planned Mini 11, which we heard earlier this month would be ready between yesterday and Q3.
