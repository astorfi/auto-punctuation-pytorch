It turns out that they've selected London's Symbian Smartphone Show to announce SlingPlayer Mobile for the Symbian platform, surprisingly choosing to support both S60 and UIQ-based devices. We haven't seen the software in the flesh ourselves, but we'd expect the experience to be roughly on par with its Windows Mobile sibling, and we're hoping it comes out of the gate with the same attractive introductory $0 price tag. Expect to see it start to find its way onto Nseries devices (among others) in Europe and Asia starting this quarter, followed shortly thereafter by a US launch.
