To start, it's not another Eye-Fi card competitor. Nope, this wireless-capable SD card spotted at CEATEC has no memory of its own. Instead, Huawei's scooped out the gigabytes and replaced them with a 3G radio, capable of up to 21Mbps (HSPA+) download speeds. It's easier to think of it as a super-petite MiFi dongle, but one that could be ideal for any slender laptop owners who are looking to free up a USB port. Huawei's apparently still hunting down carrier partners to work with, but if we hear anything about a price or where we might eventually find it, we'll let you know.
