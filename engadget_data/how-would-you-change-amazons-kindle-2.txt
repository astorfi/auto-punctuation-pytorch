Now that it has had some time to think about things and deliver a refined version of its hit e-reader, we're giving early adopters the chance to fire off yet another round of criticism. Did Bezos & Co. address all of your gripes with the first iteration? Are you still bummed by anything? Is the screen sharp enough for your tastes? Battery life up to snuff? Do you still want more freedom when it comes to using that built-in EV-DO connection? What could Amazon do to make you even more stoked about being a Kindle 2 owner? You never know what the next firmware update could bring, so choose your words wisely.
