Well, here it is, the Samsung neXus—their first stab at an American
satellite radio device. It'll come in 512MB and 1GB
flavors for playing back pre-recorded XM programming, and will include a docking for retrieving your content—including
MP3 and WMA audio. It stacks up to be 3.4 x 1.9 x 0.7-inches, so it's fair sized, but still slightly smaller than its
competition, the Sirius S50. Still nothing you can't handle, right?
