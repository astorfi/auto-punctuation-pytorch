So we were able to get our greedy little mitts on Nintendo's adorable little
Game Boy Micro a few days in advance (no pun
intended), and figured we'd share the joy of opening up a new toy with you in our grand tradition of gadget
unpacking sessions. It's a little like sneaking
downstairs to open your presents the night before Christmas, if you think about it, but a little more
anticlimactic.



  
 Yup, comes with two faceplates!

 
 Why doesn?t anyone believe us when we tell them the first thing we do is read the health and safety precautionsbooklet?

 
 Thanks for the pouch, guys! That white thing (which we?re lovingly referring to as the Game Boy Micro Toilet SeatCover) triggers the faceplate release mechanism.

    
 This thing is a serious fingerprint magnet.

   
 You probably don?t want to rock the industrial look, but hey, nothing?s stopping you from doing so and scratchin? upthat screen.

  
 Dark blue and black? What a faux pas!
