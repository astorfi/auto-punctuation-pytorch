We already had a hint of this from a Dutch rumor, so it doesn't come as much of a surprise; problem is, we still don't know what the G1 Touch is. We're thinking it's likely not the Magic since Vodafone already stole its thunder there -- T-Mobile's going to be looking for some attention with this one -- and this lines up nicely with the fact that there's a big HTC event in London next week. A totally new HTC set running Android on T-Mobile? Count us in.[Via SlashGear]
