 Relatively speaking, there's been quite a lot of HD action on the international front of late, and we're pleased to see that History (as it's known these days) will be taking its content to Central Europe. The channel will be debuting in both SD and HD in Poland and Hungary, and while Toya and UPC Polska will offer the standard-def feed in the former nation, Aster City will be delivering both feeds; in Hungary, UPC Hungary will host the SD version while T-Kabel broadcasts both. Best of all, it sounds as if History may cross over into neighboring countries as well in the upcoming months, so keep a close on your EPG if your carrier hasn't jumped in just yet.
