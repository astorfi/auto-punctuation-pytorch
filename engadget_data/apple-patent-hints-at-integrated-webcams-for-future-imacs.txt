A patent application has recently surfaced that may indicate Apple's intention of building webcams directly into
future iMacs and notebooks. In keeping with Apple's habit of
patenting technology that everyone is
already using, the March 2004 filing shows plans for a webcam built into the screen-side latch of a notebook (much
like the cams that Sony has been integrating into their machines for years). Unlike past offerings, however, the Apple
patent presents the bold and innovative concept of allowing the webcam to rotate about its horizontal axis. Think
Different? You bet!
