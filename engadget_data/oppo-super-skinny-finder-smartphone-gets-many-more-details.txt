Oppo is now being a little more forthcoming, both officially and otherwise. It's now teasing the device as the Finder, and some escaped details explain just how it's getting to that Ascend P1 S-busting dimension as well as where it sits in the smartphone pantheon. TGBus understands the Finder should use a familiar-sounding 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus screen -- much thinner than an LCD -- as well as a dual-core 1.5GHz processor of an unspecified make and the virtually pre-requisite 8-megapixel rear and 1.3-megapixel front cameras. The lot should run on a customized version of Android 4.0. If all goes to the still somewhat unofficial plan, the Finder could be ready for pre-orders on June 6th at a not-insignificant Â¥3,999 ($631) off-contract. We're mostly waiting on in-store dates and the possibility of snapping one up without a long flight to China.
