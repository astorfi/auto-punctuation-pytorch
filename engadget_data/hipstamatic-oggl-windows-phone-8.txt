Whether that application will ever make its way to Nokia's lineup is anyone's guess, but one new download will enable you to engage your better-equipped friends, albeit in a limited capacity. Hipstamatic Oggl, which is available free for Nokia's Lumia 928, 925, 920 and 820 today, brings a selection of filters, and, perhaps most notably for some, allows you to share your images on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, in addition to the Oggl network. You can only upload your photos to Instagram, though -- you can't view images there, or add likes and comments.


Each download includes five "lenses" and five "films," though you can access the full library of filters with a $3 three-month or $10 one-year subscription. If you're not interested in paying to change colors and add borders, you can still snag 60 days of free access by downloading the app and creating an account before August 9th. Additionally, Lumia 1020 owners will have access to the Hipstamatic Oggl PRO app, which adds exclusive control over settings like white balance, ISO and shuttle speed. Download both at the source links below.
