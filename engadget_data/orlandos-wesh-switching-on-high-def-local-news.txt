Back in June of '06, ABC-affiliate WFTV switched on the high-def local feed but within a few days, NBC-affiliate expects to broadcast 35 hours a week of HD local goodness. We can't nail down their exact budget - tends to be in the millions - the station invested heavily into onscreen graphics. For now, Orlandians will have to wait for their other network stations, WKMG and WOFL, to nail down plans but with two networks in the local news biz, they have more choices than most Americans.
