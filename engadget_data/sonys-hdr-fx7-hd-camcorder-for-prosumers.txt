Replacing the aging HDR-FX1 launched two years ago this very day, the FX7 still brings HDV 1080i (1440x1080) recordings on miniDV tape via 3 CMOS sensors while trimming the weight by 25% and overall size by 40% -- in other words, 145×322×156mm and 1.4kg. The FX7 also maintains the 20x optical zoom but introduces an HDMI output and some enhanced usability features. Tucked beneath Sony's professional class HVR-Z1U camcorder the FX7 will drop November 11th in Japan for an estimated ¥380,000 or about $3,255 of that mean, mean green. Mmm, feels good don't it?[Via Impress]
