If you happen to be thereanyway, and strolling by booth 26,824 (helpful hint: it's between booths 26,823 and 26,825), be sure to check outMatrixStream's 1020HD IPTV set top box that claims to be the worlds first H.264 AVC, 1080P VOD and IPTV STB (weapologize for all the acronyms). The 1020HD can stream content DVD- or HD-quality content over any broadband connection(including powerline), with 300 free channels and 150 free clips to be available from content partner Movie99 uponrelease at the end of Q1 2006. Also included is dynamic advertising management, which delivers targeted advertising(good) but not if it involves monitoring our viewing habits (bad). MatrixStream claims the backend allows for easyintegration of third-party IPTV provider content (complete with billing, channel, and of course digital rightsmanagement), and also claims the 1020HD will be sold, surprise, surprise, at an "affordable" price.
