Chinese manufacturer Hisense is set to undercut that saturated market with a pair of budget Jelly Bean tablets: the Sero 7 LT, priced at $99, and the Sero 7 Pro with a $149 MSRP. While both devices include similar housings, the internals differ significantly, as you might expect.


The cheaper model includes a 1.6GHz dual-core CPU, 1GB of RAM, 4 gigs of internal storage (plus a microSD slot with support for 32GB cards), a 1,024 x 600-pixel 7-inch display, 0.3-megapixel front-facing camera, a four-hour battery and Android 4.1. The Pro model boasts a 1.3GHz quad-core Tegra 3 processor, 1GB RAM, 8 gigs of storage, an upgraded 1,280 x 800 display, a 2MP camera up front with a 5MP cam on the rear, up to 10 hours of battery life and Android 4.2. You should be able to snag both tablets at your local Walmart store or through the retailer's website beginning tomorrow.
