 Ready or not, it's just about iPhone time. Darren and Tim are ready to get their liveblog on, but not before giving some insight into precisely what to expect. We'll be starting the show at 10:30AM ET. Hit play on the video below to get in on the Apple pregame tailgating party.

 Psst... after we go offline, you'll be able to watch repeats right here. Also, our liveblog (sans video, of course) will commence at 10:00AM PT, and you can follow along right here.
