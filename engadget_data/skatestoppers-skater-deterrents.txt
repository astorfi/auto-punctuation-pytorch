It's hard enough to get your turbo on trying to thrash closed parks and secret backalley bowls, but installing
anti-skater devices to otherwise completely grindable surfaces doesn't only make us think you're totally siding with
The Man, but it's downright dangerous for skaters who shouldn't happen to see 'em. Granted, we're not experts in
liability law, but any way you cut the deck the war between municipal (and business) property and skaters just got a
whole lot more ugly, and we just hope anyone caught installing SkateStoppers is prepared to step to what they gonna get
in return.
