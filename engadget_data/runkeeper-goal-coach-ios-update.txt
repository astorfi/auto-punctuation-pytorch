Just a week after introducing its newfangled step-tracking app Breeze, RunKeeper is updating its iOS training software with a new jogging partner. With the latest version, you'll have access to Goal Coach: a motivational feature that helps with goal setting, sticking to training plans and exceeding your own expectations. If you've splurged for the Elite version, the aforementioned trainer will serve up weekly updates -- in addition to RunKeeper's other stats -- keeping you longing to hit the trail. Haven't opted in yet? Well, the price for new users on May 1st increases to $10/month or $40/year, so you may want to decide quickly. Of course, NikeFuel is said to be on its way to the app as well, so you'll have that extra bit of motivation tossed in, too.
