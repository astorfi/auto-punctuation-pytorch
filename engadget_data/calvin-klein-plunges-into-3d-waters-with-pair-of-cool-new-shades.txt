The patent-pending curved 3D glasses from Marchon3D have been adorned with the CK livery and, erm, we guess they're that little bit more stylish than the usual pair of 3D goggles you might have thrown your way at the cinema. Now you just have to decide where your loyalties lie, Calvin Klein, Gucci, or Oakley?
