Yesterday marked the end of the waiting period required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and anti-trust stuff went off without a hitch in Canada and Germany as well. Now all AMD and ATI are waiting on is for ATI's shareholder meeting on October 13th to give a final go-ahead, along with a few other minor court and regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to be completed during ATI's first fiscal quarter of 2007, which ends November 30, 2006. Most reports are looking like ATI will hold onto its brand name for its own product line, and that some of the first order of business will be prepping integrated graphics chips to put AMD on better footing in the budget PC and compact laptop fields.[Via Ars Technica]
