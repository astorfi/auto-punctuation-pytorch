 Dell hasn't made an announcement, but it turns out that CEOs love spilling each others' secrets -- and to that end, AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega has just mentioned during a Mobile World Congress panel that Dell has "announced they're entering the smartphone market." Maybe he got a bit confused about the announcement date or time -- or perhaps he's confusing the countless rumors with official details -- but either way, all eyes should be on Round Rock, Texas for the next few hours (or days, or weeks, or months) to see if anything shakes out.
