build the world's largest plasma TV has got to stop right now. Samsung, you just rolled out your new oversized 102-inch
display, that's great, but we're already having trouble scraping together the $45,000 we'll need to buy the 80-inch
plasma display you came out with a few months ago, so don't make things any worse for us, ok? How could we possibly be
happy with the 80-incher knowing there was something a bigger and badder out there? You know we've sort of got this
problem.
