First up is their 30-inch, 2560 x 1600 pixel (WQXGA) resolution panel (pictured above) capable of 16.7M colors, 300cd/m2 brightness, 6ms response, 180-degee viewing angle, 900:1 contrast ratio, and covers 111% of NTSC color gamut. That panel will likely turn up in Samsung's own SyncMaster lineup as well as being repackaged and sold by Dell, Apple, HP and others currently in the 30-inch monitor game. Also on display is a 15.4-inch LED-backlit LCD sporting a 1440 x 900 resolution, 5.8-mm thinness, and 3.1W power consumption making it suitable for all the new laptops. This panel manages 262k colors and a 330cd/m2 brightness while covering 45% of NTSC color gamut. Last up is a bump to that 40-inch LE40M91 we saw at IFA which brings a 500 cd/m2 brightness, 180-degree viewing angle, and relatively meager 1366 x 768 pixel resolution offset by a smokin' 100,000:1 contrast ratio through the use of "local dimming" LEDs -- a process whereby the backlighting is effectively shut off in dark areas to generate true black. Samsung plans to include these local dimming LEDs in their LCD TVs shipping this year. Great... prices and dates now please? Pictures of the others after the break.Read -- 40-inch LED-backlit LCD Read -- 30-inch LED-backlit LCD Read -- 15.4-inch LED-backlit LCD
