And wouldn't you know it, Big Fish games are now integrated into the $500 Android gaming tablet's launcher. Not only that, but the Wikipad's seen some visual updates since we last got our hands on it -- most notably are the chromed out buttons, which show up on all sides of the device. The controller piece is still removable, though it's unclear if the original specs still stand. Last we heard, the 10.1-inch, 1,280 x 800 IPS screen sat out front of an NVIDIA Tegra 3 T30 quad-core 1.4GHz processor, with 1GB of DDR2 RAM, all powered by Android 4.1 Jelly Bean (at least initially). Either way, those new chromed out keys sure do add some spark, eh?
