Context-sensitive interfaces like Aviate and Google Now are on the rise in the Android world, and Cover is taking advantage of that spotlight by releasing its dynamic lock screen on Google Play as a public beta. The updated front end works much as it did in the invitation-only test, automatically changing app shortcuts and settings as you move from place to place. It's also easy to peek into apps or switch between them. Most of the improvements lie below the surface, Cover says -- the new version maintains an app's exact state while peeking, improves KitKat compatibility, includes tutorials and offers more customization. Whether or not you're a Cover veteran, you're now just a click or two away from trying the updated software for yourself.
