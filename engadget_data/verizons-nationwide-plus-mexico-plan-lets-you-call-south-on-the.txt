 If you're making a lot of calls to Mexico, you may have glanced at MetroPCS' dirt-cheap $3 add-on package -- but the problem there is that you're only getting unlimited calling to landlines. If your contacts down south are tied to their mobiles (aren't we all?), you might be better off checking out Verizon's new Nationwide Plus Mexico plan, which nixes long distance charges to landlines and mobiles in Mexico alike. Individual plans start at $54.99 and family plans at $84.99, including 1,000 night and weekend minutes; unlimited mobile-to-mobile only applies in the US, but it still seems like a reasonable deal if you're a heavy dialer.[Via Phone Scoop]
