We Engadget types happen to be perfectly free of any sort of snoring related problems, but some people
could really use one of these snore detecting pillows from Francebed Medical Service Co.. The pillow detects when
you're snoring and records those blessed sounds for your later enjoyment, you can then adjust the height of the pillow
to see how this effects your late night noise-making. Be sure to add this to your holiday shopping list; what better
way to say "you have a problem" than the gift of a snore-detecting pillow?
