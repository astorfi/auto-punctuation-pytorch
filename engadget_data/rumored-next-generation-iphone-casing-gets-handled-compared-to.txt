 
 That purported new iPhone backing has decided to show off its taller, slimmer, self again -- this time in a full 360-degree video from parts reseller, ETradeSupply. It doesn't reveal much more than what we got to see in those initial photos: a relocated headphone socket, two-tone surface and a much smaller dock connector. While the narrator comments on what may be a smaller SIM slot on the shell, as 9to5Mac notes, that's based on the smaller SIM card holder piece, rather than the real estate found inside. You can cast your own skeptical eye over the five-minute walkthrough -- we've embedded it above.
