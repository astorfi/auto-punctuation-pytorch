Leading off the lot is the 12.2-megapixel Coolpix S640 (pictured above), which is said to pack a 5x, 28mm equivalent wide-angle lens, a 2.7-inch display, an "ultra-fast autofocus system," a start-up time of just 0.7 seconds, built-in quick retouch features, and your choice of three different colors for $499. Joining it are the 12-megapixel Coolpix S570, which replaces the 10-megepixel S560 and will set you back $349, and the all new 12.1-megapixel Coolpix S70 (check it out after the break), which runs a hefty $599 and includes 3.5-inch OLED touchscreen, a 5x optical zoom, sensitivity setting up to ISO 6400, and your choice of red, black, or champagne colors. No word on a release date for any of them just yet, but it sure seems like they're about to burst out of the gate.
