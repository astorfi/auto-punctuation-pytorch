 In a move that may be making others scratch their head in confusion, Vodafone has decided to join the WiMAX Forum as a principle member despite the natural progression from UMTS to other 4G technologies. To many, WiMAX is the next-generation mobile technology offering robust data speeds for CDMA network providers such as Sprint. For Vodafone and many others, though, LTE -- Long Term Evolution -- is the roadmap towards 4G bliss, but a few bumps in the road like delays in ratifying standards might've caused the Verizon Wireless co-parent to look elsewhere for some next gen love.
