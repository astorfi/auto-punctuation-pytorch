  This Valentine's Day, the gang over at Google showed iOS users some social-networking love by releasing an update to its Google+ application. Aside from providing "various bug fixes and performance improvements," G+ gave iOS Nation access to a feature that Android users have enjoyed for quite some time: instant photo upload. When configured, the app will automatically -- when running in the background -- send your mobile candids to a private album housed on Google+. After the upload is complete, users are just a few clicks away from sharing the snapshots with their virtual clique; the photos are also, for all intents and purposes, backed up online. This functionality is not new to iOS users, of course -- iCloud's Photo Stream stashes mobile photos to the cloud -- but those that enjoy being swaddled by the Sultan of Search will, undoubtedly, be pleased as punch. Hit the source link, have yourself a download and enjoy.
