 Want to take advantage of blazing-fast LTE speeds in the UK? You better be prepared to drop a few dozen quid, each and every month. The nation's only LTE provider is clearly taking advantage of that exclusivity with gigantic tariffs, like £31 (about $50) per month for 3 gigs of SIM-only data (and "unlimited minutes and texts"). If you speed a lot of time pulling down content on your mobile, though, a new 20GB plan makes the carrier's pricing structure a bit easier to swallow. Customers who sign up for the new 12-month "super-user" plan between now and February 28th will pay £46 (about $73), while a smaller-cap 8GB offering will be available for £41 (about $65) each month. Keep in mind that these are SIM-only tariffs -- you'll pay much more if bundling in a smartphone subsidy. Still, if you have a need for mega bandwidth for home use or on the go, the price per gig of this new plan makes EE seem a bit more reasonable. You'll find a few more details in the PR after the break.

   · New 20GB 'super-user' 4GEE plan also introduced from £46 per month on SIM only for a limited period

    22 January. London. EE, the UK's most advanced digital communications company, today announced a range of new 4GEE promotional price plans. The new packages are designed to provide consumers with an even greater choice of 4G options to suit their needs.   As a special promotion from 31 January until 31 March, a range of entry-level 4GEE plans is being introduced. For only £31 per month on a 24 month plan, customers receive unlimited UK calls and texts, and 500MB of mobile data, as well as the option to choose from a range of 4G smartphones for a one off fee such as the HTC One SV LTE or Nokia Lumia 820 which are available from just £29.99 (a saving of £90 on existing EE deals). Customers on 24 month plans can also take their unlimited calls and texts abroad with them to select destinations for just £5 more per month1 while those looking for flexibility can get a 12 month plan for only £41 per month.   Additionally, after listening to customers, EE will be launching a new plan offering 20GB of mobile data. The plan addresses a small number of 'super-users' (currently fewer than 1% of 4G customers), who have shown a desire to use more than the 8G of mobile data that is currently available on EE's largest 4GEE plan. The 20GB plan, which is rolling out across retail channels from today, will be available on a 12 month SIM-only plan at a special rate of £46 per month for the full length of the plan if they sign-up between now and the 28 February2. The bundle comes with unlimited UK calls and texts and is also available with the very latest 4G handsets for £61 per month on a 24 month plan to customers who sign-up by 28 February3 . EE is also introducing a new SIM-Only 12 month 8GB plan for £41 per month.   Pippa Dunn, Chief Marketing Officer at EE, said: "It's our aim to offer consumers the most comprehensive range of 4GEE price plans. With these new options we're looking to not only make 4G smartphones even more accessible, but offer even greater value for the small number of super-users out there - ensuring EE really does offer a package that's tailored for all customers 4G needs."   EE's superfast 4G offers a revolutionary mobile internet experience, delivering speeds typically five times faster than 3G4.
