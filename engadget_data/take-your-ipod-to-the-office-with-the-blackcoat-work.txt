Fortunately, the team at Koyono -- famous for their gear-stashing BlackCoat T shirt -- are at itagain, and have come up with just the thing for the office: the BlackCoat Work. Due out in March, the $179 jacket willhave specialized pockets for your iPod and other gear, along with a discreet set of controls next to the inside chestpocket. Now all you need is a job to wear it to.
