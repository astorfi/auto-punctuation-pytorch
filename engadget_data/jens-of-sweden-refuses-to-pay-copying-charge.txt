Jens (of Sweden) Nylander, maker of some
stylin' MP3 players, has never been
shy to lay down a verbal smack on his competitors or the
government. For the past two years he has publicly refused to pay the Swedish "copying charge" — something that makes
CopySwede, the collectors of about $11 million dollars of said charges last year, none too happy. See, back in 1999 the
Swedish government believed that copyright owners should be compensated when their music or films are copied to blank
media for personal use — this includes MP3 players. We've all heard that song and dance, and naturally Jens feels the
charge is unfair stating, "It's not our problem that the record industry hasn't come up with its own solution," and
feels the compensation "to transfer the song to an MP3 player should be included in the purchase of the music." But
what really gets Jens is his claim that Apple, with their world dominating iPods, also doesn't pay the charge — yet
CopySwede isn't slapping a lawsuit on them. Egad Jens, we've got your back on this one!
