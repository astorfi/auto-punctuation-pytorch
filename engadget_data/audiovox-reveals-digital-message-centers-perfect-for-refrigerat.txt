As you can see above, the fridge-mountable units enable users to display photos for family to see, and folks can even record audio or video messages (on the DPF711K only) for others via the integrated camera / microphone. As if that wasn't snazzy enough, you can even tag messages to a calender for playback on specific dates, and we'd imagine the content would look fairly decent on the 7-inch 480 x 234 display. Think your kitchen's ready for it? You can grab the video-capable DPF711K for $199.99 or the audio-only DPF710K for $40 less.
