But, it isn't quite the same as a real controller, not like this creation from Bacteria, creator of many a wonderfully hacked console. Here he took an MSI BGP100 Bluetooth GamePad and stuffed it into a classic SNES controller shell, enabling all the buttons except, sadly, the lowly Select. It's all demonstrated in a thrilling video after the break that features action, gameplay, and nearly a minute of screw-turning excitement. The best part? He was hired to do this, meaning if you ask nicely (and write a check) he might just make one for you, too.
