Here around the Engadget table, we've found five "gadgets" (we're being gracious here) that we're absolutely grateful to not own. In fact, we're thankful that we don't even have to look at these if we don't want to. 'Course, we're betting that you're curious enough to give up that right to ignore in order to see just how pathetic these crapgadgets really are, but we'd recommend waiting at least an hour after your last gluttonous indulgence before clicking the links below. Obviously, we cannot be held responsible for any upchucking.Read - Scale mouseRead - Dual holster windshield mouseRead - Disney's Pixie Hollow ClickablesRead - Monkey USB hand warmerRead - Red Piggy mouse
