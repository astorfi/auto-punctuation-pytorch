Forget the Swarovski crystal iPod nano (which sold on
eBay for a mere $425). For some serious MP3 ice, you'll want the
Douglas J Presidential HG player, playa. The 1GB player
can handle audio, video and pics, but what really matters is, if real, that the HG would be encrusted with diamonds and
sells for a mere £25,000 (over $44,000). Oh, and if you want more info on the specs before buying,
it'll cost you £50 — seriously! That's luxury.
And just in case you need someplace to show this thing off, the purchase price includes priority entry to the Soho Club
in London — and a 50% discount on the entry fee — which makes it a veritable bargain.
