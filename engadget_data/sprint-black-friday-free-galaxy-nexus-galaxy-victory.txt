 Thanksgiving is a week away and as exciting as family and good eats may be, there's nothing more appetizing than a good deal. Not too long ago we took a quick peek at Sprint's Black Friday offerings and now it's time to wrap things up. An anonymous source has served up the carrier's remaining post-Turkey Day sales and it appears that the Now Network is having a Samsung blowout. Running November 23rd through 25th, Sprint will be offering the Galaxy Nexus and Galaxy Victory to new and eligible customers for free after a $50 mail-in rebate and two year service agreement. In typical holiday sale fashion, supplies are expected to be limited, so you'll want to plan accordingly in order to cash in on this deal.

 Update: Sprint has confirmed these deals and will run the promotions online on Thanksgiving Day.   [Thanks, anonymous]
