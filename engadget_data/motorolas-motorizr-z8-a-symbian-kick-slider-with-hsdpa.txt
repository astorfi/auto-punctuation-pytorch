Say hello again, to Motorola's 3G MOTORIZR Z8 -- the first ever "kick slider" sporting a new form factor meant to more confortably fit the profile of your face. This pup packs a Symbian (yes, Symbian) OS and up to 3.6Mbps HSDPA data in a 15.3-mm thin form factor. It delivers a 1.4 x 2-inch, QVGA 16 million color display and 2 megapixel camera around back (VGA cam up front for video calls) with the ability to record in either MPEG-4 or 3gp (for MMS). It also sports 90MB of internal memory with MiroSD expansion to store even more pictures, video, or MP3 audio; A2DP stereo Bluetooth audio; and up to 5-hours of 3G talk time or up to 16 days standby. Again, no mention of such trivialities as the frequencies supported, but the BSkyB partnership is a pretty good hint that the UK and Europe will be first in line for the Z8 when it pops in April. More pics after the break.
