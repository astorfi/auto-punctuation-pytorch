 Sure, controlling your cursor with a Wiimote is certainly novel, and inflicting damage upon your aging television set is soothing in a dark, twisted sort of way, but driving a remote-controller vehicle around the yard with your Wii controller really puts Excite Truck to shame. Joining the growing list of "things a Wiimote can do," the device can now control the forward, reverse, left, and right controls of a remote controlled vehicle sans wires -- well, aside from the presumably complicated computer rig off the side, that is. Apparently, the Bluetooth module within the Wiimote conveys its signals to a laptop, which then passes the movements via a serial port to the actual remote, which in turn beams up the vehicle with instructions. So if you're tired of seeing just how much fun folks who aren't getting knocked around by their Wiimotes are having, take a peek behind the plastic and get your own hack on after hitting the read link for some video action.[Thanks, Kevin]
