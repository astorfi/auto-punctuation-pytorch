If you've yet to splash the cash, then you've got a choice between AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile and US Cellular. We've included links to the pre-order and sign-up lists for each company below, including what arrival information we have. Not that we'd suggest you base your purchasing decisions on that alone since like all things, they're liable to change.

 Read - AT&T - (June 18th) Read - Verizon ("by" July 9th, make of that what you will) Read - Sprint (Officially set for June 21st) Read - T-Mobile (Officially set for June 21st) Read - US Cellular (pre-orders begin June 12th)



*Verizon owns AOL, Engadget's parent company. However, Engadget maintains full editorial control, and Verizon will have to pry it from our cold, dead hands.
