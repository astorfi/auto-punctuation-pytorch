As you may recall, this one actually made its debut way back at IFA in the summer, and it looks to be mostly unchanged for its entrance into the US. That includes the standard 4.3-inch touchscreen, 2GB of internal flash memory with a microSD card slot for expansion, handsfree Bluetooth functionality, voice recognition, maps of the US and Canada courtesy of TeleAtlas and, of course, a built-in SIM card slot and GPRS modem to let you take advantage of all those "connected" features. As with the Insignia connected GPS unit, you'll get a year of free service with the device, which certainly makes that $500 price tag a bit more bearable. Look for it to be available sometime in the second quarter of this year.[Via PC Magazine]
