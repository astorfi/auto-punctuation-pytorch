 Just months after hearing that San Franciscans would be forced to deal with the collapse of a seemingly inevitable citywide WiFi access plan, wireless addicts in St. Louis will be mourning similarly. Apparently, grandiose plans laid out by AT&T this past February have now been throttled back quite a bit, as the outfit has announced that it will not be covering the city's 62-square miles with wireless internet. Instead, the firm will be "building a WiFi pilot project in the downtown core and expects to have it in service early next year." It seems that the main issues with completing the initial goal were the inability to find a "cheap way to power the network's transmitters," and you know, figuring out how to spin this into a profitable enterprise.
