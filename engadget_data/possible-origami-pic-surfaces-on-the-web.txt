For the record, we think it's fake, both because the EXIF header includes a little reference to Photoshop CS(yes, we know that could've been used to optimize it for the web, but still...), and because it looks nothing like theversion of Origami that oursources have told us is real. Regardless, somehow we suspect this isn't the last creative rendition of Origamiwe're likely to see before Microsoft lifts the curtain on the genuine article.
