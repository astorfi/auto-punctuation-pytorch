According to Plastic Pals, a group of private investors recently met with the city council (probably Masan's city council, as Robot Land's city council has yet to be built) to hash out details, with the result of the government ponying up some $229 million of a promised $600 million. But not everyone is happy about all this -- indeed, organizers of Incheon City's robot theme park are unamused by the thought of a similar attraction competing for those hard-earned tourist dollars. Of course, there's one way to settle any potential conflict that Engadget wholeheartedly supports: Robot theme park fight! Just as long as the winner doesn't turn on us.
