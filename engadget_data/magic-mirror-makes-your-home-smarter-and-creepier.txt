Okay, LG, you're not the first to come up with the idea of displaying
information in the ol' looking glass (nor the first to
use the term "Magic Mirror"), but maybe you're the first
to make it this freakin' big. This particular Magic Mirror is supposed to provide you with updates on all sorts of
"daily living" sorts of things such as your schedule, the weather, cooking (what, as in "the rest of the family
secretly hated your meal"?), and "outfits" by which we must assume it puts an end to your fashion woes by telling you
what to wear (though it's obviously led this model astray). LG, don't you know gigantic mirrors telling you what to do
in your own home is just kinda creepy? And have you not seen Watcher in the Woods?
