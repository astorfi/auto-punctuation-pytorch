Built by request for a serviceman injured in Iraq, Ben's single handed Xbox 360 controller places the four right-thumb buttons and right bumper at the middle and ring fingers, the right trigger at the pinky, and the left at the index -- but the most inspired bit is the left stick placed beneath on an extension, to be used as a fulcrum while the whole thing rests on a leg or other surface. And despite it all, it still has rumble. Just brilliant. Something tells us these one-handed controller hacks could be big sellers if mass produced. Ben, you laying down the patents yet?
