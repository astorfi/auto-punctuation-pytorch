 Ok, so you've dropped some serious green onyour Aston MartinEdition Nokia 8800, diamond encrustediPod nano, and Samsung Q1 and you'vestill got that mad spending jones -- what to do? How 'bout dropping another few hundie ($399 monthly) on an exclusivemillionaires24.com "Upper Class" email address. For that you get such pedestrian features as 512MB of emailstorage with uh, "unlimited eMail traffic," 1GB file sharing, address book, antispam/antivirus, and justabout every other feature (and less) available on your run-o-the-mill, free email service. But if this is the kind ofhard posing you need to remember your social status, then have it son, and double-quick 'cause the service is limitedto only 10k of your well-heeled peers. Oh, just so you know, that "24" tacked onto the name means, well,nothing apparently. The folks behind the service are just too cheap to buy the domain rights to millionaires.com. 'Nuffsaid, eh?[Via Newlaunches]
