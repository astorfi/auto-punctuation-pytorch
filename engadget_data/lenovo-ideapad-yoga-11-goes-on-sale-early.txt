 So you like what you've heard about the IdeaPad Yoga 13, but still don't relish the prospect of trying to wield a 13-inch Ultrabook (and its matching high price) as a convertible tablet. Not to fear: Lenovo has started taking orders for the system's smaller cousin, the IdeaPad Yoga 11, a few weeks ahead of its planned December launch. The foldable, 11.6-inch Windows RT machine is available to buy in 32GB and 64GB models that cost more than expected in regular pricing, at $849 and $949 respectively, with post-Thanksgiving discounts that whittle those figures down to a more reasonable $679 and $759. Don't count on an early ship date, by any means -- Lenovo is quoting "more than 4 weeks" as of this writing -- but do expect to secure a place in line for what's arguably the least conventional of the ARM-based Windows PCs we've seen so far.
