Nike's line of FuelBand wearables has been a popular choice for those looking to keep tabs on daily activity, but Fuel tallies haven't meant much outside of the company's own apps. Now, with the launch of the Nike+ Fuel Lab in San Francisco, the athletic outfit is looking to expand through partnerships and collaboration. Through the initiative, the Fuel platform will soon team up with "industry-leading companies" that include the likes of MyFitnessPal, RunKeeper and Strava. According to Nike, this means that over 100 million new participants will have access to its "common universal currency to monitor and evaluate" all kinds of activity. "The demand for simpler data-powered experiences is soaring, and all-day sensing is more available on mobile and wearable devices than ever before," said Nike VP of Digital Sport Stefan Olander. "Nike is committed to broadening the use of NikeFuel through collaborations with industry leaders to create smarter products and services." Unfortunately, there's no word on when the integration will begin just yet.
