 The Las Vegas Convention Center's expansive exhibition space may not be open for another five days, but we're already on site, gearing up for the CES madness to come and setting up shop in our temporary headquarters -- that beautiful trailer just above. Sure, we have a pretty good idea of which new mobile gadgets we might see -- and what products not to expect -- and it's pretty much a given that Windows 8 will be just about everywhere, but as always the show is bound to bring some surprises. For now, though, we'll all have to sit tight as thousands of exhibitors put the final lavish touches on their enormous booths. In the meantime, get a taste of the pre-show scene at the LVCC in the gallery just below.
