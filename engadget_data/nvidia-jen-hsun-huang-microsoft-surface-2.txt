NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang has confirmed to CNET that a followup to the Surface RT is in development, and that it will apparently continue to use NVIDIA hardware inside. Recently news concerning the ARM-powered version of Microsoft's tablet hasn't been good, with a $900 million inventory charge and price cuts for both the RT and Pro. According to Jen-Hsun Huang, the addition of an Outlook mail app in Windows 8.1 can be the killer app the platform has been missing, and the company hopes it will be a big success. Rumors for the next gen of Surface have hinted at Microsoft offering Qualcomm chips in some models as well a smaller 7-inch version. NVIDIA may have some Tegra 4-specific features to contribute to the latter -- we'll see if Microsoft can take a bigger bite out of the tablet market on its second attempt.
