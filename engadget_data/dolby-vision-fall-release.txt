Dolby's TV image-enhancement tech has been in development for a long time, and today the company is finally ready to show you when and where you'll find it. What we saw in December has been graced with the Vision name, and the outfit has promised we'll see TVs with it baked in this fall. What's more, Sharp and TCL have compatible hardware on display in their respective CES booths this week, and Amazon, Netflix, VUDU and Xbox Video are stepping up as content providers. Hit the Dolby link below for more information, and be sure to check back later this week for our latest impressions.
