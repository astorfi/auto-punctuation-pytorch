 So you're the very definition of generosity and plan to put a Wii U under the tree for that special someone. Nintendo just provided a helpful tip to keep the kindness going beyond Christmas morning, if it's not too late: update that Wii U's firmware before you wrap the box. Unless the recipients are wired up with Google Fiber, they'll likely face a long wait as that 5GB patch arrives. The process will spoil the unboxing experience, to be sure -- but so does realizing that it's another two hours before anyone can use the eShop and Netflix. Trust us, they'll thank you for it later.
