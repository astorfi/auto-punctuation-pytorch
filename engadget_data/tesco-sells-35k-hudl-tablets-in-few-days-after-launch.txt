Well, according to Tesco's CEO Phil Clarke, via a tweet from Retail Week's Jennifer Creevy, not too shabby: the supermarket chain has offloaded about 35,000 of the devices over the past few days. We very much doubt the likes of Google and Amazon, which have never been forthcoming with early sales figures, will be threatened by the number, but it's surely not a bad start from a retailer that knows more about selling bread and milk than tablets. Incidentally, Amazon's just dropped the price of its soon to be last-gen 7-inch Fire HD to £119, matching that of the Hudl -- if you've got no ClubCard points to secure a discount, that is. We now have one of Tesco's tabs in our possession, so look out for the review. We're assessing the display by rewatching the entirety of Game of Thrones, however, so it might take a while.
