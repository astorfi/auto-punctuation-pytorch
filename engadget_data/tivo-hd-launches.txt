HDMI / component out up to 1080i
Dual frontal CableCARD slots (plus M-Card compatibility! slots are behind the gray plastic bar), single ATSC tuner, analog NTSC, etc. (Same deal as Series3 though, only two tuners can record at the same time.)
No frontal display, Glo remote, or THX cert, still no support for multi-room viewing, TiVoToGo, and TiVoToComeBack
$300 price tag
