By the looks of BlackBerry's stats, millions were not only unfazed by BBM's launch hiccup on Android and iOS, but were also excited to get the app. The company formerly known as RIM says that BBM has been downloaded more than 10 million times within 24 hours since its release on the platforms. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean there are now 10 million devices out there sending and receiving BlackBerry-flavored messages: a boatload of people, including this editor, are still waiting for activation emails before they can even take it for a spin. BBM Video, Voice and Channels haven't made it to the application just yet, but they -- along with other features -- are still on the roadmap. Here's hoping the company's servers can continue handling the onslaught of users.
