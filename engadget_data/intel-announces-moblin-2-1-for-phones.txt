The interface has been redesigned for handheld usage, and there's a lot of widget-based social networking integration, as well as a panels-based navigation system that allows you to flip through multiple running applications. There's no hard date on when this might ship, but it was demoed running on a MID -- which we'll be scoring the show floor trying to find just as soon as the keynote is over.
