Loaded with ICS, the phone is outfitted with a 3.5-inch display, 5-megapixel camera, a front-facing "chat cam" and comes in shades of black, gold, pink and silver. Integrated Facebook features and customizable illuminations are also promised, but the lid hasn't been lifted on more detailed specs. As of now, the social-minded phone is only slated for release in Europe, but look out below for some additional glamour shots or head past the break for the video unveiling.
