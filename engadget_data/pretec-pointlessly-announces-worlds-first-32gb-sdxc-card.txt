       Here it is, the world's first SDXC card... announcement. Unfortunately, PRETEC's take on the new SD eXtended Capacity storage format falls well short of the 2TB theoretical maximum at 32GB (a 64GB card is promised for later in the year), as does the card's 50MBps transfer rate when 300MBps data rates are possible. Still, a first's a first, at least it could be if this is the first SDXC card to go retail -- PRETEC doesn't list a price or a ship date. Let's just hope that devices supporting the SDXC standard appear at about the same time these SDXC cards do ship, eh?
