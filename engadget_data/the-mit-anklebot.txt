Though we'd like it to, "robotic therapy" will not treat your
Roomba's delusions of overlordian
grandeur. Rather, we're talking machines which snap onto human appendages to assist with movement â€” showing particular
promise in the rehabilitation of stroke victims. MIT already developed a bot to assist with arm movement that provides
rehab patients with "twice the improvement" as those using traditional therapy. Now they've released the Anklebot
(prototype) which uses a less cumbersome approach than the
Swiss to help with wrist movement. Oh ok, the ankle but couldn't they at least call it something like Ankleborg3000
to get our geek juice flowin'? In fact, the team at MIT envision a gym full of rehabilitation equipment which we can
only hope will make patients look as intimidating as
this.
