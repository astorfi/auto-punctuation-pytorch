 Now it's on. After letting Intel run amok with the performance per watt crown for a few months with that well received Core Duo processor of theirs, AMD is jumping into the game with their new Turion 64 X2 chips. The chips range from 1.6GHz to 2.0GHz, and range in price from $184 to $354 in bulk purchases. Of course, it's just not nice these days to call a chip by its clock speed, so the models go by names like TL-50 (1.6GHz), TL-56 (1.8GHz) and TL-60 (2.0GHz). Turns out the wattage, when in an active state at least, is a bit higher than that of the Core Duo, but AMD claims that the Turion 64 X2 won't zap as much power in the down times, so it might turn out to be a wash. No matter how it works out for performance per watt per dollar per lame model number scheme, more competition in the mobile space should be fun. At least for our benchmarks if not for our wallets.[Via MobileMag]
