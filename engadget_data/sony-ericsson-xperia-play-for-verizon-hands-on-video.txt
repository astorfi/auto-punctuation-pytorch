 
Well, we knew it was coming, and tonight at CTIA we finally got our dirty little hands on Sony Ericsson's Xperia Play for Verizon. It's pretty much what we expected: an Xperia Play that's lacking a SIM slot but displaying a couple of Verizon tattoos logos. The front-facing camera is still on the menu, along with a tasty serving of Gingerbread -- Android 2.3.2, to be exact. Strangely, the custom skin we saw during our hands-on at MWC was nowhere to be found on Verizon's model, being replaced instead by what appears to be the stock Gingerbread UI with some Sony Ericsson wallpapers and widgets. The Xperia Play app was on full display on the demo phones, which came preloaded with Ashphalt 6, Bruce Lee, Crash Bandicoot, Star Battalion, Madden '11, and The Sims 3. Take a peek at our gallery below, and poke your way past the break for our hands-on video.
