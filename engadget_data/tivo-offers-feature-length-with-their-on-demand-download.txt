You can now catch your favorite star of that veritable action classic, Mortal Kombat, in a new
feature length documentary called Red Trousers with TiVo's on-demand
download service, a nice sign that
they're going to keep on keeping on even after the death of their
plans with Netflix for the potential
distribution of Hollywood movies. Unfortunately the download requires some mojo involving the TiVo website, your email
address, and waiting around until November 23rd for the movie to come through, but at least it's a step in the right
direction.
