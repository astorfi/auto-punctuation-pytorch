  ViewSonic's ViewPad VS14445 -- also known as the ViewPad 10e -- has been kicking around since CES, and other parts of the globe have had access for a few months now. That said, those in America who've been holding out for this particular Android slate won't have to wait much longer. A drop by the FCC's database typically means that a product is just weeks away from being on store shelves, and considering that we've already been waiting months on end to get from 'hands-on' to 'now shipping' in this part of the world, hopefully it'll be out and about before long. Hoping that it'll run Ice Cream Sandwich? We'd go ahead and stash those dreams aside...
