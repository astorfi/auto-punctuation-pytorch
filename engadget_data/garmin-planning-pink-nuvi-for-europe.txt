 Perhaps concerned that it's developing a reputation as something of a hard ass due to its serial legal battles with TomTom, American navigation darling Garmin will reportedly try to show off its sensitive side in Europe during the upcoming holiday season. Buried in a piece about the state of mass market satnav, Reuters reveals that Garmin has a Buddy-like, pink "nuvi-branded device" in the pipeline aimed at the fashionable ladies of Europe, most likely some variation of the 200 series. No more info is given, and since this doesn't sound like a very exciting product to begin with save for the fresh paint job, interested parties should probably keep their eyes on European GPS forums.[Via GPS Tracklog]
