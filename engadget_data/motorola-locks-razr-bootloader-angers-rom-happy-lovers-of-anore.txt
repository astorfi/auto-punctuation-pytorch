Sure, the Atrix is ripe for the hacking, but it seems like Verizon really doesn't want Moto encouraging its customers to start mucking around with custom ROMs. The official Motorola Mobility Twitter account says the RAZR bootload is locker per the carrier's request. It's a shame, but we're sure this will be only a temporary roadblock. If it takes more than a month to crack this bad boy we'll be shocked.
