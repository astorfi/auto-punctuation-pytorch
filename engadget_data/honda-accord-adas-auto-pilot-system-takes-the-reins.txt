 We've heard of radar assisted cruise control,that has certain luxury cars running at set speeds on the highway, but slows them down or speeds them up when they gettoo close to a car in front or behind. Well now Honda UK is taking it to another level with their Advanced DriverAssist System (ADAS) that not only regulates your speed, but manages the turning, allowing you a full auto-pilot system for yourAccord when you're out on the freeway. The Adaptive Cruise Control is your regular radar variety, but the Lane KeepAssist System keeps you headed in the right direction by using a camera on the rear-view mirror to watch the whitelines and turn accordingly. Honda was quick to point out that their system isn't exactly set up for you to take a nap,since the ADAS system will beep every 10 seconds to make sure you're paying attention, requiring you to touch thesteering wheel to inform the car you're still in charge, but we're sure someone is going manage an accident and anensuing lawsuit or three out of this "convenience".[Via TG Daily]
