That note came with some rosy news, however, informing early adopters that they would be receiving the device for free, so they could join in on the extended beta testing. Today we got a note from one of the aforementioned pre-orderers informing him that the device had shipped. We reached out to Google, who confirmed the shipments. Still no word on how long the rest of the world will have to wait for the new and improved Q, however.  [Thanks, Fred]
