Since it's our God-given right as Americans not to have to learn to speak other languages (hey, if it was
good enough for Jesusâ€¦) it's good thing
that there's a new version of the Phraselator, a handheld that can do instant translation. The Phraselator P2 has even
better speech recognition and a wider vocabulary than its predecessor, and can recognize more than 15,000 phrases in 53
languages. Supposedly troops in Iraq have even been using a customized version of one of these.
