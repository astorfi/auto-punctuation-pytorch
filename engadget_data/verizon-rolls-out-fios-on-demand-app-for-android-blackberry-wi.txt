As we'd heard earlier, the number of officially supported devices is somewhat limited to start with --- including the Droid X, Droid 2, and Storm 2, to name a couple -- but Verizon notes that the list is expanding, and to check back often. Of course, you won't simply be limited to watching the movies on your phone; you can also transfer them from your phone to your PC, and view them on any combination of up to four devices in addition to a FiOS TV set-top box.
