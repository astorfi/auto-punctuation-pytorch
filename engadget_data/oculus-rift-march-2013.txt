Were you one of the many folks to donate your hard-earned cash to the crazy folks developing the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset? Sadly, we've got some bad news for ya -- you won't be playing Doom 3: BFG Edition with your new headset any time this year, as the device isn't shipping to its Kickstarter backers until some time next March. Citing a variety of factors, the folks at Oculus say it's simply impossible to get the dev kits manufactured and shipped to all 7,500 backers within the previous time frame of "before 2012 ends." The company hopes to have all dev kit orders fulfilled by mid-April 2013.

Moreover, a handful of tech specs have changed on the OR since we last saw it, including a display change from 5.6-inch LCD to 1280 x 800 7-inch -- that's a lot of screen connected to your face! As such, the whole device is a bit heavier than before (by 30g). Additionally, previously off the shelf motion sensors were replaced with a custom one "that excels in VR-critical areas." Should you wish to get into all the (extremely) nitty gritty details, Oculus has a detailed Kickstarter update right here.
