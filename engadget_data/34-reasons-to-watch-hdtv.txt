 We counted 34 "fly-away" hairs on Marg Helgenberger's head that you would never see on an analog set. Trust us, we checked by snapping this picture from CSI last night on CBS in 1080i. We had to go back to our PVR on the non-digital set and guess what? No fly-aways on Marg!Let us know if you're on the fence for an HDTV purchase; maybe we'll snap an occasional pic like this so you can see what you're missing! Yes, before you even ask: we have way too much time on our hands.
