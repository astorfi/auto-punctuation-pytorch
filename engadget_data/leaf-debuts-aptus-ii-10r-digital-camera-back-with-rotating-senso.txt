Well, it looks like Leaf is now making folks' lives a tad easier with its new Aptus-II 10R digital camera back, which packs a rotating sensor that will let you switch from portrait to landscape orientation without actually removing the camera back from the camera. Other than that, you can expect a 56-megapixel sensor, a 3.5-inch touchscreen, ISO range from 80-800, and full compatibility with most medium and large format cameras. Oh, and a price of â‚¬24,995, or about $33,700.
