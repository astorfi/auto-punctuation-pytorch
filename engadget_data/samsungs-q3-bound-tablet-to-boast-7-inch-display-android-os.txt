 Slowly but surely, Samsung's future as a tablet PC provider is taking shape. Details on the outfit's foray into the world of the slate has been trickling out over the past few months, and shortly after learning that a so-called Galaxy Tab would be out and about in Q3, now we're finding out two more critical details: screen size and operating system. According to the company, the Q3-bound device (assumed to be the aforesaid Galaxy Tab) will boast a smaller-than-average 7-inch screen, and rather than humming along on Bada or Windows 7, Google's Android will be at the helm. We're being forced to wait for further information, but given the proximity to Q3, all should be crystal clear in the not-too-distant future.
