 
Well, color us surprised! Here we have yet another "limited edition" PlayStation 3 bundle, this time with Uncharted: Drake's Fortune packed in alongside a PlayStation Network voucher for PAIN, a DualShock 3 wireless controller and... a 160GB PS3 console? Yep, Sony's formally introducing us to the new king, which will start shipping to North America this November in the aforementioned kit for $499.99. Curiously, there's no word as to whether it'll be released separate from the bundle (we're guessing yes), and there's no mention of PS2 backwards compatibility (so don't count on it). In related news, the "new" $399.99 80GB version is finally shipping to retailers, so you should be able to snap one up in the very, very near future.
