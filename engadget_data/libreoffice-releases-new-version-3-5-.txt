  Microsoft recently outed a preview of MS Office 15, so it's fitting that the Document Foundation has taken the wraps off the next major release of Office's open source competition, LibreOffice. Among the new features is a bundle of upgrades for its word processor, including a built-in grammar checker and a real-time word count window. Its PowerPoint equivalent, Impress, received the ability to embed multimedia and custom color palettes among others upgrades, while the spreadsheet software, Calc, now supports up to 10,000 sheets per workbook. Version 3.5 also reintroduces an online update checker to make it easy to keep LibreOffice up to date. All total, 30,000 code commits went into the improvements, so if you're on the open source office suite bandwagon, don't let that hard work go to waste -- check out the fruits of their labor at the source link below.
