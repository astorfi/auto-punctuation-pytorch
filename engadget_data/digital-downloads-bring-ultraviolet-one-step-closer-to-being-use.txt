Of course being able to download and watch a handful of movies on a single movie application is far from anyone's dream, but we supposed you have to start somewhere. If you had your hopes a simpler solution, though, you might also keep dreaming as the video after the break seems to show just how complicated one can make watching a movie. We suppose we'd be more excited if we'd just purchased Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 and learned that we could now also watch it on our tablet or smartphone -- now even if we aren't connected to the internet -- but perhaps like you, the final Potter installment isn't exactly on the top of our must have movie list.
