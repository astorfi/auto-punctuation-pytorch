 Reuters is reporting that Hon Hai, the manufacturer that everyone else knows as Foxconn Technology, saw its sales tumble in the first quarter of this year. In the post-Christmas season, the iPhone maker brought in $26.9 billion -- a fall of 19 percent compared to the same quarter last year. It's a strange turn of events, seeing as 2012 turned out to be a record year for the company, but Reuters interprets the figures as being a symptom of a drop in demand for the Apple products that Hon Hai builds and is largely dependent on -- an issue that has been brewing for a while now.
