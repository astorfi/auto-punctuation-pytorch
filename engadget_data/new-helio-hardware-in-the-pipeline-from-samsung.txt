No real deets on the device itself, though this pictured Z400Â "phone of champions" may be the culprit. Anything is an upgrade from the Hero, although the Z400 lacks the Kickflip's style; at any rate, if Helio wants to save itself, we're hoping Bluetooth finds its way into the mix this time around.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
