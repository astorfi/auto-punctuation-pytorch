Inside its unassuming shell, the GMonster Quad holds up to (you guessed it!) four 32GB CF memory cards, and a JMicron controller described by our man in Taipei as "awesome fast." No word on price yet, but we're sure to find out before this bad boy goes on sale in the next few weeks. In the meantime, enjoy the award-winning video after the break.
