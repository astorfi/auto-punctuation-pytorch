If all of the 4K -- or 8K! -- talk from CES has you jonesing for a new TV, but you're short on scratch, we've got good news. Vizio has announced pricing for its P-series of Ultra HD panels and they'll sell for a lot less than you might expect. A 50-incher will run you a measly grand. Each five-inch bump in size ups the price $400, all the way up to the $2,600 70-inch set. Given that Vizio has a solid reputation, this line could be a reliable way to watch House of Cards in its native resolution without breaking the bank.
