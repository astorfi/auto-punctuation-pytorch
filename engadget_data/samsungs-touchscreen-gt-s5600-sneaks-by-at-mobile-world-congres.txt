This small and potentially lower-cost touchscreen features Samsung's TouchWiz UI, some type of cam, touchscreen display, and we're sure plenty of other goodies that we still have to figure out. While Mobile-review caught sight of it at the show, Samsung seems perfectly happy to remain tight-lipped about it, so hopefully we'll catch wind of more info in the near term. Until then, feel free to follow the read link for a few more pics.[Via UnwiredView.com]
