Despite discontinuing Wii shipments in both Japan and Europe, Nintendo is apparently charging ahead with Wii sales in the US by offering a $100 Wii Mini this month with MarioKart Wii packed in. The previously Canada-exclusive console is the final iteration of Nintendo's extremely popular Wii game console, and looks distinctly different from the original hardware. In terms of functionality, the Wii Mini lacks backwards compatibility with the GameCube and cannot access the internet (yes, seriously). But if your'e looking to play some disc-based Wii games and hate less expensive used Wiis, this is your best bet this holiday.
