In keeping with Dell's recent tradition, details are nonexistent at the moment, but we've snapped a couple pics -- if you look closely you can see a pretty wild hinge design. We'll update you ASAP, keep it locked!  Update: And... that was it. Seriously, you would think Dell would've maybe learned something from the original Adamo launch and maybe dished out some info, but as usual they just waved it around for a second and then talked about less-interesting things. Still, here's what we know -- it's super thin, and it obviously unfolds in a completely new way. We're digging for more, we'll let you know.
