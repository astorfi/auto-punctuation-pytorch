 If you like to let your fingers do the talking but basic text and smileys alone don't cut it, Samsung has just released version 2.0 of its ChatON internet-based messaging app. It works on Android, iOS, Blackberry, Bada and even web browsers to let you send missives to your besties -- alone or in groups -- with video, audio or images. The updated app / website works in over 200 countries and 60 languages, and now includes a multiscreen feature to let you chat with over five separate accounts at once along with the ability to conscript new chat-ees via Facebook or Twitter. You'll still be able to post messages to the "trunk" for friends to see before they hit social networks or create a personal profile with status updates -- so, hit the source for more info, social butterflies.
