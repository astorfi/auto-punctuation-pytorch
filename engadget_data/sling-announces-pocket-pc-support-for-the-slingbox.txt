We don't really know whether it's a public beta or it's the real deal, butapparently there may or may not be some associated subscription or software fee for it -- we certainly hope not on theformer, but we'd like to think the latter could be foregone as well. Either way, we'll be stoked to be watching ourteev on the go.[Thanks, Dave]
