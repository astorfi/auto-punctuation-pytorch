TEN Technology is working on a Bluetooth adapter for the iPod called the naviPlay that'll
work with Bluetooth stereo headphones (assuming that any of those ever see the light of day), Bluetooth cellphone
headsets (so you can listen to your iPod and take phone calls), or with any regular headphones using an included Remote
Headphone Adapter. This was actually supposed to have already come out earlier this year, and the fact that the only
picture we could find of it was this simple illustration doesn't necessarily inspire much confidence that the
naviPlay will be out soon.
