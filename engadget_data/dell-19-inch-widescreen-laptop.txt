We need to be more careful what we ask for.Â 
While we are pleased to hear the DigiTimes report that widescreen laptops may account for "80-90% of the notebook
market in the first half of 2006," the news that Dell will launch a first-ever 19-inch model next year has us
giggling-up bubbles in our fruit loops. Given how massive a 19-inch laptop would have to be it's doubtful you'd ever
see one of these backbreaking monsters outside the cubicle, especially if it comes packed in the usual sleep-inducing
Dell plastic slab.
