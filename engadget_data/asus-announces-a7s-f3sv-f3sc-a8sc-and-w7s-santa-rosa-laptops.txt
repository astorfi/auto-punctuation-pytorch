 Just in case the recent outpouring of Santa Rosa wasn't doing enough to keep you satisfied, ASUS just announced five laptops sporting the new mobile processor. None of 'em break much ground on the design or form factor side of things, but Santa Rosa isn't the only thing these laptops have going for them. The 17-inch A7S-7S006C runs a 2GHz T7300 Core 2 Duo processor, 2GB of RAM, a 1440 x 900 screen and perhaps most excitingly, the new NVIDIA GeForce 8400G mobile graphics card with 896MB of RAM. For sheer power, the ASUS F3SV (pictured) is teh win, with T7100 to T7700 procs at its disposal, up to 2GB of RAM, and NVIDIA GeForce 8600M graphics with up to 1GB of RAM. The F3SC is similar, but steps graphics down to an 8400, with 384MB of RAM -- both laptops feature 1280 x 800 15.4-inch screens. The same graphics card ends up in the A8SC, alongside a 1.8GHz T7100 processor, 1GB of RAM and a 14.1-inch 1280 x 800 screen. Finally, the W7S brings up the rear with a 1.3-inch 1280 x 800 screen, T7100-T7500 processor, 2GB of RAM and 128MB of GeForce 8400 graphics. All of the laptops feature webcams of various resolution, along with plentiful connectivity. No word on when specifically these are due to wow us with their DirectX 10 prowess, or how much those fun and games will cost.
