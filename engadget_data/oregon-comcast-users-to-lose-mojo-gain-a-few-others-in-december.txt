A recent bill sent to an Oregon Comcast subscriber explained that MOJO HD would be falling off of the EPG "on or after December 1st," although SPEED HD (723), Versus HD (732), Golf HD (733), FOX News HD (748) and FX HD (753) would be added. Interestingly, this also points out the separation of Versus / Golf HD as a single station, though we're unsure if this will end up being a sweeping change or simply a localized one.[Thanks, Brad]
