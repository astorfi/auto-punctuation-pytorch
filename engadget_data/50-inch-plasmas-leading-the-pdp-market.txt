2007 is the year of the 50-inch plasma. For the first and second quarter of this year, 50-inches have outsold their little 42-inch brothers. In fact, 58% of the plasmas sold in Q2 were between the sizes of 50-59-inches. Quixel Research also indicates that plasma's archrival, LCD, was 65% more expensive than PDPs. We would love to see a chart indicating decline prices as it is apparent that consumers are choosing to spend nearly the same amount of money, but simply picking up the bigger screen. Alternatively, how 'bout a chart showing the rising rate of foreclosures against increasing HDTV sales?
