Apple products are especially privy to such treatment, and the MacBook is proving no exception, going from announcement to dissection in roughly 24 hours. The dissasembler over at Kodawarisan responsible for this was quite thorough, and along the way displays a couple of the niceities of the MacBook. First off, the RAM slots are quite convenient. You just remove the screws from the memory door and you have access to the two slots, with little ejector tabs to help you with your efforts. Replacing the hard drive is just as easy (pictured bottom left), which means you can finally replace your own drive without voiding the warranty. Perpendicular storage here we come![ViaÂ Tuaw, Zatz Not Funny]
