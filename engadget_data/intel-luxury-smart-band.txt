We understand: you want to get into the whole wearable tech thing, but what's holding you back is how fugly most current offerings are. That shouldn't deter you for long, as Intel has made good on its promise to make a smart-bracelet that doesn't look like an overgrown phone strapped to your wrist. It's called the MICA (My Intelligent Communication Accessory) and the notification-bracelet be available at Opening Ceremony and high-end retailer Barney's for the holiday shopping season this year, according to USA Today. Pricing isn't quite set in stone yet, but an Intel rep tells CNET that the cuff-style gadget will run under $1,000. Slightly expensive for a a wearable, sure, but not so much when compared against, say, a piece of traditional jewelry. The MICA comes in black and white (as illustrated by the image above), and will feature either Chinese pearls and lapis stones or tiger's eye and obsidian depending on which color of watersnake skin you opt for. Snazzy!



If the device's looks don't do it for you, maybe its capabilities will. The MICA packs a 1.6-inch sapphire touchscreen covering an OLED display that'll show off, among other things, your text messages and calendar reminders. An internal 3G radio (no smartphone-pairing needed, apparently) keeps it connected to mobile data and it can be charged either via USB or a wireless system. Still want more? Swing by Opening Ceremony's spring/summer 2015 show this Sunday during New York Fashion Week for the gizmo's official unveiling.
