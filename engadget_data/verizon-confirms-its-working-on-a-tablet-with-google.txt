Unfortunately, that's all we've got to work with at the moment -- McAdam said tablets are "part of the 'next big wave of opportunities,' but didn't say what OS the Google devices would run, just that Verizon's "looking at all the things Google has in its archives that we could put on a tablet to make it a great experience." That sounds like something Google's been working on for a while, so we'll take a guess and say it's Android-based, but we wouldn't be surprised to see a Chrome OS tablet or netbook make the scene at some point in the future. We're also wondering who'll build this thing: any number of companies from Dell to Toshiba to MSI have already started working on Android tablets, and we're sure HTC and Motorola would totally jump at the opportunity. A nice crisp confirmed fact wrapped in layers of chewy speculation -- just how we likes it.

Update: Bloomberg scored some more details in an interview with Marquett Smith, Verizon's VP of corporate communications; the tablet is said be Android-based, and more details will be released later this week. Let the wait begin!
