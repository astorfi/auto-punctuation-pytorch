The next generation of consoles are in the wild, and now that the general public has access, they're bumping up against some new restrictions with the way they work. While Twitch is clamping down on its live streams, on the Xbox One side some users have run afoul of XBL policies against foul language in their Upload Studio clips. Microsoft hasn't been specific about what constitutes a violation, but in a statement to TechCrunch it says "excessive swearing" (in Upload Studio, peer to peer communications like Skype are reportedly unmonitored) can lead to some or all Xbox Live privileges disappearing. In this case, it appears to usually manifest as a 24 hour ban on voice communication, which some of those affected first noticed when they tried to use a different app like Skype. We'll see if these policies or the way they're enforced evolve over time (if not, you may be in for some very quiet gaming sessions with your favorite Engadget editors), but for now you might want to tell the world what you think of campers after liberating an uploaded clip from SkyDrive.



To be clear, the Xbox Live Policy & Enforcement team does not monitor direct peer-to-peer communications like Skype chats and calls. Also, we take Code of Conduct moderation via Upload Studio very seriously. We want a clean, safe and fun environment for all users. Excessive profanity as well as other Code of Conduct violations will be enforced upon and result in suspension of some or all privileges on Xbox Live. We remain committed to preserving and promoting a safe, secure and enjoyable experience for all of our Xbox Live members.
