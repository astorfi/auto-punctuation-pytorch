Well, they gave us the latest iteration of the device as it's been moving forward, as well as some details -- and we have to say, this is the first UMPC we've genuinely been able to get excited about. The sub 2-pounder will supposedly be somehow optimized for VoIP, videoconferencing, viewing live TV and VOD, and apparently even gaming (we're hoping they mean light gaming -- no CrossFire going on up in here). It's also supposed to have voice recognition systems (presumably for use with GPS guidance and the like),  a docking station, and is set to be priced under $800 for Q4 2006 launch. So basically it sounds like they're making a bunch of stuff up to get us excited, because we're having a hard time believing they're going to meet these goals. Then again, with capabilities so tantalizing and a price that low, we're a little tempted to turn a blind eye and hope for the best.Update: Ok, we've got some preliminary specs here! Look out for a 1GHz Celeron M,  30 or 40GB drive, up to 1GB RAM, 1.3 megapixel webcam, Bluetooth, 802.11b/g, WWAN optional, 4-in-1 card reader, external VGA and audio outs, and a 5-inch 800 x 480 display. Pepper Pad 3, watchout now, kid.
