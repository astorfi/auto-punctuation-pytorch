Have kids that refuse to use a cellphone because they're worried about exposing their developing brains to
potentially harmful radiation? Yeah, well Guidetek has just the handset to overcome their intransigence: the i-care, a
bear-shaped dual-band GSM cellphone that comes in five different colors (we're not even going to make a Care Bears
reference, ok?). Like a lot of those other toddlerphones (like the
Firefly), the i-care replaces the regular numeric keypad
(which means your kid can't call phone sex lines) with four speed dial keys that can be programmed to automatically
call you, the police, etc.
