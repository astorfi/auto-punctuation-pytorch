Well, at least we know it's for real now: someone over at HowardForums posted up a live pic of that new
BlackBerry 8700 we were blathering on about the other
day. They don't confirm (or deny) any specs, but last we heard the 8700 was supposedly going to have built-in GPS and
come in an EV-DO version for Verizon and Sprint and an EDGE version for Cingular. Not a huge step forward in terms of
design (the EV-DO's the big deal here), but it's definitely a smidge less clunky than your typical BlackBerry.
