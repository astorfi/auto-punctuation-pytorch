Sort of the opposite of the Devil Duckie,
SolidAlliance's new i-Duck Love is a, um, more love-themed special-edition of their regular i-Duck USB drive that we're
thinking a certain special lady might be getting for Valentine's Day (if we can remember to try and find this five
months from now, that is). Only comes with 32MB of storage space, but you're not really buying it just for that since a
portion of every purchase also goes towards funding AIDS research.
