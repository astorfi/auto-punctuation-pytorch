Swaddled in silk with a "coming soon" teaser tagged on Olympus' European site is what can only be the new flagship shooter they've been dribbling out at tradeshows under the "P-1" codename. No specs of course, only that the E-1's successor will take "the excellent picture quality, mobility, and reliability of the E-1 to new and unprecedented levels." Hey, that's what Olympus says. Still, until they take off the veil, well, anything goes.[Via Impress]
