We're pretty sure the P.E.A.R.T. (Pneumatic and Electronic Actuated RoboT) was designed specifically for all the
droves of aspiring post-electronic musicians selling their turntables for guitars, being that it interfaces with your
computer via USB and plays MIDI tracks. But make no mistake about it, all that stuff about the drummer being the most
replaceable member of the band just got very real. And like Louis and the
EZ Trumpet, Buddy Rich must also be rolling in his grave.
But in a good way this time.
