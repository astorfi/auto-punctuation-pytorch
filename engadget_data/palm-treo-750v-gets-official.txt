Palm has issued all the juicy details on their UK site, and... well, it's pretty much exactly what we expected: internal antenna, quadband GSM with triband UMTS (lending itself to a Cingular release), and a superbly average 1.3-megapixel cam sitting atop Windows Mobile 5 Pocket PC Phone Edition. The phone is still apparently in the pre-order phase, though Vodafone's site is showing a price "From Free to Â£127.66" (about $240) depending on contract -- not bad considering what you get, but whether similar pricing will carry over to Cingular is another question entirely.[Thanks, Wolwol and Camp]
