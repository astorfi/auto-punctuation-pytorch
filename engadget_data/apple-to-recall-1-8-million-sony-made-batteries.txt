Apple has just recalled 1.8 million iBook and PowerBook laptop batteries, 1.1 million of those in the US and 700,000 abroad. They've had their fair share of recalls already, including the unrelated MacBook Pro battery recall just last month, and another Powerbook/iBook recall last year, but this one really takes the proverbial cake. Apple says they've received nine reports of overheating, with two incidents of minor burning and a few claims of "minor" property damage. The laptop models include the 12-inch iBook G4, 12-inch PowerBook G4 and 15-inch PowerBook G4, and the recall includes computers sold from October 2003 through August 2006. So unless you're looking for the next hot pic of a laptop inferno, we suppose you'd better head on over to the official recall site and peep your battery serial number for the official word on your particular model.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
