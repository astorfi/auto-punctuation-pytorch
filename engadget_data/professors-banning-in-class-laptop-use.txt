 In yet another signthat Luddism is alive and well in academia (remember Lakehead University's silly WiFi ban?), theAssociated Press has picked up on a disturbing "trend" of professors banning laptops in their classrooms.Unlike the WiFi brouhaha, which revolved around fears that the wireless signals might be dangerous, keeping laptops outof the lecture hall is seen as a way of forcing students to pay attention. The AP article cites several law schoolprofessors who have enacted the ban, including one whose inspiration came while serving as an expert witness in atrial, when he realized the court stenographer wasn't absorbing any of the content that he/she was transcribing. If youask us, not only does this policy fail to address the root of a problem -- hey Prof, try making your classes moreinteresting if you want people to pay attention -- but considering what students are paying for a higher educationthese days, they should be allowed to lug a mainframe and three monitors to class if that's how they like to get theirlearnin' done.
