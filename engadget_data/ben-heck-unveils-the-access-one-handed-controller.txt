The modular rig features five interchangeable pods -- one each for the analog sticks, d-pad, main buttons, and shoulder buttons -- that can be rearranged to make any control scheme one-hand-friendly. Ben says the Access is in pre-production with eDimensional, and will be hitting in PS2 / 3 versions first with a planned 360 version to follow -- although it certainly looks like a brave 360 controller was involved in making that prototype. More photos await you at the read link.
