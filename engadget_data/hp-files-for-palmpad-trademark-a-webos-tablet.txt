We don't know much apart from that, but it's certainly an encouraging sign -- and we can't help but feel a twinge of nostalgia for a name that harkens back to the glory days of the PalmPilot. Now we're just wondering when (this fall?), how much, and -- as usual -- what this means for the HP Slate. We'll keep our eyes open.
