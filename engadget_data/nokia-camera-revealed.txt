The announcements keep coming, and Elop's just dropped the new Nokia Camera app into our laps. This unifies the existing Pro and Smart cameras, and brings three new modes, including a "smart mode" which shoots a stream of shots, and lets you remove objects, or create a sequence shot after the fact -- the reframing/zoom mode also makes a come back. There's also quick access at the top of the interface that lets you switch to different features easily. That should go nicely with the new 1520's 20MP shooter!


Update: Nokia Camera is now available to download through the Windows Phone Store; it replaces Nokia Pro Camera on existing Lumias.
