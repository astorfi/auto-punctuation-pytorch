Customers around the US are receiving email notifications today stating that their Watch Instantly disc (required for Netflix playback on the Wii) has shipped, and it should be waiting in their mailbox before this weekend begins. We'll be interested to see how the streaming service performs on the weakest of the three major consoles, but given that no 1080p content is available, we doubt they'll be any major snags. Let us know when your disc arrives and how the experience is down in comments, won'tcha?
