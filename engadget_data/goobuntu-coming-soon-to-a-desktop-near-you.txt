 The rumor mill continues tocrank out stories about the GooglePC and the Windows-challenging OS it will run. And now that phantom operating system actually has a name: Goobuntu.According to reports, Google has already developed the OS, based on Ubuntu Linux and the Gnome desktop, and may be closeto rolling it out. Of course, Goobuntu may actually be just for internal use; Google has in the past admitted to usingan internally developed OS for its servers. However, it could be the next step in Google's quest for desktop hegemony. We just hopeit runs Google Earth and Picasa, or we're not interested.Update: Another Google rumorbites the dust, since according to Ars Technica,Google spokeswoman Sonya Bor√§lv says that "[w]e use Ubuntu internally but have no plans to distribute itoutside of the company." It's almost as if they enjoy crushing our hopes and dreams.
