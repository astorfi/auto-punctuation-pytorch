With pretty much every spec of the Nexus 5 already leaked, it was only a matter of time before it popped up prematurely in a video. The seven-minute clip shows the device from all angles and running various apps like Google Earth, albeit without any sound. The unit matches a previous accidental photo leak from Google, but it's unlikely the final version; the software is listed as KeyLimePie, the back is marked with "Not For Sale" and the camera lens appears rough around the edges. One Week Creations notes that the original video (likely from retailer, Club SFR Smartphones) was set to private, but you can catch a rip of it via YouTuber Enaze Uddin after the break.
