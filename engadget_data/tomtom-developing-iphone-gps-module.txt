Might be, might not. TomTom is a Dutch company and a righteous, straight-talkin' Dutchman would never tell such a fib, would he? On the other hand, that device is clearly not in a car heading to Rotterdam. Still, it could be a route demo and that stretch of highway (A13/E19) is a favorite for internal TomTom validation studies. Surely a move towards GPS is a logical next step for Apple -- particularly after that little VW concept. And with Apple on the verge of opening the iPhone to third party developers, well, anything goes, eh?
