Looks an awful lot like all those anonymous Windows Mobile-powered Smartphones out there, so odds are they're just
rebranding somebody else's something or other, but the tri-band GSM/GPRS AXIA A108 doesn't actually run on Windows
Mobileâ€”it runs on Windows CE .NET 4.2. Does have a lot of other stuff you may be interested in, like a 1.3 megapixel
digital, a 2.2-inch, 240x320, 262,000 color LCD touchscreen, 64MB of flash ROM, 64MB of RAM, and an miniSD memory card
slot. There is, as usual, no information about when this might ever come out here.
