We had a few things toask about what the deal is with UMPCs and Origami, here's what welearned: Origami is a term originated from Berkes that doesn't necessarily refer to a device or specific hardwarespecification, per se, but to an ultramobile PC running Windows Tablet (or Vista, later) and enhanced Microsoft TouchPack (a suite of apps and utilities meant to optimize using Windows by touch, and not necessarily only by stylus).Touch Pack consists of a launcher app that better groups and opens apps based on a touchscreen interface; DialKeys, athumb-based text input system that uses those two onscreen touch inputs on eitherside; Touch Improvements, a suite of environment optimizations to make using Windows with your fingers a less painfulexperience; and some other stuff, like Sudoku and an Origami-optimized Windows Media skin to kind of round out thewhole thing.Otto made it pretty clear that Microsoft is aiming UMPCs based on Tablet with Touch Pack at thegeneral consumer, and not necessarily as another device for the already gadget-laden mobile office -- we'll be seeing(and have already seen) initially launches by the likes of Samsung, Asus, and Founder, so keepan eye out for those today. We did ask about Alexandria, the other Microsoft buzz-video /project we saw the other day, and it sounded like a system MS was working to ease acquiring music and movies online --is Alexandria a service that might be an iTunes-killer, perhaps? We don't know (we're working on finding out), but wedo finally know what the hell Origami is, and now you do too.
