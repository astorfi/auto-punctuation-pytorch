 No Android Market? No problem! The 10-inch Advent Vega tablet, famously boasting NVIDIA's Tegra 2 chipset, just went on sale across the pond earlier today, and after a matter of hours, the Â£249 device has already sold out. In a message that sounds eerily similar to that uttered by HP regarding its Slate, PC World has confessed that the first shipment "sold out nearly as quickly as 'Take That' tickets." It's hard to say just how "unprecedented" the demand was with no actual sales figures, but it looks as if this here tablet will be quite the item this holiday season. The Tickle Me Elmo of slates? Maybe, just maybe.

Update: We've touched base with PC World and Currys in the UK, and both reckon that it'll be "another week or two" before stock is replenished.
