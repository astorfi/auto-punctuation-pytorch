That's a privilege often enjoyed by HD film editors, graphic designers, and those of us who know how to beat the technology ordering system at work. Luckily, Dell's new UltraSharp U2412M isn't ultra expensive, delivering over 2.3 million pixels with its 24-inch LED-backlit display. It also features in-plane switching (IPS) with a wide viewing angle, a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio, DisplayPort and DVI connectivity, a built-in USB hub, and height adjustability. Oh, and it retails for $399. That price tag may make you reconsider spending an extra $200 per inch for Apple's new $999 Thunderbolt Display, though Dell's 24-incher notably lacks a built-in webcam, and is somewhat limited in the connectivity department. Still, we like to see HD monitors that don't cost more than many all-in-ones, and, knowing Dell, you should be able to find the U2412M for less than retail, assuming you're willing to test your patience with that 17-inch CRT for a few more weeks.
