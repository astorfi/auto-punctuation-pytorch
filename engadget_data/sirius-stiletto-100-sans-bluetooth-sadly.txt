 Believe it or not, there are times when you can't believe everything you read on the internets. We know, we're shocked too. One of the latest rumors catching wildfire is that Sirius' new portable radio, the Stiletto 100, will come with Bluetooth. We've done some digging and have found out that it appears that it won't -- or at least Sirius hasn't told anyone that it will. The unconfirmed reporting originated from a piece by Wired News reporter Eliot Van Buskirk, who just told us that his news organization would be soon running a correction. That drops the Stiletto's sex appeal by about a half a notch, no?[Via Orbitcast]
