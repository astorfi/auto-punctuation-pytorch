The trigger of the attachment locks in with the analog "T" trigger button of the slotted-in Move controller for some sweet, shoot-tastic shooting, while the face buttons of the controller remain accessible thanks to a window cutout up top. But while we're sure it works great and all that silly nonsense, we're just totally enamored with the looks: it's like a 1950's ray gun, and with a light-up ball on the end and the future of motion gaming at your fingertips, perhaps that's not so far from the truth. The ray gun part. The 50's were actually a pretty bad year for motion controlled console gaming.
