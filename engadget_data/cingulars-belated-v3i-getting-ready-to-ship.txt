 Who woulda thought Cingular would have so much trouble getting Moto's little ol' (emphasis on ol') V3i out the door? Well, they have; rumored release date after rumored release date has gone by without so much as a peep from corporate on the matter. We're at the point now where far more exciting things lie on the radar in Cingular's pipeline, but for folks just looking to to replace a RAZR with another RAZR -- and we know you're out there -- the V3i still holds a lot of promise. So where is it? Amazon seems to think they know, claiming they'll have 'em ready to ship in 1 to 2 weeks. Rumor has it these things may be bundled with a 512MB microSD card, but with the infamous track limit in place, we might recommend something other than iTunes content to fill it up.[Thanks, John]
