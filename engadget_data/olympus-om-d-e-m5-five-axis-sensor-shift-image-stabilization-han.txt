  Olympus's inaugural OM-D mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, the E-M5, boasts the world's fastest autofocus and a pretty fantastic design, but it's also the first camera to implement a new five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization technology, that allows the lens to compensate for camera shake. The company was on hand at CP+ 2012 to demo the new sensor, which really does shift every which way to keep your photos and video still. We'll of course need to spend some time shooting photos and video with the E-M5 before labeling the five-axis sensor a success, but from the demo we saw today, it looks pretty darn promising. Jump past the break for a video hands-on, and scroll through the photos below for an up-close view of Olympus's latest Micro Four Thirds masterpiece.
