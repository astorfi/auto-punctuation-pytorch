 Clearly, a lot of us wanted LG to reveal the design of the 5.5-inch Optimus G Pro as quickly as possible: just a day after a teaser, we're looking at the complete picture. And it's quite a looker, by all counts. While it has the familiar digital cube pattern on the back, it's also using curved glass in black or white, which LG says produces a "2.5D" effect. Those other details that LG is willing to divulge are largely what we expected based on the Japanese edition, including a full HD (1080p) display and a quad-core processor that's likely the Snapdragon S4 Pro. LG expects the larger G Pro to launch in late February, although it didn't say whether or not this is limited to South Korea; based on the timing, though, we might get a peek at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
