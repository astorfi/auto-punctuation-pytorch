 
Sure, that Xperia X8 in the picture may look demure, but the FCC doesn't mess around -- mere seconds after we found this shot of the 3-inch, Android 1.6 handset, we stumbled across a PDF showing the phone in -- ahem -- various states of dress. Now, we try to run a clean site here, so you'll have to hit our source link to find those salacious pics (and manual) yourself, but if you want some nice, tasteful shots of the device's exterior and ports you'll find them immediately below. No new specs here, by the way -- it's the same quad-band GSM HSPA handset with WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0, A-GPS and FM radio we've seen before.
