NikeFuel is a universal standard that converts your exertions into a normalized score -- great for when you want to want to compare your exertions against friends with different hobbies. It's also heralding a revamped Nike Plus website where we hope it'll integrate with the recently announced Xbox edition. The Anthracite Blue Glow (or "Black and Blue") edition lacks a Nike+ shoe sensor so costs €150 ($190), while the other three colors will, pushing the price up to €170 ($215).
