Starting at the bottom, the S5230 tops out at EDGE speeds but features a commendable 3-inch WQVGA display, 3 megapixel cam, microSD expansion, FM radio, and naturally, TouchWiz -- and it's all shoved into a mere 11.9mm. The real high-speed action starts up in the S5600 that we heard a bit about after MWC, where we pick up 7.2Mbps HSDPA on the 900 and 2100MHz bands -- only problem is, you've got to step down to a 2.8-inch QVGA display to get it. It'll slide into retail come May, while the S5320 gets a little bit of a jump start, hitting shelves in April.
