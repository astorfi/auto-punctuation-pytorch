Hyperkin's FC Mobile II tickles our every retro-gaming fantasy, combining portable cartridge-based NES action on a 2.5-inch screen, complete with TV-out, two "standard" wireless controllers, and a wireless gun just to top off the majestic collection. Even better, the whole kit is going for around $60 on eBay, so we can spend the rest of our suspicious money horde on Joystick Test Cartridges and tasteless cufflinks.[Via OhGizmo!]
