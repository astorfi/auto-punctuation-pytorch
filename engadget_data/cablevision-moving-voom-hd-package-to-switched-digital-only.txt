 Cablevision is making the move to switched digital video, with its 15 Voom HD channels going SDV-only in April and May. Of course this means that CableCARD users won't be able to get them any more. There were around 14,000 such devices on Cablevision as of last December, most notably Tivos, so the company is offering a free HD set-top for a year. While not the most elegant of solutions, it should at least tide people over until the tuning resolver that fixes this gets sorted out. Of course, maybe the Voom HD channels aren't important to every viewer, but others will inevitably follow and the offer is set to expire June 30. Such is life on the way to 500 HD channels, we suppose.
