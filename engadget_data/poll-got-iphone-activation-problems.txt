Of course, evidenced by the flood of users continuing to tip us, we'd say a great deal of you are still experiencing activation problems. We've flipped the switch on a half dozen or so iPhones, and had no problems whatsoever. So to all you new iPhone owners out there, are you (still) having issues?
