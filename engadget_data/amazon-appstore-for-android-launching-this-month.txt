That word comes from the seemingly in-the-know ad network Millennial Media, which tweeted earlier today that the Amazon Appstore for Android is "launching this month," and linked to a blog post that details what's in store for developers. Unfortunately, that post doesn't actually contain a ton of specific details, but the ad network apparently sees the store as a "great opportunity," particularly when it comes to the additional exposure apps would get through Amazon.com. In case you weren't aware, Amazon's also been maintaining an official developer blog for the Appstore (yeah, it's all one word), which does provide quite a few technical details for those interested -- check it out at the link below.
