Sony has announced that its new Z3 lineup will exclusively get PS4 Remote Play, a service that has so far only worked with the Vita. The console will detect your Z3 device over WiFi and unlock it, letting you play with a DualShock4 wireless controller using the new GCM10 Game Control Mount (see the image below). On top of playing games, you'll also be able to use a Z3 device as a second screen to view livestreams (of games, of course) or chat over the PlayStation Network. Sony kept using the word "exclusive" with Remote Play, so if you're using a non-Z3 handset, it seems you'll be out of luck. The mount and service will likely arrive when the Z3s do, along with the pricing.
