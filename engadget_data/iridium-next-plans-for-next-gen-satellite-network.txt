 Although nothing is set in stone, everyone's favorite why-aren't-they-dead-yet satellite communications firm, Iridium, is starting to sketch out its next gen satellite network, titled, obviously enough. Iridium Next. Looking to go far beyond mere satphone calling and the like, Next might well include environmental monitoring, sat-photography, GPS, and a 10Mbps "broadband" mesh network. It'll cost Iridium about $2b when they light it up on or before 2016, but don't worry, you're sure to continue paying a buck or two a minute for taking advantage of that network, too.
