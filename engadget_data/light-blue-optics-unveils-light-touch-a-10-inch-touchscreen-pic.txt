As the name implies, LBO's product is a laser projector that turns any flat surface into an auto-focused and image-adjusted 10-inch touchscreen with WVGA resolution thanks to its laser- (not LED) based pico projection engine dubbed HLP (holographic laser projection) and infrared touch-sensing system. Light Touch runs Adobe Flash Lite 3.1 and includes WiFi and Bluetooth radios, 2GB of on-board storage (with microSD slot for up to 32GB more), and a battery capable of about 2-hours worth of runtime. We'll be getting up close and personal with the mini projector here at CES so until then, feast your eyes on the simulated demo and usage scenarios after the break.
