Maybe you do, but it's always good to pepper some good old fashioned rumors atop well established facts for that extra bit of spice. Neowin cites insider sources in reporting that Microsoft intends to use its Windows Phone 7 launch as a platform for revealing its plans for the tablet realm as well. Specifically, Steve Ballmer and crew are expected to "announce Slate devices which will be available for the crucial holiday season." We can't think of anything that would make the Redmond CEO happier, but let's not go building our hopes up too high. Just one revolution from Microsoft will be enough for us.
