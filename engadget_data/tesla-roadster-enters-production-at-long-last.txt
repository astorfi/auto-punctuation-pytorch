Since then we've seen delays, setbacks and untimely retirements, but Tesla Motors claims it finally has the car under production, and is naturally taking orders for the 2009 run -- 900 cars have been reserved so far. Despite the concrete language in this press release, we'll believe it when these silent beasts start hitting the road. And run our cycling-asses down.
