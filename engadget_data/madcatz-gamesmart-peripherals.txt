Hardware carrying the GameSmart moniker uses Bluetooth Smart tech to pair with devices ranging from smartphones to tablets -- and presumably other Bluetooth-equipped hardware. The firm says it'll include an app to add functionality to peripherals and it expects the tech will help game developers bridge differences between platforms by offering standardized controllers. Though MadCatz is waiting for CES to pull the curtains back on a raft of GameSmart gamepads, keyboards, mice and headsets, it says the hardware will launch shortly after it's unveiled.

  GameSmart Enables Core Game Controller Functionality on Mobile Devices
  SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. ("Mad Catz") (NYSE MKT: MCZ) announced today GameSmart, a technology initiative that moves smart devices one step closer to delivering a core gaming experience similar to a gaming console or gaming computer. GameSmart control products will function through the BluetoothÂ® Smart stack, will be game and hardware independent, and will have a smart device app to provide additional functionality. By utilizing Bluetooth Smart, GameSmart devices will feature simplified setup, longer battery life and universal compatibility. In addition, GameSmart offers game developers and game publishers standardization, ease of implementation and scalability when enabling controller and console-like accessory functionality in mobile games.
  "Smart devices have made considerable inroads in delivering all forms of entertainment including games, music, movies, books, and social media. Mobile gaming is a vibrant and exciting space and we don't see controller-based games replacing touch screen games, we expect them to enhance and enlarge the smart device gaming experience to include the living room experience. There are a number of point-to-point solutions in the market today that provide proof of concept, but the industry needs an agnostic operating system solution to provide standardization, ease of implementation and scalability," said Darren Richardson, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. "With our long history in the gaming industry, Mad Catz has the technical capability, product breadth, global distribution, and developer and publisher relationships that uniquely position our company to make this ambitious initiative a success. We believe the GameSmart initiative fits perfectly with our long-term strategy of designing innovative products for passionate gamers."
  Mad Catz intends to launch a full range of GameSmart products, including game controllers, gaming mice, gaming keyboards, headsets, and other specialty controllers. The GameSmart products will also be app-enabled to provide additional functionality. The first wave of GameSmart products will be announced at CES 2013 and are expected to launch shortly thereafter.
