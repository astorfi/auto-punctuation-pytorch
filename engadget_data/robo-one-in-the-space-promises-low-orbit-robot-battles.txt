  Besides the promised army of nanobots that will fulfill our every want and need, there hasn't been too much about the "future" to get really jazzed up about -- until, that is, we found out about a little event happening on October 10, 2010 called "ROBO-ONE in the Space" (actual title, not a machine translation). From the same enthusiastic folks who bring us the fascinating terrestrial robot battles and posedowns in Tokyo every year, ROBO-ONE in the Space is an ambitious project that was announced at this year's competition, in which the organizers plan to launch a 125,000-cubic centimeter "piggyback satellite" into polar orbit in conjunction with a larger payload-- all for the purpose of robot grudge matches in zero gravity. Although the 10/10/10 date of the premier competition is purely tentative (pending certain non-trivial steps as international approval for the launch and use of certain radio frequencies), the rules already seem to be set in stone: to simulate the sumo-style ring (or sphere, as it were) of play, the four bots sent up as cargo will each be attached to 5-meter long tethers, which will signal that the competitor has been tossed when they become fully taut .Since our brief write-up can in no way do this topic justice, you should definitely check out this animated "artist's conception" of what the battles will look like; we don't use the phrase lightly, but it really is the greatest thing ever.[Via Pink Tentacle]
