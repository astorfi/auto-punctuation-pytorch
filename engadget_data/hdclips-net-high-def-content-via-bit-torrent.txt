 Even though there is a good amount of HDTV stations available now, we still need more content. We stumbled across HDClips.net via their high-def trailer site of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. The site has some forums and general news but the true gem is their torrent listings of HD clips. Currently there isn't that much on the site as they seem kind of new but we would totally recommend downloading some of the HD Demo Loops that they have. These are the loops that you will find in retail stores that make the HDTVs look so good. Our favorite one so far as been the Seven Seasons Sony loop - astounding.
