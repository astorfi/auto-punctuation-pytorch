The dilligent scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory are working to perfect hybrid solar lighting, which they
hope could be the cure for the worlds biggest electricity drain, indoor bulbs (odd, this whole time we thought it was
SETI@home). Basically the system collects light from the roof and pipes it indoors via fiber opticsâ€”of course, the
technology wouldn't do much good in places like Glasgow, so it comes equipped with external optical sensors which will
adjust the indoor lighting for the most efficient balance between bulbs and fiber optics (hence "hybrid"). Too bad,
guys, but they did this years ago in Japan, and we wouldn't be surprised if it's long been a built-in feature of new
domiciles there.
