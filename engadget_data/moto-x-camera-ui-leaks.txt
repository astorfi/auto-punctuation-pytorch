We learned a few things about the Moto X's camera interface in that leaked Rogers promo video, but we didn't learn everything. Android Police is more than willing to fill in those blanks by posting screen captures that reportedly show Motorola's new camera software in action. The images suggest a stripped-down, swipe-driven UI reminiscent of a Google Play Edition phone, but with an extra bit of polish. In addition to the flick-based launching and tap-to-hold burst shooting that we've seen, the Moto X depends heavily on a hidden settings carousel with a few features above and beyond stock Android, such a slow motion mode. While the screenshots say little about the cameras themselves, it's reasonable to suspect that we'll learn more about those within a few days.
