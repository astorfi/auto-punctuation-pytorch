On a promo website for the firm's 120Hz Auto Motion Plus technology, it nonchalantly explains that said innovation enables the display to "keep it fast and real," but closes things out with a word typically reserved for less public settings. We're hoping someone cleans this up real quick like, but we've screen-capped the offending image above for the sake of comedy.Update: It's been fixed -- fun's over, kids.[Thanks, Wendell]
