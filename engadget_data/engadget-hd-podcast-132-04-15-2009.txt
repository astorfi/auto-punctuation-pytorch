  A little bit of a slow news week didn't keep us from finding plenty to talk about in this week's show. There were plenty of comments, both of the written and voicemail variety to cover, so we spend a good portion of the podcast covering what's in the listeners' hearts and minds; hopefully Time Warner cable will do the same and rethink its capping plans. We both got some good gear in for review this week, so we spend some time talking about our impressions of the Cisco SDV tuning adapter and the Moxi (cable-only) DVR. Media is moving online, and nobody knows this better than Netflix, which is looking to hire some talent for gaming platform development. As much as we stress Blu-ray quality, that doesn't mean DVD doesn't still have a place -- take Apple's computers, for example. We wrap things up with a not-so-surprising "Chicken Little" reaction from the CEA on California's proposed TV energy standards.
