 
Cheeky folk that they are, the engineers at iRobot have chosen Halloween to take the wraps off their latest super-secret project, codenamed "Sentinel" -- it won't clean your floors, but should it fall into the wrong hands, could make crumbs the least of your worries. Funded by the U.S. Army's  Small Business Innovation and Research program, the project allows for multiple semi-autonomous robots to be controlled from a single touch-screen computer. While the intended uses for the project are mostly non-hostile at the moment -- like conducting surveillance and mapping in hostile environments -- it seems only a matter of time before the bots get outfitted with some pint-sized weaponry. Lets just hope they're restricted to fighting each other.
