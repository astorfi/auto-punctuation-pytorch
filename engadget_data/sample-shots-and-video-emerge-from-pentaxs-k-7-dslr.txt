Early stills are rather impressive, with images being sharp, crisp and generally delightful to stare at. As for video, it's tough to judge the real quality based on a YouTube rendition, but feel free to glean what you can just after the break. So, if you weren't sold already, are you now?Read - Pentax ForumsRead - DPReview
