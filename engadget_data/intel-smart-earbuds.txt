We're here at the opening CES keynoted by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, and the parade of wearables has just begun. The firm's head honcho has just unveiled a pair of smart earbuds that can track your heart rate (and display it on a companion app), keep tabs on your running and get their power from your device's headphone jack. There's no word on price, but it's set to arrive sometime this year.
