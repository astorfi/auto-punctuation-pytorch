It's only been hours since the little black box maker introduced Roku-loaded TVs and now we're getting our first look at a few sample sets from Hisense and TCL. The sets we saw were of the 48 to 55-inch variety and were all accompanied by standard Roku remotes. The company's representative pointed out that we can expect the standard 20-button remote, with different manufacturers controlling the overall design. The 48-inch TCL set that we saw has a 1080p, 60Hz display and contained a Sigma UXL processor. Roku has yet to release pricing details, but said we will be seeing that closer to launch.
