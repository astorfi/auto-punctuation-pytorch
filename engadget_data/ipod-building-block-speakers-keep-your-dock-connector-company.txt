Take heart, young buck, as the iPod building block speakers can keep that kid in you alive for a good bit longer -- though we aren't sure the audiophile in you will be too pleased. These non-powered "drivers" get amped after being plugged into an iPod's dock connector (sorry, iPhone users), but curiously enough, they only arrive in a single 2.5- x 1- x .75-inch form, which doesn't exactly fit flush against the last-gen nano. Nevertheless, those giddy about the notion of claiming a few as their own can pick 'em up in yellow, white, red, black, blue and green for $24.99 apiece.[Via BoingBoing]
