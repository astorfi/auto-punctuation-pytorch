But what about someone ready to get a jump on things, and set up their home theater for the full Captain EO experience right now? That's Joel's question, we'll let him take it from here:  "I just moved into a new house with a room I'm specifically planning for my home theater setup and need something that will beat all the equipment my friends have. The way I figure, a 3D setup should keep me ahead of the curve for some time, but I can't decide who to go with. Dual projector, plasma, LCD? Samsung & Mitsubishi are two I know already offering 3D ready equipment, but is there anyone out there that's tried them out yet?  Well, there it is, instead of just keeping up with the Joneses some people want to get way ahead of them. So c'mon, if anyone's been brave enough to invest in the future, let us know where you found the proper equipment right now (and content) for a 3D experience worthy of an upcoming Avatar viewing party.Got a burning question that you'd love to toss out for Engadget HD (or its readers) to take a look at?
