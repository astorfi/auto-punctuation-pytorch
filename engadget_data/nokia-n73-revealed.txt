The N73 (on left in the picture)as it's currently called, is the the supposed successor to the N70(on right), and is expected to pump Symbian 9.1 and Series 60 3rd addition while featuring a 3.2 megapixel cam withwith autofocusing Carl Zeiss lens, Bluetooth 2.0, stereo speakers, memory card expansion and that good 3G (UMTS) lovin'for video calls on that large QVGA screen. So really, no additional details, just some fuzzy eye candy this time around.More pics after the break. [Via NewMobile, Thanks Oliver]
