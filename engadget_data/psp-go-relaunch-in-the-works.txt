 There's not much to go on here, but according to alleged sources of Gamervision, Sony's planning a relaunch of sorts for the PSP Go. The oft-maligned portable hasn't exactly taken the world by storm -- and with its lack of an UMD drive, despite the company's continued support of the format, that arguably wasn't the point of its existence, anyway. An apparent marketing blitz is in the cards (unsurprising), and additionally there's speculation that a price drop might be coming, too. That seems a bit early given it only launched back in October, but if the company's really wanting to get aggressive and pushing units of its admittedly pretty hardware, that's a pretty good way to do so. Then again, its hands might be full adding some vigor to its other gaming machine.
