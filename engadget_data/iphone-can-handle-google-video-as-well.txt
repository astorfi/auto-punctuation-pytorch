Well, now you've got another option for viewing pointless videos, since it turns out the iPhone can support the iPod/PSP video download option over at Google Video from right within Safari. Not all videos include a download option, and we tried a similar option over at Gametrailers.com to no avail, but who needs alternatives when you can watch sneezing panda eternally? Check out the QuickTime player after the break.  [Thanks, Canek]
