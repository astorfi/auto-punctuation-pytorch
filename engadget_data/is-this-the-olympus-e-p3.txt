That's exactly what we have here with the claimed leak of a new Olympus camera -- the E-P3, according to Photo Rumors -- in all its Micro Four Thirds glory. The camera appears to be a hybrid of both the E-P2 and E-PL2, including a P2-style button layout, but with a pop-up flash and sloping top plate reminiscent of the PL2. The new cam is also rumored to include a new 12 megapixel sensor, a max sensitivity of ISO 12,800, a high-res touchscreen, much-needed AF improvements, and an updated UI. Photo Rumors expects Olympus to announce the E-P3 on June 30th, along with an E-PL3 and E-PM1. That last model would be the first in the rumored Pen Mini series. We don't expect the E-PM1 to best the new Pentax Q's record-breaking small size, but with a significantly smaller sensor, the Q will be no match for any of Olympus's new Micro Four Thirds offerings.

Update: Andrea wrote in to tell us that Mirrorless Rumors now has a much clearer publicity shot. Isn't it lovely?
