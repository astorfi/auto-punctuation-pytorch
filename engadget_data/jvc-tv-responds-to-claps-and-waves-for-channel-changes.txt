Using a microphone and a video camera, the TV can pick up claps to change volume, and recognize a pointing finger to control elements on the screen (apparently you bend your finger to "click".) Frankly, the whole "having to lift your hand" element isn't the JVC TV's strongest suit: perhaps a better option would be to fit an accelerometer inside a standard remote. That way couch potatoes can sloppily jerk their arm to make changes. The lazier the better when it comes to TV.[Via The Boy Genius Report]
