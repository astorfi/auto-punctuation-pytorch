That about sums it up for this new "Rubik's Revolution," a supposed "sequel" to the original Rubik's Cube. The new cube keeps that 3 x 3 configuration and the iconic colored sides, but adds in electronic games including Light Speed, Rapid Recharge, Pattern Panic, Cube Catcher, Code Cracker and Multiplayer Madness. We're not quite sure what these do, but we're guessing most of them won't be solvable via the tried-and-true sticker swapping method. The games include light, sound and voice effects, with multiple unlockable levels and even multiplayer play. No telling if this will prove at all entertaining, or merely as frustrating as the original, but for $20 it won't be too expensive to find out when the Revolution debuts this summer.
