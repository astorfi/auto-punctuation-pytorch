Just last month, we heard that a 3G model of HP's TouchPad would be coming to AT&T this summer, and now we're being told that it'll actually be called the TouchPad 4G. 4G as in HSPA+. Not 4G as in LTE. Got that? Good. Aside from the basics -- 32GB of internal storage, integrated GPS and HSPA+ / WiFi radios -- a newfangled 1.5GHz processor (up from 1.2GHz) will make its debut, hopefully improving those performance issues we saw during our review. Sadly, no one's spilling details on pricing or release, with the carrier simply affirming that it'll be on sale prior to the "back to school" season. We're guessing the Summer of 2011 is going to be quite the confusing time to be an in-store AT&T employee -- how exactly do you sell an actual 4G hotspot when you've got HSPA+ devices calling themselves the same? Oh, nomenclature.
