Slated to debut at InfoComm 2008 in Las Vegas, the unit marks the company's first active 3D stereoscopic projector. Notably, this isn't the firm's first foray into the third-dimension, as eight of its F20 sx+ PJs are currently being used in a 3D visualization system at Munich University. Moving on, we'll also find its brand new three-chip DLP F80, which features a WUXGA (1,920 x 1,200) resolution, ACOP (Advanced Color Optical Processing) technology and a stratospheric price tag (we're guessing on that last one). We'll be holding out for pricing / release information, but we don't suspect it'll be too long before those critical points get divulged.
