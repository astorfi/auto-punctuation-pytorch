  
Right on schedule, Philips has unveiled its new wave of Ambilight-powered television: Aurea. Sure, it's not as sexy when you call it by its 42PFL9900D model number, but the 42-inch 1080p LCD is sure to turn heads either way. Under the hood Philips has 100Hz refresh, "invisible speakers" and even a trio of HDMI inputs. The new Ambilight Spectra tech uses 126 LEDs and shoots light through the "Active Frame" for a more extensive Ambilight experience. The displays will be available next month, but there's still no word on price. Peep the gallery below for some stylized shots of the display by fashion photog Vincent Peters.
