  Windows 8's impending metro/desktop split means some programs may be pulling double duty in your task manager -- one for its classic environment, and one for its fancy facade. Google, not to be outdone by Mozilla, recently told Mashable that it's building a version of Chrome optimized for Windows 8's more stylized setting. "Our goal is to be able to offer our users a speedy, simple, secure Chrome experience across all platforms, which includes both the desktop and Metro versions of Windows 8." a Google spokesperson said, "To that end we're in the process of building a Metro version of Chrome along with improving desktop Chrome in Windows 8 such as adding enhanced touch support." The representative didn't say when the Metro version of the app would be ready, but hopefully it won't too far from Windows 8's own launch day.
