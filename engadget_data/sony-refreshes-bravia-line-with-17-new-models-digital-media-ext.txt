Falling into six different model lines (three pictured here), Sony has sprinkled its Digital Media Extender tech liberally throughout the releases, future technology and Bravia Link is an option down the road for all. The top end models consist of the KDL-40Z4100 and KDL-46Z4100, with new Bravia Engine 2, 120Hz image processing, x.v. Color, WCG-CCFL and 10-bit panels. The Z-series also throws in USB ports, DLNA connectivity and Bravia Sync HDMI control. Sony's got more HDTVs and we've got more specs (no prices, sorry!) so check after the break.

 

Sony's W- Series Bravia's bring the 120Hz Motionflow goods, Bravia Sync control, and USB media player connections to 52-, 46- and 40-inch models. Next up is the V series, available in the same sizes as the W, but without 120Hz and USB features. The XBR6 line of Bravia's brings 1080p to the little guy in 37- and 32-inch models with the same 3D interface as the W- and V-, bu no USB connection. The N- and M- series LCDs are only packing 720p res in their 37-, 32-, and 26-inch models, but the N adds integrated 5.1 (37- and 32-inch) or 3.1 speakers (26-inch.)
