Takara Tomy's previously announced AeroSpider RC car, which mystically scales walls and cruises upside-down, is finally shipping this month in Japan. Cool though that may be, the real news here is the overgrown 4-year old used to show off just how amazing this minuscule vehicle truly is. Head on past the break to see what we mean -- trust us, we wouldn't lead you on like this for nothing.[Thanks, Clyde]
