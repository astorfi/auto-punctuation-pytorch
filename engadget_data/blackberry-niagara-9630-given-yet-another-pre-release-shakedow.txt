CrackBerry has somehow managed to secure yet another pre-release device, and this time it's none other than the CDMA Bold / Curve 8900 / Storm hybrid. Like we saw with the latest Mr. Blurrycam video review (and all those other leaked pics) the keyboard sure looks to be a real winner and to quote CB, it's "the optimal solution." The form factor is also described as "awesome" and its narrower size made it even nicer to hold than the Bold. Unfortunately, this particular device was running -- or trying to run -- OS 4.7.1.10, which is basically a dummy phone equivalent at this point, while .17 is purportedly available somewhere in the Great White North. We've heard that the hardware has indeed been finalized, and that RIM is mass producing these like crazy -- and if they can get the software to match what we've seen of the hardware, it looks like they're going to have another winner on their hands.
