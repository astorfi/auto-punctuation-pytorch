Then we'll transfer some songs and images, expire our three plays (before those three days run up, of course), and watch some clips. If you want to know what it's like to sit down and play with the anti-iPod, we're ready for ya.P.S. -Our flash video isn't the highest quality / res. If you want the best looking video, check out the VGA h.264 file below.Download videoMOV (h.264) - VGA, QVGAAVI (DivX) - VGA, QVGAMusic: Christopher Willits - Orange Lit Space (Ghostly International)
