Now, according to some very believable Vodafone snippets, we're being told that this here handset will launch exclusively on the aforesaid carrier as the Magic, bringing with it a 3.2 megapixel camera, HSPA, WiFi and GPS. Also of note, Cupcake will be loaded on from day one, though there's no word on pricing and availability just yet.
