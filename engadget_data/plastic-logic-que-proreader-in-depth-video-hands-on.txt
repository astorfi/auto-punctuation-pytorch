We have to say, the more we play with it, the more we like it. The interface is very well thought out, the touchscreen keyboard is very responsive (though a little awkward to type on in landscape mode) and the general functionality is just about perfect for this sort of device. It's not going to change the world, and the price means it'll be only for a very select sort of user, but we have a sneaky feeling that those users are going to be pretty smug folks once this thing starts shipping. Check out the video after the break.
