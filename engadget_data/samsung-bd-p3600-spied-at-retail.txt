That $399 price is enough to pick up the BD-Live storage, 7.1 analog outs and 802.11b/g/n WiFi dongle missing from the BD-P1600, while super slim wall mounting bliss remains the exclusive domain of the BD-P4600. Deciding between this and the DMP-BD80 without some real hands on time may be tough, but at least until Amazon has some HD on top of their VOD, Netflix streaming is probably enough to sway our decision.[Thanks, Eric]
