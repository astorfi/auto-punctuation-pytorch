 
Certainly no secret up until now, the VX9900 (aka the enV), successor to the VX9800 (aka the V), predecessor to what will surely be dubbed the VX10K (aka the Flying V), is now officially out -- November 27th, as stated. It can be had for as little as $150 with two year agreement and rebate, and features that fat QWERTY keybord, tiny ass bezel-tastic display, EVDO, 2 megapixel camera, Bluetooth 1.2 with A2DP, OBEX, AVRC, microSD slot, WMA support, and all the V CAST support you'd ever want. Online now (big surprise), ready for ordering.[Thanks, Tyler and Michael]
