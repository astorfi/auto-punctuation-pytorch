Music, 1080p movies (MPEG-2, h.264 & WMV9) or pics from a USB drive? The whole line has that with Vizio's Multi-media hookup, while LED backlighting, 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio and 5 HDMI ports are kept exclusive to the $1,999 55-inch VF551XVT1A. 42- and 47-inch models share the 240Hz motion technology that's become so popular with their larger relative, but only rock 50,000:1 contrast and 4 HDMI jacks for $1,099 and $1,399 respectively. 32- and 37-inch aficionados can expect 120Hz refresh rates for $749 and $999 respectively when they ship in the fall, while the rest of the pack are summer babies. Of course, by then you'd probably want to wait for a Connected HDTV....we love this time of year.
