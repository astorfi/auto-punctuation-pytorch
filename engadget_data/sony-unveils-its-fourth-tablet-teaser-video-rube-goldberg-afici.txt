What we do know is that we love the films' cheery soundtracks and the wondrous contraptions they showcase. This fourth spot has the now-familiar pale figurines wandering though a mechanical wonderland, with marbles whizzing overhead and bubbles floating about. Alas, like those that precede it, the latest video provides no new info on the slates Sony's shilling, but feel free to enjoy the visuals in the bit of esoteric advertising after the break.
