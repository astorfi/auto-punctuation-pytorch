Speaking to The Seattle Times, Microsoft VP Mike Delman said that "Live has been successful on the Windows Phone," and that "Live will be built into the PC. It will be the service where you get your entertainment." Delman went on to add that "Xbox Live will the pervasive media service across devices," and that "whether it's us or Apple or anybody else, people want to be able to navigate through multiple devices in a certain ecosystem very seamlessly so we're committed to that." As you might expect, however, he was still fairly light on any further specifics, but he did say that assets like Live and SkyDrive will be unified, and he promised that Microsoft will have plenty more to show at next year's E3 -- according to Delman, "you will not just see consoles and handhelds at this show next year, this show's going to morph into other devices."
