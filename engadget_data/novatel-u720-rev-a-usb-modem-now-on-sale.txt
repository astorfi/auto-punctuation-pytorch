Well Ross, an eagle-eyed reader, pointed out that the U720 is now in stock for $50 after the usual assortment of instant savings and rebates and what not. Still, as sexy as this is for the Windows folks, where's the love for the Mac users among us? Sprint, we fully expect to see some drivers comin' down the pike, hopefully sooner rather than later.
