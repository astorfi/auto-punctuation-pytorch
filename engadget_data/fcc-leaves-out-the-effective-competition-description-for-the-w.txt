Namely, it failed to describe the industry as having "effective competition" for the first time since 2002. The report -- which covers the period of 2008 and part of 2009 -- could signal the government is getting ready to regulate and impost policies to encourage and increase competition in the wireless industry. AT&T's senior vice president of federal regulatory policy, Robert Quinn, said that the move toward more regulation is "unwarranted," while Verizon's Kathleen Grillo said that the "facts" have already shown that there is, in fact, enough competition in the industry. Regardless, the report actually fails to come to a conclusion on the whole matter, leaving the FCC's options pretty open at this point, so we're going to have to keep an eye on the boys.
