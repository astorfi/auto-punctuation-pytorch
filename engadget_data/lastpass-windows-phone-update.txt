 
 LastPass, the password-managing service, announced that it's added many features in a new version released today for its Windows Phone application. Most notably, LastPass now offers support for Windows Phone 8, while those running an older variant of Microsoft's mobile OS can keep using the app as they have been since its early days on the platform. Other improvements and enhancements include a completely overhauled user interface, which should make it easier for users to navigate within the application, as well as easily find their most preferred sites by sorting alphabetically or adding them to the "Favorites" panel. The new version of LastPass is up for download now, so go and tap that source link if you're looking to keep those (many) passwords of yours all tidied up in one place.
