       So we heard that Sharp would be bringing a few Blu-ray-infused HDTVs to CES, but it's JVC breaking one out first. Here in Vegas, the company has introduced the 42-inch LT-42B300, which packs a 1080p panel, integrated ATSC-QAM tuner, a 5-band equalizer, dual 10-watt speakers, three HDMI inputs (with CEC) and an inbuilt Blu-ray player to boot. It'll be ready for consumption this June at an undisclosed price.
