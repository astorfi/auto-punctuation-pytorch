To whet our appetites, it's released a 21-second teaser featuring a helmet-free cyclist smiling at the camera and not spending enough time watching where she's going. We can't find any clues in the footage (after the break), except that it's using the same font that we saw in the run up to the Pureview launch. Who knows, maybe we can get our hopes up for a Lumia device rocking that 41-megapixel sensor.
