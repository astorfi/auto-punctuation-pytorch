Quite frankly, Huawei's 6.18mm-thick P6-U06 is quickly becoming the company's worst leak in this half of 2013. Following yesterday's spy shots of said phone in black, today we received three new ones courtesy of an anonymous tipster, and this time we have a close-up of the brushed metallic back of the phone. Interestingly, the camera looks different than the one -- what appears to be a dual-SIM model -- in the TENAA filing, and we also noticed that the volume rocker is on the left side of the phone this time, while the headphone jack is now located at the top left side instead of at the bottom left. The overall shape of the device matches what we've seen before, though.


On a related note, we've also been notified of an upcoming Huawei launch event in London on June 18th (Huawei Device chairman Richard Yu told us he's attending), and we wouldn't be surprised to see this slim phone popping up there -- hopefully alongside the mysterious Edge that was leaked in March. Two more shots of the P6-U06 after the break.


Update: Meixcan blog Circular got hold of a couple of photos -- embedded after the break -- of the P6-U06 lit up. One of the shots reveal that the phone features a 1.5GHz quad-core chip, 2GB RAM and 8GB of storage space, along with Emotion UI 1.6 running on top of Android. We're not sure if the "No SD card found" message is an indication of microSD expansion, though.
