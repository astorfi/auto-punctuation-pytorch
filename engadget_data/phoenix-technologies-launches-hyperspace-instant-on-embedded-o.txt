A company called Phoenix Technologies is introducing a new mini-OS called HyperSpace (what's with all these compound names?) that features a four second boot time. Using a form of virtualization which sets aside memory and disk space for the small boot, the ROM-based environment lets you access Firefox, launch a DVD movie, or fire up other apps while your system loads Vista or XP in the background. Apparently, the BIOS-embedded platform will also allow manufacturers and developers to embed their own, customized applications, thus extending the range of uses for the system. Soon, you won't have to wait even a tenth of a minute to check your Facebook inbox.[Via Good Morning Silicon Valley]
