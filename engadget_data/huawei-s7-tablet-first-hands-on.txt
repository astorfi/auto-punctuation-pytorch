Huawei was unable to provide us with any information beyond pricing, but here's what we've gathered. The 7-inch touchscreen is capacitive, unlike the model we played with before, and the tablet is running a slightly customized skin on top of Android 2.2. Build quality is solid and the device is satisfyingly thin and light. There are cameras front and back and a microSD card slot and a docking port on the bottom edge. We spied a SIM slot underneath the battery, so it's likely that the model we used features 3G. We hope to have more details for you soon -- in the meantime, feast your eyes on the gallery below.
