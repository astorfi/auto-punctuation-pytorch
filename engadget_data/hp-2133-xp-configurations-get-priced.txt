If the numbers are accurate, a base 1.2GHz rig with 1GB of RAM and a 120GB disk will run you $729, and bumping things up to 1.6GHz, 2GB of RAM and a 160GB disk will set you back $819. That's pretty steep -- but remember, early pricing info on the currently-available models was a tiny bit off, so these numbers could change when these hit sometime next week.
