 As weexpected, the GooLink WiFipartnership between Google and Earthlink was judged by a San Francisco city panel as the best candidate to blanketSF in a free-ish, citywide WiFi service. The service, which is expected to cost at least $15-mil to build, will consistof an ad-subsidized 300kbps free service or a $20/mth ad-free 1Mbps service. Of course, the two must now enter contractnegotiations with the City which Earthlink is taking the lead on before any, er, wiring can begin. MetroFi came in asfirst runner-up meaning they'll take the crown should any lewd photos from Larry and Sergei's Stanford days bedrudged-up.
