You might remember Erick from his appearance on The Engadget Show and a brief video we did with him at CES -- he was an instrumental part of the Android team, and a pretty great interview to boot. We'll see how Google decides to fill his shoes, but for now let's wish Erick luck with the new gig -- we're sure he's got a million new friend requests coming his way.
