The description for this eBay auction reads "everybody needs one of these" — indeed. If only we hadn't just plunked
down all our cash for that solid-fuel booster propelled BMX bike, we'd be all over this Toyota MR2 powered by twin GE
t-58 turbines. We'll have to settle for setting up an all-out deathmatch between this thing and the
jet-powered supermarket cart — we'll post up the deets
for the betting pool over the weekend.


[Thanks, John]
