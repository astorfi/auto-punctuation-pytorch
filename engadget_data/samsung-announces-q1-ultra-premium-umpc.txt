Inside there's a 1.33GHz ULV Intel Core Solo U1500 processor and 1GB of DDR2 RAM. The 57.7 watt hour 6-cell battery has a purported 7.5 hours of battery life, and the whole unit comes in under two pounds. The main exterior addition is the split-QWERTY keypad 1.5, which improves upon the last model with larger keys for easier text entry. There's also a docking station and external keyboard packaged with the Premium. Otherwise the device matches up with the Q1 Ultra, with a 80GB 1.8-inch HDD, Bluetooth 2.0, SD card slot and 1.3 megapixel webcam. The Premium should be available now, and Samsung says it'll be dropping prices on its existing UMPCs to make room for the new model.[Via jkkmobile]
