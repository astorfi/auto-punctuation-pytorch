Senators John Kerry (D - MA) and Olympia Snowe (R - Maine) have written a letter to FCC chairman Julius Genachowski asking them to prioritize actions on broadband white space while adhering to the scheduled Broadband Action Agenda, finishing it up by the third quarter of 2010. The national broadband plan includes 360 recommendations, with the white space action being just one of them. The letter reminded the commission that it's been about two years since it first authorized the use of white space, which would allow the use of unused television channels for wireless broadband.
