Armed with a $1,500 budget, he walks out of Fry's with an HP HDX 16 that features a 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo, NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT graphics, 4GB of RAM, and a 500GB drive -- raw numbers that would cost you $2,499 from Apple, although you'd be getting a vastly better display.

We leave that up to you -- video after the break.P.S.- That's the two commercials and two HP machines purchased, anyone sensing a trend?[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]Read - CNETRead - The Fry's listing for the $1,099 HP HDX 16
