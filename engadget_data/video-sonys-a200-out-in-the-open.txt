 A simple announcement not good enough for you? No worries -- Mahalo Daily's Veronica Belmont gets up close and personal with the all new DSLR and even takes a peek at the menu system 'round back. Granted, it doesn't look a whole lot different than its predecessor, but if stills just don't get your juices goin' quite like live video, hop on through the break and take a look.
