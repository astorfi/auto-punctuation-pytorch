According to Pocketnow, this is a press shot of the HTC EVO One, supposedly packing a 4.7-inch 720p display, a dual-core Snapdragon processor and LTE capabilities. We have our reservations on that name (EVO HD?) and those slightly dated style lines, but know that the Now Network and HTC are primed to show off something tomorrow. Rumors add that a 2650mAh battery and (hopefully intelligently placed) kickstand could also be part of the offering. Expect to hear some definitive answers at Sprint's big reveal -- we'll be there.
