If the images are to be believed, the SPH-L300 draws design cues from the chinny HTC Legend and packs NFC. According to BriefMobile's sources, there's a 800 x 480 display in the front, a Snapdragon S4 MSM 8960 in the middle and a 5-megapixel snapper 'round back. It'll also come with 4GB onboard storage, LTE and Ice Cream Sandwich from the get-go, oh, and it'll do a flawless impersonation of Bruce Campbell when things get slow at parties.
