If you've liked deals and retailer pages on Facebook, the social network's upcoming feature for mobile could be a dream come true. Apparently, the company's working on credit card and shipping info autofill that makes it a breeze to buy merchandise right off the app. The feature's yet to launch, but a post on the Mobile DevCon New York 2013 page reveals that The Social Network is now looking for beta testers. Developers who help test the new feature will get free mobile advertising if they integrate it before December 7th. With Facebook mobile's 874 million users per month, you bet many devs will beat that deadline to be on your radar in time for holiday shopping. To see the feature (which could lead to a boom in buyer's remorse) in action, check out the video after the break.
