 SanDisk is all about adding those prefixes to solid state drives, and not quite a year after we were forced to learn what uSSD really meant, the same firm is now shoving pSSD into our dictionary. Launched at Computex, these new parallel ATA solid-state drives are designed for use in the booming low-cost laptop sector, and will be available in 4/8/16GB sizes. They'll also boast a streaming read speed of 39MB/sec and a streaming write performance of 17MB/sec. According to SanDisk, the modules will be built using the outfit's Multi-Level Cell (MLC) and Single-Level Cell (SLC) flash memory at fabrication plants in Yokkaichi, Japan, and while dollars and / or yen weren't talked about, you can get set to grab your own when they land in August.
