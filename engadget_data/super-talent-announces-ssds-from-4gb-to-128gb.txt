 The always confident in itself Super Talent has announced new batch of solid state SATA drives, coming in the usual 1.8-inch, 2.5-inch, and 3.5-inch form factors, and ranging in size from 4GB to 128GB. Broken down, the petite 1.8-inch drives will give you between 4GB and 32GB of storage, while going up to the 2.5-inch model will give you a bit of extra breathing room, ranging in size from 8GB to 64GB. The real expansiveness, however, comes when you step things up to the 3.5-inch drives, which start at 64GB and go all the way to 128GB, although that's slightly less impressive than A-DATA's SSD drives, which manage to cram those same 128 gigabytes into a 2.5-inch form factor. Unfortunately, there's no word on pricing just yet, but it looks like we should know soon enough, with the drives set to roll out sometime next month.[Via PC Launches]
