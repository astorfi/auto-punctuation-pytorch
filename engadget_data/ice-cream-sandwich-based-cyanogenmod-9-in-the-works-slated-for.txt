In a Twitter post published on Tuesday, the Mod squad confirmed that it has already begun working on CM9, though it won't be released for another two months. CM8, in case you were wondering, was likely pegged for Android 3.0, but with Google holding tight to its Honeycomb source code, CyanogenMod may just leapfrog it altogether and jump straight to Cloud Nine. We'll all know more, come January.
