Of course, everybody has a personal wishlist, but Zune marketing director Jason Reindorp is hinting at a welcome development on the subscription front: "The subscription service was a solid move on our part. We've seen 65% growth in our subscription base, although the number is still small. It could be better and it could become different -- we're looking at what other flavors of subscriptions there could be. We've been looking at the subscription model where you pay a certain amount and you essentially get the cell phone for free." That seems to imply a cheap-or-free Zune, most likely a less pricey flash player, like the ones Napster has been giving away for a while. It ain't no WiFi syncing, but it's a start.
