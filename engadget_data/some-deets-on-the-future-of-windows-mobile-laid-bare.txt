 Brighthand appears to haveunearthed a few details on what's up with Windows Mobile 5.0 and beyond, as laid out in a Microsoft "TechDays" presentation given in Switzerland (which we can only presume they didn't expect to make it into the wild --oh come now, sillies). There isn't much to work with here, but the document makes mention of "Crossbow," whatmight otherwise be remarked as WinMo AKU3. We know, we know, you probably still don't have AKU2 yet, but with Crossbow you might be able to look forwardto "Great mobile messaging," "Advanced Business and Enterprise propositions," a "Strengthenedphone experience," "Faster, easier application development and distribution," and a "Q1/Q2 '07Marketing Launch."Â  Yeah, that doesn't really tells loads. As for Photon: "New, FlexibleShell," "Modular Containers," "'Yamazaki' CE kernel," and "Q1/Q2 '08 MarketingLaunch," meaning it could be mid to late 2008 to see the true successor to WinMo 5.0. Dems the breaks, ladies andgents, we're just letting you know what we find.[Via MGN]Update: ReaderUni points out you can snag the PowerPointpresentation here.
