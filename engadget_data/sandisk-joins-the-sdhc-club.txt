 With Toshiba and Panasonic having already unveiled their respective 4GB SDHC cards, you didn't really think that industry powerhouse SanDisk would be too far behind, did you? For the uninitiated, SDHC (or SD 2.0, as it's also known) is a new FAT32-compliant format designed for capacities up to 32GB, with cards that look exactly like regular SD models, but that won't work in any but the newest of digital devices. SanDisk's offering -- available sometime before the end of the month -- is rated as a Class 2 card, meaning that it guarantees a minimum transfer rate of 2MB per second. The $200 pricetag also gets you a "free" MicroMate card reader, which is not only handy but vital to making the most out of your new card, as the SD readers you currently own won't have any idea what to do with this thing.
