  Can't get enough of the FCC approval gossip? For some reason, neither can we. In the middle of what seems like a flood of new devices trying to get prepped for their inevitable US debut, the HTC PJ53100 appears to stand out above many of the rest. Why? It's boasting LTE band 13, which is Verizon's piece of 700MHz real estate. And while it doesn't come right out and proudly proclaim exactly what it is, we're rather certain this is the HTC Droid Incredible HD -- also known as the Fireball. Any other details? Nothing worth writing home about, sadly, but we have a feeling we'll be seeing a lot more of this smartphone pretty darn soon.
