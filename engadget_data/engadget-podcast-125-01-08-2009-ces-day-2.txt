Josh, Paul, and Nilay (who finally got his grubby mitts on a microphone) gather 'round the campfire to ponder the intricacies of the last day before the show floor opens up and the first "really real" day of CES begins. (This was recorded last night before the Palm new-ness hit, we'll be recording impressions about that and should have them up tomorrow).

Hosts: Joshua Topolsky, Paul Miller, Nilay Patel
Producer: Trent Wolbe
Song: Beat It
