Promoting its wares on a 103-inch screen at The Cable Show, MGM continues to tout its 4,100 title-deep library of 1080i content. Multichannel News has more info its background, as an HD-only channel MGM HD charges a license fee to operators, causing it to reside on an HD tier with DirecTV and Dish Network. It's still unclear what it might cost to get the channel whenever it is eventually available on Time Warner, but executive VP Douglas Lee is confident those tiers will eventually "kind of melt away". We can only hope. [Disclosure: Engadget is part of the Time Warner family][Via Multichannel News]
