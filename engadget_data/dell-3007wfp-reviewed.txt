What'd they think of the Engadget Best of CES 2006 winner? Well, they gave it a4/5 and their pick as Editor's choice, and were into its consistent image, contrast ratio, and grayscale performance.Not so hot, apparently, was its backlight uniformity, and the fact that you're gonna need an adapter with dual-link DVIto handle this bad mamma jamma. Yeah, we know dems the breaks, but if you're thinking about a diametrically perfectaccessory to your cute little laptop, think again (unless you just got a new HD PowerBook, that is).
