New devices, ranging from enhanced keyboards for the
visually impaired to Braille displays, are making it easier for those with limited or no eyesight to use computers â€” or
just do simple things like riding the bus, according to News.com. The U.K.'s Blazie Engineering, for example, produces
a $2,000 Braille display that can refresh lines of text as they are "read," while the Keys-U-See (pictured) is a $35
large-print keyboard for those with limited eyesight (or fully-sighted people who never quite learned to touch-type).
Some devices address more prosaic needs, like the daily commute. AgentSheets, of Colorado, modifies Ipaq PDAs to
interact with GPS-equipped city buses, allowing them to alert commuters when a bus approaches their stop, so they know
when to get off.
