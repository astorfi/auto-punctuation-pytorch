Playlist Mag has got a roundup review of three Bluetooth headphone systems for the iPod: Logitech's
cryptically-named Wireless Headphones for iPod ($150),
Ten Technology's naviPlay ($200), and the MacAlly
BlueWave ($170). They break it down thusly: if you gotta have those sweet, sweet, audiophile sounds, you gotta go with
the naviPlay, which lets you use your own headphones. The drawback is that you're still basically wired, although not
to your iPod but to a somewhat smaller, lighter Bluetooth receiver â€” one could argue that this defeats the whole
purpose of using a wireless solution but hey, YMMV. Otherwise, for a truly wireless experience you'll sorta hafta
compromise on the audio quality to some extent. Between the two other options, the Logitech sports more features (like
on-headset controls) but is potentially on the uncomfortable side, whereas the BlueWave is simpler but more
comfortable, as well as providing a bit of noise isolation.
