Still, it probably won't stop some users from wanting to join in on this Android exploiting pastime; if you dare, J says the code will be released shortly, but for now you'll find the footage by breezing past the break.

Update: If you're still feeling brave enough, you'll find the root guide by hitting the Nook Devs link below.
