 In yet another patent infringement case from Texas, French networking gear manufacturer Alcatel has just taken Microsoft to court for violating seven, count 'em, seven patents pertaining to fast-forward and rewind functions in online video streams. In a pair of suits filed in US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas this week, Alcatel is seeking damages for those alleged patent violations. As our buddies at PVR Wire point out, given that Alcatel worked with Microsoft to build an IPTV platform, it's likely that this will settle before this legal snowball gets too out of control -- that way, both parties could fast forward the outcome, too. Or would that be another violation?[Via PVR Wire]
