Put simply, you invert your console, snap a photo (or three for good measure) through the mesh, and compare your image with the above picture in order to determine if your box is rockin' the beefed up heatsink we've been hearing about. Go on, give it a go yourself, and make sure you report back with details of your findings (and photos for extra street cred).[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
