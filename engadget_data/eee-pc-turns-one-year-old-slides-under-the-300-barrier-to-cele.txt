That doesn't come in the form of that rumored new sub-$300 model, however, but rather an existing Eee PC 900A that's now available from Best Buy for $299.99. Not that we're complaining, as this particular model packs an 8.9-inch display compared to the 7-incher on the 701SDX spotted yesterday, along with a 1.6GHz Atom processor, 1GB or RAM, a 4GB SSD, and Linux pre-installed. Now, about that $200 Eee PC.Read - jkOnTheRun, "Asus breaks sub-$300 price barrier with Eee PC 900A at Best Buy"Read - Laptop, "Happy Birthday Eee PC!"
