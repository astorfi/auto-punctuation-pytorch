Sadly, however, it looks like touch S60 is going be exactly what the name implies and not a speck more -- check out this demo video posted on the Nokia marketing blog. Sure, it's being demoed off a PC on a touch tablet and anything could change, but we'd say that Nokia's goal of keeping S60 essentially the same to avoid confusing consumers is a little misplaced -- this seems like a terrific opportunity to roll out a sexy new version of S60 with touch at the forefront and re-capture the interest of all those Symbian users, so simply glomming touch onto the existing UI seems like a cop-out. Let's hope things get a little swoopier when the first devices show up in a few months, eh? Video after the break.[Via Boy Genius Report]
