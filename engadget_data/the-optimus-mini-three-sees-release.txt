Nothing much here we haven't seen pics of or couldn't alreadyinfer, but we do have dimensions (4.6 x 2.0 x 0.7-inches), a price (it's going to go for $100), and some dates (you'llbe able to pre-order this week to get yours when the first batch rolls out on May 15th). Oh, and you can also orient itvertically (nice) and play animations up to 5 fps on its 96 x 96 pixel 262k color 0.78 x 0.78 OLED keys. Did we mentionits big brother, the full Optimus keyboard, also makes a cameoon the site being listed for sample manufacture by late 2006? Well done.[Thanks to everyone who sent thisin]
