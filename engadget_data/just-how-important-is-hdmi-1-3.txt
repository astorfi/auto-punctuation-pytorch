Aside from the fact that you'll need v1.3 in order to take full advantage of the hippest audio formats and such, why even care about what version you're using? The lovable geeks over at HomeTheaterMag broke it all down real nice like, explaining the benefits of HDMI 1.3 as well as what the prior versions of HDMI can / cannot do. There's far too much detail to cover in this space, but we'd highly recommend you checking out the read link if you're even remotely interested in learning something that any home theater junkie should know. In other words, don't miss out.
