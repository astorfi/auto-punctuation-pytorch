On the SX20 they liked the focal range but hated the noisy image quality, and such is the case on the SX30 IS. This year it has a whopping 35x focal range, going from 24mm all the way up to 840mm and adding "very effective" IS to boot. The problem is double-trouble on the image quality front: noisy shots anywhere north of ISO 400, and chromatic aberrations that add a little too much Technicolor delight on contrasty shots. Ultimately it sounds like a hugely flexible and capable shooter, but only for those who aren't too picky about quality -- and who don't mind the $429 MSRP.
