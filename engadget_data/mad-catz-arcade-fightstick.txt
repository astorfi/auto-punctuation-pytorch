The M.O.J.O. may be Mad Catz's star of this year's E3, but the peripheral-maker's pretty darn excited to show of its latest massive gamepad, if for no other reason than the fact that the controller made a rare appearance at Microsoft's press conference, the other day -- in fact, during our time in the company's booth, a Redmond rep popped by and gave it a thumbs up (and casually mentioned that Mad Catz happens to be the only company other than his own that happens to have the Xbox One it its booth).


The controller, as you can no doubt tell in the above image, is a bit of a beast -- you may well need both hands to onto it. Along the top, you find six buttons in two rows and a joystick, as well a mystery panel on the top -- something Mad Catz apparently isn't ready to talk about. The controller has a detachable cord on the back and will open up use a button on the front, making it easier to change artwork on the thing. Between the buttons and the sides, there's a lot glowing space on the FightStick. Check out a video of that and more, after the break.
