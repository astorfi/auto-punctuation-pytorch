The 10-inch (1024 x 600 resolution) laptop primarily uses the SSD, reserving the HDD for storage, and boasts an "Eco Mode" button which will temporarily disconnect the HDD to save power. The hybrid functions should provide both a faster OS and longer battery life -- but we'll wait till the test results are in to form our opinions. If you've forgotten, spec-wise the U115's got a 1.60GHz Intel Atom CPU, up to 2GB of DDR2 RAM, plus 8GB SSD / 80GB HDD, 16GB SSD / 120GB HDD, and 32GB SSD / 160GB HDD storage options, and a 2 megapixel webcam. No word on pricing or release date for this bad boy yet. We'll keep our eyes peeled.[Via PC Launches]
