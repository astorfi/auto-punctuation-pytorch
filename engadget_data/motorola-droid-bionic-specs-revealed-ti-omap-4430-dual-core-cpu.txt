Seems as though the Motorola mobile of mystery can't hold its secrets forever, since the specs of the Bionic are now up for perusal on Motorola's developer site. Here's the skinny: it's got a TI OMAP 4430 1GHz dual-core CPU bundled with 1GB RAM (twice the amount in the Droid 3), a 4.3-inch qHD display with 960 x 540 resolution, HDMI 1.4, 8 megapixel rear camera accompanied by a VGA front-facing shooter and 1080p HD video capture, webtop capabilities, and the obvious LTE radio. Unfortunately, the specs confirm the Bionic's lack of GSM / EDGE -- essentially turning it into a fancy PMP when traveling abroad -- and doesn't bother mentioning battery size (or life, for that matter), the most confounding question still lingering aside from the release date. C'mon, Motorola, can we at least get a hint?

Update: A keen-eyed tipster alerted us to one minor snafu in the above image: it shows the Motorola XT865 -- the original Droid Bionic unveiled at CES 2011 last January -- instead of the XT875, which belongs to the new and redesigned model. We can't be sure if this is an typo on the site or if it really is the old version. Either way, we'll keep a close eye on the story and update if we hear anything else.
