       Ok, it officially started some time ago, but it isfinally being adopted by the average consumer. I was visiting my parents this weekend which is like goingback in time in regards to technology. I love my parents, but it pains me to visit and watch SD when I am used to HD.While I was visiting my parents, they came home with a new TV and to my surprise it was equipped with a ATSC and QAMtuner. My father plugged it (I helped him lift) into his basic cable and and my mother easily used the remote to setupthe TV and a few minutes later we were watching down converted HD. If you have never seen down converted SD, let me tellyou it looks much better than analog cable. The cool part is that the TV automatically found the QAM channels and addedthem to the line up. Of course the channels numbers are not the same as digital cable, but it was still nice to havethem there. Here at HD Beat we are always talking about consumer acceptance and to me when my parents buyit, it has arrived. I mean my parents didn't buy a DVD player till I bought them one for Christmas in 2002!Haveany of you seen these new ATSC SD TVs in action?
