 The more things change, the more they stay the same -- for our old pal the iPod Classic, at least. Sure Apple went and revamped the rest of its music playing brethren, but the HDD stalwart is, as its name implies, staying true to its roots. Death rumors aside, the high-capacity player is sitting pretty over in Apple's online store. Those who need a shot of 160GB nostalgia can still pick one up for $250.
