 Nokia is jumping on the UMA (unlicensedmobile access) bandwagon with the 6136, a GSM phone that also works with LANs over WiFi. The phone, a clamshell,quad-band GSM model with a 1.3 megapixel camera, will be out during the second quarter, and will initially be availableon the Orange network. The phone is primarily targeted at corporate customers who can deploy the phone for use both as acellphone for external use, and as a VoIP phone within company facilities.
