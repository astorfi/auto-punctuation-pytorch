Leaked T-Mobile roadmap outlines Ice Cream Sandwich updates, new myTouch devices
T-Mobile's next myTouch to come from Huawei?
T-Mobile myTouch and myTouch Q coming August 8th for $50, we go hands-on


Gone are the days when $50 got you a flip phone that could make calls, send texts and shoot super-low-quality thumbnails. T-Mobile's myTouch offerings aim to provide all the functionality of a top-tier smartphone, coupled with the kind of hardware and software top-tier handsets were offering a year or two ago.


After letting HTC and LG have a go at the myTouch series, T-Mobile tapped Huawei to design its latest devices, the myTouch and myTouch Q, a garden-variety slab and a full QWERTY slider, respectively. This time around, the carrier chose phones with more expansive 4-inch, 800 x 480 displays, among other improvements to the design and internals. Unfortunately, software wasn't considered in the upgrade: both of these run the aging Android 2.3 OS. Suffice to say, skinned Gingerbread is likely to turn off some shoppers, but it's still worth asking if people on a budget might appreciate these devices when they go on sale Wednesday for $50, post-rebate. So are there any redeeming qualities to speak of, if not the software experience? Read on to find out.




Hardware
As we've mentioned before, the latest myTouch offerings are quite similar in appearance aside from the Q's added heft, stemming from that QWERTY slider. All told, the design here calls to mind previous myTouch offerings, with their rounded corners and curvaceous frames. This time around, though, Huawei added a touch of silver to the front speaker grill and opted for a soft-touch coating on the handsets' back covers. The change in material keeps those pesky fingerprints away and generally feels really nice in the hand. Overall, we'd call that a decisive improvement.
