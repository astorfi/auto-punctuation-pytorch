 Samsung's product lineup for 2008 includes 3D-capable plasmas, powered by DDD Group's TriDef 3D. It's about time, as we've been expecting the TriDef 3D box since 2005, and it only recently hit as a product for some of Samsung's DLPs. Hopefully we don't need to wait two more years to get this hooked to one of our flat panel sets, but it is here at CES, or available from DDD's website for $199.
