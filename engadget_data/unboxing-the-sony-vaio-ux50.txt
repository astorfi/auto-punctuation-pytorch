Some think the practice began among the ancient Ap'heelfanboi tribes, but today the practice of carefully documenting the mundane act of opening a box with a gadget inside has spread across all of geekdom. However, rarely have we seen the art taken to such heights as with Micro PC Talk's unboxing of the Sony Vaio UX50. Not only are there 187 pictures in total, but 25 of those are before the UX box is even breached. The soundtrack is also quite the touch, and we almost teared up when the chubby little device was brought from its polyethylene foam. Micro PC talk, you have done our ancestors proud.
