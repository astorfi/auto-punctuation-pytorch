The last time SpaceX's Dragon visited the International Space Station, they brought along some nifty presents that included the first zero-g 3D printer. SpaceX captured this photo of Dragon lifting off from Cape Canaveral in September on its fourth commercial resupply mission to the orbital outpost. The company is planning another launch on Friday. What does Elon Musk have up his sleeve this time? They'll attempt to land a Falcon 9 rocket booster on an "autonomous spaceport drone ship" (i.e., a barge). Will this crazy idea work? Musk estimates a 50â€“50 chance of success. Tune in on Friday to find out how it goes.
