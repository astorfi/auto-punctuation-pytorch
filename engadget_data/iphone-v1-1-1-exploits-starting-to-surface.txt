       As if anyone expected it to stay locked down forever, the layers of security surrounding v1.1.1 of the iPhone firmware are being peeled away. TUAW's Erica Sadun managed to get read / write access to the phone's directories during her liveblogging session, and the hackint0sh forums are abuzz about a new hacking method that uses buffer overflow via "carefully crafted" TIFFs that crash Mobile Safari. Neither of the new hacks approach the relative ease of use that we'd seen pre-v1.1.1, but it's still early days yet. Apple, throw us a bone here, will ya?[Thanks, Julian]Read - Liveblogging the big iPhone 1.1.1 hack (TUAW)Read - A new exploit discovered (hackint0sh)
