We have to hand it to Nokia: the company faces an acquisition by Microsoft in the very near future, but it's still got a few tricks up its sleeves. The FCC just approved a mystery device known as the RX-114, and Nokia's team did an incredible job of dressing up the paperwork so as to hide all clues of what it really was -- that is, right up until the last page of a 167-page document full of bland measurements and technical graphs. What you see above is official confirmation that Nokia is indeed working on a tablet, complete with diagrams of the device along with specific references to its slate-like state. (Forgive the fuzzy print; the diagrams are pretty small, so we enlarged them.)


What else do we know? The docs confirm that the tablet features LTE with support for bands 2, 4, 5, 13 and 17, along with a full suite of HSPA+ and GSM / EDGE. This means that regardless of which carrier actually picks up this particular device (frequency support doesn't guarantee carrier coverage, and no networks have confirmed that they'll be selling it), it technically will work on Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile. Of course, we've already seen purported leaks that show the Windows RT device with Big Red branding, so it's not a far stretch to believe this is still in the works for one or more US providers. We'll continue to parse the paperwork for other cleverly hidden clues, but this at least confirms what we already suspected -- and if we had to guess, we have a strong suspicion that we'll be seeing this beaut in the flesh at Nokia World in Abu Dhabi on October 22nd.
