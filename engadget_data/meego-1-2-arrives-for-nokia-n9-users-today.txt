   Nokia N9 users, if you've yet to activate your beloved device today, then do so post-haste. It looks like our army of faithful tipsters found PR 1.2 ready to roll this morning. The 284MB update should be available worldwide, although a few users in Saudi Arabia are yet to see any goodies. Video calling, folder functionality and copy and paste should all be available in this release, but we'll let you get elbows-deep in the update and stop spoiling the surprises that are in store for you.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
