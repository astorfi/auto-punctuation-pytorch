Said display has become the first Acer monitor with a matching multimedia dock, which includes a USB hub that allows PCs to connect to it via DisplayLink (or in other words, via USB). In case you're in need of a refresher, other specs include a 10,000:1 contrast ratio, 1,680 x 1,050 native resolution, VGA input and a 5-millisecond response time. It's shipping now for an undisclosed amount in the US and Europe.
