The latest entry into the ultraportable market comes in the form of the Medion Akoya Mini, a handsome looking entry that clearly aims to compete with ASUS' wunderkind. The 10-inch laptop scores big points right out of the box due to its inclusion of Intel's infamous Atom CPU. The system will feature a traditional hard drive, with some form of Linux on-board, 1GB of RAM standard, two USB ports, a memory card slot, VGA out, and a 1.3 megapixel webcam. No word on if we'll see this in the States, but it's hitting Europe soon with a starting price of â‚¬399 (or about $638).[Via le Journal du Geek; Thanks, Anh]
