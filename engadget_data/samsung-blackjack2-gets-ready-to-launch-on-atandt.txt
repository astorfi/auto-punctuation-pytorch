It seems the carrier's pulling the same stunt it did with the Q9 Global, taking email addresses for notification of availability without giving any indication as to when it might be available. Compared to the original, the keyboard and d-pad both look considerably hotter, Windows Mobile 6 comes installed (just imagine the horror if it wasn't!), "faster 3G speeds" are being touted, and perhaps most importantly, GPS capability is integrated. Oh yeah, there's some Video Share action in there too, but we're not too sure we'd call that a "feature." When it's launched, look for it in "wine red" and black.[Thanks, Chris P.]
