Amazingly enough, not the first PlayStation Portable
knock-off
we've spotted, though we'd wager that GaoMing's GM-219
portable game console is the only one that comes with 37 games built-in, is compatible with GameKing game cards, and
sports a "Super-glare imitate color screen" (you can say that again!).
