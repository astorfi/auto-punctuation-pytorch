For most HD junkies, we're sure the answer is a resounding "yes," but for the average joe, even the cheapest Blu-ray players are still pretty pricey. Of course, one downside of the format war ending is the removal of pressure from BD player manufacturers to actually keep prices low to compete, but we're fairly certain most decks will be a lot more reasonable when holiday shopping season 2008 hits. So, dear readers, what do you all think? Are Blu-ray players still priced to high?
