LG first rolled out its Knock feature on the G2 earlier this year, but now that item will become a standard feature on future handsets. If you'll recall, the power button on that smartphone is situated around back, so Knock allows users to turn the unit on by double tapping on the screen. In addition to those upcoming devices, the outfit will add Knock to existing L Series II gadgets via a maintenance release update starting next month. Of course, specific availability will depend on region and carrier, so you might have to wait a bit longer for the add-on.
