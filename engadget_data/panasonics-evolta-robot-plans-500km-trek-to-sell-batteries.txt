Enlist the help of a robot to do the dirty work, of course. Just like last year, the company is sending its Evolta-powered bot on a long-distance trek, this time in an attempt to crush the previous endurance record of 23 kilometers by traveling the full 500 kilometers from Tokyo to Kyoto. If all goes as planned, the trip will start on September 23rd and end on December 10th -- hey, nobody said being a robot mascot was easy.
