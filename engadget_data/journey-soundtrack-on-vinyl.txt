Sony and Thatgamecompany are proud that Journey's soundtrack was good enough to make it the first game nominated for a Grammy -- so proud, in fact, that they're releasing the score on vinyl. Spend $35 and you'll get a double LP of Austin Wintory's original score for the music-driven adventure, complete with art on each side of both discs. You'll have to wait until August to start listening, although you can get a $60 limited edition print of the album art this June. Is this overkill for a game that you can easily finish in an afternoon? Quite possibly, but it's a testament to how soundtracks like this are increasingly finding relevance beyond your console.
