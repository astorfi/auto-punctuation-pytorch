Alternatively, you can plunk down $21,000 for a pre-order on Panasonic's newfangled 3D camcorder, which was just introduced (officially, that is) at CES this week. Our home slices over at Switched were able to get a plain, mundane 2D camera on this piece at the company's booth, and while it doesn't exactly look as useful as a fully loaded Ford Focus, we hear it's great for making Avatar fanboy clips. Hit the source link and give the video a look, won't you?
