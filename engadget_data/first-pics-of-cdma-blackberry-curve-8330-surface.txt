According to non-blurry (gasp!) pictures over at BBGeeks, the CDMA Curve is rockin' a 8330 model number, integrated GPS, built-in camera and a temporary sticker on the back warning that what you're looking at is absolutely not for sale under any circumstances. Excited? You should be, now hit up the read link and take a peek.
