For those keeping track, that still leaves it well behind Apple's App Store and the Android Market, which by some estimates boast roughly 250,000 and 70,000 to 100,000 apps, respectively, and each of which also took less time to hit the 10,000 app mark. Even still, the fact that a smartphone platform "only" has 10,000 apps speaks quite a bit to how far we've come in just a few short years.
