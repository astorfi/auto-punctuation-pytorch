 Here's a new one: TiVo is holding a publicity eventwhere they're giving away 14 boxes with lifetime subscriptions - no big deal, until you find out that it's a speeddating event, where attendees will be matched up by their favorite TV programs. If we didn't hear this from Dave Zatzwe'd swear it was a joke, but sure enough TiVo is actually hosting a singles meetup on February 13th at a "bar inthe hippest downtown San Francisco hotel," wherever that is. Not only do you get a shot at the TiVo swag, you alsogets two free drinks and a packet of "Thumbs Up/Down" stickers to rate people on your scorecard or more likelyall over the back of their shirts. We predict that the most successful guys of the night will have put down Sex &the City, Lost, and Desperate Housewives on their "Now Playing List," while the unhappiest gents will havelisted Star Trek, Star Trek: TNG, and Star Trek: DS9 (you might be okay with Voyager, but we wouldn't risk it).[Via Zatz Not Funny]
