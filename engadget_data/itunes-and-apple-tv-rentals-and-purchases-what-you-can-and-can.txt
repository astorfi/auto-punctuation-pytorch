Granted, real world scenario won't be too complicated for most people, but the nerds around these parts will probably want to check out our handy, aptly confusing chart to know exactly what's in store. Hey, don't look at us, we just parse the data.
      

 

 #comparechart { border: 2px solid #333; border-collapse: collapse; } #comparechart td { padding: 3px; border: 1px solid #ccc; vertical-align: top; margin: 0; line-height: 1.3em; } #comparechart th { font-weight: bold; text-align: left; padding: 4px; background: #eee; } #comparechart th.mainth { border-bottom: 1px solid #333; font-size: 1.2em; } #comparechart td.red { background-color: #f08c85; } #comparechart td.green { background-color: #b3e2c4;  Green indicates goodness, or the general perception of awesomeness. Red indicates badness, or not-goodness (but not including inherent lameness due to DRM). The columns (iTunes / Apple TV) represent the point of purchase / rental. The Apple TV column assumes AFTER the Take 2 update.  So to say Buy shows: SD / iTunes is the equivalent of asking "Can I Buy shows: SD through iTunes on my PC?) Nerdy: likewise, the circuitous logic of checking to see if an Apple TV can transfer a purchase from a computer to an Apple TV has a nixed answer.      iTunes (desktop)Apple TV (PC-free)Comments / notes   Buy show: in SD Yes - $1.99 Yes - $1.99     Buy shows: HD No No     Rent show: in SD No No     Rent show: in HD No No     Buy movie: in SD Yes - up to $15 Yes - up to $15     Buy movie: in HD No No    Rent movie: in SD Yes - $2.99 / 3.99 Yes - $2.99 / 3.99 Library / new   Rent movie: in HD No Yes - $3.99 / 4.99 Library / new   Play purchased: on previous-gen iPods Yes Yes    Play rentals: on previous-gen iPods No No     Play purchased: on current-gen iPods Yes Yes    Play rentals: on current-gen iPods Yes No     Transfer anything: ATV to any iPod / iPhone (without PC) -- Hells no     Transfer anything: to non-Apple devices Um, no Are you high?
