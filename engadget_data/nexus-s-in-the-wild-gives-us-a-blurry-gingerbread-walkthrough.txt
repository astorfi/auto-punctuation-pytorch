Of course, Eric Schmidt himself did the same on stage at the Web 2.0 summit recently, but there's a difference: Schmidt wouldn't admit he was holding a Nexus S, wouldn't show us all of Gingerbread's UI tweaks, and wouldn't take a bunch of dark, low-quality shots and submit them to xda-developers. There's not a lot to see here, but you can make out some of the icons on the redesigned, blacked-out status bar, the redone phone keypad, and the About screen where we get confirmation that it really is a Nexus S running 2.3 (granted, this screen is incredibly easy to fake, but we'll allow it in light of all the other visual evidence we've got going on here). Unfortunately, it's still not at all clear when the Nexus S is actually launching... so for now, we'll take as many of these high-ISO galleries as we can get.
