Caught in the hellish strife that is modern living, we're not sure anymore what we're more scared of: gas attacks or
cellphone brain cancer. And naturally, as Americans, we consider baseball caps our first line of defense.
CR Clean Air took care of the former, so thank god
someone stepped up to the plate to still our raging Treo-induced-tumor fears: Handy-Fashions.com has the Mobile Cap, a
hat designed with an RF-insulating earpiece lined with material "used by the military to shield missiles in extreme
microwave exposed environments" which claims 99.999% signal blockage for only $39.99. The moral of the story? You're
already going to look completely stupid wearing one or the other, so you might as well be extra safe and wear both at
the same time.
