Streaming online television services appears to be the next big thing in the Valley -- at least, if you ask Google, Apple, Intel and other tech giants that are considering making a move in that direction. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google has approached several media companies about licensing TV channels for such a service, which involves offering cable TV-like channel packages over broadband. This wouldn't be the first time we've seen the folks at Mountain View putting feelers out, as the company opened up discussions with media companies two years ago. Nothing came of them, of course, but it's hard to say if the current conversations will meet the same fate -- a couple years is a long time in the industry, and things may be different enough to merit a more appealing offer on either side, especially given the rise of Netflix, Roku, Amazon Instant and others. A report from the New York Times indicates that these talks are still likely preliminary and not anywhere close to a deal, so we shouldn't anticipate watching new TV shows live on our Google TV anytime soon.
