The card, which has been in development for a few years, houses an NFC radio and antenna that deals with payments through MasterCard's PayPass system. Moneto's iPhone case is already available, offering swipe payment delights for iOS users for $80, and includes $10 of spendable cash. The microSD card is set to land in the next few weeks, pegged at $30. Both will be available at the source below, with plans to support several -- as yet unnamed -- Android devices by Q2, rolling out further throughout 2012.

The moneto iPhone wallet is powered by MasterCard PayPass technology and linked to a general purpose reloadable MasterCard prepaid card to enable iPhone users to make purchases with their phone at the hundreds of thousands of merchants that accept MasterCard PayPass.  "For over a decade, MasterCard has led the transformation of mobile phones into secure mobile payment devices," said James Anderson, senior vice president, Mobile and Emerging payments at MasterCard. "We are excited to partner with moneto so that iPhone users can enjoy the convenience of paying for purchases with a simple 'tap' at thousands of PayPass locations around the globe."  For the first time, NFC functionality is available directly to consumers at retail without the need to change devices, upgrade plans or sign new contracts. The moneto mobile payments technology uses a NFC-enabled microSD chip embedded in a patented, protective iPhone case. iPhone users simply need to sign up at moneto.me to receive the case, install the moneto app from the app store, and activate their account. Users can launch the moneto app to view their account balance, check transaction history and make everyday in-store purchases with a tap of their iPhone at any PayPass-enabled contactless payments reader at the point of sale. Users can fund their moneto prepaid account through direct deposit, ACH transfer or cash/credit/debit card-enabled third-party money transfer services such as MoneyGram, Western Union, PayPal or GreenDot.  "As this breakthrough mobile wallet launches in the US, it not only makes mobile payments available to iPhone users for the first time but it also opens the door for consumers to adopt NFC while pushing mobile commerce forward," said Deepak Jain, DeviceFidelity President and CEO. "We are excited to partner with MasterCard and SpringCard to break the barriers for a rapid effective rollout that will spur both consumers and merchants to adopt this new wave of electronic commerce."  moneto also comes with a companion prepaid MasterCard to give users the ability to access cash at ATMs and make online purchases, pay bills or shop at merchants that do not accept contactless payments. moneto also enables card-to-card and wire-fund transfers from a secure internet portal accessible via moneto.me.  "Consumers have been hearing about NFC and mobile wallets for years, now with moneto they can finally start using it and with the most popular smartphone device on the planet. The moneto mobile wallet app is focused on delivering a faster and easier shopping experience that is consumer friendly," said Kevin Haddad, president of SpringCard. "Our vision is simple: People who use our applications should not have to worry 'Will this work with my phone?' as consumers can easily make secure purchases regardless of their phone, carrier, or bank."  SAFETY AND SECURITY  The In2Pay technology behind moneto brings peace of mind to consumers. moneto users can prevent unauthorized access to their account using a PIN that is safely stored in a secure chip inside the microSD. The sleek and durable case design protects the iPhone and the NFC enabled microSD securely stores and encrypts the card information. Additionally, the moneto account is backed by MasterCard's Zero Liability, which protects consumers against unauthorized purchases.  PRICING AND AVAILABILITY  moneto for iPhone will be available for online ordering in the U.S. immediately at moneto.me for $79.95 which includes $10.00 of pre-loaded funds. The moneto mobile wallet is available in limited release on the iPhone 4S, iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPhone 3. A number of Android models will also be supported by 2Q12. Additional phone support will be added throughout the year.
