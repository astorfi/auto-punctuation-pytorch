 
Well, here we have it. Microsoft's Xbox 360 spring Dashboard update really will do everything it's been reported to (and then some). Unfortunately, those waiting for a sea change update intended to knock the PS3 on its ass may be a bit disappointed, but here's what you need to know:

The update hits the beginning of the week of May 7th
Your contact list will now integrate Windows Live Messenger, and show joinable session status
Messenger contacts can see what game you're playing, and your gamertag
Marketplace will now have its own blade, which will be skinned independent of your theme
Users will now get inline achievement updates (i.e. see what achievement you just unlocked and how much it's worth).
Low-power download mode and auto-shutdown
Progressive download: watch, fast-forward, and rewind partially downloaded movies
You can text chat messenger six friends playing games watching movies
Multiple tweaks on the user interface

We got a hands-on with the update, so there are plenty of shots for you to gorge yourself on in the gallery.
