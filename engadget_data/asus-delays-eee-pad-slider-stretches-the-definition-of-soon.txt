ASUS has an update on its UK Facebook profile indicating that the QWERTYfied tablet will now be shipping there sometime this Autumn, taking this extra time to throw up some surveys and better "understand what is important for our customers." That sounds dangerously close to the company's feet getting a little cold as it prepares to launch the most interestingly designed Honeycomb slab we've yet seen, but maybe if everybody leaves some encouraging comments we can get this reluctant bride out of the limo and down the aisle, already.
