 In case you hadn't heard, relations between Apple and Samsung aren't exactly peachy keen these days. Their global legal conflict has been particularly fierce in the land down under, and it seems Apple just poured a bit more gas on the fire by alleging that Sammy's infringing its designs for tablet and phone cases. According to Bloomberg, Cupertino informed the Australian court of its latest legal allegations in a hearing in which it was attempting to push back the case's March trial date. Apple's already issued a notice of this newly alleged infringement to the Korean company, and a statement of its new claims is forthcoming, so details of the infringed-upon IP aren't yet available. What we do know is that it looks like Samsung's attorneys in Oz just got a lot more work to do over the holidays.
