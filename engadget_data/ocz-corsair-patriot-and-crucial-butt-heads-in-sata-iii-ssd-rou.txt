The benchmarking gurus over at Hot Hardware have assembled quite the guide for those currently in the market, hosting up a variety of top-tier drives from the likes of OCZ Technology, Patriot, Crucial and Corsair. We'll leave the nitty-gritty for you to discover, but those hungry for spoilers will be elated to know that the SandForce-built OCZ Vertex 3 Max IOPS, Corsair Force GT and Patriot Wildfire proved to be the best performers in terms of transfer rates. That said, the whole lot managed to impress, and while the average user isn't apt to feel the real-world differences among them, there's a safe bet you aren't in that "average" crowd. Cliff's Notes? The Crucial M4 was deemed superior in terms of value, while the Vertex 3 Max IOPS and Wildfire just about tied for sheer speed.
