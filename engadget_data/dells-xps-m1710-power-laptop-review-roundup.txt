       Yeah, we'll fess, for the fastest laptop, like, ever, the M1710 got kind of a poor showing ongetting itself reviewed. Seriously, with speed like that we kind of expected the writeups to pour out within minutes --no speed bottlenecks to emcumber slowish tech journos. But those who did get their hands on an M1710 were prettyunanimous about it; the thing's freaking fast. We'll show you what we got if you're thinking about plunking down fourgrand (and as always, leave reviews we may have missed in comments so we can add 'em).Read - Laptop MagazineRead - Notebook ReviewRead - PC MagRead - AnandTech
