Sprint, however, is sick and tired (but mostly tired) of playing such games, and it has today announced a new "Satisfaction Guaranteed or Money-Back" program that it has no current intentions of ever nixing. We spoke to Sprint this morning regarding the news, and a spokesperson affirmed that it will be in place for the foreseeable future, with no expiration date already dialed up in the background. The new deal (which starts tomorrow, all kidding aside) enables any customer to open up a new line of Sprint service for 30 days; if they aren't feeling it, they'll get "reimbursed for the device purchase and activation fee, get the early termination fee waived, get a full refund for service plan monthly recurring charges incurred and get all associated taxes and Sprint surcharges associated with these charges waived." We'll confess -- that's pretty darn thorough, but do you seriously expect to return that EVO 4G? No, no you don't.
