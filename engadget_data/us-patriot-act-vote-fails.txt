 The Senate has voted overwhelmingly to reform the powers of America's security services, at the expense of renewing existing provisions of the Patriot Act. In a contentious debate leading up to midnight, the house belatedly opted to support the USA Freedom Act, which will eventually end the bulk collection of phone metadata.

As Reuters points out, however, a 2013 investigation reported that metadata collection has never been essential to preventing a terrorist attack.
