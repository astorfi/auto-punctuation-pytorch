It's said that Seven, Nine and Ten all placed bids for airing rights, but it was the latter that came out victorious. Purportedly, the network is also teaming up with Foxtel and "agreeing to sell the subscription television as well as internet, mobile and digital video rights to the pay TV provider." Essentially, both will share equal broadcast rights to all events save for the opening and closing ceremonies, both of which will only be seen on Ten. 'Tis aways until the games get cranked up, sure, but at least you won't have to wonder if your favorite events will be beamed out in pitiful 480i 576i.[Image courtesy of AP / Herald Sun]
