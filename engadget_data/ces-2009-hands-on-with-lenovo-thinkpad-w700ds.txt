The slide-out screen felt sturdy, and it's capable of swiveling 30 degrees forward and any steps in between. The tablet isn't going to replace a Wacom anytime soon, but it'll get the job done in a pinch. The laptop itself is rather bulky, but what do you expect when you're packing this much power? Check out the gallery below for pics.


Update: Added video after the break.
