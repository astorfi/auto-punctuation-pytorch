Short of attending an industry event or ordering your own dev kit, it's a bit tricky to get your hands on an Oculus Rift VR headset. Soon, that could change: the company just secured $75 million in funding to bring the product to market. The extra capital comes from both Spark Capital and Formation|8 (early Oculus investors), as well as Andreessen Horowitz -- an investment firm known for funding companies like Jawbone, Facebook Twitter and Skype. As part of the deal, Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Mark Andreessen will join the Oculus VR board of directors. "We believe Oculus will not only alter the gaming landscape, but will redefine fundamental human experiences in areas like film, education, architecture and design," Andreessen said in the company's official statement. "We're incredibly excited to help them change the world."

The influx of cash will help Oculus VR finish building the consumer version of its Rift VR headset, which promises to bring immersive experiences to Windows, Mac, Linux and Android devices. The company didn't go as far as announcing a release window for the headset just yet, but CEO Brendan Iribe seems optimistic. "This additional infusion of capital, as well as the leadership and experience of Marc Andreessen, will help us take the final steps toward our ultimate goal: making virtual reality something consumers everywhere can enjoy." Details are scarce for now, but we're told more details should be available tomorrow. Check out the full press release at the source link below
