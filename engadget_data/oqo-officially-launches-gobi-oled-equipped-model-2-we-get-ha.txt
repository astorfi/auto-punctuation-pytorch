The 800 x 480 (native) OLED touchscreen was positively gorgeous to look at, and the Qualcomm Gobi dual-mode HSPA / EV-DO WWAN chipset was much appreciated. It's also sporting a 1.86GHz Intel Atom CPU, 2GB of RAM, WiFi / Bluetooth, DirectX 9 and H.264 video decode support, 3.5 hours of battery life (7 hours on the double capacity cell), a world keyboard and a global power supply. The unit checks in at under a pound and can support 1,9200 x 1,200 external displays with HDMI / DVI / VGA interfaces. Get ready to lust after one (we already are) when it ships in 1H 2009 starting at $999.
