What can you say when a manufacturer finally comes clean about a
product defect, three years after the fact? If that manufacturer is Sony, and the defect is a CCD problem that affects
over 100 different models of digital cameras, camcorders and PDAs made from 2002 to 2004, you might say, "gosh, no
wonder your market share is slipping!" According to Sony, the defect, which affects both the recording and displaying
of images "only occurs to a limited number of units" (ain't that always the case?). The company is offering free
repairs to anyone whose camera is still experiencing the problems, though we have to wonder how many owners of
long-discontinued digicams like the 2 megapixel DSC-P31 have been hanging onto their defective cameras just waiting for
this announcement â€” and how many have moved on to newer (and probably non-Sony) models in the interim.
