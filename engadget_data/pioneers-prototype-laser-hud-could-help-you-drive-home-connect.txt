First off, it uses lasers to generate its ethereal navigation images -- lasers make everything better -- and second, it's presently sourcing that data from a Android smartphone, making it a fantastic potential addition to infotainment ideas like Nokia's Terminal Mode. Pioneer told Network World that it's planning to actually sell a version of the technology by 2012, but that it might be an aftermarket product rather than an integral part of your car's windshield. They are, of course, entertaining deep-pocketed auto manufacturers as well.
