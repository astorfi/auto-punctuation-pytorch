Now, with version 3.55 of the media player's firmware, the D3 is getting even more streamlined. There's no huge new features to speak of -- and don't even get your hopes up for market support -- but overall the PMP should be more stable and run a bit smoother. Hit up the source link to check out the full list of bug fixes and to download the update now.
