 It's usually safe to presume that BlackBerry will give the most love to its home country, and that's proving reasonable with the BlackBerry Q10. Bell, Rogers and Telus have all confirmed that they'll be carrying the QWERTY-equipped smartphone on May 1st, quite possibly putting them on the cutting edge of the Q10 launch schedule. Smaller networks like Fido, Koodo, Sasktel and Virgin Mobile are also on deck. The big three are already taking pre-orders today, but we'd brace for a rather steep price premium -- they're all asking about $199 for the Q10 on a three-year contract, which is more expensive than many of the phone's touch-only rivals. BlackBerry hasn't outlined plans for the US or other countries yet, but we're hoping they get a slightly better deal.
