 
Just in casethe cellphone-TV landscape wasn't confusing enough, another player is about to enter the market, fueled by a $10million investment from Sprint, which we assume is looking for a decent alternative to its Sprint TV (shown above onthe Sanyo MM-7500) and MobiTV offerings, which haven't exactly taken the world by storm. The new service, TDtv, isbeing developed by equipment provider IPWireless, and is designed to work on 3G TD-CDMA networks. The service canreportedly offer as many as 50 channels for small-screen cellphones, or 15 channels in QVGA. The service is expected tobegin tests in Europe and Asia later this year, with Sprint expected to test the service in the US at some point.
