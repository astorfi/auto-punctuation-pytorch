The X300 (not to be confused with Lenovo's lappie with the same name) is an 11.6-incher that measures just 17.6mm thin and features a reflective keyboard, borderless touchpad (complete with tactile feedback), a 2GHz Intel CPU, 1.3 megapixel webcam and an SSD. It even ships with a spare 2-cell battery for up to seven total hours of operation, and while we know it'll be rolled out worldwide starting next month, there's nary a mention of a price.
