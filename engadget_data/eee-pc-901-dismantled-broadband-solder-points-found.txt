They didn't find anything terribly unusual, but highlights include a monitor-diameter 802.11n antenna, the all-important SSD module (not soldered to allow for upgrades), internal fan, an IDE3 slot, and solder points labeled "3GCard" which you can interpret as you wish (we'll give you two guesses). Finally, they found a mysterious button that doesn't seem to do much of anything. So there you have it: The Eee PC 901 has officially been pillaged. Hit the read link for some exposed silicon.
