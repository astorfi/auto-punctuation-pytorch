IODATA's got two of their own: the internal BRD-UM2, and external USB BRD-AM2B, whichwill go for ¥110,250 and ¥121,800, respectively (that's $942 US and $1,041 US, also respectively). Looks likethese will also burn dual-layer BD-R and BD-RE media, as well as your usual DVD±RW and CD-RW, and will even beatPanasonic's offering to market by a solid 9 days with a June 1st release date. So keep an eye out with your favoritegadget importer and keep that credit card clean.[Via Impress]
