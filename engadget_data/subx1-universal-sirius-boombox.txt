Need a boombox to take your satellite jams wherever you're at in the house? Want to throw back to the 80s and hoist it up on your shoulder? Whichever camp you're in, Sirius has a new boombox looming that reportedly supports the entire array of Sportster units; according to Orbitcast, the SUBX1 Universal Sirius Boombox even supports the Sportster 4, Streamer 3, and any future receivers, and has the usual built-in amp, stereo speakers, and aux input to connect your other DAP of choice. The SUBX1's actual release date is still up in the air, but preliminary estimations indicate a $359.99 pricetag on the boombox / Sportster 4 combo kit. Extract the Sportster 4 and we'll probably see the box going solo for around $190.
