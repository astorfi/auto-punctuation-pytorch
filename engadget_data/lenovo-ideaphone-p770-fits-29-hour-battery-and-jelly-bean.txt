 Motorola may face a new contender to the Droid RAZR MAXX HD's battery capacity crown. Lenovo's quietly introduced IdeaPhone P770 at least theoretically challenges its American counterpart by cramming a 3,500mAh lithium polymer battery into a thicker 11.9mm (0.47-inch) body. That's 200mAh more than Motorola's energy champion, and enough for the company to flaunt a 29-hour talk time. That's not quite as long as Motorola's claimed 32 hours, but Lenovo has done something its American rival seemingly can't -- launch a phone with Jelly Bean. Motorola might rest easier in knowing that the the P770 is an unrepentantly budget-focused behemoth, carrying a 4.5-inch qHD display, a (possibly MediaTek-made) 1.2GHz dual-core processor, 4GB of built-in storage, an 8GB microSD card and both 5-megapixel rear as well as VGA front cameras. For the Â¥1,699 ($273) Lenovo is asking for an off-contract model in its native China, the P770 could still be the first pick of many local phone owners on long-haul trips. It's just a shame that the lack of 4G (and Lenovo's domestic-first mobile strategy) likely means we won't see a launch in the US.  [Thanks, FT]
