So the hot new feature on this Sirius satellite radio receiver is the ability to record and time-shift programs for
later listening, courtesy of some built-in memory that will hold up to 44 minutes worth of content. The unit itself has
also been redesigned with sleekness in mind, includes an FM transmitter and a new antenna, and will reportedly be
available next week. Mad props to the individual who leaked the shots — not so much for leaking the shots, mind you (we
can't condone that, it would be, um, unethical, so we're told) — but for the Humpty Dance reprazent, yo!
