Sony Ericsson's Xperia Neo just became official -- having already graced these pages thanks to sneaky leaksters and prying mobile reviewers -- and it is pretty much what we thought it was: a downmarket alternative for those not keen or able to afford the Xperia Arc. It has an 8.1 megapixel camera round the back, Sony Ericsson's "human curvature" design, and the same Bravia screen technology as the Arc. The sides are extremely shiny and there's an abundance of plastic on show. In simple physical terms, you can just feel the difference in (likely future) price between the Neo and its more reputed siblings. We also found the multitouch widget-summoning feature extremely laggy. We'll have video of that and more for you very soon. Don't go anywhere!

Update: Video's in!
