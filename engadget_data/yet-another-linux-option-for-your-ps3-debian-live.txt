 At this point, running Linux on your PlayStation 3 shouldn't come as any surprise, but just in case you haven't snapped up the Yellow Dog variety, and you're still intrigued after seeing that Fedora Core video, here's yet another option for testing the open source waters on your machine. Debian Live is now available as a downloadable ISO for use on Sony's latest console, and while the task may seem a bit daunting to the uninitiated, there's a fairly thorough wiki set up at the site to guide you through the snags and help you get things running smoothly. So if you've got nothing better to do than tinker with an OS on your PS3, be sure to hit the read link, get your download on, and report on back with your tales of success (or failure).[Via PS3Fanboy]
