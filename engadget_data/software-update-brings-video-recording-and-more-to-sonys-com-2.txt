Revision 1.201, which is only available for the latest of mylos, adds support for video recording, provides a new menu for "easier photo and video uploading," adds a function for formatting Memory Stick Duo media, adds support for 16GB MD Duo cards and improves Flash playback of YouTube videos. The upgrade also adds support for WMV files and the SHOUTcast widget while improving "system stability." The download is slightly hefty at just under 60MB, so head on down and get the new stuff headed your way.[Thanks, shanne]
