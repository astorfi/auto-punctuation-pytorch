We begin with another official-looking leak of the oft-teased A77 -- this time accompanied by its bodacious portrait-assisting hand-grip. Joining the fray is a plethora of leaked pricing: 1,050€ (or about $1,500) for the body of the aforementioned shooter and 900€ (around $1,300) for its little brother the A65. Fancy something smaller? Okay, well hop after the break for a picture of the firm's upcoming NEX-7, and don't forget to peep the source links for the full monty.
