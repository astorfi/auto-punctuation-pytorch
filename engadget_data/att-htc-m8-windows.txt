Feeling blue that the HTC One M8 for Windows is exclusive to Big Red? Good news: AT&T just confirmed that it'll carry the flagship Windows Phone... eventually. The carrier can't openly discuss details like pricing or availability yet -- likely because it can't sell the phone until the terms of the exclusive contract expire -- but at least we can rest a little more easily knowing that this top-of-the-line Windows Phone will expand its reach to more than just one carrier. Who knows: Since a GSM version will be available, that may open the door for the device to go to other parts of the world as well. While you wait, check out our hands-on coverage of the device here.
