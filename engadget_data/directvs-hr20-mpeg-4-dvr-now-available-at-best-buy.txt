This DVR started in the Los Angeles market but thanks to the power of the Internet, all hail the Internet, the unit can now be ordered from BestBuy.com for a cost of $399. We have discovered via their store search that it is in fact available in new markets across the country signaling a nationwide roll out. Interestingly enough, CircuitCity.com, another large DIRECTV provider, doesn't list this model anywhere and a quick call to a local store proved that Circuit City isn't carrying this model just yet. Just a quick warning though: unlike DIRECTV's first HD DVR, this model does NOT come with an HDMI cable. They had to cut costs someplace.
