 Along with a pair of compact point-and-shoots, Samsung also announced their second digital SLR camera today at the Seoul International Photo & Imaging Industry Show, the 10 megapixel GX-2. This followup to the 6 megapixel GX-1S was, like its predecessor, developed in conjunction with Pentax, and thus looks suspiciously like an unnamed model from the esteemed camera manufacturer that was revealed late last week at the same South Korean show. Also like the Pentax, very few details are known so far regarding little things like features, pricing, and availability -- although we can say with some certainty that the GX-2 will accept Schneider and Pentax lenses --Â  so stay tuned to this station for updates as we learn more.
