The laptop includes those same NVIDIA 9400M graphics, Mini DisplayPort plug, new manufacturing method, backlit keyboard and fancy glass trackpad of its big sibling, but does it with a 13.3-inch LED-backlit screen and typically friendly MacBook pricepoints. The laptop is 0.5 pounds lighter than its plastic predecessor, 0.95-inches thick, and Apple's also claiming 5 hours of battery life here, but we'll have to wait and see how realistic that number is. The base model weighs in at $1299 with a 2GHz Core 2 Duo processor, while $1599 gets you 4GB of RAM and a 320GB HDD. There's also an SSD option if you're really looking to splurge. If none of the new speed or style appeals to you, Apple's also slashing its existing low-end MacBook to $999, which is still a bit steep if you ask us. Hit the jump for a breakdown of the configurations.
