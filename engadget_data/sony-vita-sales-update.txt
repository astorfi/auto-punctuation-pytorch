In an interview with PlayFront, German boss Uve Bassendowski blamed the slow sales on the company ignoring young customers to court a more grown-up demographic -- but would redress that balance soon. Compared to the 3DS at the same point in its life, it had sold over three million units worldwide even before Nintendo scythed $80 from the ticket -- the sort of cut that Sony has ruled out for this year
