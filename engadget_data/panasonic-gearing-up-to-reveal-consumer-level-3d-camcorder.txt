 You won't be coloring us shocked if this plays out exactly as rumored, but word on the street has it that Panasonic will be busting out a consumer-level 3D camcorder as early as next week. 'Course, this is a company that already has a built-to-order 3D camcorder available to those with just over 20 large in need of a new home, and with the 3D push happening at a breakneck pace, it was just a matter of time before one of the big boys came along and served up an option for the Average Joe / Jane. Specifics on the device -- which will be "shown at a Tokyo news conference scheduled for July 28" -- are few and far between, but we're hearing that it'll be "about the same size as a conventional consumer-use camcorder," will integrate a pair of lenses (like so) in the front and will ring up at "far less" than professional models.
