 
E Ink Triton. That's the name we should all start getting used to as E Ink Holdings has just officially announced its first color electronic paper display. It was only yesterday that we learned Hanvon would be the first to bring the newly colorized e-reading panels to the market, so today the eponymous E Ink display maker has seen fit to dish out its own press release, catchy title, and even a handy explanatory video. The key points are that the new Triton stuff will offer 20 percent faster performance, sunlight-readable imaging, and up to a month's battery life. That would suggest there's almost no sacrifice in endurance relative to E Ink's monochromatic screens already on offer in things like Amazon's Kindle, which sounds all kinds of righteous to us. Skip past the break to get better acquainted with the Triton.
