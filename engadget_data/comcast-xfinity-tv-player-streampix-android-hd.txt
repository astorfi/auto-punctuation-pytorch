After recent issues delivering video to some TVs, Comcast has fixed those and is also improving the experience available through its video apps on Android. The Xfinity TV Player video on-demand app and Streampix subscription video app have both been updated to support HD video on devices with screens that are 720p or higher. There is also more content available for downloading or streaming, plus improvements to address stability and monitoring video quality. A recent blog post attributes some improvements to its "Viper" infrastructure to deliver video across a number of platforms at once. One drawback? The update will clear any content you've already downloaded to your devices.
