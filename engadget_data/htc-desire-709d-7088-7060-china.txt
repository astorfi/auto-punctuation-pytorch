HTC is doing all it can to maximize its efforts in order to continue growing as a smartphone maker. And, although the newly announced Desire series may not exactly fit the company's flagship type, the 709d (China Telecom), 7060 (China Unicom) and 7088 (China Mobile) are part of HTC's promise to strengthen its mid-range portfolio and definitely shouldn't be overlooked. Design-wise, the Desire trio clearly borrows concepts from the HTC One, sporting a pretty sleek look which includes the now-famed BoomSound speakers next to a 5-inch (960 x 540) display. Inside, there's a 1.2GHz, quad-core Snapdragon 200 chip with 1GB RAM, 8GB of built-in storage (expandable up to 64GB via microSD), an 8-megapixel rear shooter and a 2,100mAh battery. HTC hasn't revealed pricing or availability details yet, but it surely won't be long before folks in China can call one of these their own.
