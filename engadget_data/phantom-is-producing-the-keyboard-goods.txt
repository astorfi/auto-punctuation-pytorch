Due Q2 next year, the Phantom Lapboard is targeted at from-the-couch gamers, who mightstill be waiting around for a relevant console for using this thing come next year (or 2009 for that matter), but thatwon't stop them from lounging around and looking way hip with this sleek little number across their laps. We've alreadycommandeered a few local whiteboards for use as a countdown calendar because this Phantom thing is going to be thedealio, yo.[Via Techdirt]
