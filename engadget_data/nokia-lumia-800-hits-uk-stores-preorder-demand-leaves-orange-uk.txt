Based on preorders, the smartphone has trumped both the critically acclaimed N95 and the 5800, while we're sure the gratis Xbox 360 for upgraders hasn't hurt demand -- 50 percent of those looking to pick up the polycarbonate phone are already Orange customers. The carrier has told us that an Xbox-based offer for new customers looking to pick up the Nokia-coated Windows Phone is also in the pipeline -- something for UK network hoppers to get excited about.
