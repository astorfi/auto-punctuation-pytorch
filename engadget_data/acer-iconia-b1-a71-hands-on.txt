It's hardly a flagship tablet. Quite the opposite actually: it has a dual-core Mediatek processor, 512MB of RAM, 8GB of built-in storage, a 7-inch 1,024 x 600 display and a single 0.3-megapixel camera. Overall, the build quality and screen aren't nearly as nice as what you'll get on the Nexus 7. Still, for $150 it could be tempting for folks who think even $200 is a lot to spend on a tablet. We're told this won't go on sale in the US, so for all of our readers in the states this is nothing more than gadget tourism. For the rest of you, though, we've got hands-on photos and video below to help you decide if this is worth any further consideration.
