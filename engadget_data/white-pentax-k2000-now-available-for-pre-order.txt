Best of all, it's available for the decidedly non-premium price of $679.95, which is actually a bit less than we were expecting when it was first announced. You'll still have to wait until mid-February for it to actually ship, however, but that should at least give you enough time to get the rest of your gadgets Colorware'd to match. Hit up the link below to get your order in.
