The 32-inch VH3243, 37-inch VH3743 and 42-inch VH4243 all manage some SRS TruSurround XT surround sound, which does up virtual surround from any mult-channel source. The displays also feature "AMVA" (Advanced Multi-domain Vertical Alignment) technology, providing a 178 degree viewing angle and 1200:1 contrast ratio. No word on resolution, so we're going to assume 1,366 x 768 and hope for the best. We're also in the dark in regards to price and US availability, but we suppose that's par for the course.[Via AVING]
