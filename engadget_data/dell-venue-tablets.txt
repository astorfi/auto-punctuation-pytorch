Dell dropped a surprise here at the Intel Developer Forum when Neil Hand, VP of tablets and performance PCs, announced that it's reviving its Venue brand with a new line of Windows 8 tablets. The company last used the branding almost a year ago with the less-than-successful Venue and Venue Pro handsets -- the Venue ran Android while the Venue Pro used Windows Phone 7. Hand was on stage during today's IDF keynote showing off what appears to be an 8-inch slate running the latest Windows 8.1 firmware on Intel's recently announced Atom Z3000 processor. Not much else was unveiled about the hardware, but Hand did drop a hint that it plans to host a Venue-specific event on October 2nd in New York City that will hopefully reveal more information.
