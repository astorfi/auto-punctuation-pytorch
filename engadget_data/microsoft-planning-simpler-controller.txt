 Like many baby boomers, even Xbox chief Peter Moore is getting a little confused by all the buttons and joysticks being crammed onto modern gamepads, and some recent comments he made may indicate that Microsoft is actually working on ways to dumb-down the increasingly complex controller. In an interview with Gamertag radio, Moore seemingly put the "shoulder buttons, triggers, analog sticks, and d-pads" on today's controllers in a negative light compared to the "old Atari 2600 button-and-stick, which everybody could pick up and have some fun with." Even Moore's 14-year-old daughter reportedly finds the 360 controller somewhat confusing, with the man himself mentioning that Microsoft is "doing a lot of stuff there," but that they won't release a product that's not "intuitive and innovative." We're all for input devices being as intuitive as possible, but instead of wasting time trying to innovative, maybe Microsoft should just cave in and adopt a certain technology that's already proving to be pretty popular.
