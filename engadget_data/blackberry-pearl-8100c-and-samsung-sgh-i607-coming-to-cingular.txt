The specs on the quad-band Pearl look to be in place and has that tweaked appearance, and the i607 pictured retains the i600's front-facing camera, as well as quad-band GSM / GSRS / EDGE / HSDPA data, and Bluetooth; of course, we knew the Pearl was headed to Cingular, but the Blackjack will make a nice little addition to the cadre of Q-killers making their way to the states.P.S. -Oh, and the 8525 is listed as Q3, too. Big surprise.[Thanks, Jaybo]
