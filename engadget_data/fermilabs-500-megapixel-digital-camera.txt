It didn't take long for someone build a digital camera that could actually use the entire 12GB of storage space
available on Pretec's new $15,000 CompactFlash memory
card: Fermilab just built a digital camera with a resolution of 500 megapixels. But before you start saving your
pennies for one,Â  the Dark Energy Camera is a one-of-a-kind that is being attached to a telescope in Chile for use
in Fermilab's Dark Energy Survey project.
