The handset is now on sale at US Cellular for $79 with a two-year contract or $399 for those who aren't fond of the commitment. Packing the expected Galaxy S III Mini-reminiscent specs, the budget LTE smartphone runs Ice Cream Sandwich, packs a 4-inch WVGA display, a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor, 4GB of built-in storage that can be expanded with a microSD card of up to 32GB in size, a 5 megapixel camera on its rear and a 1.3 megapixel front-facing cam. With NFC baked in, the Galaxy Axiom joins the ranks of devices that have support for Google Wallet. To pick up a fresh Galaxy family device and not break the bank, hit the adjacent source link.
