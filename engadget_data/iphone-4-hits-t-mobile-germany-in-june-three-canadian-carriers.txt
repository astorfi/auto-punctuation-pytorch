Meanwhile, the English (and French) speaking world is still rolling out iPhone launch dates, as Canada's Rogers, Telus and Bell Mobility have all quietly announced the new superphone will be available "in the coming weeks" or "coming soon." Americans at Engadget HQ are supremely jealous of your choices, Canada... and rest assured that we feel Germany's pain, too.

Update: T-Mobile is also continuing its tradition of carrying the iPhone in the Netherlands, with another announcement that's light on specifics. [Thanks, Xylias]
