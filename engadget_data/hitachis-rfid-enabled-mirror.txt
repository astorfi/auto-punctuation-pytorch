So there's no shortage of mirror TVs out
there, but Hitachi's doing one on steroids, that's more of a computer display than a television-like device. It's half
mirror, half diffusion film and will display digital information on the surface via LCD projector. The technology,
dubbed Miragraphy, integrates sensors, RFID readers, barcode readers, and cameras so it can automagically respond to
people presence and act accordingly to personalize its digital content display based on their identities. This would
place the device squarely into the "cool, yet kinda creepy" category. Should be out in Japan (of course) on September
30.
