 Sony, godluv'em. Analysts have been noting formonths that Sony's hope to launch the PlayStation 3 console this Spring with that new Cell processor and Blu-raydisc is, well, just a bit too aggressive. Six to twelve months too aggressive according to that Merrill Lynch researchnote detailing the $900 $800 PlayStation 3 per unitmanufacturing cost. Yet despite Merill Lynch downgrading Sony to "sell" this morning, Sony remainsoptimistic once again stating that "there is no change in our original plan to release the console in spring2006." However, they do concede that they are waiting for the final specifications related to both the PS3'sBlu-ray drive and for input and output of video and sound. Yeah, Ok Sony. We're not gonna say told you so come June.No, really.[Thanks, YM]
