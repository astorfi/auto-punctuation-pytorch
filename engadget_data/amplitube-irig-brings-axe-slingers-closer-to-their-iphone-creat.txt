 
Oh sure, we've seen something similar from PRS, but the reviews on the Guitarbud were -- how do you say? -- less than stellar. For those looking high and low for a decent alternative, IK Multimedia has outed the equally seductive AmpliTube iRig, a software / hardware tandem that enables axe slingers to jack their guitar or bass into an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch and tweak their sound with a variety of amps and effects (up to 10 stomps, 5 amps, 5 cabinets and 2 microphones). The dongle also has a headphone jack for keeping your wailing to yourself (read: it's mom and neighbor approved), and if you're sporting a jailbroken device, you could also record your newest masterpiece while this hums along in the background. It's a beautiful thought, no? It's up for pre-order right now at $39.99, and you can peek a video of the solution in action just after the break.
