A hands-on review of the Archos AV500 has been
posted (in French) to the generationmp3 forum by Edrysark. Lots of pr0n and a few side-by-side shots with the iRiver
H320, Archos Gmini 402, and PSP. The author likes the "very luminous" 4-inch screen, industrial design, and finds the
ability to record broadcast television "simple" and even offers up a video made by the device for

download. On the flip side, the included headphones are a bit shabby and there are some problems with DivX playback
which he is confident Archos will sort out in future firmware releases. Bottom line: this is the best PMP available
until the author gets his hands on the Zen Vision. He's
probably right.
