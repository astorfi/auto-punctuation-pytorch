 When we think of BBC iPlayer use on mobile devices, we most often picture someone catching up on dramas with their smartphone during the commute home. Not anymore: newly available March stats from the Beeb reveal that tablet viewing has overtaken phone viewing for the first time. The difference is slight -- tablets are only 200,000 requests ahead, at 41 million -- but it's enough to suggest that many now prefer bigger screens when they're away from a computer or TV. While the broadcaster hasn't directly explained the change in demographics, it's not hard to see a possible explanation based on viewer habits. The BBC notes that most tablet-bound iPlayer users watch TV, and most iPlayer TV time overlaps that of traditional viewing, when audiences are more likely to be at home with the larger devices at hand. If you're one to curl up on the couch to watch Panorama on an iPad or Android slate, then, you may just be part of a growing trend.
