 
Well, it's a bit past May 2nd, but AT&T has now finally officially announced that it will be carrying the HP Veer -- or Veer 4G, as it prefers to call it. The diminutive smartphone will be available on May 15th in your choice of black or white for $99.99 on a two-year contract. That will buy you a 2.6-inch 320 x 400 display, an 800MHz Snapdragon processor, a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, a 5 megapixel camera, 8GB of internal storage and, of course, webOS 2.1 for an OS -- all in a package about the size of a credit card. As you might expect, however, that 4G addition does literally come with an asterisk -- the phone itself only has basic HSPA capabilities. Head on past the break for the complete press release.

Update: There's been some question as to whether this bantam device would support only basic HSPA or HSPA+, so we reached out to HP and AT&T for clarification. Both outfits were adamant that the Veer 4G's hardware would indeed support HSPA+ in areas that have upgraded cell towers. AT&T affirmed that "the Veer has HSDPA Cat 10, which is HSPA+," while Palm said, "the Veer supports HSDPA Cat 10 and HSUPA Cat 6. For reference, this is the same for the Motorola Atrix 4G and HTC Inspire 4G both currently available from AT&T." Of course, we all know that not all 4G is created equal, and it seems it's becoming increasingly clear that all HSPA+ isn't either as well.
