Launched yesterday, this new Zero Taxi initiative aims to attract customers with its zero emissions (from the car, the electricity used might still be produced in a polluting way) appeal, aromatic oil-scented cabin, and primarily female drivers who'll be trained to provide local area and tourist info. We're just reporting here, don't blame us for the Hinomaru Limousine Company's belief that a man can't be as good a tour guide as a woman. It's a humble beginning since the company's only deploying two i MiEVs for now, but local competitor Nihon Kotsu is also preparing to join the fray, and is currently testing out a Better Place battery-swapping station that should keep its cars where they need to be -- on the road.
