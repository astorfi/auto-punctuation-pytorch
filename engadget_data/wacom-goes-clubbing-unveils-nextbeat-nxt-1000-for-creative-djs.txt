It's called the nextbeat NXT-1000, a device with a plethora of knobs, buttons, and a small LCD for controlling samples, plus a touch-sensitive pad that seems to act as a turntable and a fingertip drum machine in one. That pad actually pops out, maintaining a wireless connection to the base and enabling fleet-footed DJs to show some moves off-stage while still dropping beats -- assuming their cans are wireless too. No word on cost at this point, but can you really put a price on that sort of musical freedom?
