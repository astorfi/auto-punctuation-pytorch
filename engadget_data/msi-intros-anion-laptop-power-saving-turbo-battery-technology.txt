 It looks like MSI has some big plans for CeBIT, if the company's latest news is any indication. The computer-maker is gearing up for two innovative new laptops, both of which are part of its ECOlution "green" line of systems. The first model will bizarrely feature a high concentration of anions -- negatively charged ions which the company believes will "enhance the body's condition, promote nervous stability and recovery from fatigue, and encourage circulation of halted blood." The second, less magical entry from MSI comes in the form of the GX600-08 laptop, which utilizes a new battery design intended to extend life up to 20% by engaging a "Turbo Battery Mode" which automatically adjusts the system's workload to conserve power. We'll undoubtedly be hearing more about these from CeBIT, so keep your eyes peeled.[Via Fareastgizmos]
