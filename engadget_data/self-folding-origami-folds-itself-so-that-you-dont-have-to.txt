A team of researchers have created "programmable matter" -- essentially origami that folds itself. Made from paper that's edged with programmable actuators which cause it to 'fold itself,' its creators hypothesize that it could be used to make things like cups that adjust to the amount of liquid they contain, but really, does something like this need to justify its existence? Check out the video below, and hit up the source for a full read of the research.
