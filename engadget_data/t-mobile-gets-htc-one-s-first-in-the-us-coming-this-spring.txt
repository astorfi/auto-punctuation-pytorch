  See HTC's new superstar handset the One S earlier during our MWC 2012 liveblog and want one for your very own? Well, we've got some good news for you T-Mobile aficionados, as the One S will be coming to the magenta-clad masses before anyone else. That means you'll be able to enjoy its super-slim profile, prodigious Snapdragon S4 computing power and ICS with Sense 4 on T-Mo's blazing HSPA+ 42Mbps network before your friends on Ma Bell, Big Red, or the Now Network. Unfortunately, we can't neither tell you exactly when you can get your hands on one, nor how much it'll cost to do so, but we do know it'll be on sale this spring.
