In similar fashion to the psion "netbook" debacle, the German entity of Qualcomm was just hit with a restraining order for its use of the term "smartbook" as followup to the smackdown issued on a German blogging site over the weekend. The preliminary injunction issued by a German court comes at the request of Germany-based Smartbook AG that claims it is being confronted with an "absurd" and "bold attack" on its brand name. The decision calls for a â‚¬250,000 fine in case of non-compliance with risk of arrest for contempt. Really Smartbook AG, arrest? We imagine a number of vendors are frantically scribbling out the term "smartbook" from its placards that will be on display at the big IFA show in Berlin later this week.
