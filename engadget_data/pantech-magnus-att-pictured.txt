Could it be that the OEM has finally earned the opportunity to add a higher-end device to the GSM giant's lineup? It may very well be the case with the P9090, aka the Magnus. Our source has hooked us up with the first images of the smartphone, which confirms an 8MP camera with LED flash, front-facing cam and at least Ice Cream Sandwich (if not Jelly Bean). While the image doesn't reveal any other specs, we're expecting to see a 720p display, LTE connectivity and a Qualcomm MSM8960 dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor. We're still not sure what to think about the bumpy design on its back, though it does remind us a little bit of what Verizon has done on the HTC Incredible series. The specs may be quite similar to the Vega Racer 2, though the phone itself doesn't look anywhere close to the manufacturer's Korean flagship. AT&T still hasn't announced the Magnus, but we'll let you know pricing and availability as soon as we have it.  [Thanks, Anonymous!]
