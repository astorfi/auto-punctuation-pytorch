  Google's Flight Search -- which was conjured up after its acquisition of ITA -- has been giving Kayak and Bing Travel a run for their respective dollars here in the States, but an airline search engine is only as good as its reach. This week, the company announced that over 500 airports outside of the US are now being included in the results (but, sadly, only if you start in the US), and while no specific promises were given, Google says that it's "working hard on expanding [its] global coverage and adding more routes in the future." Oh, and for those looking to disconnect in Samoa, APW totally made the cut here. Happy trails![Thanks, sciwiz]
