As you can probably guess, the Toughbook pictured above manages to pass the test easily, but there's also another surprise in store at the end -- head on past the break to see for yourself. Of course, Panasonic didn't let an opportunity for a bit of cross-promotion slip by -- it also shot the video on a Panasonic GH1.
