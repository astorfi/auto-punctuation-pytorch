With every generation the problems from the previous are resolved, but we somehow find new issues that were previously unnoticed. Last year they uncovered the bob versus weave when de-interlacing 1080i, and still many TVs throw away half the lines. This year the HD Guru discovers that there is a significant loss in resolution when there is motion -- you know like when the camera pans or a player runs down the field. What he discovered is very interesting, but not surprising; Plasmas fared the best with a loss of 18.52%, microdisplays were next at 27.78% and the LCDs were last at 44.45%. Unfortunately we'll have to wait to see how each individual model fared, but until then, it appears that Plasmas are still the king when it comes to picture quality.
