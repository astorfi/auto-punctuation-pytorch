Now they've dropped word of an inked deal with CBS that allows Slingbox customers to share short video clips with other Slingboxers as well as the public at-large. Using Clip+Sling, as the new technology is called, SlingBox owners can copy clips from their favorite CBS show or sporting event and post their "SlingClips" to an "interactive portal" which can be accessed by anyone. Interested? Then go ahead and apply for the public beta. Sorry, US only for now. Expect to see the software fully integrated into the desktop and mobile versions of the software by Q2.
