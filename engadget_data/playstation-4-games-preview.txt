As with any gaming console, good hardware only tells half of the story. Today, Sony announced a stable of games that'll play a large role in determining the early success of the PlayStation 4, which is set for availability this holiday season. Leading the charge will be biggies such as Killzone Shadow Fall, Bungie's next first-person shooter known as Destiny, Diablo III and a new installment of Final Fantasy. These games will be joined by creative efforts such as Knack, a game directed by the PlayStation 4's lead architect, Mark Cerny, Watch Dogs from Ubisoft, and Driveclub, which aims to bring team-based racing to new levels. PS4 owners can also expect exclusives such as InFamous: Second Son and The Witness. Rounding out the list -- for now, anyway -- is a game from Capcom with the working title of Deep Down, along with an unnamed entry from Media Molecule. While it's clear that Sony and the development community have a number of surprises that've yet to be revealed, you're invited to check out a preview of what's to come in the following gallery.
