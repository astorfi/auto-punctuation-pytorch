Yeah, weren't we just talking about office drones?
This new bit of "production management" technology in use by Japanese company Omron aims to squeeze every last morsel
of productivity from you peons. It makes use of video cameras, security systems and mandatory RFID tags carried by
employees to monitor everyone's whereabouts, analyze employee work performance, and eventually optimize employee
allocation to improve product quality (why don't they just replace everyone with robots so we can all go home,
already?). Yes, worker bees, all your brain cycles are belong to Omron. Every. Last. One.
