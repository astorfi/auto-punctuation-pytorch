	HTC has now launched itself into the clouds, confirming that its latest Android phones will get an extra 3GB of storage with Dropbox. According to Pocket-Lint, the extra space will extend to all HTC devices running Sense 3.5, which at the moment means it's limited to the forthcoming HTC Rhyme. We probably won't see the Dropbox deal extend to HTC's Windows Phones though -- Microsoft reckons it has the whole file-syncing thing covered.
