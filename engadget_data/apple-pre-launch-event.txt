Picture the line in front of an Apple Store before any new product hits the shelves, add in a few hundred cameras and sat trucks, and there you go. Weather-wise, the scene is a bit dreary outside the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in downtown San Francisco, but things are undoubtedly heating up inside the relatively petite venue, beyond those black velvet ropes and the white polo shirt-clad security team. The scene outside will be long forgotten less than an hour from now, so click through the gallery below before it fades to irrelevancy, then hit up our liveblog to catch all the action inside.
