The ultra-compact camcorder touts "on-board software to enable editing, organizing, and seamless video uploading to AOL, YouTube and other video sharing sites," and even includes a video output for watching captures on TV. The device includes a flip-out USB port for connecting to your PC, is already available in white, pink, black and orange motifs for $149.99 (1GB) or $179.99 (2GB), and reportedly holds "60 minutes of full VGA-quality video" on the latter.
