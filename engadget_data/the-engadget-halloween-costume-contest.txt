A handful of foolios totally showed all of us up last year with their fancy iPod costumes, so this Halloween we're
expecting Team Engadget to represent in our First Annual Engadget Halloween Costume Contest. We're not looking for the
scariest costume, we're looking for some super gadgety, teched-out costumes â€” we want to see people dressed up like
Treos, laptops, PSPs, whatever.


 Here are the prizes:




First place: A new 30GB iPod (with video)




Second place: An unlocked
  Motorola RAZR V3



Three runners-up will each win one of three Tokyo Flash watches




You'll get points for creativity, complexity, and, to a certain extent, obscurity (translation: we don't want to see
three dozen iPod nano costumes, though we wouldn't mind seeing a really amazing iPod nano costume).


 Official details:




You have until Tuesday, November 1st, 11:59pm EST to submit your entry




Send all entries to us at engadget@gmail.com




The contest is open to anyone anywhere




You have to be able to prove that it's your handiwork




You can enter multiple times, but you can only win a maximum of one prize
