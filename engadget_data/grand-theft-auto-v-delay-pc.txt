Bad news, highway high-jackers: Grand Theft Auto V on PC has been delayed for a second time. It's now due out on April 14, pushed back from a previous release date of March 24. The PC version's original release date was January 27, nearly a month ago. Rockstar, the developer of the Grand Theft Auto series, says it's sorry for the (extra) delay:



"Our apologies to PC gamers worldwide who have been counting down the days until the launch of the game, but a bit more time is needed to ensure that the game is as polished as possible, and to make certain that both Heists and the GTA Online experience are ready to roll out on day one for PC."




As compensation, Rockstar offers $200,000 in-game cash to anyone who pre-ordered the game on PC. That amount of dough can score players a medium-size house or 2,000 Stun Guns in Grand Theft Auto Online. Your choice.

At least Grand Theft Auto Online PC players won't have to wait to jump into "Heists," the game's highly anticipated four-player cooperative mission mode. Heists will launch same-day with the game's PC release, Rockstar promises. Otherwise, Heists mode is due out on March 10 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of Grand Theft Auto 5.
