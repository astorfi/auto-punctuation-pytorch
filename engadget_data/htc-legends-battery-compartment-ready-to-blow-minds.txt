A most unusual battery compartment, that's what. HTC's unibody follow-on to last year's Hero throws away the concept of a battery cover altogether, opting instead for an endcap that conceals slots for the SIM and microSD card along with the battery -- in other words, it slot-loads rather than dropping into place like almost every other phone you've used. Besides eliminating a big, ugly battery cover, the setup means that all three components can be changed independently; gone are the days of yanking the battery just to swap SIMs, for instance. It's not a totally unprecedented configuration (the Devour takes a similar path, for one), but with HTC's weight being thrown behind these slick designs now, we're excited to see where it could lead -- assuming signal strength still rules with that much aluminum in play.
