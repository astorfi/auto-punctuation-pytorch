"We wanted to focus on a single platform, and PS4 was clearly the best fit," Ancel said during the announcement, on Sony's stage at the PlayStation press conference. "Our concept is based on experiencing new situations every time you play."

Despite forming the new studio, Ubisoft says that Ancel remains a member of its Ubisoft Montpellier team. Someone has to remind them they announced a Beyond Good & Evil sequel from time to time, right?
