 Here at KIRF headquarters, we've seen our share of Apple product fakery. We remain, however, impressed at companies' abilities to knock off laptops in any decent manner. This white MacBook-looking fellow, made by LeThink, boasts a feature or two you'll probably never see on an actual Cupertino-born laptop, such as the option of two batteries. This bad boy boasts a tray loading DVD player, an NVIDIA Ion 2 graphics processor, a 1.66GHz Intel Atom D510 CPU, GMA 3150 graphics, 1GB of RAM built-in (with support for up to 2GB), an up to 320GB hard drive, two USB 2.0 ports, VGA and HDMI outputs, a LAN port, and an SD slot. They're available in China for starting prices of around 2,999 yuan -- that's about $440. Another shot is below.
