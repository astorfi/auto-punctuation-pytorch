Although clearly different from the first Panny AVCHD recorder we peeped last week, it shares much the same specs including 3CCDs capable of capturing video at 1080i to SD/SDHC cards. This fully functional prototype, however, brings a Leica DICOMAR lens with 12x optical zoom, image processing LSI, and HDMI out. No word on pricing or ship date but hey, flaunt 'em if you gotta 'em Panny. More snaps after the break.
