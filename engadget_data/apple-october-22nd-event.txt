The rumors, they are true. Apple's ready to take the wraps off of something big next week, just in time to seriously impact our collective holiday spending -- and just a little more than a month after that big iPhone event. In fact, the invite alludes to that recent event by noting that the company still has "a lot to cover." And just like the last invite, there's more than enough color here to go around, so take that as you will. As ever, there's no word on precisely what'll be announced, but rumor is that the iPad, iPad mini and MacBook Pro lines are set for refreshes. And the recent release of the OS X Gold Master hints at a bit more information on the desktop operating system side of things. Whatever the news may be, we'll be bringing it to you live at 10AM PT.
