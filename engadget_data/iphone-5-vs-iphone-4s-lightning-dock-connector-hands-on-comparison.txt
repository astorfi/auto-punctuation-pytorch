 We knew the iPhone 5 was thinner and lighter than the iPhone 4S, but seriously, it's thinner and lighter than the iPhone 4S. By a pretty notable margin. Picking up the iPhone 5 is almost jarring -- it's barely heavy enough to feel "premium," and it'll probably make you handle it with care for free of breaking it in half with too tight a tug. The new Dock Connector -- also known as Lightning -- is most certainly smaller, and looks most at home on the new iPod nano. Without further qualifying, have a look at the comparison gallery below.
