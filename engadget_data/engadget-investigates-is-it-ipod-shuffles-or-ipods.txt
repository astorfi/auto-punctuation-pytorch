It took us a few days of harrassing Apple's PR department, but we were finally able to answer one of the most
burning questions of the past seven days: Is it "iPod shuffles" or "iPods shuffle?" Here's a transcript of our
conversation:



US: Thanks for calling us back. We have a really important question for you. How do you pluralize
 "iPod shuffle?"




APPLE: Like in a sentence?




US: Yeah, like would you say "iPod shuffles" or "iPods shuffle?"




APPLE: Huh. "iPod shuffles." It's "iPod shuffles."




US: Are you sure? Would you mind double-checking, because people do say "attorneys general" and
 not "attorney generals." We don't want to offend William Safire and write the wrong thing.




APPLE: Let me ask someone here. [Puts us on hold for a minute.] Yeah, it's "iPod shuffles."




US: Thanks!
