PC Advisor, citing "a source familiar with Intel's plans," claims that a pair of PC makers will use the MBA processor. Not that this would be unexpected. The custom-built 1.6GHz and 1.8GHz Intel procs remember, are 60% smaller and consume less power than the typical Core 2 Duo while using the same 65-nm manufacturing processes. Of course, with Intel's 45-nm Montevina platform scheduled to ship as early as May, the advantages gained by the processor will likely be short lived, though glorious if a PC maker can dethrone Apple of its claim to the world's smallest thinnest laptop.
