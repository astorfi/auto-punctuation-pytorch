But Intel isn't chuckling, and maybe it's because the ad is a not so subtle slam on their last few decadesof existence, and a straight out dissing of all their current partners in the PC world. Intel didn't even know what wasgoing on with this ad, despite allowing it to be shot in their facilities, and saw it for the first time right beforethe keynote. Kind of reminds us of anotherlittle surprise that Apple dropped on a recent keynote partner: a little thing Stevie likes to call the iPod nano. At least Intel is putting on a good face about it;Intel VP Deborah Conrad says that "it's probably a good thing that we didn't see them earlier," but if SteveJobs starts wearing a baseball cap to the keynotes and flipping through slides about Q2 punking effectiveness, we'llknow something has gone horribly wrong.
