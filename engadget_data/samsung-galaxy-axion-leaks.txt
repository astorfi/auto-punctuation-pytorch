 The always-informative evleaks has done it yet again. This time out it's not a Lumia 920 or some revealing press shots of the PadFone 2, though -- instead, what we have here is what appears to be a variant of Samsung's recently announced Galaxy Mini. According to evleaks, this 4-inch handset will be officially known as the Galaxy Axiom (model SCH-R830), and could very well end up on US Cellular, bringing with it a WVGA display alongside a decent dual-core, 1.2GHz MSM8960 CPU, LTE and Ice Cream Sandwich. Naturally, take this with a grain of salt, but given the messenger's recent track record, it also wouldn't surprise us if we hear something more official in the days to come. In the meantime, however, it looks as if the picture above will have to suffice.
