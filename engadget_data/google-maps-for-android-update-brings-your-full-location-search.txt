 While Google Maps may have found itself on the outside looking in on the just-released iOS 6, it's got a fresh update for Android devices that makes sure any locations you've searched are right at your fingertips. Rolling out now in Google Play, it includes results from your search and directions history (whether on your phone or on a PC that you were logged in to) whenever you start a new search, and in the search or directions tab under My Places. The other tweak noted in the changelog is the ability to zoom with just one finger -- double tap the map then hold down your finger and slide. There's no word specifically on what's in store for Apple's hardware but the final line of the blog post mentions improving the Google Maps experience across all devices -- draw your own conclusions from that.
