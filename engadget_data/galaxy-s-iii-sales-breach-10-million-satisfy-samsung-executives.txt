According to Yonhap, Shin Jong-kyun, head of Samsung's information technology and mobile communication division, told reporters the firm has moved more than 10 million Samsung Galaxy S IIIs since its unveiling. Jong-kyun wasn't able to give specific numbers, but we know from history that the handset is outpacing its predecessor, which took five months to make eight digits in sales. As for the goal, Sammy previously pegged the 10 millionth unit for early July, noting that it was fighting component shortages along the way -- all in all, mid-month isn't too far off. Thinking of helping the firm bolster its numbers further? We've got a whole series of reviews you may want to take a look at.
