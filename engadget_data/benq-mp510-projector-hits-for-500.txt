Shortly after we saw one of its higher-end models drop late last month, we now get word of a new projector that costs 1/10th the price. The MP510 packs 1500 lumens, a 2000:1 contrast ratio, and an 800 x 600 resolution -- all for $500. To date, the only other projector that we've seen at this price is the Lumenlab 1000 projector, which does have better resolution, but an inferior lumen output and contrast ratio. The MP510 will do 480p, 576p, 720p and 1080i and has the usual assortment of analog inputs, including RGB, component and S-Video. Expect this inexpensive projector to come to a home theater or boardroom near you later this month.[Via AboutProjectors]
