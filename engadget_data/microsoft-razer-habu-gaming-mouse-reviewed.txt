 Microsoft sure raised expectations pretty high with the months of build-up for its Razer-co-designed Habu gaming mouse, but now that its been freed of the hype-machine we're finally starting to get an idea of how it stacks up to the competition. While Extreme Tech didn't exactly get off on the right foot with the mouse, with their first one turning up D.O.A., they eventually got one that worked and put it through the usual paces, mostly liking what they found, giving the mouse a hefty 9 out of 10. They especially dug the mouse's comfortable design, responsive buttons, and massive 2,000 DPI resolution, although they found that to be a bit too much for them, instead preferring the mouse's 1,600 DPI setting for gaming and going all the way back to 800 DPI for non-gaming tasks. The biggest downside, not surprisingly, is the price, coming in at a not insignificant $70. More than the average mouse to be sure, but not all that out of line compared to some of the other top-end gaming mice on the market, although we have to admit that "Habu" doesn't exactly elicit the same sort of menace as the DeathAdder.
