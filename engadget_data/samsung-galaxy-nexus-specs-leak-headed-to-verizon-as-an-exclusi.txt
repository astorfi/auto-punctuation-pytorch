  Ready for the latest scoop of Android Ice Cream Sandwich future? A report over on BGR details specs for the next pure Google phone we've come to know and love as the Nexus Prime. Quoting a "trusted source," the insider dish paints a familiar contoured picture of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy family member. The screen has been purportedly bumped to a 4.65-inch HD Super AMOLED display, and lurking just beneath its chassis should be a dual-core 1.2GHz TI OMAP 4460 processor. As for the rest, the supposed Verizon exclusive packs 1GB RAM, 32GB of storage, a 1,750mAh battery, 1.3 megapixel front-facing / 5 megapixel rear shooter capable of 1080p HD video, WiFi a/b/g/n, NFC and possible LTE / HSPA bands. So does this handset measure up to your (by now) impossibly high standards? We'll soon find out if any of this pre-release gossip holds its water when we're live at Unpacked next week.Update: A new batch of rumored specs have surfaced over on GSM Arena, and these seem to be more in line with what we'd expect of a new Nexus. According to an anonymous Google employee, that 4.65-inch Super AMOLED HD display mentioned above is just about the only spec to make the final cut. The processor, however, is more likely to be a dual-core 1.5GHz Exynos (that's right) with an accompanying dual-core PowerVR SGX543MP2 graphics chip. That rear facing camera? Try 8 megapixels with a newly beefed up sensor. The handset should also ship with a girthy 2,050mAh battery fully capable of juicing this apparent LTE / CDMA / GSM Android monster.
