QNX has become something of a staple for us here at CES, wowing us each time with new and more compelling auto gear packed inside the finest cars. This year's no different, as QNX has shown up with a flat blue Maserati Quattroporte GTS that has received a complete technological overhaul. What's most impressive to us is that the rearview and side mirrors have been completely gutted and replaced with cameras and displays as part of its ADAS (advance driver assistance systems) demonstration. Unlike typical car mirrors, the cameras on the QNX car are able to easily reposition when reversing, for example, offering you a safer view.





          
 
 
 Another standout safety feature is the increased coverage, which means the car's blind spot is all but eliminated. Also, the side mirrors feature a colored strip in the lower section that turns red from green when something is approaching on that side. Sitting down in the cockpit during our demo, QNX's Alex James was able to show us what we'd see if the car's mirrors were still in place and the difference was fairly dramatic. This idea seems like a natural progression for the automotive world -- we're curious to see if and how this eventually gets implemented.
