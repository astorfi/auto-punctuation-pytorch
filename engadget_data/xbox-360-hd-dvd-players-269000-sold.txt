If you'll recall, Microsoft managed to move 92,000 of these things last holiday season, and considering its perpetually lower price (comparatively speaking), it's been a fairly attractive option for Xbox 360 owners looking to get into the HD DVD game. According to new sales figures outed by NPD Group, over one-third of the HD DVD standalone player market is made up of the aforementioned units, and the attach rate to the 360 install base sits at 3.4-percent. 'Course, if the price of this thing keeps a-droppin', we could easily see that percentage climb higher once the dust settles from the end-of-year buying frenzy.[Via High-Def Digest]
