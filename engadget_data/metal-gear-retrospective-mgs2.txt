       It's time for the next part of GameTrailer's Metal Gear retrospective; this time we're going back in time to Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, the Substance re-release, and The Documents of Metal Gear Solid 2. Ah, the fond memories. Remember feeling completely thrown off guard when you found out about playing as Raiden for the majority of the story? Or how about all those memorable scenes ... "You're a man?!", Vamp shot in the head, and Colonel Campbell's codec calls in Arsenal Gear? Good times, good times. All you MGS fans, make sure you watch this retrospective -- this is the one to watch to prepare for MGS4.[Thanks Kaylin B.!]
