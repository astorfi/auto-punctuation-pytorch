Just how much will the genre defining "Tunebuckle" set you back? $50 smackers, and it comesequipped with either a white or black to belt to match, or compliment, your iPod nano's shade. We're not even going tocall these guys out on their "Waist Management" tagline because in the Second AgeTM there will beno player haters.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
