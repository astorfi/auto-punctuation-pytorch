Synaptics wants to fill the gap for those portables (and suitably-equipped desktops) with its Scrybe software. It augments Windows' existing touch functionality to add context-specific gestures and motions, and while jog-dial control for media has us most excited, you'll also be able to edit photos, look up word definitions, and plenty more -- even if you don't have a 10-finger capable device. The plan is for the company to make partnerships with various manufacturers so that this software becomes standard issue stuff, but you can get a taste of it today thanks to a roughly 10MB beta preview downloadable now at the read link. Do let us know what you think.
