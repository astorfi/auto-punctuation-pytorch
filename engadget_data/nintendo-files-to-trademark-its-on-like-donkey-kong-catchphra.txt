That's right, the company that brought you Donkey Kong now wants to claim ownership of the popular catchphrase "it's on like Donkey Kong." Apparently seeking the mark in advance of its release of Donkey Kong Country Returns, Nintendo is seeking to lay claim to the popular phrase which is loosely used by the kids these days to say they're ready to kick a little behind. Suggestions for a new, less corporate catchphrase are welcome in comments. The full press release is after the break.
