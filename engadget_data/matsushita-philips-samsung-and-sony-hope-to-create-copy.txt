The LA Times is reporting that Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. (who we all know and love as Panasonic), Royal
Philips Electronics, Samsung Electronics Co. and Sony Corp. are forming a joint effort to develop a standard way for
eletronic devices to share copy-protected content (where have we heard this before?). Most of the core technology will
come from rights-management software developer Intertrust Technologies, who is also a member of the consortium. 
But they're going to have their work cut out for them as Microsoft has also set out to establish their own copy
protection standards.
