It's been just over a week since we roamed the halls of the Makuhari Messe in Japan for the Tokyo Game Show, and we're already back to take a broader look at tech coming from Japan, from the Sonys and the Panasonics down to the Companies You've Never Of. There's going to be a particular focus on car makers this year, with both Nissan and Toyota promising us some interesting new things and you be able to find everything we discover at our dedicated CEATEC 2013 page.
