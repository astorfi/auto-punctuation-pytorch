The world-ready variant of RIM's BlackBerry 8800 series -- sporting both CDMA / EV-DO and GSM radios -- saw a recent launch on Verizon, and seeing how these two carriers like (need?) to one-up each other, a July launch makes perfect sense. Looks like the device is pretty much the same as Verizon's variant (Sprint even says right in the slide that price and plans will be "competitive with VZW") though the carrier is touting that its global roaming service will be more user-friendly than Verizon's, offering a single phone number with unified calling and texting.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
