Just over two weeks ago, the old Apple released its latest build, and now iOS 5 beta 5 is ready for devs to download. We've yet to get the dirt on what this version will bring, but we're downloading it now, and will let you know if any juicy bits float to the top. If you've already got it going, let us know what you see in the comments below.

Update: Strangely, the beta 5 release notes mention the possibility of multiple iCloud accounts, but we're not entirely certain how that will work, or whether or not it will make it to the final release.
