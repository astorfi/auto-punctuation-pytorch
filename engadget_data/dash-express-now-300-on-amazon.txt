 If you were looking to snag a Dash Express, perhaps saving a Benjamin could be the excuse you're looking for. We don't know if it's because these things aren't selling well or if there was just some kind of pricing error, but the Dash Express -- was originally set to debut at $600, but then dropped to $400 at release -- is now on Amazon for $300. (And yes, it's still going for $400 on Dash's own site.)[Via Gear Diary]
