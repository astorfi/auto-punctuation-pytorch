Lucky for the kids, VTech is stepping a bit outside its normal educational role with some more entertainment-oriented gadgetry. Most notable is the $100 VTech Gadget, a phone-like device which includes a digital camera, movie maker, MP3 player, FM radio, games and a TV plug. The big seller is voice and text messaging up to two miles away, and VTech was kind enough to include 256MB of memory to store all that media you child will be messing around with. VTech's other media unit is the $60 Kidizoom Camera (pictured above), which cops that two-eye design from Fisher-Price and can shoot digital photos and videos, with computer and TV hookups for playback and editing. But if you're set on your kids actually learning stuff, VTech still has you covered with its Whiz Kid Learning System, which purveys interactive reading and learning via its portable "Whiz Pad" and touch-sensitive stylus. VTech is also upgrading its V.Smile edutainment system, which includes a sing-along microphone and writing joystick for an odd sort of educational video game platform. What a freaking brilliant time to be a kid.
