That doesn't sound like good news, but it's fewer than it lost in the year or quarter preceding, and may push back some of the talk of the trend of "cord-cutting" as the remaining subscribers continue to opt for bundled services with high speed internet and phone contributing to rising profits. We'll check back next quarter see if its Xfinity offerings are enough to keep more customers hanging around, or if the cable-cutter rhetoric comes back stronger than ever.
