        In an apparent effort to make good on its claim of having WiMAX rolling in Baltimore this month, Sprint is reportedly going live with the service in the downtown area today. There's no indication of when it'll spread XOHM throughout Charm City, but we're hearing that prices will start at $10 for a 24-hour unlimited pass and $35 for monthly service. Best of all, there won't be any contracts necessarily attached, and WiMAX-friendly laptop cards will supposedly start at around $45. For any locals able to actually find one of these so-called aircards and hop on this elusive XOHM network today, be sure and let us know how it goes.[Via USAToday]
