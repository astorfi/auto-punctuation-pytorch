Ringing up a fair bit cheaper and boasting a few less niceties, this plasma still managed to net a Very Good rating from the critics at CNET. Overall, the unit was said to be relatively inexpensive for what you get, and it managed to deliver deep blacks, a satisfactory port selection and a classic, attractive design. On the downside, the color accuracy seemed to be off, and the built-in noise reduction was fairly ineffective. Still, the unit was dubbed "a standout among HDTVs for the entry-level crowd," and so long as you don't go in expecting a Kuro, you're likely to walk away quite satisfied.
