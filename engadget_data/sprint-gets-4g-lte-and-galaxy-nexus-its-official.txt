	In the midst of a rival's developer conference, Sprint's snuck out an official page for its (already leaked) 4G network. Anyone living in Dallas, Atlanta, Houston and San Antonio can expect to see 4G coverage pop up alongside "improved 3G coverage." The first device to land will be an LTE-flavored Galaxy Nexus, and according to the official page, Google Wallet is coming along for the ride. The illusive LG Viper is also apparently riding those 4G waves, alongside a new router that'll connect to 3G and LTE signals.
