 And to think -- that $2.3 billion figure might have been a few million higher if not for the absurd Golden Parachute that Mark Hurd will continue to float on for centuries to come. All jesting aside, HP published its Q3 2010 financials today, reporting a healthy $2.3b in operating profit (not to be confused with net income, which deducts those massive corporate taxes) and a five percent increase year-over-year. All told, third quarter revenue was listed at $30.7 billion (an 11.4 percent uptick from last year), with a "record" amount of services signings. Interestingly, a whopping 63 percent of total HP revenue came from outside of America, though we're struggling to find any specific mentions of Hurd or Palm in the release (embedded after the break). We'll be checking in on the press call shortly -- we'll let you know if anything crazy goes down.
