Dubbed the Wind U90, this one is apparently identical to the now-familiar 10-inch model in every respect except for the screen (no word on the resolution) which, as you can see above, is accommodated by an extra-wide bezel instead of an all around smaller laptop. No word on a price, but you can look for this one to launch alongside or slightly after the 10-inch U100 model "towards the end of June."[Thanks, Ax]
