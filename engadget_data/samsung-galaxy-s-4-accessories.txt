Don't ask the Galaxy S 4 -- it's already planning to augment its software tricks with scales, fitness bands and of course, the requisite screen cover. Samsung's latest flagship won't settle for a mere flip cover, however, its S View Cover features a window to the Galaxy S 4's 5-inch Super AMOLED screen, allowing users to peek at the display and even answer calls without exposing their device. There's goodies for the health conscious to buy, too: the jawbone-like S band and a Samsung branded body scale, both of which sync with the device's S Health software. The device even has gamers covered, teasing a prototype gamepad with striking resemblance to the beloved Xbox 360 gamepad. Sammy didn't mention when these accessories would hit the market (or at what price), but we'll keep our ear to the ground for future details.
