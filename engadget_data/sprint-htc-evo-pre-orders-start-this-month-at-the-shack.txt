That situation looks set to change soon based on the pic above nabbed off The Shack's internal website showing a big "coming soon" exclamation that translates to pre-orders starting "later this month." Remember, in addition to Android 2.1, an 8 megapixel camera, and 4.3-inch 480 x 800 display backed by fierce Snapdragon silicon, the Evo also comes packing WiMAX with built-in hotspot capability. We're still not sure if Sprint will charge for that or make it a freebie a la Verizon's Palm Pre and Pixi offering, but we can hope.
