 If you thought it was hard to keep track of the network players in the US, check out the roster in Australia. Seven Networks has been representing for TiVo for less than a year, but is now getting competition from Channels Nine and Ten. New markets don't just develop overnight, so the competition coming in the form of FreeView is no small thing. No knock on TiVo, which gets lots of love here in the US, but FreeView has a wide range of OEM and broadcaster support. And that broadcaster support may push things in FreeView's favor, forcing Seven to abandon plans to make TiVo a centerpiece of an Australian TV platform. Sad to think that the TiVo bleeps and bloops down under could go silent, eh?
