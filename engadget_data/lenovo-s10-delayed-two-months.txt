Given the standardized nature of the Atom-based internals and this little guy's recent appearances in the wild and at the FCC, we'd venture that this has more to do with stock issues than with design problems, so hopefully things will get sorted a lot quicker than two months -- although apparently even Lenovo didn't know what parts it was putting in this thing, so who knows what's going on. Anyone else have an order pushed back -- or better yet, shipped out? Let us know in comments![Via jkOnTheRun]
