Essentially, it's the 610 with ATI's 3D tech shoehorned inside. Otherwise, it looks the same, with a 23-inch, 1080p panel and that sliding display that reclines at a nearly flat 60-degree angle. In addition to the 3D screen (best viewed when positioned upright), it has a webcam that captures 3D stills and video. At the base level, you'll get a pair of active shutter glasses, TV tuner, a Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 1.5TB HDD and an AMD Radeon HD 6650 card with 1GB of video memory. (For whatever reason, HP didn't add HDMI-in this go 'round.) That starting configuration technically costs $1,900, but HP's going to apply $300 in instant savings when it goes on sale November 15, so for all intents and purposes it starts at $1,600. Full PR after the break, and if you need a refresher on what this thing looks like, we suggest you revisit our review of the 610.
