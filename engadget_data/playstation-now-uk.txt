It's been an awfully long wait, but finally Sony is prepared to launch its video game streaming service outside of North America. A private beta for PlayStation Now is headed to the UK, and curious gamers can register their interest right now. To gain access later this Spring, you'll need to own both a PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Plus membership. Otherwise, the selection criteria is rather ambiguous -- you'll just have to fill out the survey and hope your responses chime with the ideal player base Sony is looking for.



A range of PlayStation 3 titles will be available in the private beta, including The Last of Us, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and God of War Ascension. Access for beta testers will be free of charge, and Sony is recommending a connection speed of 5mbps or higher. PlayStation Now hasn't had the biggest impact in the US, and it's unclear if that'll change in the UK. Pricing has been a major hang-up, so it'll be interesting to see how Sony approaches both rentals and its Netflix-style subscription model in Britain.
