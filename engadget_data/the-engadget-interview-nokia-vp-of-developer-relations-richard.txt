Obviously, there's bit of a chicken and egg situation when it comes to attracting software talent to Windows Phone. Developers favor platforms with an established community, and users prefer an ecosystem with a broad selection of apps. We talked about what Nokia announced at the show -- including apps like City Lens -- and how the company is helping developers with its Business Development Kit (BDK) and App Highlights showcase. Want all the details? Just take a look at our video interview.
