Thought the Surface RT's $150 price drop was enticing? Hold on to your wallet: Microsoft's at it again. Over the weekend, Redmond quietly took $100 off of both its 64 and 128GB Surface Pro slates, bringing their base prices to $799 and $899, respectively. According to the fine print, the discount will hold until August 29th, but we wouldn't be surprised to the sale drag on if it moves units.


"We've been seeing great worldwide success with Surface RT pricing and keyboard-cover promotions over the past several months and our proud to offer Surface Pro at more affordable prices starting today," a Microsoft spokesperson told Engadget. "People who buy Surface love Surface, and we're eager for more people to their hands on Surface and share their excitement." It's not a staggering price reduction, but it's certainly enough to make buyers on the fence raise an eyebrow.
