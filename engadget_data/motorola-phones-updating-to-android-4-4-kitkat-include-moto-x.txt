Now that Google's latest mobile OS is officially rolling out, the folks over at Motorola are letting end users know which phones will see Android 4.4 KitKat, and which ones won't. As AndroidCentral points out, digging through the upgrade tool reveals pretty much what you'd expect: all Moto X variants are on the list, as well as the company's recent Droid Mini, Ultra and Maxx devices. Statuses for the Droid Razr HD, Razr Maxx HD and Razr M are left fuzzily tagged "future plan coming soon" while the Droid Bionic, Razr Maxx and Droid 4 are all confirmed staying on Android 4.1.2. VP of Product Management Punit Soni posts on Google+ that Motorola will keep updating the website as plans get more detailed (and hopefully get release dates, or at least windows).
