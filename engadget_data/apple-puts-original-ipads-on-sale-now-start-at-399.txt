Well, even though you can't get an iPad 2 until March 11th (nor can you even pre-order it yet), Apple is already putting the original models on sale. Right now you can grab up that base model, 16GB WiFi only iPad for $399, with prices ranging up to $729 for the 64GB 3G model. Moreover, you can also snatch a refurbished one for a starting price of $349. If you're in the market for yesterday's model, now is certainly the time to grab one.
