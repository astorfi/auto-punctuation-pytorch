 
 Amazon has rolled out its Cloud Player to Apple's smaller screens, with both the iPhone and iPod able to play the full catalogue of music stored in your Cloud Drive. This time, it's a dedicated app, although it may mean re-purposing the music library you've already built up from Apple's own collection. You can't buy tracks from within the app just yet, but at least your iTunes-bought AAC tracks are transferable. There's unlimited storage available for anyone willing to pay up for a storage plans and for those less willing to pay, Amazon's willing to offer up 5GB of storage gratis. Hit up the source to download, then upload, then listen.
