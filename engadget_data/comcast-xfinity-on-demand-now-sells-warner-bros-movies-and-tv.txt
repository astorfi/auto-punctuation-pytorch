Comcast's Xfinity TV Store only started offering movies for purchase late last year, but it's catching up today by stocking Warner Bros. movies and TV shows prior to their release on DVD or Blu-ray. Now, like the rival stores from Amazon and Apple, it has a wider selection of movies like Gravity for purchase or rental well before the flicks hit kiosks, mailboxes, and subscription streaming. Comcast is counting on ubiquity to lure people away from competitors -- you can watch any of the new content through your TV set-top box, PC or mobile device. The Warner Bros. deal isn't likely to have you giving up your preferred video store, but it certainly doesn't hurt to have another choice.
