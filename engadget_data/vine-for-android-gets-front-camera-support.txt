Twitter is certainly making up for lost time on Android -- just a few days after it upgraded Vine to address some early omissions, it's back with another round of improvements for the Google-inclined. The just-posted Vine 1.2 update for Android brings front camera access for those inevitable selfie videos. It also brings an upload manager for backlogged clips, settings tweaks and a fresh wave of performance boosts. The new version may not lure back Android users who've switched allegiance to Instagram, but those who still prefer Twitter's approach can grab Vine 1.2 at Google Play.
