We don't follow the FPS gear scene all that closely (if you couldn't tell—well,
maybe a little), but when Sim Wong Hoo
announced the
X-Fi a couple weeks ago with a small cloud of hullabaloo,
our ears definitely perked up. So how is the X-Fi Fatal1ty? Well, besides being one of the first ever sound cards that
requires external power, audio quality on the device is apparently noticeably better than the Audigy 1 or 2, while also
relieving some CPU usage in system audio processing. Sounds like a win-win if you ask us—so now we're just supposed to
wait for the Creative takeover of the consumer PC audio world, right? Wait, what do you mean they're already to the
gold standard?
