 Placeshifting just seems to make so much more sense when you can shift to your handset. Sling recognized that last year (though its Symbian support is still a no-show unless you're on 3) and now Monsoon's hopping on the mobile video bandwagon, adding Windows Mobile support to its HAVA line of placeshifters. No word on exactly when it'll be coming out of beta, but when it does, HAVA owners will have compatibility with Pocket PC phones, Smartphones, and even classic Pocket PCs (via WiFi, naturally) to get their TV fix on the go. If they make it free, it's a strong marketing point over Sling's now-commercialized offering (hint, hint, Monsoon).[Via PhysOrg.com]
