A leaked screenshot of Big Red's internal system, brought to us by Droid Life, indicates that this very well may be the case, as a new device called the HTC Fireball (ADR6410L) just popped up. Aside from its inclusion of the next-gen data speeds, nothing else is known about the gadget; heck, we don't even know for sure if it's going to have the same name (we're half-expecting it to be renamed as something Beats-related). Regardless of its name, if the screenshot above is accurate, we may soon have another quietly brilliant device hanging out next to the Rezound.
