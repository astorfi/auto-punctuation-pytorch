Aptly named Early Future, the creation is being produced as a limited edition and unveiled at the Light&Building Fair in Frankfurt, Germany this week. Each OLED tile measures in at 132- x 33-millimeters, but we're not told exactly how energy efficient this desktop illuminator is (nor where to find one). Leap on past the break for a closeup of the tiles.[Via OLED-Info, thanks Ron]
