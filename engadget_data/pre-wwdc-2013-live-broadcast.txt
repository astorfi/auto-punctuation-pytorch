Apple's 2013 edition of its notorious Worldwide Developers Conference is soon to be underway. But, while we wait for Tim Cook & Co. to hit the stage, who better than our own Tim Stevens and Darren Murph to strike up a conversation about what the Cupertino-based company may have in store for us. All signs point to a seventh major revision of iOS, but will we also see the fabled iWatch? How about the long-rumored iRadio music service? The clock's ticking, so join us after the break as we'll be broadcasting live from outside Moscone West, in beautiful San Francisco.
