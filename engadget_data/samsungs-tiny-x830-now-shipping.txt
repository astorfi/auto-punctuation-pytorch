The curious lil' spinner gets by with just two columns on its keypad (a rather low number, we reckon), brazenly sacrificing usability for fashion and the cool factor. Then again, for a phone of this shape and size, we could be going completely keypadless -- so we'll stop our bellyaching right here. Look for the "Flick & Swing" X830 to drop in a rainbow of six colors when it shows up in your friendly local importer's inventory.
