The 17-inch unit comes with a 1,920 x 1,080 display, a choice of GeForce GTX 680M or Radeon 7970M and an Intel Core i7-3910XM, which the company's engineers reckon can be stably overclocked to a whopping 4.5GHz. It's got the usual raft of features you'd expect in a high end unit, including support for 32GB RAM, USB 3.0, eSATA, Blu-Ray and a backlit keyboard you can tweak to your needs. The base model will be out at the end of September, setting you back $1,753, while a signature edition with a custom paint-job will come later, and cost you more.
