Nevertheless, the widely quoted Taiwanese-tattle rag says that projected iPhone shipments have been reduced from 2 million units to "around 1 - 1.2 million" for the current quarter ending March 2008. This according to Economic Daily News (EDN) sources at component suppliers. Nevertheless, Apple's own CFO and COO team said on Tuesday that Apple "remains very confident" that they will ship 10 million handsets by the end of 2008 as originally stated -- even while projecting a very low (even for Apple) EPS for the March quarter. So who ya going to believe?
