No confirmation yet, but rumors are circulating that Kenwood may be getting out of the home audio business.
AudioVideo Revolution reports that the company recently axed the head of its U.S. home audio division. The company is
expected to retain its automotive business, where it has a much larger market share. AVRev speculates that Kenwood
might sell the name to a third party that can take advantage of its brand equity and relaunch the home audio line. So,
if Kenwood's high-end home-theater gear disappears, and is replaced by something that looks more like a Sorny or
Magnetbox product, you'll know why.
