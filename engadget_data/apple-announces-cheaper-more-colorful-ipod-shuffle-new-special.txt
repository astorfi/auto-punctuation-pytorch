Now starting at just $59 for a 2GB model and $79 for a 4GB, the shuffle is also available in your choice of pink, green, or blue in addition the usual silver or black, as well as in a new, all stainless steel 4GB Special Edition for a premium price of $99 (which also just so happens to be an Apple Store exclusive). Not much else new, as you might expect, but Apple is also promising that more iPod shuffle-friendly headphones will soon be available, in case that's the one thing that's been keeping you and the voice apart all this time.
