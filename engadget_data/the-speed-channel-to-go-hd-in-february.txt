       One of the most technologically advanced sports is soon going to have an HD channel to match, as The Speed Channel is gearing up for HD. The week leading up to the Daytona 500 next year will be a week of speed and for the first time ever, the Speed Channel will cover the entire week in HD. As much as they'd like to produce all their programming in HD, as we know all too well it's almost impossible, especially with auto racing which uses as many camera as any sport and twice the fiber. They're not stopping with live events either, as Speed has already upgraded production of a few of their shows to HD, so they'll have some ready in time for February.
