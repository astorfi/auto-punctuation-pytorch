Word was, they'd rake in a sizable $150,000 on the high-end, but it appears even Sotheby's underestimated the power of paperwork. The three sheets of dead tree in question, signed by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne (Apple's often forgotten third founder) fetched a whopping $1.6 million today. The documents originally belonged to Mr. Wayne, who reportedly received just $2,300 after relinquishing his stocks and agreeing to forfeit claims against the big Apple. According to Bloomberg, Sotheby's identified the winning bidder as Eduardo Cisneros, CEO of the Cisneros Corp.
