The company has now responded to the country's federal court, offering to contact -- by email -- everyone who bought the retina-screened slab and promise a refund if they felt misled over its connectivity capabilities. Apple will also amend its point of sale details to explain that while it can connect to 4G (LTE) networks in the US and Canada, it won't connect to Australia's own next-generation network offered by Telstra. Apple also thinks that the existence of HPSA capability -- and its nebulous definition as either a third-generation or fourth generation network -- in the Land Down Under meant it could still hold onto those 4G credentials.
