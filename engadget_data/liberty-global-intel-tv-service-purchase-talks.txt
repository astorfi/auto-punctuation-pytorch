Word broke last month that Intel was in talks with Verizon to sell off its stalled web TV effort, presumably dubbed OnCue, which was slated to get off the ground this year. Now, Bloomberg's gotten word from a trio of sources that Intel is chatting with at least one more interested party: telecom titan Liberty Global, which purchased Virgin Media last spring. According to one of the outlet's well-informed contacts, the firm has designs to use the online television service outside of the US. Despite the cable outfit's interest in the chip giant's pet TV project, Bloomberg's informants say that the negotiations could fizzle out. Regardless, with interested buyers beginning to line up, a deal might not be far off.
