That's all we know right now -- Dell reps called those earlier specs we'd heard "pretty much rumor and speculation" -- but we'll go out on a limb and say we wouldn't expect anything less than an 8.9-inch screen and 1.6GHz Atom in there. Sorry if we killed the surprise, guys -- but remember, you can still wow us with the price tag.[Thanks, AC]
