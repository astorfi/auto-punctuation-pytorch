We're not sure what the handler's impressions are of the, as yet, unannounced device (but if you speak Thai, please, feel free to enlighten us in the comments). It seems that 1.2GHz Snapdragon delivers some snappy performance, at least. It's tough to tell, thanks to predictably out of focus camera work, but it also appears that the Torch 9860 (we're sticking with that for now) is using Comic Sans. We hope that's not by default. Vid's after the break, per usual.

Update: A reader pointed us to another video (after the break) of the Torch 9860 in action. Nothing new to reveal, but the quality is much better -- and not a trace of Comic Sans in sight!
