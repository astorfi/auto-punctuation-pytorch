AT&T has just confirmed that a duo of HSPA + / LTE WWAN devices will be shipping within the next few months, with the USBConnect Momentum 4G offering plug-and-play access to both high-speed networks and the Mobile Hotspot Elevate 4G acting as a liaison for up to five nearby WiFi devices. The former is nothing more than a rebranded Sierra Wireless AirCard 313U -- the same oversized (and we mean oversized) device that launched on Rogers' own LTE network just days ago in Canada. Aside from being large enough to double as a cricket bat, the dongle features a microSD card slot, works with Mac and PC platforms and supports roaming in over 200 nations -- not that you'll be silly enough to actually take advantage, though. Moreover, those using the card will get gratis access to AT&T's growing WiFi network if using a post-paid data plan.

Moving on, the carrier's first 4G LTE mobile hotspot device (yeah, that'd be the AT&T Mobile Hotspot Elevate 4G) will include a 1.77-inch display for showing just how few megabytes you have left on your plan, support for five simultaneous connections and the ability to seamlessly hop between HSPA+ and LTE. AT&T will begin selling the AT&T USBConnect Momentum 4G for $49.99 with two-year contract after a $50 mail-in-rebate, while the Mobile Hotspot Elevate 4G will be available for $69.99 with a similar deal. The company's not going any further than stating a "summer" ship date, and despite our pleading, we can't get anything more solid out of 'em. Naturally, it'll be folks in Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Atlanta and San Antonio enjoying the LTE spoils first, with ten more cities to be blessed by the end of the year. Too bad it's still not saying what kind of scratch will be required on a month-to-month basis.

Quotes 		"AT&T recognizes that customers want a consistent, responsive network performance from major cities to their neighborhood. Our deployment of 4G LTE technology backed by our nationwide HSPA+ network allows us to give customers a superior mobile broadband experience today and for years to come," said Jeff Bradley, senior vice president, Devices, AT&T Mobility and Consumer Markets. "As we begin to roll out our 4G LTE network this year, AT&T customers will be able to choose from several new LTE devices, starting with the AT&T USBConnect Momentum 4G and AT&T Mobile Hotspot Elevate 4G." 		Price and Availability 		AT&T will begin selling the AT&T USBConnect Momentum 4G in black and silver for $49.99 with two-year contract after a $50 mail-in-rebate. The AT&T Mobile Hotspot Elevate 4G will be available in black for $69.99 with 2-year contract and after a $50 mail-in rebate. AT&T expects both devices will be available this summer online and in company-owned retail stores. 		LTE Roadmap 		AT&T recently announced plans to roll out its 4G LTE network in five markets – Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio – later this summer. Customers with compatible devices and 4G LTE coverage in those markets will be able to enjoy access to 4G LTE speeds as AT&T's 4G LTE network is turned up. 		As AT&T rolls out 4G LTE, customers outside of its 4G LTE footprint will have access to AT&T's HSPA+ network. When combined with enhanced backhaul, HSPA+ enables 4G speeds that are up to four times faster than AT&T's already fast mobile broadband speeds. Because AT&T has taken the extra step of deploying HSPA+ technology with enhanced backhaul, its customers will have access to consistently fast mobile broadband speeds when moving out of 4G LTE areas. 		By the end of 2011, AT&T plans to offer 4G LTE to customers in at least 15 markets, covering 70 million Americans. In addition, the company plans to add 20 4G devices to its portfolio this year, with some of those being LTE compatible.
