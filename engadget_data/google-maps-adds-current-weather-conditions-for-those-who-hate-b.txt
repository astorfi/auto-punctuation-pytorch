The feature is live now on the site, accessible by clicking the weather layer on the upper right hand corner of a map. Selecting the feature will overlay conditions culled from Weather.com, anywhere in the world. The results include the temperature and icons for the sun, rain, clouds and the moon, when that part of the world goes dark. Also new is cloud coverage from the US Naval Research Lab. Video of new feature after the break for those who like pi√±a coladas but can't stand getting caught in the rain.
