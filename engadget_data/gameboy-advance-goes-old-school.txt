It's not exactly news anymore that the Eighties are in again, andÂ Nintendo, who were the console kings back
then, are taking advantage of the nostalgia for all things Reagan-era and releasing an NES-styled Special Edition
GameBoy Advance SP. The special edition starts with a plain old silver GBA SP, but they've swapped the A and B buttons
out for red ones and slapped on a black decal with grey stripes to make the GBA look much like the original NES
controller.


 Even if you don't like the looks of retro controllers, everyone loves retro games. As part of this retro celebration,
Nintendo are also releasing eight classic NES games as GBA carts. There are some arcade classics like Donkey Kong and
Pac-Man as well as some serious NES old school favorites like Legend of Zelda, Bomberman and the original Super Mario
Bros.
