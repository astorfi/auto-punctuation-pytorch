You know how logoprint has kind of come and gone (thank god) and now all the me-too marketers are getting up on what
we already look back upon as being kitschy? Well done, Disney, with your Dmobo M900 Disneyphone, featuring no less than
80,000 Micky Mouse heads, themed buttons, interfaces, and a Dmobo certificate of authenticity. Coming soon to a Hong
Kong retailer near you. Scratch thatâ€”certificate of authenticity? They're just begging the gray market retailers to
make that "coming soon Chinatown ghetto knockoff phone vendor near you."
