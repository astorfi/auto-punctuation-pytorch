       Ok, another iPhone rumor -- you want to be looped in, don't you? If not then just wait, there'll be another post along shortly. Anywho, supposedly according to a CNBC "On the Money" report, an AT&T store told them Apple's cellphone would launch on June 20th. Which is hilarious because if you call 10 different cellphone stores you're bound to get ten different answers regarding the launches of upcoming products -- especially the hottest phones. Why? Mostly just because those clerks read the rumors online just like you. Surely enough, the AP apparently called a bunch of AT&T stores and got launch dates franging from June 11 to June 22, but nothing certain from Apple or AT&T corporate. Still, makes for some amusing Friday reading, dunnit?[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]Read - MacRumors reportsRead - AP follows up
