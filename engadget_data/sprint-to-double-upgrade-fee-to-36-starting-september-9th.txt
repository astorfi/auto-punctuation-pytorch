In today's second bout of unfortunate news coming from Overland Park, SprintFeed is reporting that we should brace ourselves for yet another hike in one-time charges on September 9th. This time, it's the oh-so-beloved Upgrade Fee that's the victim of inflation, getting beefed up to $36 for any existing customer who desires a new phone; if you're hoping to renew contracts on multiple lines, Sprint is graciously willing to cap the fees at a maximum of $150. There's speculation that these bumps may have something to do with the latest rumor coming out of Cupertino, but it may also simply be a routine policy change. Regardless of the motive, it means anyone holding out for the next best thing should start looking under every couch cushion they sit on, in hopes of scrounging up a few extra bucks.
