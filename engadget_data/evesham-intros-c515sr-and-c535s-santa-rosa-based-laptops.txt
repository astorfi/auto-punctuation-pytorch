The slightly lower-end of the two, the C515SR packs a 15.4-inch WXGA display, along with a T7100 Core 2 Duo processor, 1GB of RAM, an 80GB hard drive, built-in 802.11a/g/n WiFi, and a dual layer DVD-RW drive. Taking things up a notch, the C535SR packs the same display but upgrades the processor to a T7500, adds NVIDIA 8600 graphics (as opposed to the standard Intel business on the C515SR), ups the RAM to 2GB, and increases the hard drive to 120GB. Both can also be customized further to suit your liking. Those in the U.K. can snap up either one of 'em now, with the C515SR starting at £699 ($1,380) and the C535SR coming in at £849 ($1680) for the base configuration.[Via Tech Digest]
