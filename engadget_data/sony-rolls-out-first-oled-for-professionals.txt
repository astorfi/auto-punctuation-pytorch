This viewfinder gives the HD camera operator an 11-inch OLED display (960x540) with wide color gamut, fast response time and, of course, more than 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio to make sure they've lined up the perfect shot. We remember from CES, you can clearly see those displays from a mile away in even the worst lighting conditions, so it should come in handy for production crews to look at without having to get close to the camera. no word on how much this will cost, but we're guessing its a bit outside the range of the enthusiast set, for now.
