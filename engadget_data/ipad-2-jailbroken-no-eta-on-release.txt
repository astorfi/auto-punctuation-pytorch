The development community credits @comex with installing Cydia on this white iPad 2, and he's apparently already hard at work on a public jailbreak. According to his Twitter feed, the hack required a brand new exploit, as previous bugs were squashed in iOS 4.3. We'll keep you posted on when the hack's ready for you to use, too.

[Thanks, Henrique and Vassilis]
