Take one of the best LCD projectors you can find, and instead of
projecting onto a wall or screen, use a piece of custom-milled toughened glass in sizes up to
102-inches, coated with translucent holographic film. The result is the Claro TV, which can be wall-mounted or set
up as a free-standing unit. The coating allows the screen to display images sent to it via the projector, while
reflecting other sources of light, resulting in a mega-screen that works under almost any lighting condition. Of
course, all this holographic goodness will run you £25,000 ($45,000) and up, depending on screen size. That
explains why pretty much the only place you're going to find these in Harrods's showrooms for now. But
if you've got the cash, one can make it into your living room now; just be careful not to trip over it. Toughened or
not, this is still glass, and we'd hate to see it end up as a $45,000 sea of shards at your feet.
