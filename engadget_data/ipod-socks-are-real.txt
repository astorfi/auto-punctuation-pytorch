To all the haters who thought that those iPod Socks we
posted about a few weeks ago were fake, you can now pre-order them over at the Apple Store (unless being able to
pre-order them is also part of the joke). 29 bucks for a pack of six, but if you want we've got some freshly-washed
Engadget socks we'll let go for even cheaper than that.
