We ran into social exec Vic Gundotra after this morning's keynote, only to find him donning precisely the same set that was teased on stage. We asked if the blue was just part of Google's experimentation with coloring Glass, and he chuckled while confessing that he wasn't authorized to speak further about the project or its ambitions. Still, the man looks good in blue. And something tells us you would, too.
