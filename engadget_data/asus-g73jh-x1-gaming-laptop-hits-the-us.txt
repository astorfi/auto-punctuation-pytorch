That's now changed in a big way, however, as the laptop is available right now (at Newegg, at least) for the not-so-crazy price of $1,449.99. That will get you a 17.3-inch 1920 x 1080 display, a Core i7 720QM processor, 8GB of RAM, a 500GB hard drive, ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5870 graphics, and a DVD burner, among other more standard fare -- all in a suitably angular, eight-pound package, of course.
