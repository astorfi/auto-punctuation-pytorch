Satellite radio is a no-brainer, it just makes sense. But XM (and possibly Sirius) moving to video? That's kind of
weird, and we're not entirely sure how they'd intend to truly differentiate themselves from other satellite video
providers. Apparently XM's new partnership with Digital Fountain is key, though; their cached-data broadcasting makes
it simple for content to remain continuous (but not uninterrupted) after going out of signal range. Even Honda's in on
the deal, so we're assuming that we're probably going to hear some car-based sat-vid plan announced at CES. We'll keep
you in the know.
