Our boys over at Engadget Classic were able to get their paws on the fresh new Roku Netflix Player, and they were even able to sit down and play with the interface, catch a flick and unload a bevy of photos for you to gaze upon. Nah, HD support hasn't been added in (yet), but head on over and see what's what with the current iteration. It can only get better, one would hope.
