We've seen plenty of the 2X already, but the Black is an entirely different creature. First off, the taper on the back that sees the set go from 9mm in the middle to 6mm on each side is both nice to look at and helps keep the set cradled in your hand. The 4-inch WVGA NOVA display is both bright -- 700 nits, if you worry about that type of thing -- and extremely legible in the glaring spotlights installed at the stand. LG was touting the addition of its Wi-Fi Direct feature -- what at first sight seems like gimmickry -- that allows direct file transfer between sets without the need for an access point, and hey, it worked -- and might even be useful. We look forward to the Optimus Black crashing into our lives sometime in the first half of this year.
