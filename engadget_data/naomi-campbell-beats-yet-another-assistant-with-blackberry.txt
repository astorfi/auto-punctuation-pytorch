All that binging/purging must really be getting to supermodel Naomi Campbell's head, as today she's come under
accusation for a second time for beating up one of her assistants with a cellphone. Though her publicist has vehemently
denied the incident, word on the street's that Naomi was smacking her PA around with a
BlackBerry—at least it's a step up from that time in 2000
she beat her then-assistant with a regular cellphone—communicator-style this time! What, a Treo 650 isn't good enough
for you, Naomi? Maybe we're crass, but we still can't help but wondering how the device held up.
