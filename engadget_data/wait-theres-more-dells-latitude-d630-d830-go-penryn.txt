Just a day after the new processors landed in the Precision M2300 and M4300 -- and merely two days since they crawled within the M6300 -- the Round Rock powerhouse has seen fit to hook up the all-business Latitude D630 and D830. Effective immediately, interested consumers can snatch up one (or both, we 'spose) of the aforementioned machines with a 2.5GHz T9300 or 2.6GHz T9500, both of which include 6MB of L2 cache. Meanwhile, prospective M1530 buyers are becoming increasingly incensed at Dell's apparent negligence of their favorite machine.[Thanks, Juha]Read - Latitude D630Read - Latitude D830
