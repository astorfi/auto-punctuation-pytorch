Siemens is the latest to offer a Bluetooth
car kit for their phones, which lets you keep the phone stashed and do everything hands-free via the headend. The
Siemens Car Kit Bluetooth SIM HKW-720 can seamlessly access data from your phone's SIM, letting you use your address
book and other settings without having to manually initiate a connection. Of course, now that we know that going
hands-free to make calls in the car isn't safe, we really
shouldn't recommend this. Then again, if you're gonna go, may as well go first class.
