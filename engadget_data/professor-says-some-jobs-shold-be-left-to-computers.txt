 We've already seen robots beginning to take the jobs of lawyers and nurses, now Professor Chris Snijders of the Eindhoven University of Technology thinks that computers should take over some managerial jobs as well. According to Snijdres, the computer models he's developed are far more effective than human managers at a variety of tasks, like purchasing decisions, and can be applied to just about decision-making job, providing you have to some quantifiable data and history of past experiences to work with. He's even gone as far as to challenge any company willing to put its human managers up against his models, although no one's taken him up on that yet. Then again, human paper pushers vs. computer number crunchers isn't exactly the sort of man/machine battle we were all hoping for.[Via Techdirt]
