 We didn't beat around the bush when calling the original Nexus 7 the best tablet your hard-earned $200 could buy, but those who wanted one with built-in mobile data were sadly left out in the cold. Today, Google's remedying that. The Nexus 7 tablet with WiFi + Mobile Data is shipping today in unlocked form, with a sole 32GB model available for $299. It's the same unit that passed through the FCC's database just weeks ago, offering Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean), a SIM slot with an AT&T SIM (for use with HSPA+ connections on over 200 GSM carriers around the world), and the same overall fit and finish from the original. We'll be spending a bit of time with this guy in the days to come, but those already sold can pass along their billing information in the source link below.
