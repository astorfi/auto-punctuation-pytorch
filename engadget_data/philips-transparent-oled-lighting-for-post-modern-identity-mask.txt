This 12-centimeter prototype panel developed by Philips Research is transparent until flipping the switch for illumination. Unfortunately, the panels are currently limited in size due to complexities in the manufacturing process that necessitate a clean-room environment. Ultimately though, larger panels will replace "dumb glass" in household windows and stall dividers in trendy Germany toilets. What, haven't been to Berlin lately?[Via OLED-Display]
