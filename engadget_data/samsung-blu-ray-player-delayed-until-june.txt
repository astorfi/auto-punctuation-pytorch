This time it’s the Samsung BD-P1000 from the Blu-Ray camp which, according toAVSForm, will ship on June 25, not May 23 -- just asmidge before Sony’s BDP-S1ships. This according to a reptuable forum poster supposedly from Crutchfield. It’s not clear if this is a content issue like that plaguing HD-DVD orif this is due to that not-yet-final “copyright protection” which Sony blames for the PS3delay. In fact, we can’t verify any of this. However one thing is for sure, it wouldn’t look good forSamsung to hit their targets ahead of Sony now would it?[Via HD Beat]
