Aldebaran robotics recently announced its intention to invest in and develop a range of robots that can traverse rocky roads to help in hazardous situations, citing the tsunami in Japan as a catalyst for the move. The company's yet to state how it will make this happen, but says it's already made contributions to Cap Robotique, the "French cluster dedicated to the development and innovation in the field of service robotics." If you ask us, we're all for Nao gettin' a little dirt under its nails, as long as it can still serve Fosse. Full PR after the break.

It is for this reason that ALDEBARANRobotics has decided to develop and invest in a range of robots ableto intervene in hazardous situations."At this moment there is a veritable need for robots for our Japanesepartners. ALDEBARAN Robotics is the world leader in humanoid robotswhich are able to walk; however we are unable to help. Our robots aredesigned for research, education and personal assistance and not madefor such difficult situations. Following recent events I have decidedto immediately invest in the development of all-terrain walking robotsable to assist in these types of situations," said Bruno Maisonnier,CEO and founder of ALDEBARAN Robotics.The robotics industry continues to grow due to technology advances,mecatronics, man-machine interaction, artificial intelligence,geolocalization – all of which is leading to new applications forrobots and paving the way for an important market for personalassistant robots.ALDEBARAN Robotics is the inventor of NAO, a 58cm humanoid robot withthe ability to see, hear, speak and communicate not only with its userbut other NAO robots. Today more than 1,300 NAO robots are used in 40countries across the world as a platform for research and education inorder to explore new applications such as a treatment for autisticchildren or as a pedagogic tool for teachers. Currently, a secondhumanoid robot, ROMEO, with a height of 1 meter 40 centimeters isbeing finalized."Robots for the well-being of humans is the mission of ALDEBARANRobotics and the need for this type of robot requires the expertise ofmany actors. We have thus contributed to the creation of CapRobotique, THE French cluster dedicated to the development andinnovation in the field of service robotics, a market which represents$3.3B in 2010 and we will be very present at the upcoming InnoRoboexhibition in Lyon, France from March 23-25, 2011," he added.
