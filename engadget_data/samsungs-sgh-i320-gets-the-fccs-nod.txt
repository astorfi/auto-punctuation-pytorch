We don't yet know for sure if it's US-bound(though we expect it would be) or which carrier would pick it up (but we'll give you one guess as to which US GSMcarrier typically gets the hot PDA phones before the other), but with a supposed Q2 release, you can betÂ  yourbottom dollar we'll be watching closely for developments on this thing.
