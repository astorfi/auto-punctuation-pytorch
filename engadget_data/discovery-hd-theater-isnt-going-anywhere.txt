       When we heard that Discovery was launching new HD channels our first thought was: What about Discovery HD Theater? It appears we weren't the only ones, and the executive vice president & general manager of Discovery, Clint Stinchcomb, said that it will still be the HDTV enthusiast's "home page." While we're not sure exactly what this means, we hope that it means they are only adding channels and will continue to use Discovery HD Theater to showcase the best of their HD programming 24x7.
