You can plug up to six of these monitors into your PC and run them at full resolution, and the VW223B even includes a few USB plugs to help with the daisy-chain. The 5ms response time and 3000:1 sweeten the deal. No word on price or availability just yet, but we're starting to get a serious DisplayPort hankering up in here.
