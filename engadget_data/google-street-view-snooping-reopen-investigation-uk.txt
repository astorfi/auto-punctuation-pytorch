Authorities in the UK sure do and Mountain View's gonna have some serious splainin' to do if the Information Commissioner's Office has anything to say about it. Big G initially denied that its cars were used to willfully snatch up personal info from open WiFi networks, but a recent investigation by the FCC, coupled with earlier accusations, has prompted renewed scrutiny. The report from the US even suggests that "investigators in France, Canada and The Netherlands found that Google intercepted complete email messages, instant message conversations, video, audio, medical and legal information," which could lead to a big headache for the company. We really don't want to imagine the possible consequences of a nationwide Street View ban.
