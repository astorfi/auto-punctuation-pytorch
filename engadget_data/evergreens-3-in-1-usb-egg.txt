Besides the unconventionally-designed speakers, you're also getting a card reader and USB hub -- not a bad way to shed one or two items from your desk. Like most things, however, the devil is in the details with this one: its speakers can only muster a 2-watt output (and forget about a subwoofer), the "hub" sports but two lonely USB ports, and the reader's got SD, CF, and MS cards covered, but where's the love for xD? No word yet on pricing or availability, but we'll go out on a limb and assume that this is an egg only a mother hen could love, anyway.
