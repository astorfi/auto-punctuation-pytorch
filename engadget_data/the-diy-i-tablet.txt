Tired of waiting for Apple to come out with a Tablet Mac? Well, you could get off your ass and do it yourself, just
like Joseph DeRuvo Jr. did. He took an iBook and more or less grafted a touchscreen onto it. It took a mighty amount of
soldering, but at the end of the day Joseph had his i-Tablet. A monstrously thick i-Tablet that looks like it's a pain
to lug around, but an i-Tablet nonetheless (and shouldn't it be "iTablet" not "i-Tablet"?).
