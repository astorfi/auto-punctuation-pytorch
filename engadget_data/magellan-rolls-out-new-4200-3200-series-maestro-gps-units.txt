Coming in at the top-end of the lot, the $500 Maestro 4250 unit boasts a 4.3-inch widescreen display, along with support for live traffic information, text-to-speech functionality, voice control, and built-in Bluetooth for some handsfree calling. The Maestro 4220 and 4200 each sport the same size screen and slim 0.7-inch design but scale back on some of the features like live traffic info and voice control. Leading the pack in the 3200 series, the $400 Maestro 3250 will give you the same live traffic info, text-to-speech and voice control of the 4250, but in a slightly smaller form factor with a non-widescreen 3.5-inch display. Rounding out the line-up the 3200, 3210, and 3220 each pack 3.5-inch displays as well, but with varying amounts of maps and features depending on the model. Look for these to trickle out over the course of September and October.[Via GPS Review]
