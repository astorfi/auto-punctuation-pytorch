With acceleration and position sensors built into a head-mounted display, the remote camera moves in relation to your head's movements. The researcher sees this being used primarily for videoconferencing where he thinks it will promote effective communication by allowing eye contact. Of course, there's one problem with that -- if you're both wearing large displays on your face, how could you possibly make eye contact? Unless, of course, you paint eyes onto the outside of the display itself, Loony Tunes-style. That said, it's still an impressive piece of gear. See it in action after the break.
