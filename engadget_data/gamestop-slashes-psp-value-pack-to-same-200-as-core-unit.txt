LocoRoco fuhevah!), and it seems like someone has finally heard those pleas. The latest GameStop ad touts a newly slashed the price for the PSP Value Pack: $200, a full $50 off of its normal price, and the same amount of dollars the PSP goes for in the buff. No word if this is a Sony-originated price drop, or if GameStop was just feeling generous on the PSP's two year anniversary, but we won't look a gift horse in the mouth -- let's just hope a $150 PSP Core unit is soon to follow.[Via PSP Fanboy]
