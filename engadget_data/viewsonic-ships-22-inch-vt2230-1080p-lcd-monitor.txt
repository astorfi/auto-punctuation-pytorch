Said panel checks in with a 1,920 x 1,080 resolution, VGA / HDMI inputs, a built-in ATSC / NTSC / QAM TV tuner and a relatively small price tag. Further specs include a 1,000:1 contrast ratio, five millisecond response time, 300 nits of brightness and twin 3-watt speakers. Sure, nothing mind-blowing or anything, but it's not half bad for $349.
