Finally someone has gotten their hands on this thing, and we've got to say -- it looks pretty handsome (even if it is a rebadged, recolored MSI Wind, and a dead ringer for the Mini-Note). Specs seem unchanged, with a 10-inch 1024 x 800 display, 80GB hard drive, 1GB of RAM, and a 1.3-megapixel webcam, and the price appears to be holding at â‚¬399 (or about $630) as well. Still no word on when or if this is going to hit the states, but we've got our fingers crossed.
