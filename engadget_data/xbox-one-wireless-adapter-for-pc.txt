Microsoft didn't have just a 1TB Xbox One in store today. The company has also revealed that a wireless PC adapter for the Xbox One's controller will be available this fall, both by itself ($25) or bundled with a gamepad ($80). The add-on will give you that familiar, console-like input on any Windows 10 device with a spare USB port, including stereo audio and voice chat. That's a while to wait just to get that Xbox One feel on your computer without plugging in a cable. However, the adapter could make all the difference if you're using a laptop or tablet and want to get rid of as many cords as possible.
