 With countries lining up their orders and important prototyping milestones falling by the wayside, it's high time for an OLPC launch schedule, eh NickNeg? Indeed. According to the AP, the XO machines will be handed to kids for testing in February with Quanta Computer ramping up to ship several million production units by "July or so." When faced with skepticism over the capabilities of the little XO, NickNeg retorts, "I have to laugh when people refer to XO as a weak or crippled machine and how kids should get a 'real' one. Trust me, I will give up my real one very soon and use only XO." Ok Nick, we'll hold you to that.
