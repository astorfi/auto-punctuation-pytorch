From the sound of things, plenty of millions are set to change hands if the deal goes through, with Apple Computer potentially providing a good bit of advance cash for the marketing push and prospective sales. The Beatles haven't been incredibly receptive to the use of their music in marketing so far, though there was word recently of a downloadable offering somewhere, but it sounds like Steve is hoping they'll make an exception to be featured in one of those snazzy iPod ads -- it was good enough for Dylan and Bono afterall. Purportedly EMI Group, the band's label, is the catalyst behind these talks, and while nothing is quite legit yet -- in fact, it's all still hearsay as far as we're concerned -- hopes are high for Strawberry Fields, Revolution, LSD and all that jazz down in Cupertino any day now.[Thanks, Mack S]
