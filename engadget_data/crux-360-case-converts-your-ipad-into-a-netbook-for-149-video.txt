That said, it's easily the best looking of the bunch, and it's available to pre-order beginning today. For all intents and purposes, this case transforms your iPad into a netbook (at least, a netbook sans a bona fide operating system), but it's also capable of flipping back in order to become a kickstand. A Bluetooth keyboard is built right into the "lid," and if you're in need of little visual explanation, a video is waiting just after the break. $149 and she's yours... someday.
