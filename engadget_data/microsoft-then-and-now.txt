A time when a PC in every home was just a vision and 640KB of memory ought to be enough for anybody. That's the original Microsoft "family" re-photographed 30 years later (minus Bob Wallace who died in 2002) in preparation for Bill Gates to slip into tomorrow's smoking jacket of retirement. It's better than a gold watch we guess. Who's who after the break.
