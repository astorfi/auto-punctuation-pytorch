 
 Ooo! It's coming! What is? We don't know, but we're excited anyway. NVIDIA has a teaser up informing us that at 7:30 pm, Pacific time, on April 28th it will have something special to announce. The venue will be the GeForce LAN / NVIDIA Gaming Festival 2012 in Shanghai -- which leads us to believe there might be a GPU announcement in store for us. Though, we wouldn't write off a Tegra reveal entirely. So, which will it be? You'll just have to check back in Saturday to find out.
