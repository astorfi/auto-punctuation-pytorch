 All those looking to add Blu-ray and/or HD DVD playback to their existing PC get ready, Intervideo's WinDVD 8 is finally coming to US shelves. Already available overseas and as a pack-in with some Sony and Toshiba drives and laptops, it will finally be available as a standalone for those who bought a Blu-ray or HD DVD drive with no playback software. Set to run on Windows XP and the upcoming Vista, the Platinum edition of the software can also act as a UPnP server, streaming media to compatible devices. Out of the box its not ready for Blu-ray or HD DVD playback, an add-on HD Upgrade Pack will be necessary but no word yet on the pricing or system requirements there. The Gold edition has a price of $39.98, while the Platinum version with the media server and support for advanced HD codecs is $59.95. Look for it to show up on Intervideo's site...any minute now, and on store shelves in the next few weeks.
