Accessories for its upcoming 7-inch Android tablet have been spotted on one of Sammy's many online portals, complete with pricing. The headline act here will be that "table charging station" on the top left, which happens to have a neat set of HDMI and audio output ports, making the Tab a quirky but viable choice for pumping movies into your HDTV. It's said to be priced at €54 ($69), which we might consider expensive if it wasn't for the keyboard peripheral costing €82 ($105). The relative bargain of the set is the leather case that doubles as a stand, asking for only €41 ($52).
