Well apparently, Microsoft has caught wind of the rumor and is on a serious mission to quell the cries of eager upgraders. Hot on the heels of July 17th reports that the company had released a beta of the Windows Driver Kit (or WDK) meant to coincide with the service pack beta, Microsoft issued a statement claiming that the SP beta will be made available "sometime" this year, but for only a select group of testers, and with no plans for a public showing "anytime soon." For those used to not getting the Microsoft updates they were hoping for this should be business as usual; everyone else, welcome to the land of little "wow."[Via ZDNet]
