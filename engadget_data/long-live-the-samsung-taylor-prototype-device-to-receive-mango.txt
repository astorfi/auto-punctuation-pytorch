You may be comforted to hear that even the Samsung Taylor -- the beta device awarded to devs last summer that got left in the dark when NoDo came around -- is reportedly receiving the refresh to Windows Phone 7.5, inferring that the range of devices covered by the annual overhaul is pretty wide. It hasn't been made official, but the above screenshot was posted on the Facebook Wall of a Microsoft employee (which has since been taken down), offering a solid indication that the idea isn't too far-fetched. If you're one of the lucky few to have the prototype handset in your possession, be on the lookout and keep us apprised if Mango comes knocking on your door. Everyone else should feel at ease knowing that if the Taylor can get it, it's likely that every other Windows Phone can too.
