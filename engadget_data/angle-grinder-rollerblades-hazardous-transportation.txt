Without getting into too much detail (seriously, you'll want to view this one from a distance), strapping a modified angle grinder onto a rollerblade whilst carrying a backpack battery system enables a mettlesome individual to burn some serious rubber (or polyurethane) with next to no actual effort. Staying in control, however, becomes extremely challenging. We'd typically recommend hitting the links below (and catching the video after the jump) in order to give this a whirl yourself, but this time we'd visit strictly for the laughs.
