Otherwise, things are pretty much as we thought: support for your SOCOM Bluetooth Headset's High Quality mode, advanced voice chat features, screen capture (for future titles), a video scene search, power save mode and changes to the Trophy system and Information Board. The PSP 5.00 firmware gives the handheld WiFi access to the PlayStation store, a full size on-screen keyboard and a sleep timer (just like your old clock radio). According to SCEE, the updates should see the light of day on October 15 (at least in Europe) but there's no word yet on a Stateside release. You'll know as soon as we do.
