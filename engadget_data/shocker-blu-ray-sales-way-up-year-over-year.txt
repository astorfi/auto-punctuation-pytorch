Obviously, the end of the format war is the biggest contributor, for studios and consumers alike. The real question is whether there's enough Blu momentum and mindshare for Q1 2008 to mark the magical "inflection point" we heard about at the CES BDA press conference. Sony certainly hopes so, and we hope HD media takes off among the general public, too. But darn those pesky recent VideoScan numbers that underscore the fragility of Blu-ray sales. Our suggestion (and plea) to studios: adopt a "build it, and they will come" approach by cranking out the Blu-ray titles to fuel demand.
