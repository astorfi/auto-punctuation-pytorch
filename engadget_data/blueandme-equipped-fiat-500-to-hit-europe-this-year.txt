At the 2007 Geneva Motor Show, the two announced that the Blue&Me system would indeed be shipping in the Fiat 500 this year, and it was noted that "top-end" versions would get the system built right in, while entry-level 500 buyers could opt for it as a factory option for an undisclosed price. The do-it-all in-car technology system "guarantees owners an outstanding combination of intuitive, hands-free navigation, communications, and entertainment features,"and while exact launch dates by market weren't noted, Italians can expect the newly-featured 500s to arrive first, while those in Germany and UK will get served by the year's end.
