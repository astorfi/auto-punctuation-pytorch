Like others in the FX series, the new FX6710 is aimed directly at gamers, and includes a speedy Intel Core 2 Quad Q9400 processor, 6GB of RAM, a 750GB hard drive, ATI Radeon HD 4850 graphics, Creative X-Fi audio, and other suitably high-end specs, all for a $1,199. The all new LX6200 model, on the other hand, is targeted at more multimedia-minded users, though gamers will probably find quite a bit to like as well, including an AMD Phenom X4 9500 quad-core Processor, ATI Radeon HD 3200 graphics, the same 750GB hard drive, and 8GB of RAM standard, all for just $779. According to Gateway, both should be available at all the usual sources right now.Read - Gateway FX6710Read - Gateway LX6200
