Motorola's just sent out invitations for its own launch in Chicago, scheduled for the day after Samsung's big event in Berlin. Of course, we don't know exactly what to expect, but given the "choose your own adventure" invite, it looks like two smartphones (perhaps the X+1 and a new G model), Moto 360 and an in-ear wearable (Bluetooth headset?) are on order.
