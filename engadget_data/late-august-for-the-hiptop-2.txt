Nah, of course it's not official, but (and you can't help but love the irony of this) Danger just asked the FCC
withhold all of the test photos of the new Hiptop 2/Sidekick II for the next 45 days, saying that they "request this
confidentiality on the basis of ensuring that buisness sensitive information remains confidential until the actual
marketing of our new device, which is planned for late August 2004." Guess it's a
little late for that, but it's as good an
indication as any that they're planning to have this thing out in just a few months.
