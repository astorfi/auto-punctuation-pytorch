Well, you're in luck, as German site Macberry.de took the time to film a walkthrough of the recently released BlackBerry Playbook 2.0 developer beta. The homescreen of this new build now offers users folder options similar to that on iOS, neatly collecting your gaggles of data into appropriate bundles -- like documents and games. But you probably care less about that, and more about seeing BlackBerry Runtime for Android apps in action. We're happy to report those Google-specific applications are shown here running quite smoothly, filling the 7-inch tab's screen without any hint of lag. You can download the dev build now for your own first-hand account, or simply click on past the break to gawk at the silent tour.
