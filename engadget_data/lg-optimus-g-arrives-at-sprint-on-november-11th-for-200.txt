Brace yourselves, folks, because the smartphone that wields a 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro and a 13-megapixel camera will arrive at the Now Network on November 11th for $200. Naturally, this is certainly one to get excited about, as the phone also boasts a 4.7-inch HD (1,280 x 768) IPS display, 32GB of internal storage and a beefy 2,100mAh battery. While the phone will ship with Ice Cream Sandwich, LG has already promised to deliver Jelly Bean in short order.
