 Today the film studioswill (finally) be announcing new Blu-ray and HD DVDtitles in hopes of jump-starting the multi-billion-dollar next-generation formats while staving off criticism that they areresponsible for delays. Twentieth Century Fox will release 20 Blu-ray films including "Fantastic Four"and "Ice Age" with Sony Pictures dropping an additional 20 Blu-ray titles including "The FifthElement" and "Hitch." HD DVD supporters will get some love from Warner Bros. who will deliver the goodsin both formats. Now how about some players, playas?
