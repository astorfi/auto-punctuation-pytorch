That said, the incredible Tap-to-Share functionality that'll enable these slates and phones to converse with one another will also support "webOS 2.2 or higher" on the phones, suggesting that an update could be in the waiting. We'll keep you updated as we hear more, but for now, peek a video of the whole family getting cozy after the break.
