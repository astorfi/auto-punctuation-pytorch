 In a statement during Germany's IFA conference, Samsung promised to release its dual format player in October or November; and while there's no firm price yet, estimates are that it will cost about 400 euro ($544) more than their standard Blu-ray player. We assume that it'll be Blu-ray's first BD profile 1.1 player and at the same time HD DVD will get another stand-alone player from someone other than Toshiba -- this one actually supports HDi. While we seriously doubt a dual format player will help either side become the dominate format, it will help get some people down off the fence so they can start enjoying the best HD quality their TV has to offer.[Via Pocket-lint]
