First up is the Ion wireless gaming controller that connects to your PC, tablet or phone through Bluetooth. It'll grant you up to 20 hours of gaming at a stretch when it goes up for sale in Q3 of 2012. The company's also debuting a couple of headsets, the Flux and Siberia v2 Frost. The Flux, scheduled for a Q2 release, is aimed at gamers on-the-go, as its ear cups collapse for easy storage while traveling. It's also got cord jacks on either side that allow you to daisy chain headsets together so more than one person can listen to a single audio source at a time. SteelSeries' Siberia v2 Frost headset is an updated version of the Siberia v2 that still does active noise canceling, but adds some extra flash with blue LEDs that can be set to pulse or dim to meet your tastes.

Rounding out SteelSeries CES offerings is a trio of gaming rodents, the Kana, Kinzu v2, and Kinzu v2 Pro. The Kinzu v2 Pro, available now for $44.99 brings four buttons, a 3,600fps optical sensor that supports stable movements up to 65 inches per second. It also has pro-quality Omron switches and brings three color choices (black, silver and red) to your next LAN party. Meanwhile, its sibling, the Kinzu v2 sports the same specs sans the Omron switches and can be had in black, white, orange, or yellow for $39.99. Last up is the Kana, which has a 3,600fps optical sensor that supports stable movements up to 130 inches per second,ups the button count to six, and brings an illuminated scroll wheel to the table for $49.99.

Compatible with PC, Mac® and Mobile devices, the Flux features new, on-ear mesh cloth cushions that pump out impressive sound levels via its 40mm driver units. The headset includes cable connections for an in-line, uni-directional microphone with mute controls that connect to PC as well as a connector with a single 3.5mm jack for Mac® and mobile devices. The multi-use headset was designed to be travel-friendly, the headset earcups to fold inward when wearing it around the neck, and collapse at the earcup hangers for quick and compact storage. 		The SteelSeries Flux factors in convenience for the user by including 2 input jacks – one on each side, which allows for two user options: to choose which side the microphone cable can be plugged into, and the ability to "daisy chain" or plug in another headset to the Flux which allows for multiple users to listen to the same device. Customization of the SteelSeries Flux headset will provide users with the ability to order various outer plates with different colors and designs as well as various colored cushions all of which will be available in Q2. 		"We work with professional gamers that travel often to tournaments and events, but we also cater to users that want headset compatibility for more than just gaming, which is where the design of the Flux began," said Bruce Hawver, SteelSeries CEO. "This headset is meant to be more about the user, versus just another audio option – we brought together color and plate design options with the versatility of being able to plug in and use the audio and microphone with any device. If you play games on your PC, you most likely also listen to music and make calls, and you want a headset that will allow you adapt." 		The SteelSeries Flux will be available in Q2, which is also when pricing will be released. More details about colors and design options will be released closer to product availability.

Through a licensing partnership with Zeemote Technology Inc., the SteelSeries Ion is designed to work fully with your PC, additionally the controller brings classic control schemes to touch screen devices like tablets and phones. The compact controller connects wirelessly through Bluetooth and can be easily customized and configured through its own application on the device. 		"For PC users, the SteelSeries Ion is a convenient alternative, especially if they want something other than their mouse or keyboard as their tool. And for consumers with tablets and Smartphone's, it really is an ideal accessory" said Bruce Hawver, SteelSeries CEO. "Whether you're sling shooting birds or playing a word game with friends, there are games that are ideal for touch screen. Those types of games however, are not the only games available; there are a number of first-person shooter and RTS games that aren't downloaded or played as frequently as they could be, because the touch screen doesn't provide an optimal experience. The SteelSeries Ion provides the advantage for those types of games." 		Measuring only about the size of a standard deck of cards (approximately 108mm in length, 55.5mm in width and 18mm thick); the lightweight controller can be easily stored and carried. It connects through Bluetooth to your PC and/or your mobile device and includes a white LED light on the controller indicating a connection.
