If you're a Wii U owner in the US, there aren't too many games to look forward to in 2015. After Star Fox Zero, Super Mario Maker and Yoshi's Woolly World, the company's release schedule looks pretty barren. One of the games that could make up the numbers is Devil's Third, a third-person action shooter that's finally been confirmed for the Americas. The debut title from Tomonobu Itagaki's Valhalla Game Studios has already been announced for Japan and Europe, but until today there had been little mention of a US release. Nintendo has stepped up to publish the game in the fourth quarter of this year, while Valhalla handles the "free-to-start" PC version. Any additions to the Wii U library are welcome, but initial reactions to Devil's Third haven't been positive. No matter, there's always Xenoblade Chronicles X if you're looking for games to fill out your collection.
