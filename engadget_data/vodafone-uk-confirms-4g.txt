Vodafone UK has just announced its 4G network rollout will begin on August 29th, with London to be the first city to go live. Twelve more locations will get switched on before the end of the year, including Birmingham, Edinburgh, Leeds and Sheffield (full list after the break). Price plans will begin at £26 a month (SIM only, for 2GB of data) and the operator already has a choice of compatible hardware to choose from -- such as the Nokia 925, Galaxy S4 or BlackBerry Z10. Although the official turn-on won't be until the end of the month, those eager to get the service will be able to sign-up from the 12th in store or online. Existing customers with an LTE handset can upgrade their plan for an extra £5 a month. As a sweetener, Vodafone is throwing in unlimited data for the first three months, along with a choice of Spotify premium or Premiership football content bundles. While the UK has had LTE services for a while now, until recently, choice was very limited. Now, with O2 coming soon, and EE already up and running, the UK market is set to enjoy the benefits of proper competition.



Full list of cities: Birmingham, Bradford, Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield.
