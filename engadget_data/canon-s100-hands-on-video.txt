It's not the most compact camera in its space, but the new Powershot is surprisingly lightweight. It's got a healthy 12.1 megapixel CMOS sensor with improved low-light performance and a 5x optical zoom, the latter of which could certainly do with a bump. The S100 captures 1080p HD video and sports a convenient, dedicated movie button (no switching modes here). The high-end point-and-shoot doesn't pack too many surprises, but it certainly seems like a worthy successor to the highly-regarded S95. Sadly, Canon still wouldn't commit to a firm release date, only saying that it's due out in November for around $430.
