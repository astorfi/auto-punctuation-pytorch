 Snapseed quickly took on Google+ integration after it was acquired by Google. It's now Snapseed's time to return the favor. An update to the Google+ apps is introducing basic image editing (currently for iOS only) and, yes, those seemingly inescapable retro filters to get just the right effect before an image goes into a post. The pseudo-Instagram layer is far from the only addition, however. Android and desktop users can optionally tell Google+ to always share their closest available location in their profile; posts in the stream now include more text and make it easier to see photos and videos; Community participants can also invite people, share posts and manage activity away from their computers. If you've ever wanted to fix a Google+ photo -- or break it, some would argue -- the Android and iOS updates are rolling out today.
