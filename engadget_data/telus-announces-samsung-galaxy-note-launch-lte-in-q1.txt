The LTE launch alone gives us tingles up our spines, but coupled with this useful little handset, we're overjoyed. Telus, however, didn't provide any information on the exact date of the Note's launch nor even a hint of what it might cost, but we'd expect that'll come tumbling our way soon. In the interim, have a peek at the press info, our hands-on and give our first impressions a read, won't you?
