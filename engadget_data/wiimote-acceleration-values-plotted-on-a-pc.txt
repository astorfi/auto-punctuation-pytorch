A fellow named Marcan42 on YouTube has put together a video which shows the Wiimote's acceleration values dumped to a computer, the first step necessary in hacking the device. It's anyone's guess how long it'll take to actually transform this raw data over Bluetooth into actual usable gameplay input and mechanics, but those hungry now for at least a video of some hot acceleration charts n' graphs need to no further than past the break.[Via digg]
