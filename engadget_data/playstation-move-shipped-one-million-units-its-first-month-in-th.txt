Sony says it's shipped more than one million units of Move (which particular configuration is unclear) in North and Latin America. If you add in the 1.5 million Sony said it had already sold in Europe a couple of weeks ago, and Sony's probably hovering close to the 3 million mark as of right now. Not bad for an add-on peripheral, and Sony itself says it sees the Move as more of a word-of-mouth grower, but we'll see how much momentum Kinect gets out of the gate: Microsoft certainly plans on pushing it.
