Presumably due (at least in part) to the halo effect stirred by Apple's marketing blitz of its iPhone and iPod, Apple's US personal computer shipments for Q2 of this year landed them in a tie with the once mighty Gateway in terms of American market share. Granted, Gateway did have a few more shipments than Apple, but if Gateway continues to fade and Macs continue to move, we could see Cupertino raising up the bronze (outright) here soon. Attaboy Steve -- just snag 18-percent more of the market and second place is all yours.
