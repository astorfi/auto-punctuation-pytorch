The "youth"(translation: entry-level) smartphone arrives with a slightly better spec sheet than the Korean giant's cheapest Android phone, the Galaxy Mini, although you shouldn't expect a load of GS II-eque features. The petite handset includes a two megapixel camera, a three-inch touchscreen, an 832MHz CPU, and the typical wireless medley of Bluetooth, 801.11 b/g/n WiFi and GPS -- all packed into a 3.5 ounce shell running Google's Gingerbread OS. Sure, there's no 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus screen, but for just Â£10.50 per month, we may be willing to overlook it.
