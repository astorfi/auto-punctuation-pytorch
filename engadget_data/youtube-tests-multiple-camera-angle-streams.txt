Sports broadcasts were among the first to give viewers the chance to pick how they watch the action on the internet, but now YouTube is giving the feature a try. A video of artist Madilyn Bailey performing at YouTube Music Night lets users click through a choice of four camera angles as they watch, without pausing. We got the best results by letting the video load a bit before jumping around (apparently pulling down four streams at once can take up a bit of bandwidth) but it still seemed to hesitate occasionally when switching. Properly implemented this could make the next Lollapalooza stream even better, although we're already cringing internally at the thought of multicamera jump cuts as the next overused vlogger trend (interested creators can apply to try it out here).
