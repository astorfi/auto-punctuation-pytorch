 Are you a fan of grayscale technical drawings? Or perhaps you're in the market for an all-in-one desktop, but don't own an educational institution? Dell's satisfying those key constituencies -- and more! -- with support documents for its upcoming Vostro 360. Ahead of any official announcement of pricing or availability, the PDF lets us glean a few specs: we're looking at an Intel h61 Express chipset with Intel Core i3, i5 or i7 processors â€“ or, if you're feeling especially nostalgic, you can opt for a Pentium Dual Core. The system will max out at 8GB of memory, with integrated Intel graphics or a discrete NVIDIA GeForce GT 525M, and a touchscreen option, if you'd rather let your fingers do the computing. Oh, and there's a built-in camera privacy cover you can glue shut the next time you disgustedly swear off Chatroulette.
