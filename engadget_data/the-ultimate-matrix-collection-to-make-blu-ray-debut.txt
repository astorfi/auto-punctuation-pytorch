We've wondered when we'd see this go down for what seems like eons, but thanks to new data (including box art) over at DVD Active, Warner Home Video will finally loose The Ultimate Matrix Collection on BD on October 14th. The $129.95 (MSRP, we imagine) set will include seven discs, though we're not certain what extras will surround the films themselves just yet. Start saving those pennies, you know you'll want this one.[Thanks, Alex]
