 Samsung's M55 laptop has already been tricked out with Blu-ray and HD DVD players, but the company doesn't seem to have run out of HD goodies just yet, now adding an HD DVD burner to its lineup of portable high def offerings. Apart from that notable addition, the laptop also comes loaded with a Core 2 Duo T7200 processor in place of the earlier model's T2500, along with 2GB of RAM, a 120GB hard drive, a GeForce 7600 graphics card with 256MB of VRAM and, of course, that same big 1920x1200 17-inch display. As you can no doubt guess, all that largess comes at quite a cost, with the laptop setting you back the local equivalent of $3,200. Competing for those HD dollars is Toshiba's recently announced HD DVD burner-equipped Qosmio G30 laptop, which PC World reports went on sale in Japan over the weekend, demanding an equally pricey $3,085.Read - Akihabara News, Samsung M55Read - PC World, Toshiba Qosmio G30
