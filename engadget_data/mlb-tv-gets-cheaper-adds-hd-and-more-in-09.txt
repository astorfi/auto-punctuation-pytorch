Throw in picture-in-picture and live chat features and it looks like the switch from Silverlight to Flash is paying off, at least on paper. We're trying to find an argument against lower price and more features that doesn't have to do with the Yankees and Red Sox trying to buy a title every offseason, but we're coming up blank.
