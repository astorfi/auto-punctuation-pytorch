 
 It's safe to say Viber's VoIP applications have been somewhat of a hit since the early days on Android and iPhone. Now, looking to build up on that humble success, Viber's updating these apps to version 2.2, bringing with it a fresh group messaging feature, improvements to the voice engine for better call quality and tweaks to the UI, such as adding photos to contacts list. Meanwhile, the Windows Phone and BlackBerry flavors will still have to wait for the voice goods, as Viber didn't announce any other major changes on those platforms. Viber v2.2 is up for download now from the App Store and Google Play links below.
