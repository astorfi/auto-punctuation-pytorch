The big news here is that after the holidays Blu-ray seems to be getting stronger and stronger when you compare the amount of money spent vs DVD. Now some would say this is only part of the picture, and that it's great and all that 17 percent of the home media market's revenue last week went to Blu-ray, but what they really want to know is how many discs were sold. Now don't get us wrong, we'd love to know it as well, but the fact is that this information is provided to us by Nielsen via Home Media Magazine, and we don't get to choose the stats. That being said, we understand that including both unit sales and revenues would be more complicated, and if we had to choose between the two pieces of data, we'd easily choose revenue. After all, the entire point of starting a business is to make money and you can't do that without revenue. This week the big title that shocked us was Max Payne, which easily hit number one while The Express didn't even make the top 20. The good news for Blu though is that over 20 percent of the cash spent on old Max went to the Blu version.The really good news is that at this point we expect even the worst releases to manage 6 percent, and anything but double digit market share for the week seems a distant memory.
