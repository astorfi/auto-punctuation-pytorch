The widget interface is nice, and we're into the picture-based contacts screen, but the icon-based home screen just feels cluttered, especially when viewed in the expanded horizontal orientation. It'll be interesting to see how LG refines these elements in its upcoming onslaught of Windows Mobile phones -- we wouldn't drop back to a featurephone for this stuff, but we'd be plenty interested in seeing more phones like the GM730 with this interface.
