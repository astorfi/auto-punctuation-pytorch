With the current economic situation encouraging citizens to rethink their credit card-abusing habits, a Verizon-commissioned survey has (unsurprisingly) found that a majority of those polled will be turning to their TVs for low-cost entertainment. Out of the 1,026 adults surveyed, some 57% admitted that they were planning to spend "more time at home turning to their television instead of events outside the home." Naturally, Verizon took this opportunity to showcase just how cost efficient its FiOS TV offerings were in tough times, and if it would bother expanding its footprint to more than a handful of states, we'd probably be stoked about the notion. Instead, we're just bitter and envious.
