Despite having recently introduced the likes of Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, Netflix isn't standing still: it's boosting its original content with yet another production, Orange is the New Black. The new comedic drama series, created by Weeds' own Jenji Kohan, is set to start streaming to Netflix subscribers worldwide beginning July 11th. Similar to Netflix's House of Cards, Orange is the New Black consists of 13 episodes running at around 60 minutes -- however, the main story here won't be based on drama coming out of D.C., but rather a "world populated with unforgettable characters and no-holds-barred humor set against the backdrop of a women's prison." Be sure to peruse the PR after the break, where you'll find more particulars about the plot, as well as the full cast list.

Netflix members will have access to "Orange is the New Black" at 12:01 AM PDT in all territories where Netflix is available â€“ U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Latin America, Brazil and the Nordics.

"Orange is the New Black" follows engaged Brooklynite Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), whose decade-old relationship with drug-runner Alex (Laura Prepon) results in her arrest and year-long detention in a federal penitentiary. To pay her debt to society, Piper must trade her comfortable New York life with fiance Larry (Jason Biggs) for an orange prison jumpsuit and a baffling prison culture where she is forced to question everything she believes and form unexpected new alliances with a group of eccentric and outspoken inmates. The series' diverse ensemble also includes Kate Mulgrew, Natasha Lyonne, Pablo Schreiber, Danielle Brooks, Laverne Cox and Taryn Manning.

"Orange is the New Black" is executive produced by Kohan, who also wrote the first and final episodes of the season. The series is produced by Lionsgate Television for Netflix.
