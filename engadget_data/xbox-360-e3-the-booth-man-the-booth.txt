The ladies at the Xbox 360 booth were kind enough to give us a bit of an impromptu tour of the gargantuan Xbox 360
booth at E3 today. Even though we weren't able to pin one of their consoles down long enough to get some shots from out
behind glass, at least they were finally able to tempt us to bust a few out of their offices Mission: Impossible style.
'Spect that soon.



   The 360 demos in the press section were being run off you-know-whats.
