If you weren't inspired by any of the suggestions in our holiday gift guide, then perhaps the LaCie Huby will bring a smile (if not a raised eyebrow) to his or her face. Taking a page out of the PowerSquid playbook, LaCie has just come out with the Huby (that's pronounced "HUB-ee"), a strange-looking device that is not like your father's USB hub at all. This new post-modern bundle of joy comes with four USB 2.0 ports, two FireWire 400 ports, eight "flexible" USB and FireWire cables, eight "colorful" LEDs, a light and fan (both USB, of course), and a partridge in a pear tree. It'll set you back $80, and won't ship until late December -- we're not sure if that'll make it to you by Chrismahanukwanzakah, but that ain't nothin' that overnight shipping can't fix.[Via EverythingUSB]
