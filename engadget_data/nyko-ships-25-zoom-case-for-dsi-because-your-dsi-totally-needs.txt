Amazingly, the product design team convinced everyone else in the company to move ahead with plans for production, and now it's making its way out to cold, steel shelves. $24.99 buys you a hard shell case for your handheld along with a detachable optical zoom lens, which supposedly gets your sensor eight times closer to a given subject than Nintendo ever intended. You'll also be mocked eternally if you're ever caught using this in public, but hey, maybe you're thick-skinned.
