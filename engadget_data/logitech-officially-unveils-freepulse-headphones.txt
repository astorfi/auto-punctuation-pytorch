As you already know, these headphones use Bluetooth 2.0 EDR with A2DP to let you jam to your tunes at a range of 33 feet (i.e. Class 2), and can rock on the MP3 player of your choosing with its adjustable transmitter (though the iPod adapter attachments aren't exactly a hinderance for uptake).[Thanks, ventivent]
