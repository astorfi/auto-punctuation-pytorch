  
Get ready humans, because we have an all new Engadget Show that you do not want to miss! First up, Josh sits down with Mitsubishi product chief Frank DeMartin for a talk about the future of television technology. Next, Paul gets a behind the scenes look at iRobot's headquarters and test-drives military robots in an exclusive new Engadget Show segment. Then, Josh and Paul welcome Aldebaran Robotics to the stage for a never-before-seen demo of their humanoid robot NAO. Shots fly as Nilay joins the roundtable for a look at Ubisoft's new laser tag game, Battle Tag; and the guys recap the year in tech then preview what's on tap for next year at CES 2011. To round it all out, BIT SHIFTER rocks the house with some killer holiday chiptunes music with visuals by noteNdo. What are you waiting for? Watch it now!
