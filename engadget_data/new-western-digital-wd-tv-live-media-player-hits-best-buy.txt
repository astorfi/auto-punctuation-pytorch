Nothing here too out of the ordinary -- wide codec support, Dolby Digital and DTS decoders, HDMI out, and an Ethernet jack for DLNA streaming and accessing YouTube, Flickr, and Pandora make this one a solid buy at $119 if you need it, but it's not going to blow up the world, you know? We're still saving up for monster Windows 7 / CableCARD Media Center rig.[Thanks, Keith D.]
