Tonight at midnight (local time, we presume), South Park will air for the first time ever in high-definition (on TV) when "Imaginationland" takes center stage on DirecTV's The 101. Viewers can delight in the feature-length, director's cut from May 30th to May 31st, and if that wasn't enough, the season eight premiere -- "Good Times With Weapons" -- will also be broadcast in HD on the same station. We can't say for sure that this is a sign of things to come, but we doubt we're alone in hoping so.[Image courtesy of Scott Tenorman / Comedy Central]
