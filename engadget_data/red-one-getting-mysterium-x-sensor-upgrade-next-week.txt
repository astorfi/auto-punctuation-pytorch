That's the same sensor that will come standard on the EPIC-X, and promises a range of improvements for the $5,750 it'll cost you -- not the least of which is improved low-light performance (one of the few knocks against the original sensor). Along with it, you'll also get a new version of REDCINE-X to handle the improved video, and those interested in stepping up to the EPIC-X beta program can expect to get a $1,250 credit if they qualify and join at the first or second stage.
