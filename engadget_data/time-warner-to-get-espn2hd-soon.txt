 We have great news for college football and NHRA fans alike, but bad news for NFL fans on Time Warner Cable. First, the good news, Time Warner should have ESPN2HD and ESPNU up and running real soon. A spokesman from the cable company is indicating anywhere from 30-60 days that the stations will launch. Now for the bad, don't expect NFL Network anytime soon. The court battle that has been raging for a few years just ended and NFL fans everywhere won as Time Warner will need to carry the channel but the negotiations are just starting. These things take time. But hey, ESPN2HD is a lot better then nothing.[Thanks, Danny]
