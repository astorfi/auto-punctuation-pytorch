It's up for grabs, starting at $1,399 in its base configuration with a Core i5 processor, but getting much higher if you start tickling those option boxes in the customization screens. No word on the Envy 14 yet, but the 13 is still available... for now. Also on offer is the refreshed Pavilion line, the dm4, dv5, dv6, and dv7, showing off their new metal casings and swirly paint jobs. The dv6 starts at $699 while the others predictably go on up from there.
