 
This is the last summer for Discovery HD Theater as it will be replaced by Velocity starting September 25th. The new channel focuses on reaching an "upscale male audience" that digs shows like Cafe Racer, Inside West Coast Customs and Mecum Auto Auctions while still promising to keep up HD Theater's rep for high quality production and picture quality. We're sad to see HD Theater fall by the wayside -- Sunrise Earth, never forget -- but if this means we can get a few new episodes of Rides it may not be a bad thing after all. On the other hand, we also remember how well this exact plan failed to save INHD / Mojo years ago. Check out a trailer (that's unfortunately low-res but is the best we could do) and press release for the new network after the break.
