We're chalking it up to having entirely too long to plan, a rock-solid capsule and a Panasonic Toughbook U1. You heard right -- Panny's tough-as-nails UMPC is reportedly being attached to each miner as they are pulled up in order to monitor exact location and vitals. Dollars to donuts there's a ported version of Angry Birds on there to keep 'em entertained on the ride up, too.
