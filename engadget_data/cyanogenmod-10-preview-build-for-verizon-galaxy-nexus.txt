The marvelous news is Verizon Galaxy Nexus owners can now also take part in the early adoption process, as CyanogenMod's Brint Kriebel has said via Mountain View's social network that CM10 for Big Red's GNex is out and up for grabs. That said, he's let it be known the goods aren't exactly fully baked, though he has been rockin' it as his "daily driver" for about two weeks -- which, needless to say, is quite a good sign. Those interested in going a step further can hit up bekit's Google+ page, where you'll find the rest of the underlying details.
