The company has already moved well ahead of schedule in deactivating 9,600 iDEN sites -- a third of its network. The company admitted that it's battling with Verizon to coax former Nextel users onto its service, but hopes that since it's got a shiny new Direct Connect platform, the Now Network will be able to keep hold of far more of them than it has done so far.
