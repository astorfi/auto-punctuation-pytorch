Animal activism aside, this bizarre creation obviously utilizes a stuffed beaver in order to house the components of a fairly respectable PC, and while we can't be sure, we're guessing the 2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 160GB hard drive, 1GB of RAM, Panasonic DVD writer, and AOpen motherboard are all enjoying their stay in the now-empty stomach region, while the 80-millimeter Tornado fan is chillin' right on the beaver's backside (shown after the break). Of course, mere text alone can't fully describe just how freakish this thing really is, so be sure and hit the read link for a barrage of construction photos if you dare.[Via Wired]
