According to a pair of listings on its website, the HP TouchPad (curiously also sporting the Pavilion moniker here) is estimated to be available on June 22nd in both 16GB and 32GB capacities for $499.99 and $599.99, respectively (the latter of which matches the price already spotted at Walmart). For those looking to accessorize, an HP-branded TouchPad case is also listed. Of course, an ETA doesn't necessarily indicate an actual release date, but this particular one is at least closer to the last official word out of HP than recent rumors have suggested. Head on past the break for a shot of the listing for the 32GB model.
