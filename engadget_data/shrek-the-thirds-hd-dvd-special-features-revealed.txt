 Now that Shrek the Third is an HD DVD exclusive, it appears Dreamworks Animation is taking the opportunity to throw in all new HDi features. High Def Digest has the updated specs, which include advanced PiP features above and beyond those of previous HD DVD titles, as well as exclusive downloadable content such as a subtitle trivia and movie guide. It would be nice not to have this format war at all, but increased support for each format's unique -- at least until the Blu-ray players are upgraded -- features is a benefit.
