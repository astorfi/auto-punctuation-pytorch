Suissa Computers is targeting the anti-treehugger in us all by offering up a lineup of custom made PCs geared specifically for gaming, entertainment, or home office use. Sporting unconventional, artsy designs, these computers can be encased in a myriad of woods including maple, walnut, oak, goncalo alves, lacewood, leopardwood, paduak, mahogany, zebrawood or purpleheart. Hidden within is an AMD Athlon 64 X2 4800+ / 5000+ dual-core CPU, up to 4GB of DDR2 RAM, nVidia GeForce 7900 / 7950 graphics card, 600 watt power supply, liquid cooling system, and essentially any other option your mind can envision (and wallet can afford). Each model is only replicated 100 times, when it's then replaced by another freshly-chopped design, so if you see a flavor you dig (and have the $6,150+ to cover the cost of ownership), you should probably snap one up before it hits Suissa's endangered species list.[Via CNET]
