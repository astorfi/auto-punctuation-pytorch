(Sorry, we couldn't find it on the USPTO site or Google Patent Search -- one of you eagle-eyed readers wanna spot us one?) According to The Street, the patent is a modification of an earlier patent (also granted Hindman), which applies to satellite radios (as well as CD players and analog radios) that input and display wireless data from satellite sources. Apparently the suit claims GPS, location-based services, and crash and theft detection all owe the patent some due, so it's likely Hindman & Co. will start swarming all sorts of businesses if they can wrestle a settlement free from XM and Sirius.[Via Orbitcast]Read - The Street writeupRead - Federal Court filings
