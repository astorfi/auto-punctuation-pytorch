Desktop? Check. Android? Check. iOS? Check that one off too. The refreshed Gmail design is now officially available on the App Store for both iPad and iPhone. The update not only brings the new category-based, multiple-tab inbox -- bringing it in line with Google's new interface on other platforms -- but throws in the ability to set notification options for individual accounts. According to the change log, you'll now get "notified for all messages, only important messages, or none at all, on a per account basis." You'll also be able to view YouTube videos and Google Maps links through the appropriate app, rather than the browser. Lastly, you can turn off the multiple tab interface if you're not a fan, but unfortunately Google has restricted the new notification options so they'll only work with the new inbox. Just as we noticed with Android, we wouldn't be surprised if it's not available to everyone yet -- it likely is undergoing a similar rollout effort. Either way, it doesn't hurt to click the source link to see if you can grab the update sooner rather than later.
