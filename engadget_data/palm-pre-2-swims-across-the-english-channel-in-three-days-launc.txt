What's more, the 1GHz handset won't be chained to a British carrier, but rather released into the wild completely SIM-free, which probably means future Just Typists will need to buy it direct from HP. As for the promised pre-orders for US students, we're sorry to say they've failed to materialize; the Facebook page that once clearly stated "preorders begin 11/8" now simply reads "Palm Pre 2 coming soon." Soon enough for you?
