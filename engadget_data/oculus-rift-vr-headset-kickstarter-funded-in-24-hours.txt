  Our future is starting to look more like the future of the early '90s, with gamers signing up to have TVs strapped to their faces. The 21st-century iteration on the long-lost VR headset concept (remember Sega VR?) is the Oculus Rift, a headset that combines a 1280x800 viewing area with head tracking technology. It's apparently a much better execution on the VR idea than those past headsets, as the Oculus has the thumbs-up from designers like Cliff Bleszinski iD's John Carmack â€“ so much so that every dev kit will include a copy of Doom 3: BFG. It also has the explicit financial support of a bunch of Kickstarter users, who have contributed over $800,000 of its $250,000 goal in just one day of funding.The development version of the Rift is designed only for PC, but the team hopes to "make the headset compatible with major consoles and all other platforms, including mobile, and as soon as possible."
