Just as promised, ASUS has unveiled its Zenbook Infinity at Computex 2013 in Taipei. Being the first laptop -- let alone an Ultrabook -- to boast a Gorilla Glass 3 lid and palm rest, it's able to take advantage of three times the scratch resistance than the material's predecessor. This has allowed ASUS to achieve a maximum thickness of just 15.5mm, or about 14 percent thinner than the previous line of Zenbooks. But would the glass survive a drop? According to the product manager, the laptop's passed various drop tests, but only time will tell if it's as good as he promised.


Despite the slimmer body, the Zenbook Infinity surprises us with a built-in touchscreen as well as a backlit keyboard. There's also a USB 3.0 port on each side, along with an SD card slot, micro-HDMI port and a Mini DisplayPort. No word on the other specs or prices just yet as this laptop won't be out until Q4, so stay tuned for future announcements. Check our our eyes-on video after the break.
