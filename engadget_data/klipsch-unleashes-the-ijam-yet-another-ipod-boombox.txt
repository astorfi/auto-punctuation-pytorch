Seems like speaker manufacturers won't be happy until they've attached iPod docks to
anything remotely capable of producing
sound. The latest in this slew of add-ons is the Klipsch iJam boom box, a battery or AC-powered personal stereo
that will accept any iPod with a dock connector into its clutches. In case 30GB just isn't enough variety for a long
day at the beach, Klipsh has also included an FM tuner for those needing their commercial fix. Klipsch promises to
offer this model in multiple colors, although we doubt any of them will be able to enhance it's rather staid
design.
