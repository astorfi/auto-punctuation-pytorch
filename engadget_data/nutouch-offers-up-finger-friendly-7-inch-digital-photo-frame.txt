Nevertheless, NuTouch's 7-inch Touch Frame does manage to stand out somewhat in the legions of mediocre alternatives, as the sleek, glossy black frame gets complemented with an array of touch-sensitive controls, built-in stereo speakers and integrated MP3 player. The panel packs a 800 x 480 resolution, and furthermore, you'll find 128MB of storage, a multicard reader, internal battery, clock / calendar functions and USB connectivity. Still, we can't help but balk at the Â£139 ($273) price tag -- then again, we are dealing with the declining-by-the-second greenback here.[Via GeekAlerts]
