Rather, it'll be a single-speed transmission that won't allow the all-electric hot rod to run as fast as the planned two-speed version. Tesla still plans to swap out the units for the real deal when they're finally strong enough to handle the electric's massive torque, but at least now when Tesla owners are stranded by the side of the road they'll just need an extension cord, not a whole new transmission.
