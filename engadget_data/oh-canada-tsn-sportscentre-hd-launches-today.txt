 The first HD broadcast of SportsCentre (not SportsCenter) is tonight at 6:30 EST on TSN for our friends up north. They'll finally have a fully HD studio and high-def highlights of games. Anyone who watches ESPN-HD regularly is aware of how much better it is when you can see the highlights of all the games as intended, we're glad our Canadian brethren will get a look at the latest hockey, curling and Ricky Williams clips in HD. They're calling themselves the first fully equipped high definition newsroom in Canada, on October 2nd the Molson That's Hockey daily half-hour show will also launch in HD. ESPN and Discovery led the charge to HD for many stations in the US and we expect a similar result for Canadian television.
