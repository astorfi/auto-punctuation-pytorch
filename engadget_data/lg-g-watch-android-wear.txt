Over the last two years, LG has established a storied history of collaboration with Google. The two companies have worked together on three devices (two Nexus smartphones and a Google Play edition tablet) and today we're hearing about the fourth -- a smartwatch. LG's latest piece of handywork, known as the G Watch, features Google's new wearables platform called Android Wear. LG's keeping quiet on the specs and other details of the new device, but as you can see in the image above Google Now features prominently on the platform. And, just like on the Moto X, users will be able to initiate voice commands by simply speaking "OK Google."


LG wants the G Watch to act as a "low barrier to entry" for developers, while offering a Google experience to users at the same time; this likely means that when the watch arrives sometime next quarter (exact date and pricing remains unknown), we can expect it to sell at a rather competitive price point. "The opportunity to work with Google on LG G Watch was the perfect chance for LG to really pull out all stops in both design and engineering," said Dr. Jong-seok Park, CEO of LG's Mobile Communications division. "We're confident that a well-designed device has the potential to take the smart wearable market by storm." Of course, it'll have plenty of competition as Motorola, HTC, Samsung and even fashion brands like Fossil get in on the fun.
