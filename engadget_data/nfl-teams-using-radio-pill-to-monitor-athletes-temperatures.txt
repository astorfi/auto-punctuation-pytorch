Players on the Minnesota Vikings might soon be going on the pill — not to prevent pregnancy, but to prevent
overheating. After former offensive lineman Korey Stringer died of heatstroke four years ago, the team began looking
into ways to monitor athletes' temperatures. They found HQ Inc.'s Cortemp ingestible core body thermometer pill,
already in use by the Philadelphia Eagles and the Jacksonville Jaguars. The players ingest the pill, which transmits
their body temperature to a handheld device for about 24 hours or so, after which it's eliminated from the body. All
the hardware involved here ain't cheap — teams fork over $2,500 apiece for a few data recorders, plus an optional
$4,000 handheld that serves as a central monitor for all the players. The bright side is it makes that
iPaq hx4700 seem like a steal.
