Until someone cracks the CableLabs cert process that allows these CableCARD tuners to be used on your current PC, that is. Anyway, we caught some shots of the DCT in action, and it looked great. Smooth cable HDTV and the box was light as a feather. Ugly as sin, but light as a feather. Another snap after the break.
