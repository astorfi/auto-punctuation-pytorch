The catalog reveals that the low-end handset will arrive with a 3.5-inch, 320 x 480 display, a 600MHz processor and a 5-megapixel camera. It'll run on the country's 3.5G network (HSDPA to you and me) and you'll find Ice Cream Sandwich sharing the room on that 4GB of on-board storage. It's also reported to have a 1,320mAh battery and will retail for â‚¬200 ($260) once it's finished enjoying the Iberian weather.
