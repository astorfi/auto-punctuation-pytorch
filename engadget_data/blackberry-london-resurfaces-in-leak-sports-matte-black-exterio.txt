  That salacious onyx number up there? Per CrackBerry, it's a rendering of RIM's upcoming BlackBerry codenamed London. Found lurking in a leaked Waterloo slidedeck, the svelte render now sports a more curvaceous and onyx exterior -- a departure from the angular metallic P'9981-esque dummy-unit first spied back in November. Those tweaks validate another rumor, which foretold the redo, as-well as the killing of its Milan and Colt siblings. Looks like RIM might be putting all of its eggs into this redesigned London-basket, which per this leaked roadmap could be yours come Q3. All or nothing, Thorsten Heins? We like your gusto -- bring on the black unicorn.
