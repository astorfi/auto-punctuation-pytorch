 Meizu's irrepressible CEO J. Wong is up to his teasing ways again with more details on the M8's successor, the aptly-named M9 -- and actually, there's nothing about the list that doesn't sound doable for a 2010 release (famous last words, we know). Specifically, the dude's saying that we can expect a 1GHz Cortex A8-based Samsung S5PC110 core, half a gig of RAM and ROM, a 5 megapixel cam, Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS, TV-out, microSD expansion, and a 3.6-inch screen clocking in at 720 x 480 resolution. Interestingly, he's holding the line on committing to deliver WCDMA, CDMA, and TD-SCDMA versions simultaneously -- theoretically good enough to deliver 3G on China Unicom, China Telecom, and China Mobile, respectively -- with a price in the range of 2,500 yuan (about $366). Possible? Yes -- but with as checkered a past as the good ol' M8 has, we'll believe this one when it's in our hands and not a moment sooner.
