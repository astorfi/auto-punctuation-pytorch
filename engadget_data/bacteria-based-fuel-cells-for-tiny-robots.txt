 Unless you're looking at some sort of cyborg solution, one of thebiggest problem with tiny spy robots and other such entities isa reliable source of power. Some researchers at Rice University and the University of Southern California are lookingto solve that with a new kind of fuel cell based onelectron spitting bacteria. Apparently the bacteria can eat at about any material -- the target is waste water -- andspit electrons which the researchers hope to harvest and use to power the tiny bots. Luckily the Department of Defenseis behind this to the tune of $4.4 million, so hopefully after they manage to churn out all the espionage needed forthe decade, we might get some spillover to consumer devices.
