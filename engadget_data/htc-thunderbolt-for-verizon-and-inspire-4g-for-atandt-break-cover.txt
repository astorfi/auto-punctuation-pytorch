This is the same phone that we've seen rumored and leaked over the last few months as the Mecha and the Droid Incredible HD, but we'll admit -- ThunderBolt seems like a pretty solid name for a phone that's sporting a 4.3-inch display and some of the fastest data around.

Behind and to the right of the ThunderBolt, though, is another leak: the Inspire 4G for AT&T, though it's unclear what "4G" means in this context exactly -- AT&T's in the same boat as T-Mobile right now where they're topping out with HSPA+ and don't have any LTE markets live, so it seems they might be borrowing a play from their smaller rival's playbook and labeling the HSPA+ airwaves as straight-up 4G. We're sad to see that trend start to snowball -- but we'll admit, T-Mobile kinda forced their hand on that one. At any rate, we're pretty confident both of these suckers are going to get official here at CES this week, so keep your ear to the ground.
