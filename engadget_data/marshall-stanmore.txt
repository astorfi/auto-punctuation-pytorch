Look familiar? Yeah, yeah, it's built in the classic Marshall amp style, but the new Stanmore speaker also has a lot in common with the already announced Hanwell. The big difference? Size. The newly announced speaker is a diminutive take on its older sibling -- though it's not tiny by any means. The speaker's got a number of inputs: 3.5-millimeter, RCA, Bluetooth and optical audio. It comes in black and cream colors and will run you â‚¬400 here in Europe. It's not cheap, certainly, but man it's a pretty speaker.
