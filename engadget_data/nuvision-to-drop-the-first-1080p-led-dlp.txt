 We didn't think it'd be a no-namelike NuVision that took the eh-kinda-illustrious title of first company to release a 1080p LED DLP, but they're claiming tohave their 52-inch non-wobulator on the market in 3 months. We'll believe it when we see it, but we've no doubt that agood LED DLP would do our respective livingrooms some serious good. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of information onthis thing right now, so we'll be scanning HD Beat for the schoop at EHX just as you'll probably be scanning us for anupdate.
