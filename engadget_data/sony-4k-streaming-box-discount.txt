4K TVs are still quite expensive and there's still not a lot of stuff to watch on 'em. If neither of those things deterred you from buying one, however, then Sony's FMP-X10 Ultra HD Media Player is probably a good investment. The Roku-esque hardware lets you pull down 4K content like American Hustle and The Blacklist from Sony's Video Unlimited store, as well as House of Cards and Breaking Bad from Netflix. Having already launched in Europe, it'll arrive on these shores in July for $700 -- unless, that is, you pre-order between today and July 15th, since Sony is offering a $200 discount for even earlier early adopters.
