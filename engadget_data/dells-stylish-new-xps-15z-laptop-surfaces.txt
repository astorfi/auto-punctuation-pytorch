While there's unfortunately not much in the way of details, the laptop is apparently dubbed the XPS 15z, and it's said to pack support for Sandy Bridge Core i5 and Core i7 processors. As previously hinted at, this particular laptop is also said to be just part of a series, with both 14-inch and 17-inch models also on the way. Hit up the link below for few additional shots.
