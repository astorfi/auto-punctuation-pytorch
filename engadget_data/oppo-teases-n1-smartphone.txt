Oppo may have already confirmed the existence of its N-Lens series devices, but it's offering us a few more details through official teasers for the line's inaugural smartphone, the N1. While the posts show little of the handset in question, they point to both a September launch and backside touch input. It's also clear that the N1 is important to Oppo -- a timeline (pictured after the break) positions the phone as a spiritual successor to last year's Find 5 flagship. With the unveiling just weeks away, we won't have to wait long to get the full story.
