 Dell is pulling back the curtain on the XPS 18, its new portable all-in-one. This machine is a natural competitor to the Sony VAIO Tap 20, with a built-in battery rated for five hours of runtime, although it weighs a much lighter 4.85 pounds (versus a whopping 11.4). Still, though the XPS 18 can function as a tablet, it's portable in the sense that it can move from office to living room; it's not going to accompany you on daily subway rides.

 With an 18.4-inch, 1080p display, the XPS 18 makes for a pretty enormous slate, and we were only comfortable holding it in our hands for a few minutes, though resting it on our lap worked well. The AIO sports flip-out plastic feet on its backing, and these can prop up the device vertically or at an angle. Of course, you can also use the XPS 18 as a tablet by simply laying it flat on a table or desktop, and this is the ideal mode for playing games and the like on the 10-point touchscreen.


 The all-in-one will come with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse when it debuts in April, and a $50 dock will be an optional accessory. Pricing starts at $900 for a dual-core Pentium ULV and a 320GB hard drive, and the top-of-the-line configuration will offer a Core i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD.
