Tom Dickson is on the scene to entertain Novell BrainShare attendees with an IT infrastructure smoothie. Naturally, this involves a copy of Vista from Novell's best buddy, a SUSE figurine, Apple Mighty Mouse and a can of Red Bull. The addition of "blades" adds a bit of suspense, but the end result seem to match IRL interoperability quite nicely -- we keed, we keed! Peep the video after the break.[Via Digg]
