If you're befuddled, we're simply referring to the week that iPad owners have had to listen to their Android-lovin' brethren gloat about having Dish Network's Remote Access app. As of today, that same piece of software is available in the App Store, enabling iPad owners to watch live and recorded programs so long as they've a broadband-connected, Sling-enabled device like the Sling Adapter. It'll also allow iPad owners to browse and search up to nine days of programming, schedule DVR recordings, manage conflicts, delete shows on multiple receivers, and use their tablet as a fully functional remote, but much to our dismay, it doesn't have the power to make Heroes a show worth watching again.
