He's back, and hooked us up with some shots of Motorola'sCanary, what we understand to be the true successor to the RAZR. Contrary to prior reports that this thing would run WindowsMobile, you can plainly see that it doesn't; we understand it uses the same software build as the RAZR V3x, which might imply it's a UMTS device as well. A secondtrustworthy source let us know that the device would pack a 2 megapixel camera, and would be positioned as Moto's newflagship phone due for Q4 2006 or Q1 2007 launch, which jibes with everything else we've been hearing, and starts topull this picture together. More pics after the break!P.S. It's worth noting, as we're told, that thisphone is more or less just as thin as the original RAZR, just not as wide. And that's supposedly not a plasticexterior, but a soft-touch finish and aluminum detailing.
