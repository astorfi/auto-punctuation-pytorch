 Not everyone likes burying their head in a pile of spreadsheets, but that's how we get our kicks. It hasn't made us rich or successful like Paul DePodesta, but at least we get the satisfaction of bringing you HTC's latest vital statistics. We've put the innards of HTC's One side-by-side with last year's flagships so you can see just what's changed from year-to-year. Oh, and before you go apoplectic with rage -- the company's magical new imaging technology means that the One's 4-megapixel sensor isn't the slap in the face with a wet fish you'd assume it to be.
