 Developers looking to carry on part of the MeeGo legacy have been wondering when Jolla would publish a usable SDK for Sailfish OS. It hasn't taken long to find out: the company has updated its wiki to tell us that the programming kit arrives early into the first quarter of 2013. Although that's not immediate satisfaction, it's close enough that development will start relatively soon after we receive hardware details. After that, it's just a question of whether or not the mobile app community is willing to dive in.
