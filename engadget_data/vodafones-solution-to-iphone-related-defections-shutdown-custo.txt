 The Inquirer is reporting that Vodafone UK's customer service line used for defecting customers is down. In fact, it's been down the entire weekend since the iPhone's Friday launch. Instead, Vodafone customers looking to change their status to O2 customers are being greeted with an automated voice response asking them to try again later. Coincidence? Maybe. It's certainly timely having already witnessed the carrier defection rate following the US launch.
