Well, The Verge has laid its hands on a picture of the previously FCC-listed detachable camera grip, which would put it closer to the side profile of Samsung's Galaxy S4 Zoom than preceding Lumias. With a micro-USB connection and a four-dot LED display like that seen on Nokia's own charging peripherals, it's very likely that there'll be some extra battery power housed inside it too. Rumored specs from UnleashThePhones say it could arrive with a 2,000mAh battery built-in, dual-core Snapdragon processor and a 4.5-inch AMOLED display identical to Nokia's last new phone, the Lumia 925. At least it's now just a matter of hours, not weeks, till we can cement all the details.


Update: More leaks! But we're keeping them housed here for now. Below you can see what's purported to be new camera interface for the Lumia 1020's Pro Cam app lens, from serial EOS leaker, @vizileaks. We're hoping it'll be intuitive as it looks, with quick-access to ISO settings, white balance, metering and shutter speed all arranged in concentric circles. It also appears the new Lumia will be able to "dual capture" both at a higher and more typical resolution at the same time.
