 
It's raining Zune rumors again, or more properly, "Project Argo" rumors, and far be it from us to keep these to ourselves. The latest word comes from BetaNews and their "sources close to the situation," and things just keep looking better coming from the Redmond camp. They're claiming that Microsoft will start showing off the device to the public in the last week of August, followed by more presentations mid-September, and an October release. The August announcement would come a few weeks after Apple is rumored to release new iPod nanos at WWDC, but would come a fair bit before the flagship iPod refresh is expected, giving Microsoft a great shot at the "you have to buy a new iPod at least once a year" crowd pining for a fix. BetaNews also has some more code names from Project Argo for us to kick around: Pyxis and Alexandria. The former is a rumored iPod nano competitor, with similar size and functions, but the addition of video support. The latter we've heard of before, back when Origami rumors were in their prime, and appears to be the music/video service that will complete Microsoft's utopian ideal of end-to-end content and device provider -- and which is sure to piss off a few PlaysForSure music services in the process.
