An intrepid Howard Forums member has posted shots of a claimed Motorola i880, a rather svelte (by iDEN standards) clamshell with dual color displays, camera, external music controls, and stereo speakers to enjoy your music in glorious low fidelity while maximally aggravating those around you. If this all checks out, the i880 would likely slot in as Nextel's top non-smartphone -- although that's not saying much -- and possibly Nextel's last purely iDEN hurrah before iDEN / CDMA hybrid handsets start to drop in the coming months.[Via phoneArena]
