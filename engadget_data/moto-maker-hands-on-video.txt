We had a walkthrough with Motorola's dedicated Moto X assembly site during the company's launch event earlier this month, but we've since had a chance to log on and build our own device, selecting front, back and accent colors with a live preview updating along the way. Not much has changed since August 1st, but considering you'll be walking out of an AT&T store with a $200 scratch-off card and a two-year contract, it's worth taking another look at what you'll find when you get home. Click past the break for our hands-on video to see what we managed to make.


Update: Motorola has opted to delay the "signature" engraving, with quality issues to blame. Orders placed at launch will not include this feature.
