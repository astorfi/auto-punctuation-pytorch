Still, word is that Acer is planning to make dual-booting standard on its dual-core netbooks going forward. Right now the D255 only does Android overseas, but we're going to perceive this as a threat until we hear otherwise. Sure, adding Android to a netbook doesn't hurt anything (which is the majority of Acer's excellent argument for its inclusion), but we can only hope that this fascination with Android quickly switches to Chrome OS when it's ready.
