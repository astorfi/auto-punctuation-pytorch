Apparently, it doesn't take much: pop out the screen, replace it with an 8.9-inch touchscreen kit, flip the lid 'round so the display sits on top, toss out the keyboard and screw it all back together again. The specimen pictured above is running Ubuntu on top of the Aspire's 1.6GHz Atom CPU with 1.5GB RAM and an 8GB SSD (and quite happily, we might add). Hit that read link for details and plenty of pictures.[Via SlashGear]
