 Just yesterday, ASUS announced the first-ever quad-core tablet, packing NVIDIA's Tegra 3 SoC, and now the chipmaker is making an announcement of its own. It may be a slightly less exciting reveal, but NVIDIA's just taken the wraps off of its Q3 earnings, and it appears things are looking up -- revenue is up 4.9 percent over last quarter to $1.07 billion from $1.02 billion and up 26.3 percent from last year. The company also reported an increase in net income, raking in $178.3 million for Q3 2011, up from $151.6 million last quarter and $84.9 million last year. The company's CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang, unsurprisingly attributed the growth to the mobile market as well as the outfit's GPU business, and continued to boast of future good times, riding the quad-core wave.
