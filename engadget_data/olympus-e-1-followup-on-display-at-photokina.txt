Now the lucky few attending Photokina will be the first to see the eagerly anticipated E-1 followup when the show kicks off tomorrow. Well, kinda. See, Olympus will be displaying a concept model when the doors swing wide so take these images as a taste of what's to come, 'cause that's all we've got for now. Oh, and be sure to go full screen, 'cause just like Paris, the new Engadget's a moveable feast.[Thanks, oly_man]
