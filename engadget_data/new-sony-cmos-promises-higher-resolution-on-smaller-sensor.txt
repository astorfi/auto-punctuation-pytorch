 Sony has rolled out a new CMOS that the company claims will be able to pack more pixels into smaller sensorswithout degrading image quality. The ClearVid sensor, already available in some Sony camcorders, rotates pixels 45degrees, which Sony says allows the company to squeeze more pixels onto a small sensor without shrinking the pixels. Ifthe technique (which is also used by Fuji in its SuperCCD) catches on, we may see 10-megapixel compact cameras thatactually take decent pictures.
