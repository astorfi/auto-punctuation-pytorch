The 3.6-inch handset is fairly compact, and pretty slick looking, with its black front and curved white backing. It's not particularly exciting on the spec side, with its 1GHz Qualcomm processor. Nope, what's most exciting here is the inclusion of Mango, which should look rather familiar to Windows Phone 7 owners, while adding some welcomed updates to the mix.

	According to Acer, the handset should be arrive some point next month, though the company isn't offering up much in terms of pricing. Check out a hands-on video after the break.
