 A securities filing has just revealed that Sprint Nextel has acquired 50.8 percent of Clearwire Corp giving it control of the firm. The deal comes after buying out Eagle River Holdings' stake in the telco. This comes just days after Sprint was subject to a sale of its own, to Japanese operator Softbank. The news is the latest twist in the up and down relationship between the two firms, and hints at a more assertive LTE strategy -- given that it now has more say over Clearwire's spectrum. Although it remains unclear how this will affect deals with other operators. If you really want to get in to the nitty-gritty, head on down to the Securities and Exchange Commission doc in the source link below.
