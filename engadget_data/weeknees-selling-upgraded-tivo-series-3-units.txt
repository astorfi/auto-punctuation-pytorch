That, of course, translates to about 200 hours of SD recording capacity, or 32 hours of HD recording, but for the real HD junkies among us, Weaknees will sell you a TiVo S3 with a 500GB hard drive for $1299, or a box with a whopping 750GB hard drive (that's 100 hours of HD recording) for $1599. For the more adventurous, Weaknees will also gladly hook you up with an upgrade kit, with a 500GB drive running you $399 and the 750GB setting you back $599. You can order now, but don't expect them to ship before September 22nd.[Via Zatz Not Funny]
