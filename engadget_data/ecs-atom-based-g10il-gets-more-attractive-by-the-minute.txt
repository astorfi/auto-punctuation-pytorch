Now that ECS has filled us all in on a few more pertinent details, we're feeling all the more sure of that assertion. According to new specifications loosed on the outfit's own website, we can look forward to a Diamondville, er, Atom CPU, Windows XP or Linux under the hood, a single RAM slot (up to 2GB), an HDD or SSD, 1.3-megapixel webcam, 4-in-1 multicard reader, a 8.2- / 10.2-inch glossy display and a 4- / 6-cell battery for good measure. Oh, and if you were wondering if Bluetooth and WiFi would tag along with the built-in HSDPA / HSUPA, the answer's yes (at least on the big fellow). So, does the G10IL have your attention now, or what?[Via DailyTech]
