With Intel's Moorestown just around the corner we're leaning towards the latter, hoping for it anyway -- Sony doesn't tease just any old product without good reason. Oh, wait.

Update: A previously proven Sony tipster tells us that a new VAIO P is the mystery device. In fact, it's orange and the paper clip to the left actually represents the unit as viewed from the side. Trippy.
