  Time Warner Cable promised live TV streaming would make the leap from iOS to Android devices after Ice Cream Sandwich rolled out, and now Director of Digital Communication Jeff Simmermon tweets that it could go live by the end of March. That's described as a "very loose" date however, so don't get your Tab's and Nexus' hopes up to high just yet. This comes just after it launched a beta for live TV streaming to PCs, and on the same day the company revealed the formerly Android-exclusive MyTWC app for iOS. It handles more mundane tasks like bill payment, call forwarding and voicemail, but interested subscribers can grab the free app from iTunes at the link below.
