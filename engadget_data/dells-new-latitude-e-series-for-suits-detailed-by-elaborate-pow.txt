They've got it all, and this new Latitude E series presentation is no different. Sure, the subject matter is a little dry: reliable, boringbooks for businesses, but there are a few gems in here. The basic thing to get down is that Dell is kicking the D series to the curb, and is going E with its professional laptop line. Improvements include the perks of Centrino 2, more WWAN and other wireless chips, eSATA and Display Port plugs, thinner dockable laptops and huge ass batteries for all-day usage. The E6400, for instance, boasts 19 hours of battery with a 9-cell. On the teensy end, the E 4200 offers a 12.1-inch WXGA screen in a 2.2 pound form factor, with 32GB and 64GB SSD options. The E4300 bumps that up to 13.3-inches and 3.4 pounds. At the other end of the spectrum, the E 6400 ATG is a 5.6 pound beast designed to withstand drops, dust and moisture. The E 5400, 5500 and 6400 are the mainstreamers, with 14.1-inch and 15.4-inch screens, disc drives and all the other trappings you'd expect. Dell's roadmap has the larger laptops hitting in August, with the 12 and 13-inchers showing up in September. Unfortunately, it looks like the XT2 is getting pushed out to January of next year, but it can't all be roses. Check out the gallery for all the sordid details.
