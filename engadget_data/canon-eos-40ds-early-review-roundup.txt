 
It takes a while to put a camera like Canon's EOS 40D fully through its paces, but a few brave souls have blazed through the feature set, menus, ISOs and megapixels afforded to them by the new camera in time to get reviews up mere weeks after launch. Of course, the flashiest feature here is Live View, but the 40D is no one trick pony: unlike the minimal 20D to 30D upgrade, the 40D is all-new and packed with enhancements. Who knows if this'll be enough for Canon to get Nikon of its turf, but we'll let you read the mountains of text, peep the comparison shots and draw your own conclusions.Read - CNET Asia ("The Canon EOS 40D is a leap forward in improvement over its predecessors..." 8 / 10)Read - Cameralabs ("If the 40D's price and feature-set suits your requirements, you'll have few if any complaints.")Read - Bob Atkins ("It's a very good camera and I can recommend it.")Read - The World According to Roland ("A nice feature upgrade over the 20D and 30D and at an attractive price.")Read - DP Review (Preview)
