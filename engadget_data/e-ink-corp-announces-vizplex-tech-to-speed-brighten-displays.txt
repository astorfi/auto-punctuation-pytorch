 E Ink's first-gen electronic ink tech powers a nice little crop of e-books and a few other miscellaneous gadgets, but the slow refresh and less-than-stellar contrast offered by current devices have held them back from wider acceptance. The E Ink folks are attempting to address some these problems with the new Vizplex display technology, which doubles refresh speeds, and boosts brightness by 20 percent. E Ink is also planning to expand much further beyond those cookie cutter 6-inch e-books, with 1.9-inch, 5-inch, 6-inch, 8-inch and 9.7-inch display sizes. E Ink has also prepped a new "Metronome Display Controller" which boosts grayscale depth, and supports more sizes and resolutions, while also offering better integration with other device components to reduce costs. The developer kit for these news new displays and components is out now, so it's just a matter of time before manufactures manage to finagle them into a new line of cookie cutter e-books.
