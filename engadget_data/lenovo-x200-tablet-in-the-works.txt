We're not taking any of this as fact -- the spec sheet showed up on the web page for the Hong Kong Baptist University, and it's accompanied by a picture of the regular X200, so it could just be a mistake -- but we certainly wouldn't say no to a 4-pound tablet with a 1.86GHz SL9400 Core 2 Duo and a 7-hour battery life for $1,339, so we'll see how this one plays out.[Via GottaBeMobile]
