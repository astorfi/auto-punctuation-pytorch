Thanks to our own Boy Genius among countless other tipsters, nothing on the grid has really taken us by surprise -- no UMTS 1900 N80s, for example -- but we're encouraged by Cingular's (foolhardy?) optimism that the 8525 might yet see a release this month. Also allegedly along for the ride are the 3125, the oft-promised but rarely-delivered Nokia E62 (which turns out to be a lifetime exclusive for Cingular), the Samsung SGH-C417 that now appears to be on limited sale, and Sony Ericsson's middling W300 Walkman flip. And, oh yeah, the Motorola L6 is in there, too. Don't ask us.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
