There's still a 1.6GHz Atom processor, 1GB of RAM, 160GB hard drive, Windows XP and a 10-inch WSVGA screen, but what's new is the Splashtop-powered "LG Smart On" OS, which does the quick boot thing we've come to know and love on many ASUS products, the Voodoo Envy 133 and elsewhere. The effect, as always, is pretty stunning, and the OS should be helpful for a quick look at the web or to hop on IM over the laptop's WiFi connectivity. The netbook itself seems to have been tweaked a tad on aesthetics, but it's still a bit thicker than we'd like at this point for the netbook market. We're short on further details, but since the X110 did 3G, there's a good chance that'll be in play as well -- we're still waiting on PR from LG. In the meantime, you can check out a video of the startup after the break.
