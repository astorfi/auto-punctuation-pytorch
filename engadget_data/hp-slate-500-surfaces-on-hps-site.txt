Yep, the guys at IDG News spotted the good ol' 8.9-inch HP Slate -- now apparently the Slate 500 -- hanging out on a rather hidden HP.com page. The details are few and far between, but they do seem to coincide with all that we originally had heard about the tablet -- it runs Windows 7 Home Premium, has "exclusive" HP software and two cameras. And that's not all, the chaps at IDG also noticed that the Slate 500 was Energy Star certified, and a listing for the same product on Energy Star's site confirms that it will have a 1.6GHz processor. That too seems to line up with what we had heard about the Slate having a 1.6GHz Intel Atom Z530 CPU. We know, it's all a bit surreal considering we just got word yesterday that HP had filed a trademark on the term PalmPad, and we figured the Slate may have seen its day. There's no telling what will happen next, but it sure is looking like a HP Win 7 and WebOS tablet may just live in harmony.
