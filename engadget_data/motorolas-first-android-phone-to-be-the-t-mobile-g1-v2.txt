Not only did commenter Someperson notice that the button labels on the alleged G1 v2 are basically identical to those on other recently-launched Moto phones, Boy Genius Report says today that they can "more or less confirm" the v2 will be Schaumburg's first Android set -- a development that lines up perfectly with last month's rumors of a slider QWERTY piece. Yep, it all fits together nicely, except for the fact that HTC is oddly out of the loop on the sequel to the G1 -- but since T-Mobile owns that particular trademark, it can do whatever it wants, you know? Hopefully we'll find out more soon -- if that sketchy leaked roadmap is correct, we'll be seeing this guy in the fall.Update: Or... the G1 v2 could really be the Samsung Bigfoot. It's a mystery for now, we'll let you know.
