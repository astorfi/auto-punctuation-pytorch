We're probably still a long way off from seeing that
Bluetooth iPod that is supposedly in the pipeline, but if
you've been itching and scratching for a way to cut the cord right now, icombi has been showing off the AP 11, a new
Bluetooth stereo dongle for the iPod that works with their AH10 Bluetooth headphones (yeah, we know, there's another
iPod Bluetooth dealies out there from TENÂ  (the
naviPlay), Griffin, and
Belkin). Supports the A2DP, AVRCP, Hands-free, and
Headset profiles, though you obviously won't get the full stereo experience with the Hands-free and Headset
profiles.
