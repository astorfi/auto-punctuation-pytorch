Followingyesterday’s announcement by NEC that the companywould soon be releasing a Yonah-powered laptop (and rumors that Apple would do the same), today Dell joined therace (unofficially so far as we can tell). Dell’s Yonah models will apparently include the Precision M90,Lattitude D620 and Lattitude D820, and will run at speeds from 1.66 GHz to 2.16GHz. The laptops are expected to ship inFebruary; no word yet on pics, pricing, or other specs, but we’ll keep our eyes open.
