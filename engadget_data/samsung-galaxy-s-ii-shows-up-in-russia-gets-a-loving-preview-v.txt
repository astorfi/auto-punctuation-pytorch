One such pre-production unit, of Samsung's dual-core Galaxy S II, has escaped into the Russian Ukrainian wilderness, where it's been thankfully rescued from the cold by the guys over at gagadget. Apart from squaring it up against the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 -- which we can only surmise was the nearest available Android handset, it surely can't have been the best -- they also dig pretty deeply into the latest TouchWiz UI and dish up a thoroughgoing gallery of sample images from that 8 megapixel autofocus camera on the back. It's an enlightening read, once you've enrolled Google Translate's help, though the video after the break might not be too informative if English is your only language. Still, it's a great visual tour of some yummy hardware.
