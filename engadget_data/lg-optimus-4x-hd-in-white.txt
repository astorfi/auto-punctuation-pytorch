This time the sole culprit is LG's Optimus 4X HD, which appears to have found a way into the hands of Taiwanese site ePrice. Aside from being dressed in a different outfit than the first time we took it for a spin, not much has changed under that quad-core hood, meaning it's still sporting a flavor of Android 4.0 while also retaining its renown 8.9mm slim figure. Chances are this isn't enough eye candy for you, though, so we're hooking you up with a video of this unicorn in discrete action after the break.

 Update: We've just added our own hands-on pictures from our recent trip to Seoul, and as you can see, our Quadrant benchmark scores (we ran it four times) only reached just above 4,000 -- a bit less than what we've see previously. That said, ePrice got just above 4,200 on its 4X HD, and things could change again when the device ships with final firmware, so we shall take a look again when that happens.
