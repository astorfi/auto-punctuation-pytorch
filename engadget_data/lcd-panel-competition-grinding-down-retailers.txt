 Retailers are feeling the pinch in the LCD panel market, according to an article in the New York Times. A glut of supply, slowing total market demand for LCD's at their current price points and shrinking margins is adding up to a headache for retailers. Even the selling of ancillary items to go along with HDTV purchases is getting tough. For example, fewer consumers are willing to pony up for extended warranties at the lower prices. And the Blu-ray / HD DVD format war doesn't help HD player sales, either. The NY Times article recommends waiting to purchase until after the holidays. But in the fast-moving world of tech, we believe there are only two times to buy -- now or never. There are great sets out there for good prices, and plenty of content as well, so what are you waiting for?[Via 1080eyes.com]
