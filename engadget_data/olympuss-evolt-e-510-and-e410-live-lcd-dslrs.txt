On the sensor side you'll be working with 10 megapixels at up to 1600 ISO on that Fourth Thirds lens mount, CF and xD card support, as well as making use of its newest-generation TruePic III image processor. The difference between the E-510 and E-410, however, isn't just in the $100 price gap: the E-510 also has OIS and a higher capacity battery (and the larger grip, so you know it from the 410 in the gallery). The body only E-510 will run you $799 in June 2007, while the E-410 will land for $699 in May.[Thanks, camerasnap]Read - E-510Read - E-410
