The limited edition Jaeger LeCoultre AMVOX2 chronograph not only boasts "over 200 parts to its casing and an equal number in the watch movement itself," but it will include a miniaturized form of the "DBS transponder electronics" within the base. Owners of the timepiece will be able to leave the key at home in a vault and crank their new ride up with the touch of a watch, but the convenience will cost you a stiff €25,000 ($34,465) on top of the car's purchase price.
