We know pretty much all there is to know about the LG G2 at this point, but we thought we'd have to wait until the official reveal event next month for release dates. Well, if Korean outlet The Kyunghyang Shinmun is to be believed, we'll have to keep wearing our fake surprise faces for that part of the presentation, too. A direct quote, apparently coming from LG Electronics' CFO David Jung (strangely, he's only referred to by title), pegs a release window of August for South Korea, September for North America and Europe, and October for all other regions. Furthermore, a different exec names Verizon as a US carrier partner, which would be the G2's third if the variant we've seen at the FCC is indeed destined for both AT&T and T-Mobile. For some reason, this new info has our Spidey-sense tingling (read: we cannot verify the accuracy of these reports), so we've reached out to LG for comment and will update this post if we hear anything more.
