Oddly enough, Sony still hasn't really copped to the problem, or even mentioned the fix in its 1.5 changelog, but reports of the fix are widespread, and we won't look a gift horse in the mouth. Joystiq notes that the fix does not include upscaling of PS1 or PS2 games, a much-desired feature for the HD-friendly PS3, but we'll take what we can get for now.[Via Joystiq]
