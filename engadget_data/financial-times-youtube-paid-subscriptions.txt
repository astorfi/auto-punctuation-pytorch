Rumored for several months, according to the FT's unnamed sources it will include up to 50 different channels, with subscription pricing starting at "as little as $1.99 a month." Google has already followed up, saying it had nothing to announce just yet, but that it was investigating "a subscription platform that could bring even more great content to YouTube."
