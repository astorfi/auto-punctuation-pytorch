 We haven't yet been able to confirm the reports starting to come over the wires, but it sounds like Apple's got an event cooking in San Francisco for September 12th. They typically like announcing these things about two weeks in advance, so it clicks, but we were kind of expecting something in October in terms of fall/winter buying season announcements from Cupertino. Of course, the predominant rumor going around right now is the iTunes Music Store movie support we've all been expecting for, well, forever, but we wouldn't peg anyhting for sure. Anywho, apparently this keynote will be beamed to London, possibly in lieu of a keynote at Apple Expo Paris, which also begins that day. We'll keep you informed!
