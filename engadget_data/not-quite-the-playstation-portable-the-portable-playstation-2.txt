We're still not exactly sure whether the PlayStation Portable will arrive on time or not, but if you can't wait
until next year, Ben Heckendorn has a step-by-step guide to portabilizing your PlayStation 2 (the funny part is that at
the end of the how-to he admits he only owns two games for the PS2). Should keep you busy at least until the real one
comes out.
