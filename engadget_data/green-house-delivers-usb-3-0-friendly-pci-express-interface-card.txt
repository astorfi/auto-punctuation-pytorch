 Like it or not (and honestly, why would you not?), USB 3.0 is upon us, and we're guessing it's just a matter of time before every single USB peripheral in the entire world is equipped with SuperSpeed support. Exaggerations aside, there's still a good chance that you'll snap up an item or two over the course of your life that could benefit from hastier transfer rates, and that's where Green House comes in. The Japanese-based outfit has just revealed a USB 3.0-compatible PCI Express interface card, enabling mildly ancient desktops to gain USB 3.0 support by simply slapping a card into a free PCIe slot. The company claims that you'll see maximum data transfer rates of 5Gbps, but you'll have to wait a few more months to snag it for Â¥3,780 ($42).
