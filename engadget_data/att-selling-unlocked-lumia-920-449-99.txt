 It's an understatement to say that the Lumia 920 is priced "to sell," and that doesn't just mean with AT&T's carrier subsidy. If you'd prefer to own your smartphone outright, you can snag the handset for $449.99 -- $100 less the Galaxy S III and $200 less than the iPhone 5. There's no word on when these pre-orders will begin to ship, but if you're that commitment-phobic, you're not gonna hold other people to deadlines, are you?
