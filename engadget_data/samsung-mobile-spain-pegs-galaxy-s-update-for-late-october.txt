Well, you know how these things tend to go: plans change, bugs crop up, engineers go on vacation at inopportune times, and delays happen. On that note, Samsung Mobile's Spanish division is now saying that the Galaxy S will be getting Froyo in "late October" through the Kies desktop app, though we don't know whether Espa√±a speaks for the rest of the world -- it's entirely possible that this is a Spain-specific announcement. More on this one as we get it, but for now, we wouldn't count on many (if any) of these bad boys getting official updates in the next few days.
