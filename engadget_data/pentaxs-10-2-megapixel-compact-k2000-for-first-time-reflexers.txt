Positioned as an entry-level DSLR for those looking to make the jump from point-and-shoot, the K2000 features dead-simple Auto Picture modes, a 10.2 megapixel CCD and 2.7-inch LCD offering 96% field of view, ISO 3200 sensitivity, and the vibrational dust removal system and Shake Reduction tech expected from a Pentax K-series shooter. All this housed in one of the smallest and lightest camera bodies in its class. The K2000 body ships only as part of a $700 kit containing a smc PENTAX DA L 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AL lens (a first from the affordable DA L series) and AF200FG flash starting in November. Optional $1,500 smc PENTAX DA 60-250mm f/4 ED[IF] SDM lens pictured after the break.Update: Hands-on preview of the K2000 (aka, the K-m as it's known in Europe) over at dpreview.
