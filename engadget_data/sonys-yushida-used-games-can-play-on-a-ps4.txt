In news that should keep parties going until the early morning at Gamestops everywhere, Sony Worldwide Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida tells Eurogamer that used games will still play on the PlayStation 4. Despite some issues with the translation, he stated clearly that "used games can play on a PS4." That appears to clearly put the issue to bed, despite rumors or patent misinterpretations passed around the internet recently. Now, we wait for our own chance to ask a few questions of Sony about its upcoming console like "what does it look like?", and the competition over at Microsoft goes on the hot seat with secondhand-loving gamers.
