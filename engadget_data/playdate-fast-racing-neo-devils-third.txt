Nintendo's seemingly forgotten about the futuristic, hyper-fast racing series F-Zero when it comes to a Wii U release, but developer Shinen hasn't. We first caught a glimpse of Fast Racing Neo at PAX this year and came away incredibly excited, so of course we're streaming it today. But that's not all: We're also going to spend some time with the troubled The Devil's Third from Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive mastermind Tomonobu Itagaki. Join myself and Sean Buckley as we broadcast two hours of Wii U games starting at 6 PM Eastern / 3 PM Pacific.



And while the games change on a day to day basis, where you can watch us playing them doesn't. Tune in either on this very post, the Engadget Gaming homepage, or, if you want to join our awesome community of chatters, Twitch.tv/Joystiq.
