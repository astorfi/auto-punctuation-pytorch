Sure, it's not the most detailed of portraits, but it's the first absolutely concrete evidence we have that the RM-670 exists and may be headed to the New World. The FCC paperwork lists 1700MHz AWS and 850/1900Mhz 3G bands, suggesting that the handset could potentially work on T-Mobile or AT&T. Other rumored specs doing the rounds include the new Symbian Belle OS, a 1GHz processor, NFC and a 3.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen -- as if those rounded contours weren't pleasing enough.
