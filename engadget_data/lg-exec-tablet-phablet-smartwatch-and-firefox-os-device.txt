LG's mobile communications head in Bulgaria, Dimitar Valev, has laid out some of the company's key plans in an interview with Dnevnik.bg. For starters, he confirmed that the company will fire up its temporarily mothballed tablet lines with a new model, likely the 9.8-inch V500 we saw at the FCC earlier today. On the smartphone side, LG will trump its 5.5-inch Optimus G Pro model with a 6-inch handset and finally release its own Firefox OS device early next year. Most intriguingly, he said the company would give the smartwatch category another kick at the can, despite indifference to LG's GD910 Watch Phone model several years ago -- adding that the device might use flexible LCD tech. We're not sure if Mr. Valev was speaking out of turn, but if accurate, it'll be interesting to see how the new hardware pans out -- especially LG's take on Firefox OS.
