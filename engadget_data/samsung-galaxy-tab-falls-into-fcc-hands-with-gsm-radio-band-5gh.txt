That's because when the Galaxy Tab hit the FCC by the name "SHW-M180S," it came loaded with dual-band 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi capable of speeds up to 150Mbps. It also intriguingly sports the GSM 1900 radio frequency, meaning an AT&T launch might be in the cards alongside the CDMA one rumored for Verizon. Browsing through the WiFi Alliance databases in an attempt to track the tablet down, we spotted both a "GT-P1000T" and a "GT-P1000L," each with dual-band WiFi, suggesting that there are multiple versions in the works... and the Global Certification Forum shows one of them actually has quad-band GSM and HSDPA connectivity. Not bad, Samsung. Now, let's hear about battery life.
