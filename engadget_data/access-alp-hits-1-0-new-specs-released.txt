First up, hardware: it should run on current generation devices, requiring at least a 200MHz ARM9 CPU (400MHz+ recommended), 64MB RAM and 64MB flash memory, and has support for input via QWERTY, 12-key with 5-way d-pad, and touchscreen (obviously) or digitizer (interesting!)with four or five hard keys. Interestingly, supported resolutions include QVGA (240 x 320), HVGA (320 x 480), and WVGA (800 x 480) -- where's the 320 x 320 Palm OS Treos have had since the 650? We dunno. ACCESS still hasn't announced any licensees, but unless ALP switches up and adds a square aspect ratio, it doesn't look like we'll see this running on any Treos as we know them today. Oh, app list after the break.[Via Download Squad]
