Case in point: just days ago at CES, DISH Network unveiled its 100 HD channels / 100 markets initiative, essentially throwing the ball back in DirecTV's court. Of course, the back-and-forth between the two sat providers is nothing but beneficial for end users, but we still believe that there is enough differentiation between the two to give users something to debate. That said, we present Keith's totally timely inquiry:"I live in Austin, Texas and I'm considering both DirecTV and DISH Network. For me, it basically comes down to channel lineup versus hardware. Though I like DirecTV's channel selection more, from all the research I've done, DISH has the better HD DVR. I am leaning towards DISH because I think adding more HD channels is much easier than manufacturing and then distributing a new receiver. What do you guys think? Am I off base here?" We'll be straight with you -- we're not looking to incite any sort of flame war with the above question. Indeed, it's a legitimate concern that a myriad individuals mull over on a daily basis. So we're posing the question to you, and we're looking for your input on the performance of your HD DVR, the general quality of service, appearance of HD channels and overall satisfaction. C'mon -- give poor Keith some advice to keep him from tearing any more patches of hair out, would ya?Got a burning question that you'd love to toss out for Engadget HD (or its readers) to take a look at?
