Apparently Facebook's found the silver bullet for developing its Android apps: crowdsourcing bug testers. In an effort to make Messenger more stable for everyone, Zuckerberg and Co. are asking adventurous Google fans to help work out the application's kinks before new features are released to the general public. The process essentially mirrors what we saw with the open beta for its main app last year. Just sign up for the related Google Group, tick the "become a tester" box in the Play store, download the app, turn on automatic updates and voila you're getting early access to new features. Should a glitch pop up, Facebook asks that you report it with the in-app dialog box. Simple enough, right? Naturally, as is often the case with beta tests, those new bells and whistles might make the app a touch less stable than you're used to.
