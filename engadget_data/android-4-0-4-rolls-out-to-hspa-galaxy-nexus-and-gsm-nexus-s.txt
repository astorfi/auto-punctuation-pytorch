  Let's just say you have an HSPA+ Samsung Galaxy Nexus (I9250) or a UMTS / GSM Nexus S (I9020). It may behoove you, then, to begin frantically checking your phone to see if any updates are available, because Google has taken to its favorite social network to announce that Android 4.0.4 is rolling out to these devices as well as the Motorola Xoom WiFi, as we reported earlier. This news comes nearly two weeks after we learned from our sources that the Nexus S update was nigh at hand, and only hours after the AOSP became available. This is incredibly exciting for anyone who wasn't able to download ICS on their Nexus S before the update was pulled, and equally thrilling for owners that have been using the version Google disowned since this past December. Heck, it's jubilant enough to make any fan of firmware updates shout with glee. Ready for the asterisk? It's not rolling out to the CDMA counterparts... at least, not yet. It's hard to say what that really means. Are the Verizon Galaxy Nexus and Sprint Nexus S 4G being considered second-class citizens, demoted to as lengthy a wait as the droves of other Gingerbread devices? We're reaching out for word on when (or if) we can expect the refresh to hit these handsets, but Mountain View's lips are shut in the meantime.  [image courtesy Mirzet Kadic]
