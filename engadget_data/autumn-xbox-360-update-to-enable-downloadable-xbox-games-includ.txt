Games are reported to cost 1200 points, (around $15), and the games list is expected to grow over time. Of course, Microsoft hasn't confirmed any of this yet, but December is right around the corner -- looks like we'll find out soon enough.Update: Well, that didn't take long -- according to Microsoft, downloadable "Xbox Originals" will be available starting on December 4th.[Via Joystiq]
