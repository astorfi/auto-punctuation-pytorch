According to some anonymous-type sources over at The Verge, Microsoft is set to continue its shift away from Zuneland into the world of Woodstock -- that's reportedly the codename of a new Spotify-like service set to make its debut at this year's E3. According to the reports, the tiny yellow bird of a service will work across platforms (think Windows 8, iOS, Android and, of course, the Xbox, amongst others), thanks, at least in part, to browser-based functionality. The service is said to be set to launch later in the year, around the same as some key MS operating systems.
