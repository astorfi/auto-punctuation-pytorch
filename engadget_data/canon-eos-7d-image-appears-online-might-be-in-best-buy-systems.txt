That flash button would indicate the presence of a built-in flash, and those mic holes hint at video features, but apart from that we've got little else to go on -- there are whispers that the Best Buy inventory system is listing the body at $2700 and the kit with an EF 28-135 lens at $2900, but we can't verify those at the moment. We're dying to find out more about this one, stay tuned.[Thanks, manhog]Read - 7D image at dpreview forumsRead - 7D in Best Buy systems at Canon Rumors
