 
Polaroid has officially gone off the deep end, as a willing accomplice in Lady Gaga's crazy schemes. The new Grey Label line also includes a rebirth for Polaroid as an instant camera company, with a sexy new GL30 Instant Digital Camera with built-in printer, a separate GL10 Instant Mobile Printer, and Lady Gaga's bizarre triumph: the GL20 Camera Glasses (pictured), which include a built-in camera and dual LCDs which appear to cover your eyes when you're wearing the oversized shades. This CES marks a full year of Polaroid's collaboration with Lady Gaga, and while the glasses are possibly the least commercially viable device to be announced this year (in the best possible way), the classy new camera and printer might just make up for it. Both devices are using Zink technology for the instant printing, which Polaroid has been using in a much uglier way in its OneStep cameras, but the new devices have a retro sort of look that we're really digging. For the most part specs are light, including the GL30's megapixel count, but the GL10 printer will be out in May for $150, while the GL30 camera and the GL20 glasses don't have prices and will be available "later this year."
