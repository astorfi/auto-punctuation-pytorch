And if you want to do the logo any justice, you have to take the "space" literally, so it comes out something like: my[____]. Get it? We don't, but that isn't stopping the News Corp-owned social networking site and haunt for all things tweenaged and tweemo (as well as the world's foremost Blingee! repository) from re-launching with a new design, a new homepage, and a new focus as an entertainment portal. Makes sense to us, although we really just wish they'd get around to production on that Myspace Media Player already. Get a preview for yourself after the break.
