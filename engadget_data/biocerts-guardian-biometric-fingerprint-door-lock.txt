So if an RFID-enabled lock doesn't strike your fancy, maybe a good old-fashioned biometric
fingerprint lock will suit your style better. At least BioCert hopes so, as they're directly marketing their BioCert
Guardian biometric door lock as a security solution for home and home office users. The $200 lock runs on 4 AA
batteries that will apparently last for a whole year, and it'll hold up to 138 users, who can quickly be enrolled right
at the door.
