 Believe it or not, we've but three days before this year's Black Friday arrives, and Best Buy has just unveiled that it will be offering up Toshiba's Satellite A135-S7403 laptop and a Canon PIXMA 3-in-1 printer for the low, low price of $229. We've already seen Dell throw out a $399 lappie, but this machine hits even lower by offering up a totally weak (but potentially satisfactory) 1.73GHz Intel Celeron M 530 processor, 512MB of DDR2 RAM, an 80GB 5,400RPM SATA drive, 802.11b/g WiFi, Windows Vista Home Basic, Ethernet, a dual-layer DVD burner, GMA950 integrated graphics set and a 15.4-inch WXGA (1,280 x 800) TruBrite panel. Furthermore, you'll find four USB 2.0 ports, a PCMCIA slot, built-in speakers, a Li-ion battery, 56k modem and a multicard reader for good measure. Best Buy claims that each store will have a minimum of 20 bundles on hand, but you better show up early in order to secure a ticket. Check out a few more shots of the pair after the jump.[Via Notebooks]
