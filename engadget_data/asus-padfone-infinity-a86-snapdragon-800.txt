Following the original ASUS PadFone Infinity (A80) with Snapdragon 600 SoC, rumors of a new "PadFone Infinity A86" (or "PadFone T004") go as far back as July 20th, with benchmark evidence showing a more powerful Snapdragon 800 enabling this mysterious device. While details are still light, several eagle-eyed PadFone fans have started noticing a new name on ASUS' tech support page: "The new PadFone Infinity." Assuming this is more of an official name and less of a placeholder, it looks like we'll be seeing an identical-looking device sporting Qualcomm's latest piece of silicon; and perhaps a launch is imminent -- maybe at IFA next week? But ASUS, it really wouldn't hurt if you guys can throw in a microSD slot plus a dedicated keyboard dock as well this time. Remember the original PadFone? Good times.
