That will be available for $550 (sans contract), and you'll be able to activate it on one of the carrier's new month-to-month tablet rate plans, which run from $15 a month for 300MB of data to $80 for 12GB -- Sprint says it's also waiving activation fees on all 3G/4G tablets "for a limited time." As for the tablet itself, it comes with a speedier 1.5GHz dual-core processor than the WiFi-only model (which clocked in at 1GHz), but looks to otherwise be the same 10.1-inch device, right down to the now somewhat dated Android 4.0 for an OS -- no word on a planned upgrade to 4.1 or 4.2 just yet.
