Less than two weeks after making an unofficial appearance, today Adidas is formally introducing its new wearable, the miCoach Fit Smart. Revealed in San Francisco, during the Wearable Technologies Conference 2014, this wristband is capable of measuring your burned calories, heart rate, distance covered, pace and more fitness stats. Better yet, it wants to look good while doing so. It's going to be available in black and white, featuring a strap made of soft-touch silicone (similar to Nike's FuelBand SE) and a small strip of LEDs which can change color depending on the intensity of a workout. While the Fit Smart isn't Adidas' first entry into the wearable fray, one that's now more crowded than ever, the sports gear company says it is approaching things differently with its new product. It wants to appeal not only to die-hard runners, like with the Android-based Smart Run watch, but also to those people who would like to start running and working out on a more consistent basis.








Unsurprisingly, a big part of the Fit Smart is Adidas' miCoach technology and ecosystem. "What we did, by working with elite coaches, was bring an experience to help people set weekly goals and training plans," Paul Gaudio, GM of digital sports at Adidas, told Engadget about the practicality of the companion miCoach apps. "We took the things that have been very successful and implemented them here with the Fit Smart." Gaudio also emphasized that the Fit Smart isn't just for zealous athletes, telling us, "It is about encouraging people to get active and stay active. It can also be a motivational tool; it can coach you to be better."
