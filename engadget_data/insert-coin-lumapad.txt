 In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line.
 Soundlazer's parametric speaker pushed music in one direction, making it great for impromptu discos in confined spaces. But you can't have a party without some fancy lighting, so Soundlazer creator Richard Haberkern cooked up the Lumapad, a WiFi-enabled LED lamp. The open-source hardware houses 32 high-power LEDs that push out light a t up to 8,000 lumens and has Electric Imp and Arduino expandability. There's even a mobile app to let you control the visual rhythms without consigning yourself behind a lighting deck. Haberken needs to raise $28,000 before the project can go ahead, with a pledge of $329 enough for you to get one of your own. Not convinced? Head on past the break to watch the man beg for your patronage.



  
  Previous Project Update: It's early days for HeatMeter, but the project has already raised around a sixth of that project goal.
