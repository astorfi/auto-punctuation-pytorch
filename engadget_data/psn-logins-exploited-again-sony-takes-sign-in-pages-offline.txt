The issue? If you legitimately forget your password and need to reset it, previously all you had to do was type in your e-mail address and date of birth, then choose a delightfully cunning new password. Sounds good? The problem is that if you were a PSN member before the hack then both your e-mail address and your date of birth (plus a lot of other frightening stuff) is known to the hackers. So, whoever has the millions of rows of data that were exposed could, in theory, re-exploit any account. Sony was made aware of the issue and those pages are now offline again, which should make the Japanese government feel just a little big smug.

Update: Sony has confirmed that there was "a URL exploit that we have subsequently fixed." However, the company indicates there was "no hack involved." So, remember kiddies: exploits are not hacks -- not until someone starts having fun with them, anyway.
