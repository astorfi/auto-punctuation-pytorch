Available in retro-futurist red or sober, serious black, the RetroN 3 gaming system is compatible with your Nintendo, Sega Genesis, and SNES cartridges. And if that weren't enough for you (it seldom is, is it?) you can use a pair of the original controllers from either of those three systems. If that seems too awesome, it also packs its own wireless controllers. Available now for $70.
