So we'll cut to the chase: apparently our friend
Bill Gates told a German newspaper he thinks
the success of the iPod isn't much more than just a flash in the pan. We're not try to get all iPod apologist on you or
anything (though we can anticipate the comments), and we do agree that convergence is the wave of the future, but what
we found best about this was when it went from a simple statement of opinion to a bigger PR slip: "If you were to ask
me which mobile device will take top place for listening to music, I'd bet on the mobile phone for sure." Uh, did
anyone clue him in on the forthcoming
Motorola/Apple iTunes phones?
No?
