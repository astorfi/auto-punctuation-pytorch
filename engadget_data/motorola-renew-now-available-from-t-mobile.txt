Motorola's W233 Renew candybar for T-Mobile isn't going to blow anyone away with its spec sheet, but it might just blow away a few Cal Berkeley tree sitters with its plastics recovered from recycled water bottles, carbon neutral rating, 100 percent recyclable materials, and manufacturing process that requires 20 percent less energy than your average mobile. It features Moto's CrystalTalk noise reduction tech, support for microSD expansion up to 2GB, 128 x 128 display, and an impressive 9 hours of talk time, but maybe the most impressive part is the price: $9.99 on contract. The Renew is available direct from T-Mobile starting today.
