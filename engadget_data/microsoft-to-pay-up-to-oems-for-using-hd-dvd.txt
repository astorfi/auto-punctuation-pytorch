 Microsoft mustapparently have a lot more at stake in the success of HDDVD than we realized, since apparently they're said to be offering up "coupons" -- or certain cashincentives -- to manufacturers who use HD DVD drives in their future machines. According to the EE Times, Microsoft isalso making HD DVD support "free" in Vista, whereas they could be passing along up to a $30 charge inlicensing for Blu-ray support. That drive support licensing figure might sound a little unfair, granted, but rememberthat Microsoft does have an extensive, long standing intellectual property licensing partnership with Toshiba, whichcould well entitle them to access HD DVD technology, whereas other companies might have to pay for up for the verysame. (For example, if Microsoft didn't have that partnership, they might well have to pony up that $30 licensing feefor both formats, not just Blu-ray.) It's all a bit cyclical when it comes to the chicken-and-egg partnering/licensingangle though (and we'll refrain from using the M-word for now), but one thing's for sure, a "coupon" toincentivize HD DVD adoption on the part of OEMs is very unsettling at best, and it sounds like Microsoft isn't about tojust lie down and let the forthcoming format war sort itself out.[Via CNET, thanks BK]
