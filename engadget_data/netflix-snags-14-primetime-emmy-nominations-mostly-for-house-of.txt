Netflix's push into original content has received its latest positive feedback from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, netting 14 nominations for the 65th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards. Most of those went to standout series House of Cards, which was nominated for Most Outstanding Drama, with Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright nominated for outstanding lead actor and actress awards. The fourth season of Arrested Development also received recognition with three nominations, while Hemlock Grove is on the list for two. Netflix will need to launch a few more hits if it wants to pass other players in the entertainment space (HBO's Game of Thrones received 16 nominations by itself while the network totaled 108, for example), but with these first-ever nominations for streaming content, it's off to a good start.
