 For the second time in less than a year Apple head Tim Cook has taken a trip across the Pacific and headed to China. What exactly the purpose of his visit is and what's on his schedule is a bit of a mystery, but it does appear he met with Miao Wei, head of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The two likely discussed the country's broader tech efforts, as well as Apple's operations which Cook toured back in March. With the communist republic becoming increasingly important to Apple's bottom line -- accounting for $23.8 billion in revenue in 2012 -- we wouldn't be shocked to see trips to the far east become a regular part of the CEO's schedule.
