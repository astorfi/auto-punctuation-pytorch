 
 We got a look at Fujitsu's Arrows Tab at CEATEC last year, and the 10.1-inch tablet is making an appearance yet again -- this time running Windows 8 rather than Android Honeycomb. Exact specs were MIA, but the slate sports a front-facing camera along with a rear-facing shooter, plus a micro-USB port and a microSD card slot. Rather than the shiny plastic backing we saw last year, this device has a slightly textured, metallic finish, and it sports much sharper corners than the earlier version's more curved design.

 A booth worker did confirm that the Arrows Tab is waterproof like last year's model, and while he wouldn't provide exact availability, he said the tablet will launch within the October-November time frame. Last year's Arrows Tab F-01 LTE debuted on NTT DoCoMo, and given Japan's penchant for hydrophobic gadgets, it's safe to say that the device will be targeted at this country in particular. Head past the break for a quick video hands-on.
