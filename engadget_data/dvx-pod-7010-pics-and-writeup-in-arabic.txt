Last time we checked, most Arabic-speaking nations weren't, er,
Taiwan, but it looks like someone out there somehow got
their lucky little mitts on our gadget crush du jour, the Mobinote DVX-POD 7010 personal video player. They've
posted a boatload of pics, but for obvious reasons we can't exactly read the review the author gave of it. We're going
to put words in their mouths and say they absofreakinglutely love it.
