 If you've been feeling left out because your cable provider decided to start using Switched Digital Video (SDV) to deliver your favorite channels, don't worry because the FCC has your back. Today the FCC's Enforcement Bureau proposed to fine TWC and Cox's Fairfax County system because they "apparently willfully violated" the requirement to support third party CableCARD devices. Time Warner got slapped with a fine of 40 large, with Cox only getting half that at $20,000 -- this is in addition to the refunds both will be required to issue to affected customers. This is definitely a score for the little guy, and we sure are glad the FCC stepped up on this one, but luckily for all the parties involved, the Tuning Adapter will solve this problem long term. Now if only more providers would start making them available. [Disclosure: Engadget is part of the Time Warner family]
