Now it's no coincidence that this cube bears more than a passing resemblance to his similarly colored and sized bro' Rubik since The House owns the rights to said wunderkind in Japan. Unfortunately, this cube doesn't move, unless you mean the colored lights which do their best to keep time with the beat off any 3.5-mm attached audio source. Sure, it has a tiny 27-mm cone speaker integrated as well, but with a power rating of just 125mW x 2ch, why bother. Available at the end of the month in Japan for Â¥5,250 or right around $44.
