 NextGeneration is reporting that according to "well-placed industry sources" they have word that Sony is indeedplanning an Xbox Live competitor, andmaybe a little bit more. The story is that Sony will be dubbing the subscription service "HUB" and that itwill serve PSP users along with PS3 owners. Supposedly Howard Stringer also wants "all media content to beavailable for distribution over PlayStation HUB" which jives with what we were hearing from thatPlayStation Magazine article about a service "like the iTunes Music Store." Next Gen claims that Sony will beannouncing HUB within the next few weeks, and as a side note mention rumblings of a September 16 launch date in Japanfor the PS3, followed by September 21 launch in the US. Hope Sony fills us in soon though, 'cause we're sure how manymore PS3 leaks we can take.
