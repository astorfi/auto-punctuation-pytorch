Up first is the YHT-790 5.1-channel system, which boasts a SCENE mode to "instantly access any entertainment source and surround sound experience," YPAO system calibration, two HDMI inputs (and one output), Sirius / XM Radio comparability and the ability to stream music channeled in from A2DP-equipped devices if the (optional) YBA-10 is plugged in. As for the YHT-690, you'll notice a 720p / 1080i upscaling DVD player tossed in, while the slightly less powerful YHT-590 / YHT-390 provide just the basics for a few bills less.
