One tidbit that stood out was the announcement that the Wii will always be connected to the internet, using a service called Wii Connect 24. The service will allow the Wii to download game updates and other info while the box is in standby mode. We're not really sure we want our game console to be downloading directives while we sleep, but it can't be any worse than Windows AutoUpdate, right?
