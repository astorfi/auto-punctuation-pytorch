 Toshiba did have a new announcement at its CES press conference today. Slotting in between the just shipped HD-A2 (pictured) and HD-XA2 HD DVD players, the HD-A20 will provide the standard feature set of the HD-A2 with the 1080p output featured in the high end HD-XA2. Hitting streets this spring, it will retail at $599, but does not include other HD-XA2 features like Deep Color support -- and presumably not HDMI 1.3 either -- or its enhanced video DAC and additional PQ settings.Update: Added HD-A20 images
