Apple already has an agenda-like notification tray in iOS 7, but there are new hints that it may upgrade that functionality soon. Both AppleInsider and TechCrunch report that Apple has acquired iOS developer Cue for at least $35 million. The deal would give Cupertino technology that creates agendas based on email and other personal information; like Google Now, Cue displays meetings and other events in interactive cards. Apple is only acknowledging the purchase with a familiar statement that it occasionally "buys smaller technology companies," and won't discuss its plans. As such, there's no way of knowing if or when Cue's features will surface in Apple products. Still, we won't be surprised if a future iOS release automatically generates rich daily calendars.
