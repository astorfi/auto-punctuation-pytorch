Just weeks after the FCC tipped us off on a new pair of netbooks that are all but definitely slated for a CES unveiling, Lenovo has no one but its web administrator(s) to blame for this one. A "New product showcase" portal over on the outfit's site has just revealed a half dozen new lappies that are slated to go on sale starting January 5th - 7th, with the ultra-sleek 13.3-inch ThinkPad Edge (pictured above) leading the way. Said rig boasts up to 7.8 hours of battery life, a dual-core CPU, Windows 7, Bluetooth and WiMAX options, integrated WWAN / GPS, WiFi, a spill-resistant keyboard, three USB ports, a 5-in-1 media card reader and an option for a red paint job. There's also a sub-3 pound ThinkPad X100e ultraportable with an 11.6-inch display, AMD processor and an only-available-overseas Arctic White color option. The T410, T410s, T510 and W510 are bringing up the rear, with their (admittedly brief) specification lists spelled out in the source links below.
