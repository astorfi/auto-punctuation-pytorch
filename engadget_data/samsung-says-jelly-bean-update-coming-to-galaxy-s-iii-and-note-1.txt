That is at least a bit more encouraging than the "later this year" that we last heard for the Note 10.1, and follows a leak of an official GS3 Jelly Bean build earlier this month. The original Galaxy Note wasn't specifically mentioned on stage, but it did make an appearance on the company's Jelly Bean slide, so we'd assume an update for it is coming as well, if not necessarily "very soon."
