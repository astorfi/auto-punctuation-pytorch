 Infiniti's G35 may be the mostexpensive CD ripper you ever bought (or lusted after, anyway). The new 2007 G35 has an in-dash system apparentlyoutfitted with not only a CompactFlash slot, but a CDplayer that will also rip and encode your CDs for storage on an internal drive of unspecified size (we're really hopingthe "9.5G" mentioned in the article is a model designation, and not capacity). Sure, it might just be easierto have a removable drive (or USB port) for dropping already-rippedor, um, downloaded songs into your car, but Infiniti must not expect the unclean to understand luxe doesn't alwaysmean ease.[Via AnythingBut iPod]
