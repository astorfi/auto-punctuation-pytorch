        Just because it's the weekend doesn't mean you can't win more kit from Engadget. Check it out, today we're throwing up an Xbox 360 Premium bundle. Just in case you haven't been reading Engadget for the last year or so, here's what it comes with:

Xbox 360 console (soon with 1080p output!)
20GB drive add-on
Wireless controller
Xbox headset
Component high def AV cable
Ethernet cable

You'll have until Thursday the 28th to enter; we'll pick somebody at random who tells us in the comments what their favorite 360 game is, and who follows these rules:

You may enter other Engadget contests, however...
You may only enter this contest once; if you enter more than once on this particular contest post you'll be automatically disqualified and barred from all future giveaways. (Yes, we have robots that thoroughly check to ensure fairness.) You may enter future Engadget relaunch giveaway contests!
You can only win once. (If you win and then try to go for a second prize during our relaunch giveaways, you'll be automatically disqualified, etc.)
Contest is open to everybody! (This is a US unit, however.)
You will be shipped your Xbox in a few weeks when all our contests are over. Thanks for your patience!

Ok everybody, good luck! Oh, by the way, check out our other contests going on right now!

Be the first to win a Zune!
We got two Slingboxes for ya, too!
And a Philips 42PF9631D 42-inch plasma!
