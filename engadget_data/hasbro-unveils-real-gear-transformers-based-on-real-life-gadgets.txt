See: Speed Dial 800 (pictured), which seems to have copped his look from a Star Trek, or Power Up VT6, which from what we can tell is the unholy marriage of Sega Game Gear and first-gen Game Boy Advance. Pics of all the new Real Gear Transformers (with our guesses as to which devices they likeliest correspond to) in the gallery.[Via Crave]
