 While we all read the long list of new HD channels DirecTV will be bringing to us this fall, it is always good to get more details. We now know that the History Channel HD will launch -- on at least DirecTV -- this fall as a simulcasted version of the SD channel. This is certainly more exciting than the upconverted Weather channel we learned about last week, but we are still a long way from 100 HD channels this year. 100 HD channels or not, DirecTV is poised to be the provider to be reckonged with when it comes to HD, now if only they could work out all those bugs in the HR20.
