 Best Buy's Canadian site just got a hardware surprise from Nintendo, the Wii mini. It looks like the retailer jumped the gun but unfortunately, it doesn't reveal much else aside from a December 7th release date. Rumors of a console refresh have circulated over the last few days and while the preorder link isn't live just yet, but you can spot the Wii mini's new red and black design, which looks to be only slightly taller than the original Wiimote. The Wii's successor launched only a few weeks earlier in the US, managing to sell 400,000 units in its first week. We've contacted Nintendo and we'll have more when we hear it.
