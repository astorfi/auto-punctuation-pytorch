That, of course, brings with it mobile hotspot functionality for iPhones, along with a variety of new AirPlay features, a new and improved version of Safari, and a number of other more minor improvements and fixes (like an option to control how your iPad's side switch behaves). We're already busy testing it out ourselves and will report back on what we find, but you can feel free to leave your own first impressions in the comments below in the meantime -- Apple's complete list of what's included in the update is after the break.
