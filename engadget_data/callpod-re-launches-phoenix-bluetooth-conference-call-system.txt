For those who've managed to think about more than this revolution in the all-too-exciting world of conference calling since January, let's recap. Essentially, the Phoenix MCS enables five BT headsets to communicate with each other in full duplex over a more than a 300,000-square foot area. Additionally, the base station is completely mobile and packs a rechargeable Li-ion battery good for around 8-hours of talk time (120-hours in standby). When we pinged Callpod to retrieve the highly secretive pricing information, we were told that we'd have to "speak to a sales representative to get a better idea." Hope you're up for a chat.
