The never ending battle between Korean manufacturers Samsung and LG has moved to its inevitable next level, as LG has introduced an even larger super high-res OLED than its competitor's 55-inch models. The new high water mark is this 77-inch Ultra HD curved OLED it's showing off at IFA 2013, which is a step up in pretty much every way possible and even makes us recall the LCD size wars of the mid '00s. Whether or not we asked for it, it's bringing new display technology, a rare shape and of course, that truly outstanding size. It's only a concept now, but so was the $15,000 55-inch version at one point so we'd suggest keeping your black card handy.

Unmatched in picture quality, this enormous, futuristic-looking TV is "a true home entertainment wonder that has to be seen to be believed," Kwon said.Visitors to IFA 2013 can see LG's beautiful 77-inch ULTRA HD CURVED OLED TV for themselves by visiting Hall 11.2 at Messe Berlin.# # #
