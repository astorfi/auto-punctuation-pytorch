 They're playing Christmas music on all the radio stations and government buildings have begun decking the halls with non-denominational decorations. All of this can only mean one thing: it's time for the mad holiday rush. Once you've polished off that turkey dinner and put on a pair of your least flattering sweatpants, be sure join us after the break for some of the merriest deals on consumer electronics that the internet -- and your local big box shop -- has to offer. Yes, ladies and gentleman, it's Black Friday time.



 Phones 
  Sprint's got some solid deals on Samsung handsets this year, like a 16GB Galaxy S III for $50 (on contract, naturally). Not cheap enough? How about a Galaxy Nexus for $0 after a $50 rebate?  Free will also get you the Droid RAZR MAXX at Best Buy with a two-year Verizon contract.  Speaking of Samsung, you can get your hands on a Galaxy Reverb for $100 over at Virgin Mobile. Another $99, meanwhile, will get you an HTC EVO V 4G.  AT&T will be celebrating Black Friday with a "refurb blowout sale," offering up used handsets starting at one-cent. Tablets

Newegg has the 16GB Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 WiFi 7-incher for $250. Home Entertainment  Head over to a local Walmart on Friday and you can get your hands on an LG BP125 Blu-ray player for a cool $38.  Those movies should look pretty good on a new $688 Vizio E-Series 60-inch Class Razor Smart TV for Walmart -- or, if you go straight to the source, you can pick up a 70-incher for $1,699 on Vizio's site.  Over at Best Buy, you can grab a 40-inch Toshiba HDTV for $180 and pair it up with a $40 smart Blu-ray player from the company.  Sony's dropped $750 off of its 54.6-inch HX750 over on its site.

  Ol' Major Nelson's got the lowdown on where you can get some sweet Xbox deals, including a couple of $200 console bundles from a glut of stores. Yep, there's Kinect in there, too.  And what's a console with out games? Microsoft will be offering up a number of Xbox 360 titles at $9 a pop.  Steam's got some deep gaming discounts as well, on titles like Darksider II and Age of Empires III.  Granted, it's not a Wii U, but Mario fans can nab Nintendo's last-gen console for $89 in-store at Walmart. The store is also offering up a 250GB PS3 with an Uncharted Dual Pack and Infamous collection for $199. Etc. 
  It may not glow, but Barnes & Noble's Nook Simple Touch is a great e-reader nonetheless, and you can score one for $49, courtesy of Target.  $49 will also get you Kobo's adorable new Mini reader, should you find yourself in a Best Buy on Friday. You can also take advantage of the deal in a local indie bookseller listed here.  Who among us couldn't use a little more portable storage? For $60, you get 750GB of Seagate backup through Newegg.
