Acer is known to refresh its Android tablet line-up at CES, and this year is no different. Ahead of the madness, the company has just announced new 7.9-inch and 7-inch models: the Iconia A1-830 and the Iconia B1-720.


The 7.9-inch A1 is the more premium of the two, with an aluminum backing and an IPS display for wide viewing angles (albeit with a ho-hum 1,024 x 768 resolution). It runs Android Jelly Bean 4.2.1 with an Atom processor and 1GB of RAM under the hood. There's 16GB of on-board memory (expandable to 32GB via micro-SD card), and the rear camera lets you shoot at a 2,560 x 1,920 resolution. Of course, at $180 $149, it's still on the cheap side, but it looks to be a good low-end option, with up to seven hours of battery life to boot. The A1-830 be available in early 2014, and Acer will sell an optional keyboard and cover as well.


Now in the ultra-affordable category: the Iconia B1-720 costs $130, and your money buys you a basic slate that's nonetheless faster than last year's version. You get a 1.3GHz dual-core processor with 1GB of RAM, and the device is rated for up to five hours of battery life. The patterned finish is a touch classier than the previous B1's glossy backing, too. The 7-incher will hit North America later this month, alongside an optional protective case. Check back later this week, when we get a chance to check out both tabs in person.


Update: Acer made a last-minute pricing change to the A1-830 tablet: it will now cost $149 in North America, not $180.
