The "Vogue" has just gotten hooked up with regulatory approval, and though the documentation is kept to a bare minimum, we've already heard enough to suspect that Qualcomm's pride and joy (CDMA, that is) will be the lucky recipient of a TouchFLO-enabled handset in the not-too-distant future. Where the Vogue is ultimately headed remains to be seen -- but it could be argued that both Sprint and Verizon are in pretty desperate need of a smartphone lineup overhaul, so by all means, bring it on.
