The first full render of the HTC Runnymede has leaked and as you can see, it's one big heap of telephone. It's the first phone to benefit from the company's partnership with Beats Audio and will come with a pair of Beats-branded cans rather than regular earbuds. If you missed the specs first time around, the 4.7-inch, 9.9mm thick phone gets a beastly 768MB of RAM, 1.5GHZ Qualcomm chip and a serious 8 megapixel camera with f2.2 lens and double LED flash round back. Availability is still up in the air but we know that UK prices are £499 or £530 for the 16 or 32GB versions (roughly $790 and $840, respectively).

	HTC also apparently thinks that women don't buy enough of its phones, so it's releasing the HTC Bliss, a smartphone that's reportedly designed specifically for women. HTC's belief is that the ladyphone needs to be smaller, gentler and do generally less than its contemporaries -- it gets a much smaller 3.7-inch Super LCD display and a 5 megapixel camera. This is my next has also confirmed that the Bliss comes with an accessory called the Charm Indicator, a light-up bauble that fits to a handbag or bracelet (depending on size) and flashes when your phone requires attention. There's no word on pricing or availability but presumably all will be revealed at the stylish HTC promo event on the 20th.
