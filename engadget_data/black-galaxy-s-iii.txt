We saw hints of a darker shade of the Galaxy S III in Germany back in June, but even then we weren't totally convinced of its pedigree. More recently there have been rumors of a black Galaxy S III coming to independent retailers in the UK, but with nothing formal to back them up. So, now we have this: an animation of a very black and very glossy flagship, rotating on a lofty pedestal over at T-Mo's official US site. Can we finally relax and say it exists for sure, or did T-Mo perhaps paint it to make their site look more uniform? More to the point, would anyone hold out for this rather than snap up the ever-popular white variant right now?
