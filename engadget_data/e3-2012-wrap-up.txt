 
 Greetings from -- actually, scratch that, we're all back home now, but we had a blast spending the week in sunny, smoggy downtown Los Angeles -- even if this year's Electronics Entertainment Expo wasn't exactly the most exciting in recent memory. After all, neither Sony nor Microsoft gave us much in the way of new hardware, and Nintendo, the one member of the big three with a new console for 2012, didn't show off much that we hadn't already seen. We did, however, get our hands on a fair share of hardware and we're generally impressed by some software innovation, like Microsoft's SmartGlass. If you happened to miss something during the gaming news deluge (not to mention the fact that Computex happened to be going on at the same time), feel free to catch up on our coverage after the break.
