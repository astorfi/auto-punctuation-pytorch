On paper, this multimedia powerhouse has just about everything you could ask for given it's sub-$400 price tag, but if you've been hesitant to pull the trigger before someone else gave you the low down, head on past the break for all the deets you crave.
      

 

DesignAfter prying the A3 out of its subtle but sexy packaging, we were a tad turned off by the somewhat inelegant design. Sure, there's plenty of clean lines and hints of chrome, but we just can't help but feel that the D-pad and right-aligned buttons detract from the overall look. Additionally, this bugger had plenty of heft, and quite frankly, felt like a small brick when compared to a 60GB 5G iPod. Granted, this device can mop the floor in terms of utility with the aforementioned 'Pod, so we suppose a bit more weight is a fair trade for some. As for pocketability, the A3 isn't exactly first in class, but every time we thought about how uncomfortable this thing would be when shoved into a pocket, that luscious 4-inch display kept coaxing us into believing that everything was a-okay. Overall, we do feel that the A3 could stand to hit the gym, but for folks eying a PMP for video more so than audio, it's pretty much right on par with the competition.
