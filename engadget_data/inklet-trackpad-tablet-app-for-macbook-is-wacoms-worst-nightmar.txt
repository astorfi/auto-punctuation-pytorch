Not us -- we just keep things in our heads which is probably for the best, but Ten One Design -- maker of Pogo Stylus and Pogo Sketch -- has just come up with a new solution for MacBook artists. The Inklet app essentially converts your multitouch trackpad into a drawing tablet by adding pressure sensitivity when using with a Pogo Sketch, as well as "advanced palm rejection" which lets you rest your hand while drawing or writing. As you can see in one of the videos after the break, you can also quickly adjust your canvas area at your convenience. $24.95 and it's yours, Picasso.
