 Wouldn't you know it? No, really -- didn't you completely understand that Nintendo wouldn't be releasing something as magnificent as a stark white GameCube controller in the States? Okay, so maybe NoA hasn't made that official, but we're betting the unit you see there on the right will be a (highly coveted) Japanese exclusive. Apparently the Big N is re-issuing a Wii-white GameCube controller in its homeland this month with an extended (3-meter) cord, and while we can't glean any pricing information from the crumb of information out there right now, go ahead and start stacking those pennies for use on your favorite importer.[Via Joystiq]Update: Apparently it'll cost around $20. Thanks, Chebwa!
