But since we've now seen it (and felt it) in most of its glory, we shouldn't be surprised that its creator's taken the time to put together a quick promotional vid ahead of an expected launch next month. The MediaPad 10 teaser, naturally, touts many of the slate's own features, including the sensational 1920 x 1200 IPS display, Huawei's in-house K3 Balong CPU, as well as its "refined metallic surface" and "luxurious yet subtle" design. Of course, there's a lot more where that came from, so head on past the break to watch the ballyhooed clip for yourself.
