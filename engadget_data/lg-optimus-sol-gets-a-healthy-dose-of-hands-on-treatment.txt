Turns out we didn't have to wait terribly long for the big question mark to be erased, as German site BestBoyz was able to procure a pre-production unit of the E730, codenamed "Victor," and now known as the LG Optimus Sol. It's an Android 2.3.3 phone with a 1GHz CPU and 3.8-inch WVGA AMOLED display, and looks ready for a debut with Vodafone. Oh, and it'll come in silver and black and will retail for roughly $420. Need more quality time with the fresh device? Great news -- there's a video after the break.
