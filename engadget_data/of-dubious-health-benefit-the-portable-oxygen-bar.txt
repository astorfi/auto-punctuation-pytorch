   a long time, but we don't really notice the overall ickiness of the air anymore. Which is not to say it's all nice
   and fresh, but our lungs seem to have built up some sort of immunity, though not one we're willing to bet our
   long-term health on. So it is with some interest that we bring to you the Portable Oxygen Bar which is supposed to
   clean the air around you by "generating negative ion in electron theory." On second thought, maybe we'll just
   stick to our super-stylish surgeon's mask that we've been rocking Michael Jackson-style.
