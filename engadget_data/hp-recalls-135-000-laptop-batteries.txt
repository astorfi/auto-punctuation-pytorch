Apparently Apple isn't the only company in the
hot seat over its laptop
batteries. HP has just announced a recall on 135,000 batteries in HP and Compaq laptops sold between March 2004 and
May 2005. The company has received 16 reports of overheating. Unlike Apple's previous battery problems, however, none
of the HP batteries have burst into flames. Yet. Affected batteries have barcode labels starting with GC, IA, L0 or
L1.
