Been aching to find out what Sony's PlayStation 4 actually looks like? So have we. Fortunately, Engadget's Ben Gilbert and Joystiq's Alexander Sliwinski are right outside of the company's E3 press event, happily speculating on the box's potential shape -- not to mention what games we might see for it today. Head past the break to hear the pair's predictions for the show -- and of course, you can always follow along on our liveblog when they're finished. 

Update: You can find an archived video of the stream after the break!
