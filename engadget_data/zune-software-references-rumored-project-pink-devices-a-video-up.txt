First up is the eEndpointFamily files, which lists all the compatible hardware -- ZuneHD, for example. Also found, however, were entries for "PmxPure" and "PmxTurtle." PMX, if you recall, seems to be a reference to Microsoft's
Premium Mobile eXperiences group, the remnants of the Danger acquisition who have been whispered to be working on Project Pink. As for Pure and Turtle, let's go back all the way to September 2009, when we first heard those names as the initial Pink duo -- there were some supposed renders, too. If that's not enough, two PMX table entries pointed to a snippet of text stating that "Studio members" can "View and manage pictures and videos taken with your phone at the Studio," followed by a link that for now redirects to Zune.net. Could the mysterious Project Pink and the oft-rumored "Zune phone" be one in the same, with some "Studio" service for uploading media to the cloud? Is this all some red herring perpetuated by some amused Microsoft staffers? We don't know, but it's mean to tug at our heart strings like that, Microsoft, and worse that it makes Mobile World Congress even more painful to wait for. #tmdp
