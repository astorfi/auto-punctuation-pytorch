Little is known about the subject of this FCC filing from hardware assembler (and resurrector) Wistron, other than it will have a 10.1-inch screen, a 3-in-1 media reader, and plenty of wireless options including Bluetooth, WiFi, and HSDPA data. Dimensionally the device, referred to as the 0251, would fit into the IdeaPad category, but with no mention of processor or storage there's still some room to hope for something equally small but with a bit more chutzpah. Yeah, we're optimists.
