If you've been spooking subjects or failing to focus on them with your Panasonic Lumix GH3 or G5, you might feel like you got a brand new camera today thanks to a firmware update. Its new features include low-light (-3EV) autofocus and a "silent mode" setting that'll turn off the electronic shutter, all sounds and the flash emission in one go, leaving subjects like deer or golfers undisturbed. You'll also get an exposure compensation shutoff reset option, better AF performance with certain lenses and a WiFi fix for Mac computers. You can grab it at the source, proving it's not only hackers that bring free goodies to pricey cameras.
