As part of the C-series of Nokia devices, you can expect it to trim some of the specs off the N8, but not much as the flagship device of the family. You know, something very similar to the apparently leaked image and specs (pictured above) we saw a few weeks back. Parsing the XML posted on Nokia's own site reveals an ARM-based Symbian^3 C7-00 device with a Nokia favorite 360x640 nHD pixel display resolution and 3G UMTS/HSDPA, WiFi, and Bluetooth radios. Obviously no pricing is available but you can expect it to be fairly inexpensive for what you'll get.
