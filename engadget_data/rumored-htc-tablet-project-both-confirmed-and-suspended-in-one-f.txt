 Remember those rumored HTC Android / Chrome OS touch tablets that were supposedly being shown behind the scenes at CES? In a brief statement given to Australia's Channel News, Sales and Marketing Director Anthony Petts not only confirms the existence of the aforementioned project, he also announces in the same breath --
way to be efficient, guys -- that the slates are on hold as the company is now "focusing their efforts on a new generation of mobile phones." He's not saying never, but don't get your hopes up for the near future. At any rate, if a 4.3-inch device like the HTC HD2 is still considered a phone by its standards, we can be happy with that -- maybe they can try five on for size while they're at it.
