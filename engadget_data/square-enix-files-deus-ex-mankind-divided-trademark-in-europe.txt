The application, which encompasses "computer game software," "printed matter" and "entertainment services" is currently under review. So, just what is Makind Divided? It's impossible to say, but we have some hints.

Eidos Montreal head David Anfossi announced in October of last year that Square Enix and Eidos would be building what he referred to as "Deus Ex: Universe." Deus Ex: Universe was said to expand beyond games into media such as books and mobile games, so it's possible that Mankind Divided will fall into one of those categories.

However, not all hope is lost for those holding out for the sequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution. When discussing Universe, Anfossi shared the concept art you see at the top of this article, and described "trans-humanism segregation" as a major theme of the Deus Ex game which is currently in development for PC, Xbox One and PS4.

Humans? Segregated? Might we dare say these humans - aka: mankind - are downright divided? Let the conspiracies begin.
