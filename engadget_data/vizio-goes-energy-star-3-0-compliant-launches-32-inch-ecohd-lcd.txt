 Following in the eco-friendly footsteps of Insignia, Vizio has announced that 100% of its HDTVs that are shipping now to US / Canadian retailers "meet or exceed Energy Star 3.0 requirements." The flat-panel maker claims that at least nine of its models actually exceed the specifications by as much as 25%, and every last one of its 22- / 19-inch sets use far less energy than a conventional 60-watt light bulb. In related news, the company is also taking this opportunity to officially launch its 32-inch EcoHD LCD HDTV, which slurps down 44% less energy than a typical 32-inch LCD TV. The set will pack a 12,500:1 dynamic contrast ratio, SRS TruSurround XT audio, multiple HDMI inputs and a stylish white piano colored bezel. If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, you can latch on later this month for $499.99.
