Pre-order customers can expect a note from Dash alerting them to a refund of the difference sometime soon, while the rest of us can take ol' Benjamin and his three best friends over to Amazon, which is the exclusive retailer for the next 30 days. Unfortunately, the monthly services fees are still kind of high: although you can still use the device as a regular GPS unit after the initial three-month grace period, if you buy the premium service you'll be out $13 a month, or $10 if you sign a two-year deal -- but hey, that's the price you pay to be on the front lines of the revolution, right?
