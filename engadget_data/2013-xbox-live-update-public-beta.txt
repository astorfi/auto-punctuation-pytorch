Microsoft has opened up public beta registration for the 2013 Xbox Live update, and this time around you'll need to log your interest directly through an Xbox 360 console. Xbox owners in Japan will be missing out, although they'll have the same opportunity "at a later date." There should be a tile on the dashboard home screen entitled "Xbox Beta Program," and with limited spots available, we recommend you sign up immediately if you'd like to participate -- last year's spots were filled pretty quickly. There doesn't appear to be anything exciting included in the beta; Major Nelson cites "updates to improve overall performance" and the option to purchase content with actual money instead of MS points. There may be more details in the beta FAQ when it goes live later today, but if you get into the program and find anything juicy MS neglected to mention, it hopes you'll honor the NDA which you'll agree to as part of the registration process.
