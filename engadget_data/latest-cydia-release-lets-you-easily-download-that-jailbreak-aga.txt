The latest version of Cydia won't change that, but getting back to where you left off just got a lot easier. The app has merged with Rock Your Phone and now enables you to sign in using a Google or Facebook account. It will then track your purchases and downloads so that they can be easily applied again. And again. And probably again. There's also a new rating system and lots of other goodies -- but don't take our word for it.
