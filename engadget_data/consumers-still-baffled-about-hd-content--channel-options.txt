 After several years of this "HD thing" being around, we'd assume that the general public would begin to catch on and understand the completely unnecessary, yet very prevalent confusions that simply come with owning and operating an HDTV. Apparently there's still a vast majority of potential HDTV buyers and current owners that are still miffed when it comes to fully understanding how to setup, tweak, operate, and enjoy their new set. Research posted in USA Today states that while "about 15-percent" of American homes have an HD-capable television, less than half of them said that their purchase was influenced by wanting to catch their favorite shows in high definition. While we've certainly seen reports showing that we Americans can't get enough once we get a taste, it appears that a staggering amount of owners either don't know how to correctly receive HD content, or simply believe that "digital cable" equates to "high definition." Surveyors attribute the "confusing nature" of actually getting HD content into your home as the primary culprit, as cable and satellite companies don't exactly go the extra mile to clarify the technological mumbo jumbo while siphoning your cash. Notably, many HDTV purchasers were buying in with "gaming and / or DVD viewing" atop their list of priorities, presumably satisfied with stretch-o-vision when watching plain ole TV. Sure, some firms have reached out to addlepated consumers in hopes of clearing up some of the myths, but it seems that there's still a ways to go before the general public can truly grasp the nature of HD.
