 We already knew Panasonic was linked in with WirelessHD, but the outfit is choosing CES to come out in the open and trumpet its development of a transmission system. Apparently, it partnered up with SiBEAM to dish out a system that will enable "HD video transmission in uncompressed format," and while Panny gloats quite heavily about the use of a 60GHz band, it's really not all that surprising. 'Course, it seems we've got awhile before this stuff hits en masse (in actual products), but at least we've got yet another corporation on board, right?
