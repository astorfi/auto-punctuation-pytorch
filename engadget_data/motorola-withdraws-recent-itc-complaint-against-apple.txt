 Well, here's a bit of a surprise in the ongoing spate of Apple-focused patent disputes. Google's Motorola Mobility subsidiary has now formally withdrawn its most recent complaint against Apple with the ITC, which was just filed on August 17th and had been, until now, under investigation. Not surprisingly, details are light beyond that, with Google's filing only stating that it asked the ITC to "terminate all claims in this investigation without prejudice," and adding that "there are no agreements between Motorola and Apple, written or oral, express or implied, concerning the subject matter of this investigation." The complaint itself had claimed that Apple infringed on seven patents held by Motorola, and Google was seeking a US import ban on a range of Apple products as a result.
