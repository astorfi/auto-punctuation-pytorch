It was just last spring at Engadget Expand that Lenovo teased the ThinkPad T431s business Ultrabook, and now it's already coming out with a follow-on product. The company today announced the refreshed T440s, along with the T440, the X240 (shown above) and two mid-range Ultrabooks, the S440 and the S540. In fact, though the S540 isn't the highest-end machine on offer here, even that's worth mention, as it's the company's first 15-inch Ultrabook aimed at businesses. (Guess that bigger-screen trend is going strong, eh?)


Diving right in, the 14-inch T440s represents a fairly modest upgrade, as the T431s already ushered in some fairly big design changes (buttonless trackpad, latchless lid, 180-degree hinge, et cetera). The T440s has all that too, except it makes the natural shift to Intel's fourth-generation Haswell processors, along with an optional NVIDIA GeForce GT 730M GPU (which won't be offered here in North America). The T440 is closely related, as you'd expect, with similar configuration options (optional touchscreens, up to 12GB of RAM and up to either a 1TB HDD or a 512GB SSD). The main difference is that the resolution on the T440 is also capped at 1,600 x 900, whereas the T440s goes up to 1080p. Also, the T440s is a good lighter than the T440 (read: half a pound less).
