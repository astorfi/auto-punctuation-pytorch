Worried that you won't get to watch your favorite videos while visiting family this holiday? Don't be: After a brief beta phase, ClockworkMod's Koushik Dutta has released a completed version of AllCast for Android. The polished app lets you stream both local and cloud-based media to relatively common living room media hubs, including Apple TV, Roku players, the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One. Many Panasonic- and Samsung-made smart TVs will also handle content, and numerous DLNA-capable devices should make the cut. Chromecast support will likely have to wait until Google opens up its ecosystem in the new year. We can't promise that your relatives will share your taste in movies, but it won't hurt to grab AllCast from Google Play.
