The Inquirer's dug up some details, and while clock speeds are still unknown, the codenames for the lineup include Cypress at the top of the pile, followed by Redwood, then Juniper and Cedar for the mainstream crowd, and finally Hemlock for the lower end. The series could reportedly be ready by late September, which gives a month of breathing room before DX11-supporting Windows 7 hits the scene. Could this give AMD its much-desired lead over NVIDIA? Hard to say, but things should get mighty interesting between now and late October.
