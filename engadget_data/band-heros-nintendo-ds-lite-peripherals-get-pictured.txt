In a move obviously made to tease those already leaning towards purchasing the title when it hits shelves later this year, Activision has pushed out a smattering of renders that show a drum kit covering (ahem, Drum Grip™), guitar fretboard and even a pick to strum the touchscreen. Not much to go on, sure, but it's definitely good for keeping our attention while the dog days of summer drag on. The full, brief announcement is after the break.[Via Joystiq]






Revolutionizing the music videogame genre once again, Guitar Hero and Activision are expanding the boundaries of music gaming with the introduction of full band play in Band Hero™ for Nintendo DS™ Lite. Band Hero delivers an explosive and unprecedented social gameplay experience for Nintendo DS Lite with the addition of vocals and drums – via an innovative new Drum Grip™ – to the guitar and bass gameplay popularized by the Guitar Hero® On Tour trilogy. Band Hero allows handheld gamers to choose the way they want to play in multiplayer mode with any instrument combination of guitar, bass, drums and vocals as they strum, drum and belt out some of today's most popular tracks across multiple genres of music, including rock, pop, alternative and punk. With the largest and most diverse set list in a Nintendo DS Lite offering to-date, Band Hero offers fans 30 master recordings from today's top artists including: Blink-182, Avril Lavigne, The Killers, KT Tunstall, and Fall Out Boy. With new features players can enjoy anytime, anywhere, a brand new Rockstar Editor to fully customize your band members, No Fail mode and Stage Stunts, Band Hero changes the way games can be played on the road.
