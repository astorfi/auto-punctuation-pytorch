 Ah DigiTimes, where would we be without your river of tattle? The Taiwan rumor-rag just served up a doozy calling for Apple's "next-generation iPhone" to be equipped with a 3.2 megapixel CMOS sensor from OmniVision. Seems logical as a natural update to the existing 2.0 megapixel camera. DigiTimes also has Apple adding a 5 megapixel CMOS sensor to "another Apple product expected to be launched later in the year." Interesting as in-bezel webcams found in laptops and netbooks are typically less than 2 megapixels. If true, perhaps this will be the shooter found on a bulkier device carrying the iPhone3,1 or iPod3,1 identifiers peeped in the 3.0 firmware. Or not.[Via iPhonebuzz]
