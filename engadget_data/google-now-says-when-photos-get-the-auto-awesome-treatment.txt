The Auto Awesome enhancements in Google+ are great for livening up drab pics and bursts of photos with animations, but you've got to dig through your albums to discover if the features were even triggered. That's no longer an issue in the wake of an update: Google+ now sends notifications whenever it creates Auto Awesome animations, filmstrips and panoramas. The alerts are rolling out today on Android, iOS and the web, so you won't be left wondering about your photo collection again.
