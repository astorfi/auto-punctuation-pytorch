 Another day another next gen format player firmware update, it wasn't last week that Sony released a update for their BDP-S1 and now it Panasonic's turn. Like the other players you can download the update and burn your own disc or order one from Panasonic. The details of the update are as clear as can be expected when a company must admit their mistakes, either way we welcome any updates we can get.

Picture quality improvement via HDMI
  Enhanced playability and stability of Blu-ray discs
Better response of chapter skip operations
Support of the discs recorded on Panasonic AVC-HD Camcorders
