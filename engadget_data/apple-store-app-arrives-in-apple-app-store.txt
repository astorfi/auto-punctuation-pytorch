Apple's just unleashed an Apple Store application for its iDevices designed to pretty much give you the online Apple Store experience -- but perhaps without the crazy on-again, off-again antics of this morning. All that's required is a device with iOS version 3 or above, and you'll be able to read reviews, locate local brick and mortar Stores, check out new and featured products, and -- importantly -- buy or pre-order the latest goodies Steve and co have bestowed upon these lands. Alas, we tried to do just that with the iPhone 4 and were met with the familiar "we'll be back soon" message. So the app might work, but Apple's store is still struggling.

[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]

P.S. - The app looks to be US-only for now. Sorry world, Apple doesn't love you enough.
