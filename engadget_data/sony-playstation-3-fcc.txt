The current, existing slimline PS3 is the 3000 series, and it has its FCC label in a different location to that shown in the new filing, leading Eurogamer to suggest that this could be a "Super Slim" variant -- which that site says has cropped up in separate rumors circulating before Gamescom next month. At this point, it's probably too much to hope that magic number "4" represents anything more significant.
