Today Microsoft confirmed another disappointing detail about the Xbox One's launch -- unlike the Xbox 360 Pro SKU, it won't pack a chat headset in the box. In a statement to Ars Technica, the company extols the virtues of Kinect 2.0 and its multi-array microphones for chat across games, Skype and "other experiences." Chatting with the Xbox 360's Kinect introduces a multitude of issues like echoes and the device taking conversation as system commands. To replace even a cheap headset, Kinect 2.0 will need to be a massive upgrade. This seems odd considering Microsoft included headsets with almost everything since the original Xbox Live kits. However, The House That Gates Built isn't the only one breaking tradition: Sony's including a single earbud-and-mic headset with each $100-cheaper PS4. Shots fired?
