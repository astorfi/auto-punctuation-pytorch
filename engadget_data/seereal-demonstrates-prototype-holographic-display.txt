Showing its stuff at the Society for International Display (SID) forum in California, the company has reportedly "developed a new technology for displaying 3D images on a TV set, computer display, or through a projector." The trick is seemingly in the company's proprietary Tracked Viewing Window technology, which "limits pixel size to HDTV levels and in combination with a real-time tracking system, eliminates superfluous elements while reducing the need for real-time processing." The firm's main objective was to remove the inconvenience factor that's typically associated with viewing 3D imagery, and with its unique use of holography, it has reportedly done so. Of course, the outfit is still on the hunt for willing and able partners to kick out products to the commercial world, but according to the CEO, it already has "a number of promising contacts in that regard."[Via PCLaunches]
