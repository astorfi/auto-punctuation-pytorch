The device weighs 20 pounds, and has a better power-to-weight ratio than a Dodge Viper, according to Nathan Ball, a 23-year-old grad student at MIT who spearheaded the project along with three other colleagues. Originally based on power drill batteries and weighing 25 pounds, the device was initially designed for a MIT competition, but has blossomed into the Atlas Devices company, which continues to develop and market the unit. Obviously, special ops and rescue workers are the natural target for this "reverse rappelling," but we're sure a wannabe superhero or three will figure out something a tad more interesting and / or ill-advised to do with the thing.
