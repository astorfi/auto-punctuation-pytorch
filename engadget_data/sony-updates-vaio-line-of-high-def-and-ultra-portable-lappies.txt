 Sony let fly a raft of new specs in several Vaio lines today, including beefing up the high-definition AR (pictured, left) and FZ (pictured, right) series and the TZ and SZ subnotebooks. The flagship desktop-replacement AR790U gets a T9300 Intel Core 2 Duo bump and sports a 17-inch display, 4GB RAM, 400GB HD, 512MB nVidia GPU, Blu-ray burner and HDMI for $3300. The FZ485U now packs a T8100 2.1GHz Core 2 Duo, 15.4-inch screen, 4GB RAM, 300GB HD, 256MB nVidia graphics, Blu-ray burner and HDMI out for $2200. In the subnote department we've got the Vaio SZ791 now sporting a T9300 Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM, 250GB HD, and 13.3-inch display for $2500, with the TZ298 packing a U7700 Core 2 Duo, 64GB SSD plus 250GB HDD storage space, and an 11.1-inch screen in a light 2.7 pound frame for a cool $3600. All of these will be available for pre-order starting January 7 which, for the calendarically challenged, is tomorrow.
