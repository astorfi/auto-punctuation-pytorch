Tapping into both consoles' respective motion-sensing cameras (and Adidas' own sensors and units), there are six sports to dabble in, with over 400 different exercises that can be synced with existing miCoach accounts. There's also a raft of Adidas-emblazoned athletes to take you through those motions. The games are priced up at Â£21 (around $32) a piece in the UK, but American indoor athletes can expect their version to arrive around July 24.
