 Following up on the HD DVD Promotional Group's statement about other manufacturers lining up to support HD DVD, Onkyo has confirmed that it has a player in development to be released this year. Onkyo plans to introduce its HD DVD player along with HDMI-connected receivers to capitalize on the enhanced audio/video capabilities of the format. More details about the player aren't available yet but 2007 apparently will be the year we see HD DVD players from someone other than Toshiba.
