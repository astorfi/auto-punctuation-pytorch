In the gaming arena it turns out they're sticking with their general operating style and borrowing from theirpartner SK Telecom to bring Korean mobile gaming tech to the US. Their library of 2D and 3D multiplayer games --including titles such as Tetris, Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones, and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire -- are said totake full advantage of the Hero and Kickflip's processing power and 3G data speeds. Before you buy a game you can getinfo and screens from IGN reviews with your phone, and can either purchase the game straight up, "beg" it offa friend, "gift" it to a pal, or rent the title. Doesn't sound too groundbreaking, but there does seem to bean emphasis on community, so we look forward to seeing how it plays out.[Via MocoNews]
