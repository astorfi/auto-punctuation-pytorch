Windows Phone 7 isn't due to launch at least until October 11, but here we are, dazing dreamily at the first listing of a device bearing the hot new OS: LG's Optimus 7. Or is it the E900? You can tell Amazon's offering is way early since the e-tailer has opted to list both names -- it now seems like the E900 was the codename and the Optimus branding will be what you see in stores -- just to make sure snoopers like us don't miss out on it. So what's there to see? Not much actually, official product images are predictably missing and all we're told is that the handset will cost â‚¬499, include a GPS chip, and be capable of filling five million pixels with photonic data and then displaying the results on a 3.5-inch touchscreen. Such teases, these online retailers are.
