Fans across the Atlantic are about to get an option for streaming UK-based sporting events on Google's dongle. BT is set to make its sports offerings available on Chromecast, joining the BBC iPlayer app in beaming home-grown content to the diminutive living room gadget. Of course, only those who use BT broadband will be able to view action from the pitch. Details are sparse for now, and there's no official word on a launch date for the sports coverage to arrive on Chromecast yet either. The Â£30 add-on has only been available in Europe for two weeks, so there's sure to be more viewing options on the way.
