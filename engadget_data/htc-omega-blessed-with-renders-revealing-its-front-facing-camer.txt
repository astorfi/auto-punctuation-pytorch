One such phone that's been seeing a lot of talk lately is the Omega, rumored to be one of Peter Chou's upcoming Windows Phones. Unfortunately, it's just been a faceless name on paper -- until now. Pocketnow got its hands on a rather well-detailed render of the Mango device, which shows off HTC's traditional two-toned design (this time in white and gray) and a front-facing camera. While the latter feature isn't new to the industry by any stretch of the imagination, it backs up Microsoft's confirmation Wednesday that Mango will indeed support it. Anyone up for some sweet Skype video calling?
