Well now you can chock up one more "score" for the Japanese juggernaut's handheld, because a clever hacker who goes by the name samuelv has given the DS an additional, exciting piece of functionality -- VoIP. That's right folks, thanks to a simple piece of software, you can be making phone calls directly from your DS (provided you have a SIP account). Apparently users are up and running already with the app, so there will probably be a rash of tweaks and improvements on the way. It's truly an exciting time to be the owner of a relatively cheap handheld game system. [Via Digg]
