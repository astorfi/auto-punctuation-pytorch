Thanks to Robosapien designer Mark Tilden's affinity for Lego, the Mindstorm brain fits perfectly into the bot's backpack, allowing you to program a host of new movements into its already robust and customizable repertoire. We suggest you start with something easy like dancing then move your way up to teaching your Robo to destroy the evil imposter, Robone. The source link goes on to mention a few other interesting projects being worked on at Wowwee headquarters, including a four-foot, Segway wheel toting Robosapien model with voice technology and an internet connection, as well as a robotic spider and dragonfly. It all sounds very exciting to us, and we, for one, would like to welcome our new robot overlords (beat you to it).
