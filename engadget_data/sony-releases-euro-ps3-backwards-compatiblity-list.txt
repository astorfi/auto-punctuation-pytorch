 As promised, Sony has delivered a complete list of PS1 and PS2 titles compatible with the new Euro-centric PlayStation 3, along with a guide of just how well each game will be emulated. While we suspect many will likely still want to take a wait and see approach, according to the list, there doesn't appear to be any shortage of past-gen games that'll work just fine with the new system, with loads of titles listed as having "no known issues." That includes games like God of War 1 & 2, Shadow of the Colossus, and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, but not GTA: San Andreas, which apparently has "noticeable issues." Also falling into that latter category are Madden NFL 01-06, a number of FIFA titles, and Final Fantasy X and X-2, to name a few. Sadly, Katamari Damacy appears to be one of the few games that doesn't work at all, although it seems that its sequel, We Love Katamari, will run just fine.[Thanks, Vasanth S]
