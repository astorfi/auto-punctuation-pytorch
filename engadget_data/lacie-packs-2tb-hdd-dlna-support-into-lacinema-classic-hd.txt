Thus, we're stoked to see the outfit issuing a revamped version of the aforesaid device today, with the LaCinema Classic HD including up to 2TB of internal storage space, (optional) 802.11n WiFi and built-in DLNA server capabilities. As you'd expect, this sexy black block will stream multimedia from your Mac or PC onto your HDTV, and the included HDMI port (and cable) should ensure that transfers remain gorgeous. We're told that format support won't be an issue, and if you're a believer, you can get your pre-order in now for $249.99 (1TB). Rear shot is after the break.
