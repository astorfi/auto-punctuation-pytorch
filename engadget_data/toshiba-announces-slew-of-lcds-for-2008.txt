The overriding theme was thinness and early release dates, with essentially every set listed shipping by April. We'll get down to the dirt: two new 720p sets were introduced -- the AV500 and REGZA CV510 -- the first of which will be available in sizes ranging from 19- to 42-inches and feature DynaLight, HDMI and a PC input, while the latter will only be available in 32- / 37-inch sizes and sport PixelPure4G 14-bit internal processing, a 1.5-inc ThinLine Bezel design and a trio of HDMI 1.3 ports.

  The REGZA RV530 will be available in sizes ranging from 32- to 52-inches and feature a 15,000:1 contrast ratio, 1080p resolution, four HDMI inputs and a "high-res PC input." As for the REGZA XV540 series, you'll find 42-, 46- and 52-inch versions that sport ClearFrame 120Hz technology, 14-bit PurePixel4G processing, ColorBurst (displays 108-percent of the NTSC color gamut) and four HDMI 1.3 input with x.v. Color and Deep Color. Finishing things off is the flagship Cinema Series REGZA XF550 (available in 40-, 46- and 52-inches), which mimics the aforementioned RV540 in most ways, but ups the ante with DynaLight SuperContrast that can purportedly turn LEDs on / off depending on the image.   Oh, and if you're curious about prices: AV500 series: between $429.99 and $799.99 REGZA CV510 series: $899.99 / 1,099.99 REGZA RV530 series: between $1,099.99 and $2,699.99 REGZA XV540 series: between $1,699.99 and $2,899.99 Cinema Series REGZA XF550: between $1,999.99 and $3,199.99
