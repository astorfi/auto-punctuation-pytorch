 
 SugarSync's popular cloud sharing app just got a complete web and desktop makeover. Version 2.0 beta is now available in desktop, web and Android app flavors, bringing a handful of new features to subscribers on multiple platforms. Mac and Windows users will have direct file system access to all of their cloud content, letting you transfer documents and other data without launching the app or web interface. You'll be able to store files within individual folders, and you can hop over to the activity feed to see a list of items in the order they were added, making it easy to locate a file transferred recently.

 A new search tool indexes all of your remote content, while also letting you locate files stored locally on computers and other devices. You can also drag and drop files to specific contacts or to social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, without any need to copy and paste a download link. Apps will be available for Android at launch, and while BlackBerry, iOS, Symbian and Windows Phone users will need to hang tight for now, they'll still be able to use previous versions alongside 2.0 in the meantime. As always, you'll be able to sign up for a free 5GB account, with paid monthly plans ranging from $5 for 30 gigs to $40 for a monster 500GB plan. Grab the new version now at the source link below.

   The Highest Rated Cloud Service Gets Elegant New Design, New Features, and Becomes Simplest Cloud to Use

   • Completely new user interface design and structure for more efficient use  • New search functionality enables complete search of all folders on all your devices  • Intuitive drag-and-drop sharing to your contacts or to social media sites, giving users the fastest and easiest way to share and collaborate

   SAN MATEO, CALIF., November 13, 2012 – SugarSync, a premium service that lets you access, sync and share all of your files and folders across all your computers and mobile devices, today announced the public beta launch of SugarSync 2.0 – a completely redesigned and revamped version of its award-winning Cloud service. The new SugarSync 2.0 desktop, Web and Android apps are available for download now at www.sugarsync.com/beta.

   "As more non-technical users incorporate the Cloud into their everyday life, we've made a point to work with our customers and understand what they really need. As a result, we went back to the drawing board and redesigned SugarSync from the ground up," said Laura Yecies, CEO of SugarSync. "And while we have drastically simplified the use of the Cloud with SugarSync 2.0, we have kept all the unique power and functionality our existing users love – while also introducing even more powerful new features such as more flexible sharing and integrated search that users have been requesting, as well as an industry-first Cloud drive called "SugarSync Drive" that enables access to Cloud data right from your file system."  Your Cloud. Your Way.

   As the highest rated Cloud service, SugarSync remains committed to the features and functionality that have earned the company this status. SugarSync will continue to be the only leading Cloud service that doesn't limit you to a single syncing folder. SugarSync will also still continue to support all platforms, including PC, Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, and Windows Mobile (with Windows Phone coming soon). And with SugarSync 2.0, the company has taken all the powerful features you love and merged them with a completely new design that makes it all even easier for anyone to use.

   The new SugarSync design makes it even simpler to access, sync and share all of your digital stuff no matter where or how you are working – whether on your computer, mobile device, accessing via a Web browser, or wherever. SugarSync 2.0 also introduces the new "SugarSync Drive" capability, where users can see their entire SugarSync Cloud right in their file system. Setup is simpler than ever – just select what you want in the Cloud, and SugarSync takes care of the rest. No technical expertise required.

   Your Cloud is Social.

   Most Cloud services today, including SugarSync, make it easy to share large files and folders by simply sharing a link instead of a large file attachment. But for some, the process of generating that link is not intuitive. With SugarSync 2.0, the company is introducing simple drag-and-drop sharing. Just drag the file or folder that you want to share onto the contact that you want to share with. And if a folder that you're sharing is not already in the Cloud, SugarSync will automatically upload it and make it ready to share. Want to share a file with your social media contacts on Facebook or Twitter? SugarSync has that covered, too. It really couldn't be simpler.

   Your Cloud is Big. And Now It's Searchable.

   SugarSync is often recognized as the best cloud solution, but it's not the biggest (yet). And while other Cloud providers might want you to use only their service, SugarSync isn't the jealous type, and understands that you might be using multiple Cloud services. But unlike every other Cloud service that requires you to put all your folders into one special Cloud folder/box, SugarSync lets you sync as many folders as you want.

   We know that the more devices you use and the more you put in the Cloud, the tougher it can be to navigate. And many of you have been requesting a search feature to help you quickly find any file or folder in your Cloud. We heard you, and now with SugarSync 2.0 we've added powerful search functionality, so you can easily search all your folders and all of your data on all your computers and devices. You can even search all of the content that other people have shared with you, too. SugarSync just turned your big, unruly Cloud into something you can actually navigate and use.

   Your Cloud Doesn't Box You In.

   SugarSync has never, and will never, box you in to a single folder. When other Cloud services make you move everything into a single folder, you forget to add important stuff to the Cloud, you forget where you saved things last, and you constantly doubt whether you'll have access to important files. SugarSync lets you select any and all of your folders – even your general desktop – and it automatically and continuously syncs all your stuff, giving you the peace of mind that you'll have what you need, when you need it.

   SugarSync has repeatedly been recognized as the most powerful Cloud syncing service both by media – via their head-to-head reviews of SugarSync and the competition – as well by large global partners such as Samsung, Lenovo, Fujitsu, SanDisk, France Telecom-Orange, Korea Telecom, SoftBank and more who have selected SugarSync over the competition. And while millions of users in over 120 countries currently use SugarSync, the company realizes that there are hundreds of millions of people worldwide who still do not use any Cloud sync service.

   "Adoption of file access, sync and share personal cloud services accelerated in the past two years. In 2010, 9% of US online adults were using file, media, and information syncing services; by 2012, 15% were using a file storage service for syncing and/or web access, which is two thirds increase in just two years," according to a July 2012 commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of SugarSync: Personal Cloud Services Emerge To Orchestrate Our Mobile Computing Lives.

   "While the Cloud has gained massive popularity over the past few years, the overall adoption of Cloud sync services has only reached 15% worldwide, meaning today's Cloud services – such as SugarSync – have an incredible amount of growth opportunity ahead," said Laura Yecies, CEO of SugarSync. "We don't just want to be the best Cloud service – we want to be the best Cloud service that people are actually able to integrate into their day-to-day lives. We want to be your Cloud, which is why we work the way you work."

   Availability

   The new SugarSync 2.0 desktop and Web apps are now available in public beta, and can be downloaded today for Windows and Mac. The new SugarSync 2.0 for Android app is also available today, and can be downloaded from the SugarSync 2.0 Beta page. Redesigned SugarSync 2.0 mobile apps for all other mobile platforms (iOS, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile and Symbian) will be coming soon, but the current SugarSync mobile apps will continue to work with the SugarSync 2.0 Web and desktop apps. New users get 5GB of storage for free, and can earn up to 32GB by referring other free users (you get 500MB for each new free user you refer). You can earn unlimited free storage by referring paid users, as SugarSync offers 10GB of additional storage – with no limit – for each new paid subscriber you refer.
