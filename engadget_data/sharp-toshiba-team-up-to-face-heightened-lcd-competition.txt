In a joint announcement made in Tokyo, it was stated that Toshiba would be acquiring LCD panels from Sharp for use in televisions 32-inches or larger, while Sharp would be buying more computer chips for LCD use from Toshiba. According to Toshiba President Atsutoshi Nishida, the new partnership would create a "win-win relationship," but potentially more intriguing was the notion that his company would be "abandoning plans to make OLED TVs," and would instead be relying on Sharp's LCD technology for "next-generation TVs." Guess it's all on you now, Sammy.
