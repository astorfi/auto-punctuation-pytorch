Sure, it's not surprising that a celebrity millionaire who's buddy-buddy with Jobs and Co. would have a pre-release model, but it may come as a shock that he's using the new ultraportable Mac to look at photos of himself double-fisting a couple of BlackBerrys. We suppose it's possible that someone has doctored this photo, but highly unlikely.[Via TUAW]
