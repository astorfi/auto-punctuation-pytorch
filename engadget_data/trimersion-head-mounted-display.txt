Ah yes, yet another overpriced attempt at Virtual Reality headgear. 3001 AD's Trimersion Head Mounted Display will
work with first person shooters on the Xbox, Playstation and PC platforms and, if nothing else, is guaranteed to scare
off any potential mates who might happen by during your gameplay. It's supposed to hit retail in quarter four for a
street price of about $500, so start working harder if you gotta get it.
