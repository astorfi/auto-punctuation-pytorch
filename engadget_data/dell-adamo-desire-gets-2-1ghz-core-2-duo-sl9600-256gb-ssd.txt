Back in July, the Desire editions (available in Pearl and Onyx hues) stooped to $2,299 and shipped with a 1.4GHz CPU and a 128GB SSD. Today, those same machines are available with a 2.1GHz Core 2 Duo SL9600 processor, 256GB SSD, 4GB of DDR3 RAM and Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit). The best part? The MSRP has remained the same.
