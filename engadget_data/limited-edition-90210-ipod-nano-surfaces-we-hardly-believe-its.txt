Thinking back to those Harry Potter, Madonna and Tony Hawk editions, we can't help but wonder how this one missed the boat. Coincidentally (or not) enough, the CBS Store has decided to offer up a special run of 8GB Beverly Hills, 90210 iPod nanos just as The CW pushes the all new rendition of the show. Buyers can add up to 30 characters of text and choose black, pink, green, blue or silver hues, but you better hurry -- who knows how fast raving fans will be handing over their $269 in hopes of securing one.[Via ChipChick]
