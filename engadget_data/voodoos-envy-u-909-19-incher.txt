 19-inches. 16 pounds. 1.7 million pixels. 5,000 dollars. Guess what it is yet? It's Voodoo's Envy u:909, the monster 17.5 x 12.5 x 1.75-inch laptopthat comes packing with all of the above in addition to a AMD Turion 64 processor, dual NVIDIA or ATI SLI cards, 8xdual layer slot-load DVD burner, 8 channel audio, subwoofer, and 4-in-1 card reader. Envy sounds about right -- but foryour laptop so much as for your budget.[Via PC World]
