No surprises here since we've been expecting these to drop since last month. Same specs we've seen, and yours for the usual $129.99 after on-line discount and 2-year commitment -- which should be enough time to convince everyone of their "Cherry" and "Mint" coloring.[Thanks, Tyler A.]Read -- Mint ChocolateRead -- Cherry Chocolate
