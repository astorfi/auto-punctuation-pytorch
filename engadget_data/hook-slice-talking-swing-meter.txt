 From the"We'd Rather Get Punched in the Face" department: An absolutely awful golf gadget that hooks onto your driverand announces how crappy your last shot was, 'cause we really need some wise-ass device telling us we just sliced theball into the snack bar. Even though it's marketed as a training tool, the Hook/Slice Talking Swing Meter does nothingto improve your game but lots to crush your confidence. Great fun for screwing the jerk in your foursome, but that'sabout it. At $18, it's more than $17 overpriced.[Via TRFJ]
