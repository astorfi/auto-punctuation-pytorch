AT&T's love of Samsung-made Windows Phones seemingly turned sour after it skipped last year's ATIV S. It's clear that any ill will was short-lived, however, as the carrier just unveiled its version of Samsung's ATIV S Neo. The Windows Phone 8 device is a close match for its Sprint counterpart, sharing the same 4.8-inch 720p screen, dual-core 1.4GHz processor, 8-megapixel rear camera and 1.9-megapixel front shooter. The launch price will be easier to swallow, though. AT&T plans to ship the ATIV S Neo on November 8th for $100 on contract, or $50 less than it cost at Sprint when brand new.
