We know it's a little peripheral, but we heard it through the grapevine that Maxell is finally bringing back the
blown-away guy (aka Peter Murphy of Bauhaus), perhaps the 80s' most endearing and enduring icon of conspicuous
consumption of consumer electronics. Though we might hope blown-away guy might have replaced his Le Corbusier with a
Kjaerholm and his hi-fi with a Sonos, we're just glad to have his ass back around to show everyone how it's
really done. Just as long as he's still listening to Wagner, anyway, and didn't trade his classical collection
for some Bloc Party or Killers records or something.
