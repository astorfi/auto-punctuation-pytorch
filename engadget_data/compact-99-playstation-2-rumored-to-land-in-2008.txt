 We'll be straight with you: we're far from ready to etch this one in stone, but considering that Sony has already trimmed down the PlayStation 2 (twice), it's not unfathomable to think that an even smaller iteration could be in the pipeline. According to MCV, Sony is aiming to launch a "compact" PS2 in early 2008 for just $99, and while we've no idea how different (or not) it would actually look, it will supposedly feature a "built-in power supply." Of course, representatives for Sony "refused to comment" when questioned, so we hope you're ready for another fascinating round of wait-and-see.[Via Joystiq]
