 We kind of hoped they'd just go away, but after Maxell announced their SDHC card reader yesterday, well, those SDHC memory cards were bound to get real soon enough. Now right on cue, Panasonic just went public with a July 26 global release date for their new 4GB SDHC (SD 2.0) cards. The cards feature a 5MB/s maximum transfer rate and are expected to pull about  ¥30,000 (or around $265) once on the shelves. No doubt, Panny will drop a few devices soon enough that take advantage of the cards (besides the DMC-L1) since they'll only work in SDHC-compliant slots.[Via Impress]
