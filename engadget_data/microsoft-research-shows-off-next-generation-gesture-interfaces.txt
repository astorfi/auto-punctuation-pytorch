Check out the video after the break to see the latest, Director of Microsoft Applied Sciences Steven "Stevie B" Bathiche showing off a variety of interesting interfaces. It all starts with gesture controls that take you well beyond the touchscreen, relying on a retro-reflective sash and a camera to detect hand position. But, things quickly progress to a flat lens called a wedge that can enable holographic-like imagery. Pair that with a Kinect and perspective shifts come into play, tracking your face to enable you to peer around like looking out a window. It's all just waiting for you below -- and maybe IRL sometime in the future.
