What will Apple unveil, when will it ship, and what does it all mean? Tim and Darren will help you figure it all out. Just make sure you click "Play" to start the video.

Update: And we're done. Sorry for breaking UStream -- we'll have a saved version of the video up shortly. In the meantime, why not bookmark our liveblog of today's event? To be clear, we're NOT liveblogging the keynote itself. Apple won't let anybody!

Update 2: We've got the video after the break!
