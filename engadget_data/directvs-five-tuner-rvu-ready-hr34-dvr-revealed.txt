They've gotten an early look at the HR34 and all of its five-tuner RVU blasting capabilities and report it is just the HR24-on-steroids you'd thought it would be, with a 1TB hard drive and support for 100 Series Listings and 3 remote sessions, either RVU or whole-home DVR, at once. Of course, if we're really going to eliminate the cable / satellite box anytime soon then hardware is going to have to hit the streets, both form DirecTV and third parties like Samsung. Don't bother calling DirecTV to get one yet as they're in extremely limited release, but we'll let you know once they're widely available. In the meantime, hit the source link for a quick preview, and if you're looking for more info on the placeshifting Nomad box then you're in luck, since its product page is (finally) live on DirecTV's site.
