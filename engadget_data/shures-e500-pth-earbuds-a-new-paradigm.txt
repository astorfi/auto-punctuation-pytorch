They rock a "Push-to-Hear" function that switches fromnoise cancelling to a microphone of what is going on around you, and pack a triple-driver punch (one tweeter and twowoofers) into the in-ear canalphones. Of course all this paradigm shifting don't come cheap; the E500-PTH goes for$500, while the PTH accessory can be purchased alone for $60. Should be available in May.
