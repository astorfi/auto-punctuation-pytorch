Not quite as clever or innocuous as a Powerbook in a Pizza
Box, but we're not about to refuse such a not-so-subtle and ironic jab as the "security though obscurity" of a Mac
mini in a PC drive bayâ€”a Dell drive bay, no less. And we won't lay claim that the mini is actually really
obscured here, but what the hell, if we can put PCs
in Mac cases why can't it go the other way around?
