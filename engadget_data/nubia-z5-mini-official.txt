ZTE's sub-label Nubia may want a refresher on the definition of "mini," because we're not seeing many sacrifices in its just-shipped Z5 mini. At 4.7 inches, the Android phone is nearly as large as the 5-inch Z5 flagship; it also shares the bigger Z5's quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB of RAM, 2,300mAh battery, 13MP f/2.2 rear camera and 5MP front camera. The mini is likewise a first-class citizen in its home country with 3G support for China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom. Prospective owners are only really giving up screen resolution (down to 720p) and storage (down to 16GB), and they're getting a choice of pastel-colored, replaceable backs in return. As such, that makes the Z5 mini a potential bargain at its Â¥1,888 ($308) price -- buyers are getting most of the Z5 experience for considerably less cash.
