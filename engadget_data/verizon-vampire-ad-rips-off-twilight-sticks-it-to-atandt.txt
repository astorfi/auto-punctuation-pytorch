Yeah, that didn't last very long. Verizon is back with a biting ad campaign that continues poking fun at AT&T's 3G coverage. The consumer is appropriately a vampire, whereas the young maiden keen on being consumed turns out to be... well, it's more fun if we just let you watch it without any more spoilers. Needless to say, it's some of Verizon's funniest work yet. Head on past the break to see it.

[Thanks, Jay]
