The pictures may not quite drive the point home, so let us just say that this thing is a beast. And frankly the idea carrying it around using the add-on strip is giving us lower-back pain just thinking of it. But heck, it probably weighs a good deal less that carrying around cart after cart of vinyl -- not to mention a couple of turntables and a whole PA system (not to mention all of those glow sticks). Philips' M1X-DJ is a cool take on the idea of the computer DJ. It's essentially a massive dock that connects to your iPad / iPhone via the lightning connector. On top, you'll find two DJ platters and a mixer.


As we noted before, the M1X-DJ is hitting Europe in November, priced at â‚¬399. Click on through to the other side to check out a video of the wheels of plastic in action.
