 Intel certainly hasn't been holding back on its near term plans for its MID-powering Atom processors, but the company has been a considerably more coy about anything beyond the initial 1.6GHz Atom 230 series processor. We now have a slightly better idea of what to expect from future MIDs, however, thanks to one of those always handy roadmaps that Notebook Italia has turned up. According to it, following Atom 230, Intel will dishing out two separate 1.87GHz processors, one of which will be a dual-core model, while the other will follow in the 230s footsteps with a 533MHz bus and 512KB of Level 2 cache memory. Unfortunately, there's no word as to when those processors will ship or how much they'll cost, but the roadmap does drop the tidbit that the 1.6GHz Atom 230 will cost just $29 in 1,000-unit quantities, which isn't too shabby at all.[Via Electronista]
