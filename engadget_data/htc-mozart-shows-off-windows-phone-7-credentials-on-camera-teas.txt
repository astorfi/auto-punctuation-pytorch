Those are the handsome, albeit somewhat predictable, specs of the purported HTC Mozart we have on show today. It looks and reads very much like HTC has just transported the Nexus One/Desire recipe into the Windows Phone 7 world, which isn't exactly the worst idea in the world. But you know what, every time we see one of these WP7 devices in action, we're taken aback by the swiftness of their responsiveness (honestly, Microsoft didn't have to pay us to say that... not extra, anyway), so do yourself a favor and witness this humbly-named device cranking through a Bluetooth pairing process after the break.
