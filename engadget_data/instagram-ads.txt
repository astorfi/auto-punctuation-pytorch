Instagram is gearing up to monetize all of your colorful border-enhanced photos, and you may not like what that means for your feed. Beginning "in the next couple months," Instagram users in the United States will see "an occasional ad" sandwiched between their friends' photos and videos. The company is insisting that the advertisements will flow with regular content -- and if you don't like a particular ad, you can hide it from view and let the team know what you didn't like. As a final note, the firm clarified that the introduction of ads won't affect ownership rights of the pics and vids you upload -- so if a family member pops up in a sponsored post with a Coke in hand, you'll probably want to send some feedback.
