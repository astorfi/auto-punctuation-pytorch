 You may not be able to rent them in the stores, but Blockbuster.com will rent you all (3) of the HD-DVDs you couldever want. Doom and Apollo 13 are listed as shipping tomorrow, as well as the delayed Million Dollar Baby, although you can't tell what is in and what isn't.If you're one of the tenthousand HD-DVD owners out there, at least you have some options. Once Blu-ray launches, we can probably expect quickonline support there also, but it will be interesting to see who gets titles in brick & mortar stores first.[Via digg]
