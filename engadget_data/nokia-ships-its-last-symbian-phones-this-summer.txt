That moment we'd been expecting (and to some extent, dreading) has come: Nokia is near shipping its last Symbian smartphones. The company should deliver the final round of 808 PureViews sometime this summer, marking the effective end to an 11-year-old platform. Those still attached to the software will have to take comfort in support that will last until at least 2016. We're not overly attached to Symbian -- it never completely adjusted to the modern era -- but it's hard not to shed a tear for the OS that brought us the N95, E71 and other smartphone classics. Let's just hope that the next round of Lumias can fill the hole in our hearts.
