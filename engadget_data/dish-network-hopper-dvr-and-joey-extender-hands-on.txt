The Joey extender on the other hand, looks more like a SD digital TV adapter than a HD extender set-top and can easily be mounted to the back of a TV and connect to the Hopper via coax instead of requiring a network drop. The RF remote looks the same as Dish customers are accustomed to, but this one works with ZigBee. The boxes weren't connected but the presentation showed screen shots that reminded us of the VIP 922.
