Samsung has bested its Japanese competitor with the unveiling of a new 55-inch Digital Information Display panel that features bezels of 3.8mm on the top and left edges and 1.9mm on the bottom and right, leading to a positively svelte 5.7mm distance between the content of neighboring displays. That good stuff is augmented with Full HD resolution and a blinding 700 nits of brightness. There'll also be a 46-inch model that offers a 7.6mm separation (hint: that's still pretty damn thin), though we've yet to learn on when and where aspiring home cinema nuts might be able to obtain either screen.
