       Although we'll probably have to wait another week for the official Nielsen VideoScan charts to reflect the sales of Iron Man this week on Blu-ray, director Jon Favreau was bragging on the Howard Stern Show that the sales of Iron Man had already outsold every other Blu-ray release to date. We can't say we're that surprised though, especially after reports that the load on Paramount's BD-Live servers were too much to handle -- not to mention the fact that it is/was the number two selling disc on Amazon (the DVD version is number one). Either way, it'll be interesting to see how much better Iron Man moved discs then the previous record holders like Spider Man 3, I Am Legend and Casino Royale.
