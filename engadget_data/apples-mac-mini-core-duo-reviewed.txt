Nevertheless, Apple bumped its most minuscule Macs by tossing in Intel Core Duo processors, while leaving just about everything else (including price points) the same. In case you've been dreaming up a homegrown media center or recording studio, and need to know if the revamped mini would fit the bill, Macworld's review crew has the scoop. Reviewers admired the inclusion of Core Duo chips in both high and low-end models, the built-in WiFi / Bluetooth, and the "admirable" Front Row performance. Aside from praising the small footprint (and the "impressive versatility" it allowed), they found the "10 to 15 percent" performance boost quite helpful in the typical media center related tasks, but (as expected) didn't hesitate to slam the weak integrated Intel GMA 950 graphics set. Overall, the speedier new Mac earned a 4 out of 5 ranking, and was deemed an "excellent, fully-featured system" -- so be sure and hit the read link for the complete critique on the this maxed-out mini.
