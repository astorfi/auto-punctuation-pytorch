The cheapest unlocked stock Android phone you could buy just got even cheaper: Google has dropped the price of the Nexus 4 8GB to $199 (£159) from $299 (£239), and the 16GB model to $249 (£199) from $349 (£279). It's fast approaching the anniversary date of the latest Google phone, so the timing is about right for the discount. However, we do wonder if this means a replacement is nigh. After all, Google has yet to introduce the next Nexus successor, and we certainly don't think the Moto X is all the Mountain View company has to offer. Until then, the Nexus 4 is pretty much the best smartphone deal for stock Android lovers who hate carrier contracts. So if you feel like snatching one up, you had best hit the store link below before it sells out yet again.


Update: The Google Play Twitter account just sent out a tweet stating that the 25 percent discount (or more) applies not only in the US, but also Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, Korea and the UK. We've embedded the tweet after the break.
