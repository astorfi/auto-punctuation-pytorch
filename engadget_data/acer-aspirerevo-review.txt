 We've been thrilling to the ride of Acer's Ion-powered AspireRevo for a couple of weeks now, and despite its diminutive size and price tag, there's plenty to talk about. The model we tested included an Atom 230 processor, 2GB of RAM, and a 250GB 2.5-inch HDD for what we've heard will carry a suggested retail price of $299. Check out our full impressions after the break.



 Setup We love us a good out-of-box experience, and were mostly pleasantly surprised at our experience with the Revo -- minus one glaring shortcoming. The device has a small power brick, a helpful (if not incredibly firm) stand, and little else to worry about.
