Then take a good, hard look at the exciting screenshot above, which supposedly comes from a field test firmware for the next-gen iPhone that Apple is apparently working on. Not much more to go on than that at the moment, unfortunately, but Boy Genius Report says the screenshot (and a second one after the break) comes from one of its "Apple guys" and, as you can see, it not only offers yet more evidence of video calls, but video call debugging.
