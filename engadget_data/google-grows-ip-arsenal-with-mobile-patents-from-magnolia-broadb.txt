 In the tech industry, you're only as safe as your latest batch of patent procurements. And Google, stuffed with billion dollar coffers, is only too happy to comply. Neatly paired with its recently wrapped Motorola acquisition, the Mountain View-based company's just expanded its intellectual property holdings with a portfolio related to mobile RF uplink solutions. Formerly the property of Magnolia Broadband, the outfit's "beamforming" tech will now undoubtedly aid the search giant's in-house manufacture of smartphone and tablet devices -- likely those of the Jellybean sort. No financial details of the transaction have been disclosed at this time, but you can bet your bottom dollar the price of this innovation didn't come cheap. Über-brief PR after the break.
