Now, it seems the device has received somewhat of a facelift since our initial sneak peek and hasn't lost a bit of its popularity. The A-100 media streamer enables users to stuff an HDD within and transfer files via BitTorrent when not dishing out all sorts of media or acting as a NAS. Additionally, it supports 1080p output and plays nice with just about every format imaginable, including: MPEG1/2/4, MP3, AVI, ASF, WMV, MOV, H.264, XviD, AAC, WAV, JPEG and lots, lots more. Sadly, this $179 gem is currently backordered, and requires some sort of fancy sign-up process just to get in line. Still, with specs like these, the wait is probably worth it.[Via BoingBoing]
