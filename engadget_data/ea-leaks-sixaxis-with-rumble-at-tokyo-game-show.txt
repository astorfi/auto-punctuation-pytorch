The big sticker on the back that says "RUMBLE" doesn't exactly help either. IGN spotted the new, much rumored version of the SIXAXIS while at a pre-Tokyo Game Show event, playing a demo of Burnout Paradise. IGN says the controller is notably heavier than the SIXAXIS, but otherwise looks identical, and the rumble was comparative to a PS2 controller. An announcement is expected tomorrow at Kaz Hirai's keynote.[Via Joystiq]
