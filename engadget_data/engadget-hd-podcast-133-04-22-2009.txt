  Lots of news hit the wire just before we started recording so we once again invited Nilay from the Engadget Podcast to join us and help out. He had an early peak at the Amazon HD streaming and provided some good insight, from an HD snob's point of view. Lucky for us he stuck around for the entire show when we also covered other VOD alternatives, the new Moxi HD DVR and a TiVo survey. Next we kinda struggled through some apparently unexciting Blu-ray news, but pushed on to discuss our most recent HD 101 post. We finally bring it all home with some bandwidth cap talk and a listener voice mail.  Get the podcast  [iTunes] Subscribe to the Podcast directly in iTunes (MP3).
