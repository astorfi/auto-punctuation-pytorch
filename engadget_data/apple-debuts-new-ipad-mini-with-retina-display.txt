It was due for an update, and Apple's iPad mini has gotten a fairly big one today. The new 2013 model finally brings with it the Retina display (2048 x 1536 resolution) that many hoped to see on the original, along with an upgrade to a 64-bit A7 processor that promises up to a 4X boost in performance. Beyond that, you can expect the same 10 hours of battery life as before, along with a 5-megapixel iSight camera, a new front-facing FaceTime HD camera, MIMO support for faster wireless connectivity, and your choice of Space Grey or black color options -- unlike the new iPad Air, however, the overall design of the mini has remained unchanged.


Apple isn't offering a specific launch date for the device just yet, but says it will be available "later in November" starting at $399 for the 16GB model; the existing iPad mini will also stick around for $299. Naturally, there's also a new range of cases to go with the tablet -- they start at $39. Check out our hands-on for a closer look at the new model.
