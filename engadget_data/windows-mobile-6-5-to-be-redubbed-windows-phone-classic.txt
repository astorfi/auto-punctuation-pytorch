 What, you didn't think Microsoft would really keep up with the non-parallel syntax of "Windows Phone 7 Series" and "Windows Mobile 6.x," did you? We knew Windows Mobile 6.5.3 would continue its admittedly less chic existence, but now comes word via I Started Something that it'll be rebranded as Windows Phone Classic. The name change apparently won't take effect until the 7 Series devices start hitting consumer hands -- can't have a classic without something newer to take its place, right? No worries, Sense UI fans, it looks like you'll still have plenty of WinMo support, even if that portmanteau goes the way of the dinosaur.
