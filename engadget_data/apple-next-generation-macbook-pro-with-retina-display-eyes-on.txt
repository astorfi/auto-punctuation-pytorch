We just wrapped our eyes around Apple's new 15.4-inch "next-generation" MacBook Pro here at WWDC 2012, and while it was under lock and key, it doesn't take a touch to see that this thing is devilishly thin. For all intents and purposes, this is the 15-inch MacBook Air that many have been waiting for. Gone is the optical drive, and in are two USB 3.0 ports, two Thunderbolt sockets (side-by-side, instead of one on each edge), a full-size HDMI socket, a 3.5mm headphone port and an SD card slot. Oh, and a MagSafe 2 power connector. On one hand, it's great to see Apple finally embracing USB 3.0; on the other, it's obvious by the duo of Thunderbolt sockets that it'd prefer use those. Whatever the case, the new Pro is quite the looker, and we're guessing Apple won't have any issues moving too many of these beauts -- even at $2,199 (and up).

 Unfortunately, there's no new Pro sitting around outside of a case, but you can enjoy a few glass-enclosed glamor shots in the gallery below.
