There they go with that world's-blank crap again -- ok, we get it Samsung, jeez, you're a worldwide innovator. But for crying out loud, at least tell us just how high resolution this thing is, and what exactly it does differently than other portable 3D displays, okay? Keep an eye out, we're sure to hear more about this soon.
