Recently, both SandForce and Indilinx have all but taken over the SSD market in terms of controller use, but at long last we've got some formidable competition on the benchmarking trail. Samsung's 470 Series SSD range features an in-house controller, and it's obviously got a lot of work to do if it plans on ousting either of the previous two names from their place atop the pedestal. The good news, however, is that Sammy is well on its way. Reviews across the web have sung the praises of this her drive, with Slashgear noting that unlike most drives -- which only truly impress on the read side -- this one also generates drool on the write side. The critics over at Hot Hardware noted that while it won't take advantage of SATA 6Gbps, it doesn't "suffer from a split personality," meaning that performance was shockingly consistent in use. Of course, the rub that everyone points to is the price -- at $550 for a 256GB slab, it's far from cheap, but it's as close as one could get to being worth the premium. Drive in below to see for yourself.

Update: The Tech Report found some fairly interesting caveats during its time with the drive. Feel free to have a look to see how it handled their torture test.
