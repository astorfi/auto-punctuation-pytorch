It seems ASUS has been spending some time with Bang & Olufsen's Chief designer to create a heck of a laptop. There's no denying this is one sleek looking lappie with a polished aluminum exterior, but it's got some pretty cool tricks too -- including dual touchpads that supposedly gives you a DJ turntable-like experience. The high-def, 18.4-inch display is flanked by B&O ICEpower speakers and is clearly meant to live in your living room. It's not all looks here, though. It's got a Core i7 processor, NVIDIA GeForce GT 334M graphics, support for up to 1280GB of storage (with dual drives), a slot-in Blu-ray drive and USB 3.0. We've got no idea what this thing is going to cost ya, but we're hoping to dig up some details and get a hands-on look so stay tuned.
