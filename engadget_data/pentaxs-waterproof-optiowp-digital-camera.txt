We'd more or less resigned ourselves to underwater cameras being bulky and clunky, but Pentax has just introduced
OptioWP, a new ultraslim, waterproof five megapixel digital camera that's just 22mm thick and comes with a 3x optical
zoom lens and a 2.0-inch LCD screen around the back. All the tiny little buttons on it look like they'd be a bitch to
deal with underwater, but to ease your pain they've added a special "Green Mode" where you can have the camera
automatically revert to all your default settings just by pressing the green button.
