In what could be easily construed as a preemptive strike against Apple legal, Creative's
Sim Wong Hoo has gone on record stating that
they will "pursue aggressively" companies that are infringing on their
patent for a media player interface. He went on to say:
"Hopefully this will be friendly, but people have to respect intellectual property." Their patent basically covers the
use of a hierarchal menu structure for navigating media, which clearly encompasses the
iPod's interface, even though it might have been in
development at the time of the patent filing. This announcement comes on the heels of Creative releasing the
Zen Vision:M player, which seems to
"borrow" some Apple design elements. Sim denies any such copying, saying that their player has been in development for
more than a year, and he also takes a swipe at Apple, stating that their player's FM and mic functions mark the
"difference between a technology company and a branding company." Ooh, harsh.
