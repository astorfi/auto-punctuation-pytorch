Of course, it's not nearly the mind-blowing capacity of PQI's monster, but for an external SSD, they don't get much bigger. Sure, it's priced at Â¥94,980 (around $783), which isn't exactly cheap, but if this trend continues these prices are bound to drop -- and just think of the possibilities of never having to hear a drive mechanism failing again. 8GB, 16GB, and 24GB models available late July, but the 56GB variation hasn't been given a release date yet.[Via Akihabara News]
