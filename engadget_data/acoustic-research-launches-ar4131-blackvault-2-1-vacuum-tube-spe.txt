 Acoustic Research is putting out the AR4131 blackVault speaker system with the goal of uniting high-performance components for audiophiles with the portability of the iPod. The 2.1 speaker system features standalone speakers and a stereo vacuum tube amplifier for that good ol' warm sound. As with most other such devices, the blackVault will charge your iPod whilst docked. You'll be able to snag one in February for $199, which includes an aux in cable, remote, and a spare vacuum tube.
