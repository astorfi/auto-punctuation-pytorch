To do that, Google basically rebuilt its index from the ground up, switching from the old index with different layers that would refresh at different rates, to a crazy new index that analyzes the web in small portions on a continuous basis (as helpfully illustrated above) -- all of which should translate to you being able to find newer content, faster. Of course, this is Google, so they've also provided some analogies, noting that if Caffeine were a pile of paper it would grow three miles taller every second, that it takes up 100 million gigabytes of storage and grows at a rate of hundreds of thousands of gigabytes per day, that you would need 625,000 of the largest iPods to store that much information, and that if those were stacked end-to-end they would stretch more than 40 miles. Now you know.
