At this year's Pepcom Digital Experience, the regional service provider had a couple new devices, one of which being the LG Connect 4G. The second LG handset on MetroPCS to offer the next-gen service (after the Esteem), the Connect is certainly less bulky and much more light to hold, with a 4-inch NOVA display in tow. Clocking in at 1.2GHz, it's also the first handset on the carrier's lineup that contains a dual-core CPU. Amongst these specs, the Connect 4G also sports a 5MP rear camera with LED flash and 720p HD video capture, and has a VGA front-facing cam. As much as we begged and begged, the reps wouldn't budge on pricing or an exact date, but we do know that it's going to be coming out sometime in February. And if MetroPCS isn't for you -- or if don't live in one of their areas of coverage -- you'll see the Connect as the LG Viper on Sprint as well. Check out the full gallery of images below and a hands-on video after the break.
