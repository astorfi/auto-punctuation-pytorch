This one slipped under our radar at the show, but the folks at Softpedia managed to get a bit of hands-on time with the company's new PL30JT model, which looks more than a little like ASUS' previously announced UL30 series. The big news with this one is the inclusion of NVIDIA GeForce 310M graphics with Optimus technology, which is complemented by a Core i5-520UM processor, a 13.3-inch 1,336 x 768 display, up to 8GB of RAM, a max 640GB hard drive, and ASUS' own Turbo33 technology, which promises to "enhance performance by up to 33%." No word on a price or release date just yet, but this wasn't one of the models promised in ASUS' initial batch of Optimus-enabled laptops.
