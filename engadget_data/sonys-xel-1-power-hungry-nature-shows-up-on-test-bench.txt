Taking up the point in the quest for world domination is Sony's XEL-1, which we admit puts out a great, albeit small, picture. Lab tests by Tech-On, however, show the 11-inch display has an appetite for power that belies its diminutive size. Check out the link for some insight to the wizardry that makes the XEL-1 work, including ramping down panel brightness after turn-on and insertion of "blanking" frames. But eyebrows at the lab arched a little when the unit ate up 28.4-Watts to produce a pure white image. While that figure won't send your electric meter into Whirling Dervish mode, the CEO of Toshiba says that at sizes beyond 30-inches, OLEDs consume 2 - 3 times more juice than LCDs. These kind of challenges are nothing new to emerging technology, and we're sure manufacturers will get things under control; but for now (in an increasingly "green" world), there are still hurdles.
