A source within Samsung told Reuters of the almost-final plans for a second 8G line from S-LCD, and the possibility that Samsung will cut Sony in on its 10th-generation facility, much like the one its already partnering with Sharp on. Like Sharp, Samsung likely wants to be sure someone will buy all those flat panels once the line is running, and Sony can make sure its got a cheap source to stay competitive on prices when competition will be even higher in 2010. The only thing we can be sure of is it will be nearly impossible to tell who really made that flat panel hanging on your wall, no matter what brand name it says.
