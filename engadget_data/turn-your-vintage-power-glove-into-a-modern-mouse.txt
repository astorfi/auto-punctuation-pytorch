Just thinking about it brings back memories of those glorious early days of virtual reality, when we all imagined floating off to some alternate universe on the wisps of Jaron Lanier's dreadlocks. And, now, if you still have one of those classic controllers -- or can pick one up from someone clueless enough to part with it -- you can turn it into a modern mouse and use it to control your PC. No, it's not the simplest process, but when you're done, you'll be able to relive those halcyon days of yore while running Firefox (or playing GTA). Dreadlocks not included.
