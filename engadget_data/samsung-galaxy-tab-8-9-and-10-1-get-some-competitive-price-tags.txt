The WiFi version of the 10.1 will be up for grabs on June 8th in the US, and as you can see from that lovely chart above, the 16GB version is set at $499 and the 32GB at $599. Did you really have any doubt that Samsung was going after Apple here? The company is being a bit more vague on the Galaxy Tab 8.9 availability, only promising an early summer arrival at this point, but the WiFi version of that one comes in at a bit less. The 16GB option is $469 and the 32GB $569. You'll want to check out our hands-on with the two new tablets, but with this pricing now in our bag, we're certainly getting excited for the summer.
