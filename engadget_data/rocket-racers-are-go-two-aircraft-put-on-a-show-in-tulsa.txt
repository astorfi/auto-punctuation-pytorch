Those actually looking up are only seeing part of what makes the Rocket Racing League so unique, however, as a key component of it is an augmented reality system that not only lets the pilots and viewers alike see the virtual course, but promises to eventually let folks at home test their skills against real pilots. What's more, all of this may not be all that far off -- Rocket Racing League founder Peter Diamandis (of X-Prize fame) is hoping to kick off the first series of races sometime next year. Until then, you'll have to make do with the video after the break.
