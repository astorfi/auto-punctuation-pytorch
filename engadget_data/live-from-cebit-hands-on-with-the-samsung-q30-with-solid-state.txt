However, we just couldn't pass up the chance to run our fingers over that modded, Samsung Q30 laptopwhich tosses out the traditional hard disk drive (and fan) in favor of a solid-state disk (SSD) throwing down 32 mad GBsof heat and vibration-free storage. After all, it's not everyday we get to hold a silent, 2.5-pounds light, 0.7-inchthin, laptop with 12.1-inch display in our mits. Click on for a few shots including the SSD nekkid, next to itsmechanical brethren.
      

 


Held comfortably in one hand -- hardly anytorque on the wrist.
Yeah, we know, it says 16GB...must have pluggedall the thirty-two's into the prototypes.
