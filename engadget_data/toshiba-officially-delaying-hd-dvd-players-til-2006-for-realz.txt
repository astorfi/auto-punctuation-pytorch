In true tennis match style, Toshiba first announced
they might have to delay the launch of HD DVD standalone players here in the States until next year, then
backpedaled to prevent HD DVD buzzkill, saying they might
still release the players in 2005, after all. Well, it seems the official word from Toshiba's senior VP Yoshihide Fujii
came yesterday, and that word is, in fact, "delay." The next-generation DVD players won't be hitting the market in the
States until at least February 2006, because of a delay in the U.S. film studios' supply of their movies in the HD DVD
format. Too badâ€¦ when's that Samsung dual-format player
coming out again?
