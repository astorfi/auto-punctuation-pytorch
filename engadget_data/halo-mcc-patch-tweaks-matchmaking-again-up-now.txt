 
The latest patch for Halo: The Master Chief Collection is live now and focuses on matchmaking, UI, stability and other features, outlined by 343 Industries in summary form after the break.

For matchmaking specifically, the patch promises to improve search success rates, reduce instances of the "Awaiting Privileges" error, more correctly determine player counts in each playlist, fix an issue where players appeared to be searching in the incorrect "find game" screen, and add a countdown sound effect to the voting timer. The update should improve the network performance of Halo 2: Anniversary, lower the music volume in multiplayer menus and fix stability issues across multiple games in both campaign and multiplayer.

The Master Chief Collection has suffered from matchmaking issues since launch, prompting 343 Industries to dole out compensation in the form of a free month of Xbox Live for early adopters, plus a free 1080p, 60fps Halo 3: ODST campaign due in the spring, and a fresh nameplate and avatar.
