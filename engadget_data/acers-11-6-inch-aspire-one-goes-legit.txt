It's an inch thick, boasts a LED backlit screen with WXGA resolution, and runs the usual netbook internals like an Intel Atom processor, 160GB HDD and 802.11 b/g WiFi. On top of that there's Bluetooth, 3G, Dolby Pro Logic Sound and a multicard reader. It's also got a 8-hour lifespan with a 6 cell 5200mAh battery. Build quality is top-notch for its class, and we'd say Acer's doing good by the Aspire One name -- though they're messing with any sort of tight definition of "netbook" in the process. No word yet on price or availability.
