 We see what you did there, Oppo: a triple-12 date for the introduction of its next flagship phone, the Find 5. You'd think it'd be a tough act to follow after the Chinese company's crazy slim Finder from this summer, but as CEO Tony Chen's already teased previously, his next product will boast a five-inch 1080p (441ppi) display along with a quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro APQ8064. It sure sounds a lot like HTC's Droid DNA, but we shall have to wait until the Beijing event to see what Oppo's "fifth element" actually looks like, as well as to see what other surprises it may have for us, so stay tuned.
