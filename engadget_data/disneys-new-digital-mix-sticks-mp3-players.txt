Continuing Disney's push into consumer
electronics are the new Mickey and Princess Digital Mix Sticks MP3 players, which sport Mickey-shaped controls and
polished metal and pink finishes, respectively. Both lanyard-style devices are the same inside, rocking 128MB internal
memory (upgradable to 1GB via SD), rechargable batteries, a USB port, and preloaded content (not too much, we hope;
128MB ain't what it used to be). With Disney going into the electronics biz, does this mean we will start seeing
big-name manufacturers do the content thing? Coming soon to a theater near you: "Apple Presents Steve Jobs in Steve
Jobs and the Seven Lawyers," "British Werewolf in Tokyo: A Sony Joint," and of course Vulcan's "FlipStart the Friendly
Vaporware Ghost." The Disney gear will set you back 50 bones and is set to ship in about 5 weeks.
