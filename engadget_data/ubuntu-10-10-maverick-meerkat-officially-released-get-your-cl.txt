The new Unity desktop interface makes cramped netbook screens more organized, software purchase support might legitimize Ubuntu as an app platform, Ubuntu One brings a free 2GB of Dropbox-like cloud storage to automatically synchronize files and folders, and streams music to Android and iPhone devices too... for a price. There's also full multitouch support, if you've got the hardware. "There's never been a better time to try Ubuntu," the open-source community cries, and they're probably right -- early reviewers claim this Maverick Meerkat build is one of the best they've tried.
