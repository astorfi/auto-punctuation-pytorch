 We've seen a few USB 3.0 peripherals pop up overseas, but by and large, the American market has been left to ponder the future of their transfers. Will they really be stuck with USB 2.0 and FireWire 400 (rest its soul) forever? Will no one rise to the occasion and provide the necessary gear to support the raft of SuperSpeed USB kit that's just around the bend? At long last, those restless nights are coming to an end, as accessory mainstay Belkin has announced today a foursome of devices to help you get every last MB/sec possible from your next external HDD. The SuperSpeed USB 3.0 PCIe add-in card ($79.99) gives your existing desktop a pair of USB 3.0 ports, while the ExpressCard adapter ($79.99) adds a pair to your laptop. Closing things out are a duo of USB 3.0 cables (A-B and Micro-B), both of which are available for $39.99 in a four foot run or $49.99 in an eight foot version. Mama always said speed didn't come cheap, and now you wish you would've listened. Don'tcha?
