 Just in case you missed it yesterday, Apple did indeed confirm that it'll ship the iPhone to a few major countries by Q4 2007, which ends September 30th. Most signs point to the UK, France and Germany as being those lucky "majors," and Apple also mentioned it'll announce carriers (plural) in the coming months. The rest of Europe will have to wait until 2008, presumably as retribution for recent seasons of Eurovision.Update: A re-read of the transcript seems to point at Q4 of the calendar year, not their fiscal year. In other words, December not September.
