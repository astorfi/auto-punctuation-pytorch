It seems as if there may indeed be some meat to those recent rumors that the company is doing away with its white plastic piece of laptoppy goodness -- at the very least, the thing is nowhere to be seen in its current online lineup.

Update: We just received word from Apple that the MacBook has, in fact, been discontinued.

Update 2: While the notebook will be discontinued for individual consumers, Apple will continue to make it available to educational institutions.
