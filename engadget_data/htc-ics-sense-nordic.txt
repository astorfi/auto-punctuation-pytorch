  That's right, folks, HTC is finally rolling out Sense 3.6 -- Ice Cream Sandwich for HTC's "legacy devices" -- in a limited campaign. Who are the lucky folks to be among the first to enjoy the upgrade? Owners of the Sensation and Sensation XE in the Nordic countries, it turns out. We first heard about the rollout on XDA, but have now received the official confirmation directly from HTC headquarters; according to the Taiwanese manufacturer, "broader availability will come later this month." That definitely lines up with what the company's told us before, but we're glad to see it reaching out to users earlier -- even if it's in limited quantities. We hope the rollout goes smoothly and prompts HTC to begin pushing it out to the rest of the world. Fingers crossed.Note: As always, if you meet the criteria listed above and haven't seen the update arrive yet, don't panic -- these things take time to get to everyone.
