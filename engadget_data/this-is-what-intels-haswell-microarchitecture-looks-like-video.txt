The chip shown above (and in the gallery / videos below) is Intel's Haswell microarchitecture, a platform that is destined to slip into slimmer-than-slim laptops and Ultrabooks of the future. As mentioned yesterday, it's built on 22nm process technology, relies on the company's 3D Tri-gate transistors and should lead to over ten full days of connected standby battery life in mobile devices. So, now you know what it feels like to be in The Twilight Zone.
