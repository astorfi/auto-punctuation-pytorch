 In a bit of bad news for Dish Network, the FCC has decided against issuing a waiver for it to start using the spectrum it's acquired from DBSD and Terrestar over the last year or so right away. Company chairman Charlie Ergen that waiting might make it too risky for the company to try and roll out wireless services at all. We'll see if that is truly the case, as the FCC's decision is to opt for a longer "rule-making" process that could take until the end of the year to wrap up before Dish can get started on delivering LTE services. While it seems unlikely Dish is going to get the LightSquared treatment, what exactly this means for its wireless broadband plans, or even the potential of a rumored purchase by AT&T, is unclear at this point.
