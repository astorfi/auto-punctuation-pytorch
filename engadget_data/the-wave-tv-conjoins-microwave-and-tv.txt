You know, the topic of convergence devices is a hot one, and it doesn't get too much hotter than this. Marcel
Wanders' line of home entertainment products for Holland Electro includes this beaut â€” the Wave TV includes a TFT
television screen right in the door, so you'll never get bored again when it's your night to cook. It also includes an
inegrated DVD player, although we can't really imagine anything that needs that much cooking time. Also, no word on
whether the chicken comes included.
