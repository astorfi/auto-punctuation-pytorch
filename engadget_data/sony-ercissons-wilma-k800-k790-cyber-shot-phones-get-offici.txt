Sony Ericsson just announced their K800 and K790 (pictured) cellphones;their first to be tagged with Cyber-shot branding letting you know there's some good digicam lovin' on the inside. Trueto the name, these handsets bring a big 3.2 megapixel camera with flash and lens cover, dedicated shutter button, autored eye reduction, PictBridge support, image stabilization, and a brand new feature called BestPic -- press the shutteronce and get 9 full quality snaps; 4 before and 4 after the actual image you captured all presented as icons on thedisplay. You select the best image(s) from the bunch to keep. The handsets differ in network coverage with the K800going dual-mode UMTS/GPRS while the K790 goes tri-band EDGE with the K790a and K790i destined for the Americas withsupport for 850/1800/1900 and 900/1800/1900 MHz respectively. The K800 also features a second, front mounted camera forvideo conferencing. No surprises from the specs we already saw, but iffeels good to run 'em down again: 2.0-inch QVGA 262K TFT display, 64MB internal flash memory with Memory Stick Micro M2expansion slot, Bluetooth 2.0, an RSS reader, video recording and playback, Music Player supporting MP3/AAC, and RDS FMradio all in a 106 x 47 x 18/20 mm (4.1 x 1.8 x 0.7/0.78 inch) "Velvet Black" package. You'll have to keeplusting a bit longer though, 'cause these won't hit globally until Q2. Many more pix after the break.[Thanks WEI and Rafe and everyone who sent this in]
