 Lost fansite The Tail Section is reporting that sources from ABCs marketing department have indicated Disney's home video arm, Buena Vista is close to announcing a series of HDTV shows coming to Blu-ray boxed sets next year. ABC's Lost would be the flagship of the lineup and include many extras not available on the already successful DVD release. Unfortunately, if you thought the $79 Smallville Season 5 boxed set was high priced you may want to sit down as the rumor pegs a single season of Lost at $200. Future plans would include releasing shows in in two-episode discs, for $20 each. Lost is still a wildly popular series, but $200 per season is just a bit much, no matter what the extras...but you do want to be able to catch every single detail right?
