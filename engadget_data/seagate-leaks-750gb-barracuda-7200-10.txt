Seagate's inadvertently leaked the Barracuda 7200.10line of SATA drives with speeds up to 3Gbps (SATA II), 7200rpm, 4.16ms latency, NCQ, 16MB cache, and 750GB of storage.750 freaking gigs, man. Just another step on the magic road to a 1 terabyte petabyte drive though, youknow? [Warning: PDF link][Via DailyTech, thanks,Diego]
