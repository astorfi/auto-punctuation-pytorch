Motorola promised that it would be one of the first to roll out the Android 4.4 KitKat upgrade to its smartphones, and it's making good on its word. The Google-owned company has announced that Moto X users on Verizon are getting the OS update beginning today. Most of the improvements are those inherent to KitKat itself, such as new Gallery editing features and the smarter phone dialer. However, Motorola has significantly improved its custom camera app -- you can now drag your finger to control both the exposure and focus points. Details for Moto X upgrades on other carriers are coming "very soon," the phone maker says. Whether or not you're part of this first wave, you can check out the KitKat upgrade release notes at the source link.


Update (11/21): The Motorola blog post has been updated today, indicating KitKat is rolling out for the Moto X on T-Mobile as well.


Update 2 (11/22): Now it's AT&T's turn, apparently when Moto said news on other carriers was coming soon, it meant it.
