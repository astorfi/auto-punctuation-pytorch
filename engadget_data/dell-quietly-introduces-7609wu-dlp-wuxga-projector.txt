The 7609WU features a native 1,920 x 1,200 (WUXGA) resolution, DLP / BrilliantColor technology, 3,850 ANSI lumens, a 2,700:1 contrast ratio, twin stereo speakers, a lamp good for around 2,500 hours and a whole slew of ports including VGA (x2), component, S-Video, USB, RJ-45 and HDMI (x2). It'll set you back a stiff $4,999, but just think, you'll never have to spend another cent at the local Cineplex.[Via Electronista]
