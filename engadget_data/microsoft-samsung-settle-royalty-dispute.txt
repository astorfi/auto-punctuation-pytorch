It looks like Microsoft and Samsung aren't eager to drag out their dispute over Android patent royalties. The two tech giants have reached an agreement that ends Microsoft's lawsuit over interest payments and otherwise smooths things over. The circumstances surrounding the deal are "confidential," so it's unclear who made the most concessions. However, it's more likely that Microsoft came out on top. Unless the Windows developer was willing to walk away empty-handed (which is doubtful given its aggressive licensing strategy), Samsung probably had to cough up more money than it originally planned.
