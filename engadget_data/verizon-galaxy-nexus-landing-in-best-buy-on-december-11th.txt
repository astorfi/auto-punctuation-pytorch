The latest rumors had it pegged for December 8th, and that still may be true for official Big Red shops, but now a source inside Best Buy is telling us the big box electronics retailer won't have them in stock until the 11th. The image above, supposedly taken from a Best Buy inventory system, lists the SCH-i515 as hitting the stock room on December 11th of 2011. What it doesn't list, however, is a street date. The phones could go on sale that day, or the next or a week later -- it's really all just guesswork without an official announcement. While the photos certainly seem legit, there are a few discrepancies that give us pause. Particularly, the lighter weight and thinner profile than what is listed on the Google specs page -- 9.34mm versus 9.47mm and 140g instead of 150. But, we're not writing this off as a fake just yet.
