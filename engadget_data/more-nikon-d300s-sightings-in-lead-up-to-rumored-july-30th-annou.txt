Same observations as last time, from what we can tell it's got the same body as the D300 but with holes that suggest a mic input below the logo, although we've seen hints of a SD card slot in previous leaks. As for when we'll be seeing the official debut, Nikon Rumors has a pretty good track record when it comes to these things, and it's reporting with near-absolute certainty that the company has lined up a press conference that'll take place either July 29th in the UK or 30th in Stockholm, Sweden, and a second date for August 4th in Sweden. The first event is expected to be the unveiling for D300s and D3000 and the second some new point and shoots -- or it could be the other way around. Either way, with any luck all these uncertainties will work themselves out by the end of next week at the latest.
