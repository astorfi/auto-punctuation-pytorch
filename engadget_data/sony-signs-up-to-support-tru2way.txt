Today Sony joins Panasonic, LG, and Samsung who have already announced plans to produce cable ready HDTVs, which can take advantage of all the interactive services your cable company has to offer -- including a guide and video-on-demand -- without the need for a cable issued STB. While almost 40 percent of Time Warner Cable markets are already support for tru2way, and Comcast expects to have most of its markets ready to go by the end of the year, there's no word on when Sony expects to release its first device, which we suspect will be an HDTV.
