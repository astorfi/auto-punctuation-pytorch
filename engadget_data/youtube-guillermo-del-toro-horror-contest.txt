Want a shot at filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (Pacific Rim, Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy) peeking over your macabre masterpiece? Sure you do. Come September 22nd, YouTube Spaces is opening its doors to Partners with over 10,000 subscribers and giving them access to a handful of del-Toro-inspired sets as well as pro-grade equipment, in part, to find new voices within the genre. It's also a promo for del Toro's upcoming horror flick Crimson Peak. Del Toro (above) will review the finished products and the best one will get the push to either a digital series or fully-fledged movie. As Variety points out, this runs along the lines of the apparently popular competition Legendary Pictures held to help promote the Godzilla reboot earlier this year. Let's just hope the end results for this contest skew more toward Lights Out rather than, say, #GodzillaProblems.
