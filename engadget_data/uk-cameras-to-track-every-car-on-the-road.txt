 If you though the UK was already thesurveillance camera capital of the world, you ain't seen nothin' yet. But the authorities have seen it all, and areabout to see even more, thanks to a planned network that will combine nationwide data from thousands of roadsidecameras. The new network will be able to track the movements of every single car in the UK, and will store data,including license-plate numbers, for up to two years, in order to create a massive database that will be able to tracktravel patterns of motorists over time. Officials defend the network as a key tool to fight crime and terrorism, andbrush off concerns about privacy: "If the security services did not have access to this, we'd be negligent,"one official told the Independent. Privacy issues aside, the new system won't be very effective against terroristsattacking subway systems, which, if we recall correctly, is a very real problem in the UK. However, we have no doubtthat the authorities are already addressing that issue as well, no doubt with another network of cameras in and aroundevery tube station.
