It's safe to say GoPro's camera business is quite successful -- and there are plenty of things which prove this to be the case. Still, GoPro doesn't want to stop there, so much so that it has now started the process to take its (adventurous) efforts to the next level. The company, which is based out of San Mateo, California, recently announced it has formally filed for IPO, indicating that it will be maturing into a public company pretty soon. We can expect more details once the SEC finishes reviewing all the confidential paperwork -- for now, the official statement from GoPro is right after the break.



GoPro, Inc. announced today that it plans to conduct a registered initial public offering of its common stock. The offering is expected to commence after the SEC completes the review process initiated by GoPro's confidential submission on Friday February 7, 2014 of its draft registration statement.

This announcement is being made pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135 under the Securities Act of 1933. As required by Rule 135, this press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of that jurisdiction.
