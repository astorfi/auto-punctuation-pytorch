 Oh Hitachi, you too? Joining the ranks now of, well, pretty much anyone wheelin' and dealin' a laptop these days, Hitachi just issued a recall on 16,000 Sony-made lithium-ion batteries shipped mostly to businesses in Japan. So, let's tally it up: if you or your buds are proud owners of a laptop from Dell, Apple, Fujitsu, Lenovo, IBM, Toshiba, Panasonic (are we missing any?) and now Hitachi, you'd best be checking those lists to if you've got a potential burner on your hands. Oh, and be sure to tell your friends and neighbors of this massive general recall, who knows, you could be a hero. Acer, HP, you next?
