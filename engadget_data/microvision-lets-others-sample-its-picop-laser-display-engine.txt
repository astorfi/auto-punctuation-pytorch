The company has begun initial shipments of its PicoP Laser Display Engine, found inside the Show WX, for other companies who want to make their own projectors -- or rifles. The circuitry that's half the size of the tech in competing pico projectors while still managing WVGA (848 x 480) resolution and a 5000:1 contrast ratio. No word on cost but we're guessing there's a discount if you buy in bulk, and shipping ought to be cheap.
