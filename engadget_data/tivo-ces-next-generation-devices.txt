While we know TiVo ain't exactly
doing so hot, with a lot of the cable companies opting
to build their own DVRs, so TiVo is shifting focus with their Tahiti strategy (code-name), which will look to find
content from broadband sources as well as regular over-the-air, satellite, and cable broadcasts. TiVo Series 2
subscribers will be able to search and access (read: buy) broadband content a la carte (movies may be $3.99 a pop from
the demo shown) and the desktop software 2.0 will allow users to consolidate music, photos, and video for use
on their TVs.


The TiVo Desktop 2.0 looks amazingly fast, with decent playback quality on the PC from a TiVo source, but requires a
password to playback (not something we exactly want to do every time we watch something). They will also be launching a
high-definition digital cable ready DVR with CableCard and TiVo service built-in in 2006, which we think may be a
little late and no mention was made how many tuners it will include (we hope at least two).


As we reported yesterday at Bill Gates' keynote,
Microsoft is partnering with TiVo for easy playback of TiVo-recorded content on Windows Mobile devices with
TiVoToGo. Sonic Solutions has also partnered up and the
latest version of MyDVD Studio (6.1) will let users burn TiVo programming to DVD blanks for use anywhere.
