 Nintendo's Wii U was supposed to get TVii when the console launched back in late November. That did not happen. Then, when it did launch in late December, two key features were missing: TiVo and Netflix. Despite insistence that the former would arrive in January 2013, Nintendo tells us that both are delayed beyond January to an unknown point in "early 2013." The company specifically notes that said integration is planned for the United States.

 Google Maps and Street View, custom-tailored for the Wii U's tablet-like GamePad, were also given a January 2013 launch window when we first heard back in early December that they were headed to the Wii U. As it turns out, those are also delayed, albeit to a more precise "first quarter of 2013." This news comes on the heels of below expectation Wii U console sales, and word of not one, but two console updates coming later this year aimed at optimizing the hardware -- an issue we struggled with during our review of the console last year.

 Update: Nintendo added the following statements:

  "Mr. Iwata recently confirmed that NCL [Nintendo Company Limited] will delay the release date of Wii Street U in Japan from late January to mid-February to spend some more time on final development work. As NOA announced in a Nintendo Direct on 12/5/2012, Wii Street U will be available for download from the Nintendo eShop in the United States in the first quarter of 2013."
 Per Netflix / TiVo: 

  "Further integration with Netflix subscriptions and TiVo are expected in early 2013 in the United States."
