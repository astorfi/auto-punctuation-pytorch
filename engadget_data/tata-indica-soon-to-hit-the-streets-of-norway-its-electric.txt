Autoblog Green is reporting that the makers of the super-cheap Nano expect to have the electric Indica rolling off the line either late this year or early in 2010. While the Indica EV (above) that was shown at the SAE World Congress is not the model that will be available in Norway, we can probably expect it to look something like it. We don't know any details about pricing, but expect the available number of autos to be "limited." No further info about the car yet, but we'll keep you posted. Hit the read link for a full gallery of the EV.
