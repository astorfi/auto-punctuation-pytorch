       While it's no CableCARD 2.0, at this point TiVo Series3 owners will take what they can get. Most cable companies are using single stream CableCARDs which means you will need two for each of your Series3 TiVos. This means double your installation headache, double your fee. A keen eye member of the TiVoCommunity forum discovered a FCC complaint resolution in which the consumer received an M-Card to satisfy his grief from his cable company -- RCN -- refusing to supply him with a CableCARD. Not only did his letter to the FCC net results, but it is also the first time we have heard of an M-Card deployed in the wild. With some cable companies charging $4/mo per card, this would save you enough for a latte.
