       We're not sure if Kingston is making a statement about the entertainment to be had from owning a USB flash drive (especially those pre-loaded with a couple of simple puzzle and adventure games), or if they really think "mini" and "fun" are both good qualifiers to brand a lineup of unusually shaped storage peripherals, but we can say with some certainty that their vaguely LEGO-like Mini Fun flash drives will run you between $15 and $33 for between 256MB and 1GB of storage. It's summer time, live a little, have some, um, fun.
