What can we say, that puss dominates Japan like a pink, mouthless Godzilla... really, what could poor NEC do. Available now for Â¥199,500 or about $1,645 with plenty of pasted-on Swarovski nuggets destined for the recessed folds at the pit of your man-bag. Sure, you'll buy it for your daughter but we know who'll use it... sissy. [Via Impress]
