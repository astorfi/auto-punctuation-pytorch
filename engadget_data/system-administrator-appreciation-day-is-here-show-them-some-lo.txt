We suggested a card, or at least a polite nod in the hallway. Instead, you went all out and actually gave them a bit of raise. That doesn't mean you can let System Administrator Appreciation Day slip by this year without acknowledgment, however. We're not saying you've got to outdo yourselves and get them some sort of super yacht -- a simple thanks will do. But, they probably wouldn't mind a repeat of last year's gift either.
