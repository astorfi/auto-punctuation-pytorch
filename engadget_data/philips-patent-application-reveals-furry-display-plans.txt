 While other companies are out trying to make displays that are bigger, slimmer, and more expensive than anyone else's, Philips appears to have taken a slightly less conventional tact, setting out to corner the market on furry displays. According to a recent patent application, the company's so-called fabric display would make use of a series of "furs" that would effectively act as pixels, with each standing on end when given an electrostatic charge, revealing a different color underneath (as artfully illustrated above). So while Philips sees the displays potentially being incorporated into furniture and clothing, it doesn't look like they'll be quite capable enough for you to replace your big screen TV with a wall of shag carpeting anytime soon.[Via NewScientist]
