 
Canon's latest pro DSLR is officially here as of tonight: welcome the EOS-1D Mark III. This 10.1 megapixel shooter can fire 10fps in bursts of up to 110 large JPEGs or 30 RAW files with is dual DIGIC III processor. It also features a really friggin light sensitive APS-H size 28.1 x 18.7mm CMOS sensor with ISO modes up to 3200 (it's also got a "highly usable" just-in-case 6400 mode sure to kill image quality), but the real winner here is the 3-inch live LCD (with 5 and 10x magnification for locking that zoom). There's also a new WFT- E2A Wireless File Transmitter option for dumping to external storage and even GPS geotagging, the OSK-E3 Original Data Security Kit for file encryption and verification (if your images are just that valuable), the Speedlite 580EX II flash, and EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM lens. We don't yet have word on price or release date, but you know what they say about having to ask.
