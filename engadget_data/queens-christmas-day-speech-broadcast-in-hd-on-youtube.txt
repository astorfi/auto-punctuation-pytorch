 Those excited to tune into Her Majesty's Christmas Day speech tomorrow will have yet another reason to watch. This year, her entire speech will be broadcast in HD, and for those not near a television, it'll also be available via YouTube. Tomorrow's production will mark the 50th anniversary of her traditional speech, and the new mediums are being used to satisfy her desire to make the address "more accessible to younger people and those in other countries." Interested? If so, you can tune in tomorrow at 3:00PM GMT.
