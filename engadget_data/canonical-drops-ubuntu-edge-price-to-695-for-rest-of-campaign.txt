Canonical's Indiegogo campaign for the Ubuntu Edge smartphone had an auspicious start, but it slowed down after the first few days. The Linux developer may have just rekindled interest, however, by dropping the regular price of the Edge from $775 to $695 for the last two weeks of the crowdfunding drive. Part supplier deals helped reduce the manufacturing costs, Canonical explains. While that's not the lowest price that we've seen during the campaign, there won't be another discount -- if you're at all interested in the unique Android and Ubuntu hybrid, you'll want to make a pledge today.
