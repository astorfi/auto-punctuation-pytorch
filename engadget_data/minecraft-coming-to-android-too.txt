Then you might want to reconsider, as Kotaku has confirmed that the game that's already inspired a documentary will be headed to Android as well. Interestingly, the site says that the game's creators initially held some talks with third-party developers about doing a mobile version, but ultimately decided to do both ports in-house. Details are otherwise still pretty light but, like the iOS version, this one is said to be coming "later this year."
