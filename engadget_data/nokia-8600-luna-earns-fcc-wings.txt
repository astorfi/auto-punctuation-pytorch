Imagine our surprise, then, to find that the rumored 8600 "Luna" has managed to make its way through the FCC gauntlet this week. It's not enough, apparently, that retailers are already trumpeting its existence -- no, even the FCC is going to break the cover on this one before Nokia does. Hey, whatever, that's cool with us. Not much here to look at, but we can confirm that the phone offers up both GSM 850 and 1900 plus EDGE, offering a level of US compatibility that its flashier big sib, the 8800 Sirocco, has failed to do. Still no word on a release, but we're going to go ahead and set up a tent outside our friendly local flagship store in (excessive) anticipation.
