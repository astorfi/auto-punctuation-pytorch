Some, um, creative (read: obsessed) minds have apparently crafted a steel exhaust tip that will show those pesky tailgaters just what you adore. If you need just one more bolt-on to complete the pimping of your ride, and blowing flames seemed a bit too extreme for your 4-banger, this should fit the bill nicely. While it's unlikely these will show up anytime soon in your local automotive store, we're sure someone in Japan can give you the scoop on this fantasmical add-on, and something tells us he's acquainted with Bubb Rubb.[Via BoingBoing]
