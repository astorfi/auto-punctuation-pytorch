US pricing for the base model will start at $49,900, although that's only after you factor in the $7,500 federal tax credit. As Tesla notes, that's the very same pricing that the company first promised way back when the car was unveiled in 2009, but it does come with a few trade-offs (more on that later). Opting for that base model will get you 40 kWh battery, along with 19-inch wheels and the 17-inch touchscreen that's included on all models (complete with a number of connectivity options). The standard Model S can also be upgraded to a 60kWh or 85kWh package for an extra $10,000 and $20,000, respectively (including other performance improvements), while the top-of-the-line Model S Performance option starts at $79,900 (also after the tax credit). Somewhat curiously, while that stand-out touchscreen is standard on all models, you'll have to add the $3,750 tech package if you want built-in navigation and other options like a high definition back-up camera.
