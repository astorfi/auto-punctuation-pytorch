Nintendo's had a pretty tough year trying to push its Wii U into homes, as evidenced by the latest sales figures released today. Since this time last year, the gaming giant has just about doubled the number of Wii Us sold cumulatively, going from 3.06 million units to 5.86 million units as of December 31st. That's right, only 2.8 million Wii Us -- along with 17.68 million software titles -- were sold during 2013, which is pretty worrying when compared to the 3 million Xbox Ones and the 4.2 million PS4s sold in just the first couple of months after they launched. It's also nowhere near the 100-million-unit milestone achieved by the original Wii, which easily beat the more expensive consoles from Microsoft and Sony in the same generation.


On a brighter note, Nintendo managed to sell 12.9 million 3DSs in 2013, making it a total of 42.74 million units plus 152.29 million titles since its debut in February 2011. Alas, net income is still down by 29.9 percent year-over-year to 10.2 billion yen ($98.7 million). With no plans to offer its games on other platforms, we sure hope Nintendo's increased R&D spending will guarantee a solid comeback this year. More details in the PDF document linked below.


Update: Nintendo's bosses are taking a pay cut to make up for the latest loss.
