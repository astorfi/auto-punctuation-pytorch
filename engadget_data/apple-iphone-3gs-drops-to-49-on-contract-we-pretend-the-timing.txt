 Hey, a phone that Apple introduced back in 2009 (that'd be the iPhone 3GS) is now selling -- brand new with a two-year voice / data agreement -- for $49, both at AT&T and through Apple directly. Of course, you could get the far more capable iPhone 4 for a fair amount more, or you could wait until tomorrow so you'd actually have an option when it comes to carriers. Your call, obviously.
