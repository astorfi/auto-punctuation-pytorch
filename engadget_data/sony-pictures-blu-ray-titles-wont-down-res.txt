By now everyoneknows that if they don't have HDCP theymight not enjoy High Definition DVD's in all their glory. What I don't think is as well known is the fact that itis still up to the studios. The studios will decide which movies to down-res over component and even then it will bebetter than DVD quality at 540p. They will also have to mark the DVD packaging so that you know before you buy.
Thatis the bad news, the good news is that Sony Pictures has announced that none of the movies that they own will exercisethis right, which they refer to as a "Image Constraint Token". This of course doesn't mean that they won'tever use it, but instead will wait till analog piracy becomes a problem. 


I hope that the other studios followthis lead and if they don't, I hope that consumers will choose not to purchase discs that limit their experience bydown converting their HD signal over component.
