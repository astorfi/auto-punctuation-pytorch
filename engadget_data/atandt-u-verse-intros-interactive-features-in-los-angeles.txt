 Though we can't say AT&T's newest U-verse "features" are the most exciting we've ever seen, it's nonetheless hoping to lure Los Angeles citizens away from cable with a trio of new extras. Effective immediately, customers (and customers to-be) in the LA, California area can have access to "a suite of new U-verse TV features that further differentiate the service from cable." Provided gratis, the new amenities include the AT&T U-bar, which delivers "customizable weather, stock, sports and traffic information to the TV screen," YellowPages.com TV and AT&T Yahoo! Games. Riveting, we know -- but not nearly as interesting as five or six new HD options.[Via TVOver]
