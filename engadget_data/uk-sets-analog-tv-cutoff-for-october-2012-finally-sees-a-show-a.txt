 It's not that we're upset UK viewers get to watch series like Luther, Misfits and Bedlam long before they officially air here (or in the case of Doctor Who, hours), but we are finally glad to know how a story ends before they do. In this case, regulators have decided that after analog broadcasting shutoffs have already taken place across much of the region, the final transmitters will go dark next year. Just as occurred here, the unused spectrum will then be auctioned off, while most TV viewers will survive, whether on digital OTA broadcasts, pay-TV or otherwise. We made it through with only one TV shot dead in cold blood, here's hoping our counterparts across the Atlantic can handle the changeover as smoothly.
