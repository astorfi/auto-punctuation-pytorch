Speaking with The Wall Street Journal, Samsung product executive Hankil Yoon said that the company expects to ship 10 million Galaxy Tabs and grab a third of the global tablet market by next year. Yoon further added that Samsung eventually plans to introduce a whole family of Galaxy Tab devices, although it's not clear if those factor into his sales projections. Anyway you slice it, however, ten million tablets is a lot of relief on the go.
