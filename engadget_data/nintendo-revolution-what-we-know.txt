Alright, Nintendo intro'd the Revolution just a few
minutes ago, here's what we know so far:




Release is sometime in 2006.




Prototype shown is larger than final unit.




Nintendo is still determining final colors for the console.




All-Access Gaming, which refers to backwards compatibility to 20 years of Nintendo games, NES, SNES, N64. We
  don't know particulars of how it'll be accessed or what, if any, the cost structure might be.




Downloadable to 512MB of flash memory.




SD memory card slot.




Wireless controllers.




Two USB 2.0 ports.




Built-in WiFi.




WiFi used to interface with the DS.




DS likely to enhance future games.




Self-loading optical drive that will play 12cm Revolution discs and smaller GameCube discs




Self-contained attachment for playing media content, including DVDs.




No controller was shown. So even though the box looks a lot like the one leaked over the weekend, the
  accompanying controllers were not presented. So was it a leak, or a really good guess?
