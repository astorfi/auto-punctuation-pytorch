       Take that DirecTV, you announce 1080p "this year" and 130 HD channels in August and DISH one ups you with an announcement that it'll start offering 1080p VOD in August -- but DirecTV fanboys will take some comfort in the fact that DirecTV's latest bird started broadcasting HD channels today, while Echostar XI won't start for a few more months. Either way, this is good for everyone, but based on both company's track record, we tend to take DISH's word over DirecTV's -- after the whole CES 07 lie. DISH subscribers with MPEG-4 HD DVRs should receive an update in the next two weeks that will allow them access the 1080p VOD movies, such as I Am Legend. The release also goes on about how the quality will be "same as Blu-ray Disc quality," but we'll believe that one when we see it for ourselves.
