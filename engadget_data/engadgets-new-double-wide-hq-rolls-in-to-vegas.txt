And in true Kojak style we parked right in front of the central hall just outside the Las Vegas Convention Center. What better base to provide the best CES 2009 coverage on the Net? Check our first pass on the show floor after the break. With roots now planted and enough gadgets to keep us busy 7 by 24... we may never go home.
