 Earlier today we reported the Sony's PS3 would not be delayed in Europe, and now Microsoft is getting the same break as well. The Redmond crew has worked out its differences with the European Commission's antitrust concerns, which will let Microsoft release Vista on schedule (relatively speaking, anyway). Microsoft finally agreed to modify Vista to suit the demands of European as well as South Korean regulators -- we're not exactly sure what that means, but the Agence France Presse reports: "The changes notably will make it easier for users to pick the internet search provider of their choice and allow other firms greater access to Vista's security components." So yeah, Vista's got that going for it now.
