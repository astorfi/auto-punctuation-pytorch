As such it seems to have been given a special treat: access to Froyo, earlier than expected. TechCrunch's MG Siegler is reporting that his handset received Android 2.2 overnight. So far we're not hearing too many other reports of folks seeing this update, but that could be thanks to everyone sleeping off a week of exciting announcements. Sound off in comments if you're waking up to this frosty, low-calorie snack.

Update: We're not sure how this is being rolled out, as hardly anyone is seeing updates, but via Droidnytt we found a number of reports on Twitter that people are indeed seeing the update. 

Update 2: Count us among the lucky few who just received the OTA Froyo update, to our original T-Mobile-based device.

Update 3: We've done some additional investigation, and as far as we can tell, Google is only updating review Nexus Ones that had been provided to the press -- not off-the-shelf phones. We'll stay on this and let you know more as soon as we do.
