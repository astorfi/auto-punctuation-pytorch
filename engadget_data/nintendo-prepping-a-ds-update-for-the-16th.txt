The news comes from gamer importer Lik-Sang, stating that they're hearing from a "Japanesecontact" that Nintendo will announce a NDS: SP on the 16th of this month. This comes in the wake of ReggieFils-Aime's statement that a DSredesign was in the works, and jives with the word from Japan's Famitsu magazine stating that a current Nintendoconsole would be revised soon. SPOnG.com thinks Nintendo will go for a mix between an SP and a flip-phone form factor,and bring the VOIP action (DSpeak anyone?) with the update,but we'd just be happy for something a bit easier on the eyes and a few millimeters thinner.
