Cupertino has been known to share a stat or two during its WWDC keynotes, so it's hardly a surprise that the company just dropped some sales figures for its Mountain Lion. According to Tim Cook, 28 million copies of the OS have shipped, making it the best-selling Mac release of all time. Cook also said that about 35 percent of users have updated, compared to less than five percent for Windows 8. And Apple wasn't just talking Mountain Lion to brag; those numbers were part of a build-up to announcing the latest desktop-based software: OS X Mavericks. Hit up that link for more info.
