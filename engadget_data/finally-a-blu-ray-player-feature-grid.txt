While having a great selection is never a bad thing, it can be very difficult to figure out which is the best Blu-ray player for you. And while we wait for every player in the lineup to have every capability, IDoBlu.co.uk has put together a feature grid that not only includes every player released to date, but it also has all the announced player as well. As great of a resource as this is, like anything this complex, keeping it accurate must be a full time job with all the firmware updates and inaccurate documentation; so if you know for a fact that something is not right, send them a note and let them know.[Via AVSForum]
