While Sony and
Toshiba (among others) are squabbling over
Blu-ray and
HD-DVD, CMC Fuji Photo, CMC Magnetics, and three
other companies have rallied around Optware's HVD
technology—that's Holographic Versatile Disc—and founded
the HVD forum. They may not come out and say it, but they've obviously got bigger fish to fry than the small
stuff—their HVD format stores 1TB of data on a single CD-sized holographic disc (yes, that's over 33 times larger than
HD-DVD, and 20 times larger than Blu-ray's capacity).
