In addition to the cases and Flip Covers we saw at Unpacked earlier this week, the company had some external flashes and professional-looking holsters on hand at its IFA booth, including a grip-mounted adjustable strobe, a ring light set and a sophisticated carrying rig, complete with hinged barn doors to block out unwanted glare. There were also hard covers in multiple dark colors, a handful of soft rubber-looking covers in light colors like aqua and lime green, along with an oversized wireless charging pad mock-up. In typical IFA fashion, booth attendants were unable to provide any information whatsoever, so it's anyone's guess what any of these gadgets cost, or if they'll even make it to market. It's also unclear whether or not any of the accessories are functional at this point, or simply mock-ups of add-ons under consideration. In the meantime, you can take a closer look in the gallery below.
