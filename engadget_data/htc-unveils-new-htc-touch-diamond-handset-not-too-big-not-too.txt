 
Here we are in London at the Soho Hotel with HTC, and we are among the first to see their new Diamond handset. While we thought we may see three new products in three different form factors, HTC Prez and CEO Peter Chou led-off the event by mentioning that they would be launching just one product today. He peppered his intro by talking about the Touch, so we were prepared to see an update on that product utilizing their TouchFLO tech. The device has some pretty nice interface tech that they're calling TouchFLO 3D that heavily emphasizes one-touch browsing and single-finger dialing. They emphasized web accessibility, zoom-in navigation with "just one hand" and not too many fingers. As expected, the device is loaded with Windows Mobile 6.1, a VGA screen and HSDPA 7.2, among other nice specs.Updates, specs, and pics after the break!
      

 

As expected, the Diamond is loaded with prettiness and specs, including (coming as we get them, so refresh for more): Windows Mobile 6.1 VGA Screen Quad-band HSDPA 7.2 One-touch navigation, including single-finger dialing An accelerometer that rotates pictures as you rotate the phone One-touch music playback with an animated music browser A heavily-animated weather forecast app Full-featured desktop-like web browser (Opera) with zoom-in tech that actually reformats to fit the screen upon zoom, although Microsoft promises IE 6 coming soon for it Youtube app and content playback Available in June in Europe via Orange and the "rest of the world" sometime later Orange music store, games, wallpapers, and ringtone downloads Orange mobile TV with up to 61 channels No normal headphone jack - gotta use HTC's proprietary USB dongle "Better battery life" than their other devices (although it uses a smaller battery than the Touch - we'll keep our eye on this) -- will offer a bigger battery at a later time for those who are experiencing battery life issues No pricing info just yetinterface and more product shots in the gallery below.
