You can pre-order this thing of beauty right nowfor around $240, and while you're waiting for it to ship you can watch the video of it in action repeatedly, or do like we do and makehundreds of abstract paintings in an attempt to represent this clock's true inner beauty. Or, well, maybe you couldjust watch the video.
