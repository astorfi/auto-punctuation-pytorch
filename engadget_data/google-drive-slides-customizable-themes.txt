Users of Google Drive will be happy to know that today brings a handful of improvements to Slides, though the update is relatively minor. As you can see in the image above, slides will now be set to widescreen by default, giving you ample room to add text or images to your heart's content. Admittedly, not all displays are widescreen-friendly, so the settings can still be toggled to suit your needs on the page setup screen. Additionally, theme presets can now be tweaked to customize the look of your presentation by simply editing the master slide. And if you're a free spirit who wants to create slide layouts for themes from scratch, you can do that too.
