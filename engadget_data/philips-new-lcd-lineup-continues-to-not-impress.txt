The 52PFL7603D (pictured) is the lineup's flagship and is the "Ultimate Dream TV". If you thought Ambilight was cool, then you're really going to love Invisible Sound and Pixel Plus 3HD, which btw is anything except 3D. But the bad news is, that you'll somehow have to contain all of your excitement for new line until the spring, when the 42, 47 and 52 inch models are expected to be available.
