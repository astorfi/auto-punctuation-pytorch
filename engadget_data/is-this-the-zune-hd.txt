In the gallery below, you can see images from what appears to be a forthcoming marketing campaign for Microsoft's new PMP. We don't have any word on specs right now, though we've got a sneaking suspicion this will have an HD display.  Update: Based on discussions with sources, it's looking very likely that the device in these images is -- in fact -- a new Zune on its way to market.
