ASUS' new Zenbook UX301 and second-gen Transformer Book a little too rich for your blood? You'll be glad to hear that the company has announced what appears to be a more down-to-Earth ultraportable, the X102BA. As suggested in rumors, the laptop is ultimately a rival to Acer's 11-inch Aspire V5. While the X102BA sports a smaller 10.1-inch touchscreen, it uses the same 1GHz Temash-based AMD processor and should offer both healthy battery life and quicker-than-usual integrated graphics. The base 2GB of RAM and 320GB hard drive won't impress anyone, but ASUS is sweetening the pot by offering a free copy of Office 2013 Home & Student with every model. The company isn't providing launch details just yet; still, we wouldn't be surprised if the X102BA is priced well within the budgets of returning students.

Compact laptop features an ultra-responsive touchscreen, the latest AMD A Series APU and Microsoft Office Home & Student 2013, all at an affordable price
Berlin, Germany (4th September, 2013) - ASUS today announced the X102BA, a compact and lightweight ultraportable laptop with a 10.1-inch 1366 x 768 display with 10-point multi-touch for responsive fingertip control with Windows 8. The X102BA also features the latest AMD A Series APU and comes bundled with Microsoft Office Home & Student 2013 for high-performance productivity, straight from the box.
The ASUS X102BA features cutting-edge multi-touch technology that surpasses the standards set by Microsoft for Windows 8. With a multi-touch digitizer that recognizes a contact point with a mere 5mm diameter, rather than the Microsoft recommendation of 9mm, the XB102BA offers much more sensitive touch input for precise applications, such as drawing and painting. The X102BA also features a large multi-touch touchpad with gesture support and a keyboard with keys perfectly calibrated for comfortable typing.
Geared for work and play
The ASUS X102BA is powered by an AMD A4-1200 1GHz dual-core APU with Radeonâ„¢ HD 8180 graphics that balances multi-tasking performance with energy efficiency. ASUS Super Hybrid Engine II technology with 'Instant on' provides users with a smartphone-like experience, thanks to a two-second resume from sleep time, over two weeks a standby time and automatic data backup in sleep mode when the battery level drops below 5%.
ASUS SonicMaster audio technology gives true-to-life sound, while ASUS Splendid display technology with four image presets ensures bright, vibrant color. The X102BA also features USB 3.0, 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0. The X102BA is bundled with Microsoft Office Home & Student 2013 with full versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.
