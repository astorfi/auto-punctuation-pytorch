       We're not suggesting you try this at home (though we're also not suggesting that doing so will melt your MacBook Pro), but according toreports trickling out on the internets, the graphics processor in Apple's MacBook Pro is woefully underclocked. Oneuser who tested his unit found that the MBP's Radeon X1600 came in at just 310MHz, compared to 470MHz on similarlyequipped laptops from other brands (we almost said "similarly equipped Windows-based laptops," but, hey, wecan't do that anymore, canwe?). So, what's a gamer to do? Why, overclock it -- or reclock it, if you believe the unit is underclocked in the firstplace. Just boot your MBP into Windows (you do know how to do that, right?), run ATI Tools 0.2.5 and kiss your sluggishgraphics (and probably your warranty) goodbye. Oh, and just in case you really don't know how to run Windows on yourMBP, it turns out that at least one retailer is now selling models with XP pre-installed. Get one now, before Appleshuts them down.Read - GPURead - XP pre-installed on MBP
