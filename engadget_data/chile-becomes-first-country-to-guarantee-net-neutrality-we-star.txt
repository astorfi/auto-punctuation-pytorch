...ensure access to all types of content, services or applications available on the network and offer a service that does not distinguish content, applications or services, based on the source of it or their property.
There are other provisions as well forcing ISPs to protect user's privacy and the integrity of their systems, but it's the network neutrality bit we're really digging here. However, the cynics among us are wondering how long until ISPs start claiming that bandwidth-hogging sites pose a risk to user's systems. We're sure they just don't want your tubes to get backed up.
