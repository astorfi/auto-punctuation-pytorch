Oh, LG, you sure know how to party! And 'tis (always) the season to get sloshed proper and be merry amongst friends,
after all—though certain substances may aid and abet your red-cheeked colder-months-activities, be sure you know your
limits. But if you can't know your own, there are a variety of devices to lend a helping hand, including LG's
breathalyzer cellphone lineup with the
LG-SD410, LG-KP4100 and LG-LP4100. We can only imagine
Siemens must be less than excited—perhaps we'll find some
of their engineers at the bar drowning their sorrows?
