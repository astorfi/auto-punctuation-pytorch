 Alongside its wafer-thin 4K TVs, LG's curved OLED display was another product that occupies a special place in our CES memories. Fortunate, then, that the product has taken a step away from vaporware, with the company's Vice President of Home Entertainment Europe, Thomas Lee, confirming that its "world-first" curved OLED TVs will launch in the second half of this year. Given the Korean firm's tendency to test new models closer to home, we'd suspect this would be a native launch, but given that the company's 55-inch OLED display made it into at least one store outside of Korea, we wouldn't count out seeing an overseas retail appearance soon after.
