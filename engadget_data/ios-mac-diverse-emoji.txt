If you're disappointed that current emoji characters don't reflect your skin tone, don't worry: Apple is getting ready to accommodate you. Both the latest betas of iOS 8.3 and OS X 10.10.3 include modifiers that let you choose the skin color of some icons. There are more flags, too. And Apple couldn't resist being cheeky -- you'll now see an Apple Watch in place of an ordinary timepiece, just as it already replaces generic phone pictures with an iPhone.



          
 
 
 As for other features? There isn't a whole lot more in the iOS beta besides the previously mentioned wireless CarPlay, although Siri fans will be happy to know that they can now issue voice commands in languages like Portugese, Russian and Turkish. It's not certain when either of these updates will be finished, but they're still early. Given that Apple hasn't even released iOS 8.2 yet, you could be waiting a while to try either release unless you're willing to volunteer for public tests.
