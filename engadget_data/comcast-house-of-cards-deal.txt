Have you been eager to watch House of Cards, but haven't wanted to spring for a Netflix subscription? If you're a Comcast subscriber, you no longer have to. The cable firm has reached a deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment that lets subscribers buy the first season of House of Cards through the Xfinity Store on their set-top boxes. Orange is the New Black will reach the store on May 13th. The arrangement also gives provides access to some hotter Sony movies and TV shows before the usual video on demand release window, including American Hustle and Breaking Bad. Netflix still has exclusive streaming rights for its shows, but that shouldn't be a problem for Comcast customers with a little extra cash on hand.
