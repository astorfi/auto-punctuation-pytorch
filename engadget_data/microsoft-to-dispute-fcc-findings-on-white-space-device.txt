In an attempt to convince US regulators that use of the soon-to-be-abandoned 700MHz spectrum is "safe" for wireless internet services, Microsoft (along with White Space Coalition cohorts such as Google and Intel) is claiming that the technology is sound and can work side by side with its broadcast television neighbors -- and they have proof. As you'll recall, the first round of tests apparently produced "static" on nearby channels -- leading the FCC to send the coalition packing -- but Redmond is claiming that a new study carried out by the airwave-controlling agency yielded positive results. So, what might have been a major wind-out-of-the-sails-moment for the 700MHz-champions is starting to look more like a healthy gust of air.
