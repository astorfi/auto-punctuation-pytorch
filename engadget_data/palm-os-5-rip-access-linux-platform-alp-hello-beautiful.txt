 Palm fans, steel yourselves. We have some newsfor you this morning. Today at 3GSM Access, the Japanese company who boughtPalmSource last year, announced the (kinda) unexpected: the next version of the Palm OS. We know, crazy, right?PalmSource dragged Palm OS 5 (Garnet) kicking and screaming to its death, but what do we have to show for our years ofpatience waiting for Palm OS 6 (Cobalt)? Well, first of all, don't call it that at all -- Palm OS 6 / Garnet is gone --Access is rebranding their OS (and yes, it is now their OS to rebrand) and went "Access Linux Platform," avery sober name for um, the Access platform that runs Linux (kernel 2.6.12 or above, to be exact). And when we sayrebranding, we really mean it; though it will run classic Palm OS 5 applications, apps written for Access's newapplication framework, MAX, and even Linux apps written for the Gnome frontend, the ALP user interface is said to bearprecisely no resemblance to the Palm OS of yore. Sounds like all we can do is cross our fingers and hope for the bestwhen Palm OS 6 ALP starts showing up in devices set to be launched in 2007.[Via Phonescoop]
