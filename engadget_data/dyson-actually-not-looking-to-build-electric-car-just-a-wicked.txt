At least that's the message a company spokesperson wants you to believe. Contrary to earlier reports, James Dyson is not looking to enter the electric automobile sector in any way, shape or fashion. Said spokesperson was quoted as saying that "James Dyson did say that [Dyson's] new digital motor could power a car, but it is not working on, and [we] have no plans to create an electric car." Okay, but can you at least make the Ball 2.0 street legal?[Via AutoblogGreen, image courtesy of Telegraph]
