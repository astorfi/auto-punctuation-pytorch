We haven't tried it ourselves, but we're told it's working fine, and that snazzy new version of Sense is apparently quite snazzy and new. Of course, you're risking your phone and all your data if you try this, so the absolutely smart and prudent move is to wait for the official update, but do let us know how it goes if you're daring enough to load it up, okay?

Update: And just like that, it's been ported to the Sprint Hero, although not everything works quite yet. You be careful, kids.
