As Heck points out, a lot of the console's games were "FMV nonsense," but, like most gaming systems, the 1994-released CDX had its ardent supporters. For those of you who fit the description, Heck's combined the CD drive and motherboard from an old CDX with a chopped six-button Genesis controller, an old camcorder battery, and a four-inch LCD screen to bring you a bulky but portable console. Now you can enjoy a game of Snatcher at the laundromat while your Sonic the Hedgehog Underoos hit the spin cycle. Check out the video after the jump.
