In addition, it seems that the company has been "actively sourcing" iPhone developers to bring their existing titles to PSN. Who knows? Maybe the quick'n'easy approach to games (and someday apps?) will take some of the sting out of the PSPgo's "premium" price point. Either way, if all this is true it's turning out to be a red letter day for iPhone devs.
