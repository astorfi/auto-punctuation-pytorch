We doubt that many of AT&T's BlackBerry users want to buy a Q10 just to get BlackBerry 10.1, and today they won't have to: the upgrade is rolling out now to the network's Z10 owners. The OS update is similar to what we've seen elsewhere, adding Skype support and HDR photography as well as improvements to both the Hub and notifications. Z10 users should get BlackBerry 10.1 over the air, although those who prefer to update the wired way can visit the source link for a download.
