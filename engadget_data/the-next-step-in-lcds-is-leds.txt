 Everything has a downfall. LCDs are notorious for being backlit too much causing bad black levels. Plasmas, on theother hand, do not suffer from this. Nether will LCDs though if manufactures starting using LED (light-emitting diodes) instead of conventional backlighting. This process will cost a tad more thenthe current method, but I believe that there is enough of people like us that will pay a bit more in order to achieveplasma like colors. Right?
