 While Samsung backed downearlier this year on plans to produce a combo Blu-ray/HD DVD player, it looks like hometown rival LG is picking up thatparticular gauntlet, and may introduce its own dual-format player later this year. According to an internal memo sent byan LG executive to the company's US sales force, LG is dropping plans to introduce its first Blu-ray player, the BD199,which was originally planned for this spring (and which the company was proudly showing off at CESjust two months ago) due to "uncertainty in this early stage of the market for pre-recorded high-definitionoptical discs." Instead, the company will consider developing a dual-format player, which could be available asearly as the fall. The announcement comes just a few weeks after LG signed an HD DVDpatent-sharing agreement with Toshiba, and seems to indicate that the company is intent on hedging its bets as theBD/HD DVD war begins in earnest.[Via HDBeat]
