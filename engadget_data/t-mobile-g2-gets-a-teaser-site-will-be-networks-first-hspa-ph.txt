As to the speculation, a previous roadmap leak and T-Mobile's own reps indicate it'll be a HTC-built handset set for a September release, while a careful eyeballing of that silhouette leads us to thinking it's the same device as the purported myTouch HD we've been seeing around here lately. Whatever it is, it's coming soon!
