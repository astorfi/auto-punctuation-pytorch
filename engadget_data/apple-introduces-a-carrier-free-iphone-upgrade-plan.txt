Apple announced an alternative to paying your carrier for new iPhones at its press event today. Dubbed the iPhone Upgrade Program, the new system will allow customers to get a new phone every year while upgrading to the new flagship device annually. The 24-month installment plan starts at about $32 a month for the 16GB iPhone 6s. As the Apple website explains, "After 12 installments, you can get a new iPhone and start a new iPhone Upgrade Program. No more waiting for your carrier contract to end. Just trade in your current iPhone for a new one, and your new program begins." This is similar to installment plans offered by the major carriers, albeit for an unlocked device that also includes Apple Care. The program launches at 12:01 AM on September 12th alongside the 6s pre-orders.
