 Ready for your quarterly dose of Windows 8 sales figures? After hearing that some 40 million licenses had been sold through last November, the company's CFO and CMO for Windows Tammi Reller announced here at CES that Microsoft has sold 60 million Windows 8 licenses to date. According to her, that number includes "sell in to OEMs for new PCs," but she didn't clarify whether or not it includes blockbuster deals like the $617 million one it recently landed with the US Army, Air Force and DISA. Reller also noted that the numbers are "roughly in line with where we would have been with Windows 7." Moving 20 million of anything over a single holiday season is pretty impressive, and we'll be keeping an ear out for more details should they emerge.

 Update: Microsoft also announced that "since the opening of the Windows Store the number of apps has quadrupled and it passed the 100 million app download mark â€“ just two months after general availability."
