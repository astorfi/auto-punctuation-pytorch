Ok, so we're about ready to declare DivX/media playing drive enclosures the new hotness, so feast your hungry eyes
on Savit's Rapsody RSH-100 (not to be confused with the other
Rhapsody), which transforms that plain jane
3.5-inch desktop drive into a media-player extraodinaire supporting 720p and 1080i HD , DVI, component, S-Video and
composite outs, and codec such as DivX 3, 4, 5, XviD, Qpel, MPG, VOB, IFO, DAT, MPEG-4, MP3, WMA, OGG. Oh, not to
mention DTS 5.1 audio, and USB On-The-Go. Um, that's a lot (and thank you, Savit). Any takers for American
distribution?
