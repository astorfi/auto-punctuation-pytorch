 We've wanted a camera that we could take everywhere to record
everything we see from our POV ever since we saw Edison Carter doing it back in the day. Of course, his rig was way too
bulky and cumbersome to really carry around for any length of time. Fortunately, now that we're living 20 minutes in
the future, all that has changed, and there are setups like the DoubleVision series from the U.K.'s Second Sight
Surveillance (not to mention other POV-cams from outfits like
Viosport). The DoubleVision Pro is particularly
sweet, combining a head-mounted camera with a pocket 30 GB HDD that can store as much as 46 hours of video. While
Second Sight markets the unit as a mobile surveillance device, we could easily see ourselves donning this and zapping
our raw footage up to Bigtime TV.
