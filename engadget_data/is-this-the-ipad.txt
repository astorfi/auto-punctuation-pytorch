 Ok, so no sooner do we post up Archpartners' concept for what the "iPad" might look like than a tipster writes in to lets us know that Fscklog has what is supposedly an "official" rendering of the world's first (and hopefully last) iPod-inspired building. It's hard to tell for sure whether this is James Law Cybertecture International's final design for the building or just another concept, but one thing we do know is that this latest version looks like it's a little more Tetris-inspired than iPod-inspired.
