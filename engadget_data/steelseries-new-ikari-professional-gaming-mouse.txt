The outer shell is built to accommodate the "three major gaming grips" of "Swipe, Claw, and Palm," and gamers can select their choice of models: a high-res optical version for FPS gamers, or a laser system for RPS and MMO addicts. Both feature switchable DPI settings and five programmable buttons, with a proprietary 500MHz transmitter to reduce any lag or interference. No word on price, but SteelSeries says these'll be out in Q4, so you gamers had better start saving your pennies.[Via IGN]
