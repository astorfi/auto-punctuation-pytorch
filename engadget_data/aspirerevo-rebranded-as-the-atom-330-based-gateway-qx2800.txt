Except, instead of being known as the Acer AspireRevo, its been rebranded as a Gateway QX2800. Actually, that isn't the only difference -- the CPU on this new guy has been upgraded to an Atom 330 dual core, and storage is now 500GB. But besides that, its the same kid: NVIDIA Ion 9400M graphics chipset, 4-in-1 card reader, WiFi 802.11b/g/n, HDMI output, and six USB 2.0 ports. According to PCADV, the dual core processor could give this machine a 40% performance increase over the AspireRevo. To ship with Windows Vista Home Premium with SP1 at some vague point in the not too distant future.[Via iTech News Net]
