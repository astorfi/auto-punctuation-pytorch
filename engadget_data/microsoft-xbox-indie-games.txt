Microsoft's massive E3 press conference wasn't just about big-budget shooters -- the company also took some time to highlight the many smaller titles coming from indie developers. The highlights include Tacoma, the next game from Gone Home studio Fullbright, which is about a woman who finds herself stranded on a space station; Ashen, a stylized adventure game that seems to have the scale of Shadow of the Colossus; and Beyond Eyes, a painterly looking game about a young girl exploring the outdoors. We also got a quick look at several other titles in a promo video, which you can check out below.
