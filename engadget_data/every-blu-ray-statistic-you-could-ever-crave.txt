While we can't imagine how much effort went into creating it, a new website has been launched that details nearly every aspect of Blu-ray imaginable, right down to how much each film grossed at the box office and what percentage of discs sport lossless audio tracks. 'Course, as great as this site is, only one obvious question remains unanswered: who's up for creating an HD DVD counterpart?
