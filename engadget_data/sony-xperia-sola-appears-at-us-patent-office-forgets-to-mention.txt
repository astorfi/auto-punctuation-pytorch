  So far, the extent of Sony's 2012 smartphone portfolio for the US extends only to the AT&T-bound Xperia Ion, with no word just yet whether the see-through banded Xperia S will arrive on American shores. What happens if it was called the Xperia Sola? That very name's showed up at the US Patent and Trademark Office, although that's largely it. So it could be a phone we've already seen, or perhaps one of those many road-mapped pseudonyms. Well, with a certain big mobile event just around the corner, we're sure to get a few more answers on Sony's other plans for the New World later this month.
