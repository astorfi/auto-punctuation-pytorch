Generally Vertu phones are much flashier in real life than in basic diagrams, but we'll take what we can get -- especially when it comes to phones that haven't actually been officially announced (or rumored) yet. The set of lines, boxes and numbers you see above is the Vertu Constellation V, a device we actually haven't heard anything about. But here it is, receiving FCC approval; the phone sports AT&T and T-Mobile HSPA+ and GSM / EDGE, dual-band WiFi (802.11a/b/g/n), NFC and Bluetooth 4.0. We'd wager that this is the luxury phone company's next Android handset (second after the Ti), and it'll probably cost more than the monthly rent.
