It looks good on paper at least, with a 13.5-megapixel sensor, 28mm wide angle lens and built-in Ethernet (a first for a consumer grade camera). Unfortunately, the big ticket items like on-board GPS (for geo-tagging all those coolpix you'll be taking) and NRW file format support (the new "RAW" image format developed by Microsoft and Nikon) are said to be poorly implemented and all but unusable. Even the much-ballyhooed LAN connectivity is limited to something called MyPictureTown. Hit the read link to catch the reviewer holding forth on a number of other salient points, including the camera's DSLR-like hand-grip, optical viewfinder and external flash hotshoe.
