Is this the headless $500 Mac we've been hearing about? Every Macworld there's always a bunch of hoaxsters who think
they'll get their kicks pranking the Mac community with fake pics of some hot new product that Stevie J. is rumored to
be coming out. We can't vouch for the authenticity of these, but a bunch of pics and a video have turned up showing the
"iHome Media Center" being removed from its box. If it's legit (and again, we still don't know this for sure), then
what we're looking at is a small-form factor Mac with a slot-loading optical drive and a bunch of ports around
back.
