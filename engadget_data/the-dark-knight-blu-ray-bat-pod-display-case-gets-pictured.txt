 
Back in September, we heard that a limited edition The Dark Knight box set would be motoring onto the scene this December 9th, and now, we're being assured of that. The HD Room has acquired a number of images detailing the Bat-Pod package, which will include an exclusive display case, Gotham Uncovered: Creation of a Scene, Batman Tech: The Incredible Gadgets and Tools (in HD), Batman Unmakes: The Psychology of the Dark Knight (also in HD), a few other bonus features and the feature film in 1080p with a Dolby TrueHD 5.1-channel audio track. Worth $64.99 (MSRP)? Check the rest of the images in the read link to make that determination.
