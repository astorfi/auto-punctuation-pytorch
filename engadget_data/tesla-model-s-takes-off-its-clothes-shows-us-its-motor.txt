A fully naked Model S is on display at the company's booth, bare frame and bare aluminum separated by a Lucite riser, giving us a glimpse at the car's motor nestled between the rear wheels. Take a look at it, barely bigger than the exhaust of a modern musclecar yet powering this thing to 60mph in 5.7 seconds and up to an anticipated maximum 300 mile range. Unfortunately the tangle of wires and other components that'll actually make this thing go are missing, and the paint, but it's still a great view at the simple, obviously Elise-inspired frame that holds it all together.
