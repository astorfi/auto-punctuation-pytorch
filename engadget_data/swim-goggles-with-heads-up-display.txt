Like Katie Williams (Brunel University grad, proud Welsh
   dragon) our interns find it hard to remember how many laps they've swum here in the Engadget HQ Temple Garden â€”
   especially when we release the robotic swimming
   snakes. Fortunately, Williams' developed a system which projects the number of laps swum, speed, and the
   elapsed time right in the goggle lens while maintaining the feel of ordinary goggles. This allows swimmers to
   maintain their form instead of straining to glance at pace clocks or watches which warp their hydrodynamics. A
   small button on the side of the goggle turns the display on and off and signals to the "compass" the direction of
   travel - when the swimmer turns, the time is registered and lap-count increments.
