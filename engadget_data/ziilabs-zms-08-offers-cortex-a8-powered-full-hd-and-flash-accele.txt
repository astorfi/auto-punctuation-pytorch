ZiiLABS' ZMS-08 is a third generation mobile media accelerator / system-on-a-chip that boasts its predecessor's 1080p playback and 24fps encoding, and HD video conferencing via simultaneous 720p encoding and decoding, while adding all-new OpenGL ES 2.0 support, an integrated HDMI controller, X-Fi audio and Flash acceleration. Paired to a 1GHz ARM Cortex A8, and running a custom flavor of Android alongside Plaszma OS, the new Zii chip will look for homes in "web tablets, netbooks, connected TVs" and the like, but seemingly not smartphones. ZiiLABS has already signed up a number of clients, who'll start receiving shipments in Q1 of 2010. Full PR and an architectural diagram after the break.

Singapore (Vocus/PRWEB ) November 8, 2009 –- ZiiLABS, a pioneering media processor and platforms company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Ltd. today announced, the ZMS-08, its 3rd generation media-rich applications processor that brings 1080p Blu-ray quality H.264 decode to low-power devices. Delivering more than four times the performance of previous generation devices, the ZMS-08 combines the flexible multi-format media processing capabilities of ZiiLABS' StemCell Computing array with an 1GHz ARM® Cortex™ processor to deliver the low-power, high performance media-rich processing required of next-generation connected devices such as web tablets, netbooks, connected TVs, video conferencing systems and home media hubs.The ZMS-08 is sampling now to certain customers and is supported by ZiiLABS' optimized Linux-based Android™ and native Plaszma™ operating systems and development platforms.The ZMS-08's proven StemCell Computing array provides the media processing capabilities to deliver full HD 1080p high-profile H.264 video decode, simultaneous H.264 encode and decode at 720p, 1080p 24fps encode, accelerated OpenGL ES 2.0 3D graphics at up to 1 Gpixels/sec, 2D processing, compositing, image processing and advanced Xtreme Fidelity™ X-Fi Audio effects. With the low-power ARM Cortex processor running at up to 1GHz, the ZMS-08 is aimed at small form factor devices that enable content currently accessed via the PC to spread to mobile and low-energy devices."Combining advanced ARM technology with its own media processing IP has enabled ZiiLABS to deliver the high performance and low-power consumption required to enable the next leap in the mobile internet revolution" said Ian Drew, EVP Marketing, ARM."The ZMS-08 processor confirms the flexibility and scalability of our architecture and enables our customers to develop richer mobile and connected devices that are four times faster and twice as power efficient as previous solutions," said Hock Leow, President of ZiiLABS. "Its new capabilities such as Blu-ray quality playback, 720p simultaneous encode and decode of H.264 video, accelerated OpenGL ES 2.0 and rich peripheral integration such as dual USB controllers and HDMI are blurring the boundary between the capabilities of the traditional PC and connected device."High Quality HD Video Encode and DecodeFull HD video playback at 1080p supporting H.264 High Profile at up to 40Mbps means users can experience Blu-ray quality video playback direct to their 1080p TV utilizing the integrated HDMI controller. Crystal clear 720p H.264 video encode and decode at 30 fps enables users to keep in touch with their friends and colleagues via videoconferencing.Accelerated 3D GraphicsSupport for OpenGL ES 2.0 3D graphics and 1 Gpixels/sec fill rate enable a new class of user experiences including enhanced user interfaces, PC-like 3D gaming and Adobe® Flash® 10.Enhanced Audio and VoiceThe inclusion of Xtreme Fidelity™ X-Fi audio technology delivers a great sounding audio experience. Crystalizer intelligently restores audio detail lost during file compression and CMSS-3D adds the surround sound experience to headphones and stereo speakers and up-mixes stereo to sound great on surround sound speaker systems. The Smart Volume, Dialogue Enhancer, Acoustic Echo Cancellation, graphic equalizer, microphone beam former and noise reduction modules offer customers a complete portfolio of advanced audio processing that make their products sound better.ZMS-08 FeaturesThe ZMS-08 flexible StemCell Computing array features 64 fully programmable floating point processing elements that off-load the media processing from the ARM CPU to deliver superior media capabilities coupled with improved application performance. The flexible array architecture enables users to experience the widest range of community generated and commercial content including H.264, Microsoft® WMV9, MPEG2, MPEG4, OpenGL ES and Adobe Flash.The tightly coupled 1 GHz ARM Cortex-A8 provides a secure, high performance main CPU that features a 256K L2 cache, NEON™, TrustZone® security technology and 1 GByte addressable RAM.A wide range of integrated peripheral functions help to reduce system costs, complexity and device footprint. Dual USB 2.0 OTG controllers with PHY and ULPI interfaces provide direct connection to USB hosts, peripherals and high-speed modems. Four HD video processing units support camera and display input and output processing with the integrated HDMI and Analog video encoders supporting HD-TV 1080p output at 60fps. The secure Boot ROM, three SDIO/MMC ports, UARTs, SPI, GPIO and advanced 64-bit and 32-bit memory controller supporting mDDR and DDR2 at up to 333MHz provide the interfaces and memory bandwidth required for today's media rich connected devices.AvailabilityThe ZMS-08 is sampling to certain customers now and is scheduled for volume shipment in the 1st quarter of 2010. The chip is housed in a 13x13mm, 424-pin FBGA package.
