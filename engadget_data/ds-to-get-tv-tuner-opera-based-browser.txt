Very few details are known about either product at this point, althoughNintendo has said that the browser will start shipping in June for around $32. Neither a price nor a release date havebeen mentioned for the tuner. Follow the "Read" link for more pics...Update:More info at Joystiq, here.Update 2: Just to clarify, the TV tuner is only capable of receiving "One-Seg"broadcasts. "One-Seg" is a kind of terrestrial digital broadcast, meaning this TV tuner cannotreceive traditional analog TV broadcasts. Unless more countries hop on the One-Seg boat in the near future (Japan isset to launch One-Seg broadcasts on April 1st of this year), it's extremely unlikely this accessory will ever getoutside of Japan.[Thanks, Tom]
