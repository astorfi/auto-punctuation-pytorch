Vudu is joining Netflix in trying to put another nail in DVD's coffin by offering interactive features for select Sony films. The Walmart-owned streamer calls the new service Vudu Extras+, and kicked it off today with deleted scenes, featurettes and trivia from Sony's District 9 alien flick. Other perks include an "enhanced scene search" for dialogue, videos, photos and more, along with "clip and share," which lets you grab and share film snippets on Facebook and Twitter. Netflix mentioned it will test similar features for its original shows like House of Cards, and could expand it to other content if it catches on. Film buffs may stick with Blu-ray for director commentary, subtitles and the like, but we wouldn't be shocked to see those technical obstacles hurdled soon, too.
