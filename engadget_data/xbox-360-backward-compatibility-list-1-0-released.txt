Since day one Microsoft's been a little, uh, shall we say wishy washy on the
backward-capability issue on the Xbox
360. Yes, now we know that's because a lot of it has to do with re-developing games (to a limited extent, anyway)
to run on the 360's architecture, but it looks like they've finally gotten their release list from the game studios
since they're now live with the official launch backward-compatibility list. Though they didn't specify which titles
will be able to run high def (yes, some of the classic Xbox titles have been redeveloped for 720p), we will apparently
be able to play Splinter Cell, Half Life 2, Halo and Halo 2 (duh), and GTA3, Vice City, and San Andreas (hard drive
add-on, pending, of course).
