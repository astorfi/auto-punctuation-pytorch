Mac OS X Mavericks. iOS 7. Haswell-equipped MacBook Airs. Mac Pro sneak peeks. Videos of retail store openings. Yes, all of the above were showcased in this year's Apple WWDC keynote, but what if you weren't able to get online in time to see it live? While our liveblog and events hub are both great opportunities to get caught up, it's hard to say no to a live and professionally made video. Point your Safari browser (no other browser will work, as far as we can tell) to Apple's events page and you'll be treated to a visual smorgasbord of new firmware and hardware, if you so desire.


Update: If you have a penchant for consuming your media through iTunes, you might be glad to hear that the keynote has made it to the service as a podcast. Jab the second source link below to snag it.
