To disable the alarm, you must reconnect the red, yellow, and blue cables in the correct order. Fail your mission and suffer the annoyance -- and possible death -- of a mocked audible explosion. Genius. Just ?2,366 in Japan or $19... if you can get it back through customs. Warning: not for use in the Boston Area.[Via Akihabara News]
