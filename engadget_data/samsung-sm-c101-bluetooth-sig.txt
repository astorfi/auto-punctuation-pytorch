Slapping Android on a point-and-shoot worked surprisingly well for Samsung with the Galaxy Camera, but the device did have flaws -- not least its size and inability to make phone calls. A rumor that originated on SamMobile a few days ago suggested that the South Korean handset maker is working on a sequel called the SM-C1010 (or possibly "S4 Zoom") that adds an ear piece and shrinks the screen down to 4.3-inches from the original model's 4.8-inch display. Another rumor at Hi-Tech.Mail.Ru hints at a smaller 10x zoom, instead of 21x.


Now, this same SM-C101 model number (albeit missing the last zero) has cropped up on the Bluetooth SIG's website, leading us to believe that something is up. The rumors also point towards this mysterious handset having a 16-megapixel sensor, qHD AMOLED display, 8GB of built-in storage along with a microSD card slot and Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy support. At first glance, a smaller screen with fewer pixels may not sound too appealing, but if it results in a cheaper, longer lasting and more pocketable device, then we might be persuaded.



Update: We originally reported the model number at the SIG as SM-C1010, instead of SM-C101. This has been fixed in the post.
