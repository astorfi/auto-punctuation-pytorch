Whether or not you believe that Destiny lives up to all the hype, there's no doubt that it has a lot of gamers hooked. Bungie has revealed that the hybrid of shooter and online role-playing game is managing an average of 3.2 million players per day in the month since its launch -- no mean feat given that even a well-established (if subscription-based) rival like World of WarCraft has 6.8 million users. That's also more active players than the company saw during a similar period for both Halo 3 and Halo: Reach combined, so the absence of a familiar franchise clearly isn't spooking users.



These early adopters are fairly consistent, too. People typically fire up Destiny for three hours per day spread out over roughly two sessions, and they've signed in about 21 times each since the title debuted a month ago. That's not going to compare to the time spent by dedicated role-players, but it's clear that the game isn't just sitting idle on players' hard drives.
