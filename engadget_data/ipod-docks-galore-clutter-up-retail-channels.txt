Today's flavors comprise a virtual cornucopia of boringness, with Onkyo, Elecom and iLive all trying their darnedest not to stick out. Onkyo starts things off with their Wave Radio-inspired AERO Sound System (pictured), which includes CD playback, has a 5 watt 2 channel speaker, and will go for around 40,000 to 50,000 yen (about $335 to $419 US) when it goes on sale on November 30th. Next we have the the ASP-WP8 from Elecom, which boasts of 5.5 watt 2 channel sound, some decent looks and a 16,065 yen pricetag ($135 US). The ASP-WP8 will be out in late October. Finally, we have the painfully named IHMD8816DT Home Docking System from iLive, which boasts of full-on DVD playback along with the simple iPod docking action, and will be retailing for around $160. All three players come with cute little remotes, and while the first two appear to be Japan-only, the iLive dock should be inciting yawns from the store shelves of our very own shores. Check out the Elecom and iLive after the break.Read - Onkyo AERO Sound SystemRead - Elecom ASP-WP8Read - iLive IHMD8816DT
