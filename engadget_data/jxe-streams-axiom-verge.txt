Axiom Verge -- a grotesque and intoxicating new action game for PlayStation 4 due out next week -- wears its heart on its sleeve. From the aliens wandering its creepy interconnected halls to the variety of unusual tools you find exploring its twisted world, creator Tom Happ's game explicitly calls back to Nintendo's Metroid. Rather than lose its identity in an homage mishmash, Axiom Verge actually uses that inspiration to build a demanding game that feels as new as it does eerie. We'll dig into its deep parts and interview Happ himself on today's stream!



Starting at 3PM ET on Engadget.com/gaming, Twitch.tv/joystiq and right here in this post, we'll be playing the first two hours of Axiom Verge for your viewing pleasure. Then creator Tom Happ will join us at 4PM to discuss the game and the thorny business of making a successor to Metroid.
