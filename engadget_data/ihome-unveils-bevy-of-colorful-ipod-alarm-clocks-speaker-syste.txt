Going for that classic look, the iH14 is a tabletop iPod speaker system with a wood or black leather finish, AM / FM radio, and rotary knobs. The iH10 rocks the same overall design, but sports the more typical, trendy white or black finish. The ultra-compact iH4 provides an iHome for folks on the go, offering an alarm clock / docking iPod solution in a tiny enclosure that also features an aux input, adjustable LCD accent lights, and a white or black paintjob. Next up is the colorized versions of the now-famous iH5, and while the iH5 colortunes will come in white with blue, green, or pink grills, the iH3 adds silver to the mix and will be sold exclusively in Target. The iHM1 also gets a colortunes makeover to match those 2G nanos, and comes in blue, green, and pink as well. Lastly, the iH19 sport case rocks a water-resistant design, stereo speakers, and external control pad, and should be available in your choice of blue, green, pink, or silver. No pricing or release information was readily available, but we're pretty sure these colorized units will make it out just in time for Spring.
