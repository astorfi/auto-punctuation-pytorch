The crazy cat's apparently first-ever netbook is (as you can see in the photo) quite a looker, and it's packing a 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270 CPU with 1GB DDR2 SDRAM, a 945 GSE Express chipset and a 120GB hard drive. The 10.1-inch netbook's also got two USB ports, a 1.3 megapixel webcam and WiFi. It's going to cost you 890 smackers to make this yours, but the sassiness alone kind of makes it worth it, doesn't it?[Via CNET]
