       No details on what's new just yet, but iPhone OS 3.0 beta 3 has just hit Apple's servers for registered, card-carrying members of the Dev Center -- a nice release cadence since the new platform was first announced. More as we flesh it out!

Update: Alright, well, we've played with it -- as many of you have -- and the update seems cosmetically identical to beta 2. We'd argue that things generally feel smoother and snappier, but the difference is almost imperceptible; go ahead and upgrade if you're chilling on beta 2, but don't expect sunshine and moonbeams with this release.
