 Google has been testing an expanded search that includes Gmail results ever since August, and it's been enough of a hit that the company is swinging for the fences with an expanded test. The new version lets Gmail members find Calendar appointments and Drive files through the autocomplete results in the search box. Visit the main Google page and the results won't be quite as broad, but they'll include both the previous trial's Gmail information as well as Drive -- thankfully, tucked to the side rather than dominating the main page. Any individual, English-literate Google fans can join the new trial to get early access and find that long lost spreadsheet in the cloud.
