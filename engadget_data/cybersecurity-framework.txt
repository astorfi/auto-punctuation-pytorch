The US government clearly knows a thing or two about internet security when it  deals with (and  dishes out) cyber attacks on a regular basis, and it's now ready to share that wisdom with others. The White House has just announced the Cybersecurity Framework, a set of voluntary guidelines that organizations can use to fend off digital assaults on critical infrastructure, like power plants. The NIST-developed Framework tells newcomers where to begin, even if they're outside the US, and it can help experienced outfits educate their partners. American organizations that want further help can also sign up for a program that gets them in touch with federal agencies. The guidelines don't represent surefire protection, but they could reduce the chances that hackers will find gaping holes in the US' virtual defenses.
