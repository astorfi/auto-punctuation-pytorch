Obviously you have to have a Bluetooth-enabled PC to get rolling with this, but there's a new (or at least sort of
new) software app called SkypeHeadset that promises to make it easy to use any old Bluetooth wireless headset (like the
kind you might already have paired up with your cellie) to make
Skype calls from your PC. Nothing
earth shattering, but they do promise that you'll be able to use the buttons on your headset to dial, answer, or hang
up calls.
