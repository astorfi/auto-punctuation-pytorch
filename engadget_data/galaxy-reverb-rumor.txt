 If the now-deleted @evleaks is / was to be believed, Samsung is preparing a low-price handset for Sprint's big yellow network. The pulled feed revealed that the Galaxy Reverb (SPH-M950) will pack a Snapdragon MSM8655, a 4-inch 800 x 480 WVGA display, 768MB RAM, 4GB on-board storage and Ice Cream Sandwich. Photography enthusiasts should know that there's a 5-megapixel rear camera and a 1.3-megapixel front-facer for those self-portrait moments. There's no word on if it packs LTE, but given the limited quantity of Sprint markets that can currently use the standard, we wouldn't get our hopes up just yet.
