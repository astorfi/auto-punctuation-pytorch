It's teamed up with Slooh Space Camera to make the rare 100-minute long eclipse viewable online through a variety of means, including a live stream on YouTube, in the Sky layer on Google Earth, and in Slooh's Android app and Google App Engine-based website (which comes complete with narration from actual astronomers). It all gets started at 11:20AM PDT or 2:20PM EDT -- hit the source link below to choose your viewing preference.

Update: It's happening, people. Live stream is after the break.
