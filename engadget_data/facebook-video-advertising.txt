Now that Facebook has video ads, how is it going to make sure you hang around to watch more of them? According to a report on The Information, the social network is in talks with publishers like Vice, The Onion and Vox Media to make short-term videos it can host. The point to doing that instead of just letting them operate independently, is apparently to push them all as part of a service called "Anthology" for advertisers. That way it can charge advertisers higher prices with "TV-type scale" promised at millions of views. Whether or not that it takes off, this, along with rumors Facebook wants publishers posting content directly to its site suggests its vision of the future involves keeping users tied to Facebook.com -- at least until they leave VR space.
