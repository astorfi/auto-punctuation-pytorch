       If you want you and your loved ones looking like the family pictured alongside this text, sitting in front of the TV gazing at 3D dolphins emanating from a PlayStation 3 through your television console, your best bet is to envision Ecco, not Flipper.* According to TechRadar, Sony has clarified that the summer firmware update to enable 3D applies to games only, and that 3D Blu-ray movie support will come with a second update due out later this year. We haven't been able to confirm the announcement ourselves, but suddenly, that freebie copy of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 3D isn't looking so tantalizing.

 * Hypothetically speaking, of course. We have no confirmation on a 3D version of Sega's Ecco the Dolphin or Season 3 of Flipper, featuring "The Most Expensive Sardine in the World."
