 
Sprint's latest option for saving the environment will run you exactly $49.99 on contract after rebate, and it'll be available in just a couple days' time. It might not be the hot news on the carrier right this second, granted, but we imagine a few folks will fall for the Samsung Restore's sliding landscape QWERTY keyboard, Energy Star 2.0-compliant charger, 2 megapixel camera, and microSD expansion all the way up to 32GB (assuming you can find a 32GB card, that is). Sunday, June 6 is your target date in your choice of "midnight" or "limeade," but you can start preparing now by recycling stuff and buying a hybrid car.
