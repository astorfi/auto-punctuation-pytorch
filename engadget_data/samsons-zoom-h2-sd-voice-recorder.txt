The latest to show up is Samson's Zoom H2 handy recorder, which claims to be the "world's only portable recorder with 3 mic capsules on board for mid-side recording," and moreover, the device purportedly decodes the audio instantly to bring together a probably unnecessary level of "superb stereo imaging." Interestingly enough, the device even allows for users to record at various angles and frequencies in case you're trying to assemble a 5.1 track (saywha?) without all the proper equipment, and it even touts gain controls right on the side for on-the-fly tweaking. The unit stores recordings on an SD flash card, features USB 2.0 connectivity, a 1/8-inch stereo output, backlit display, four hours of usage on a pair of AA batteries, time stamp / track marker functions, integrated chromatic guitar and bass tuner, and a variety of status LEDs to boot. Of course, such extravagant niceties on a portable audio recorder don't come without a premium, but users serious about capturing those lecture notes (or ad hoc jingles) can snag one in May for around $200.
