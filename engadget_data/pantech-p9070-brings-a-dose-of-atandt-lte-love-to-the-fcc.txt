Now, a handset that has the same frequencies as the aforementioned tablet (including Band 5, which uses 850MHz) just made it through the Federal approval process. Known only as the P9070, little is known about this device other than the fancy blueprint above and diagram-o'-measurements below. It already received WiFi certification in August, so it seems to have been in testing for a while. Could this be Pantech's big hit for CES 2012?
