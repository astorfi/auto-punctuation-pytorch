A large part of its success has undeniably been down to the enthusiasm shown by developers, who have recently crossed the notable marker of producing 100,000 applications compatible with the device. As is true of the vast app selection on the iPhone, quantity doesn't guarantee quality, but the abundance of software available for the iPad at least offers a better chance of finding some wheat in amongst the chaff. And as to its competitors, here's hoping Ice Cream Sandwich and Windows 8 get here before this Apple juggernaut crosses the million mark, eh?
