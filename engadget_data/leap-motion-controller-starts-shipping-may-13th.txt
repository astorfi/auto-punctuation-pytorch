If you were still thinking that the Leap Motion Controller was going to turn into vaporware, it looks like you were wrong. Just less than a year after the company first made waves with its tiny gesture recognizing box, a finished product is getting ready to ship. Those that pre-ordered should receive their shipping notices starting May 13th. If you weren't willing to commit to the device before hand, you'll still be able to snatch one up at Best Buy on May 19th for $80. Or, if you're so inclined, you can continue to use your mouse to play Cut the Rope on your desktop... your choice we suppose.
