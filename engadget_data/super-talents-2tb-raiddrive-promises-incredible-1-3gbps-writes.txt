The latest announcement comes by way of Super Talent Technology with its new 2TB RAIDDrive. The card slips into a PCIe x8 slot and ships in Enterprise (battery backed), Workstation, and Gamer (!) configurations with MLC (cheap, fast) or SLC (expensive, faster) NAND and optional RAID 5 capability. Super Talent claims that its RAIDDrives "are capable of delivering sequential Read speeds of up to 1.2GB/s, sequential Write speeds of up to 1.3GB/s." Unfortunately, no ship date or price was announced, only that we'll get more "performance details" in June. Presumably that means something useful like random IOPS benchmarks.[Via Impress]
