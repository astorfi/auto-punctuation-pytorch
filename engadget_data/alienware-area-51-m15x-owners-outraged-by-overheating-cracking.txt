If you'll recall, this isn't the first time the laptop aficionados over at Notebook Review got all worked up over an issue with the m15x, but it seems the latest round of quirks have pushed the community over the edge. So, have any of you out there awoke to see your machine slightly more damaged than it was the night before? Are things getting way too heated for anyone's comfort? Let us know what's up in comments below.Update: Alienware pinged us to say that the linked response below is in fact authentic, and that the company is "aware of the issue and working hard to figure out what's going on."
