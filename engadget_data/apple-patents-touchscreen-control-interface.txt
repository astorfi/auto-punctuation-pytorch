Until that glorious day, however, we'll have to continue using our collective detectiveskills to feed our Apple obsession, as one of our readers did in finding a newly-released patent filing for atouchscreen control-interface. The pictures that Apple submitted look like your basic on-screen keyboard and theapplication is in the typical indecipherable legalese, so we're not sure what's so innovative here, but perhaps this istech that will be incorporated into the iTablet and video iPod- should these mythical creatures actually exist.[Thanks, Armin]
