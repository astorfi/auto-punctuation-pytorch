From the spec sheet adjacent to the display phone, we can pretty clearly make out Windows Mobile 6 Professional (as opposed to Standard -- score), WiFi, HSDPA, a 2 megapixel camera, GPS, and an "optical mouse" (whatever that means), which explains the presence of a pointer on the screen. HTC pulled this off with the trackball-equipped Artemis; we toyed with it briefly and it seemed usable, so we'll be curious to see what approach Samsung takes. We've heard talk of a BlackJack 2 coming to AT&T later this year; we don't know whether this (or a model based on this) is it, but it certainly looks the part, doesn't it?[Via the::unwired, thanks Daniel F.]
