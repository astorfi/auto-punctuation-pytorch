 Today, Microsoft's Major Nelson announced the release of the Sports Picks app for Xbox Live. Equipped with leaderboards, Jimmy the Greek wannabes can compete against friends to see who's the best at handicapping UFC events, NBA games and college football. In addition, Xbox Live Gold members have also gained SmartGlass integration for ESPN and NBA Game Time -- which we've previewed here -- that allows users to watch live broadcasts, highlights and replays via their smartphone or tablet. If you're looking to get your Ace Rothstein on (minus the mafia, murder and mayhem), point your Xbox to the Apps Marketplace to score this new software.
