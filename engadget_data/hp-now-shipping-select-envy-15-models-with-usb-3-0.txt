 Welcome to the most recent benchmark we've been referring to as "the future." HP has become what appears to be the first company to actually ship a laptop featuring USB 3.0. According to a rep speaking with CNET, if you order an Envy 15 with a Core i7 processor and an ATI 5830 GPU, the new ports come along for the ride. Feeling patient? Not to worry, we're pretty sure this crazy USB 3.0 thing isn't an isolated incident -- expect more machines to support it soon enough, including HP's own EliteBook in just a few weeks' time.
