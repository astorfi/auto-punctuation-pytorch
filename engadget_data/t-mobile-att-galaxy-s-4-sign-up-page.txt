 Did Samsung's bizarre GS4 unveiling leave you wanting a little more? Well, as it's often the case, carriers are already preparing for the handset's eventual launch, and two US players have now officially opened the virtual doors to those potential buyers. Both T-Mobile and AT&T's sign-up pages for the Galaxy S 4 are now live, giving the interested folk a way to be kept in the loop as soon as the South Korean firm's flagship becomes available in each network. Unfortunately, although not surprisingly, pricing and precise availability details are still scarce at the moment -- but hey, at least we have some idea as to when we can expect it to hit shelves not just in the US of A but all over the world.
