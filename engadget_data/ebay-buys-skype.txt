Yup, it's happened: eBay just bought
Skype. The price? An astoundingly
ridiculous $1.3 billion in cash and 32.4 million shares of eBay stock for a company which expects to make only $60
million dollars this year. But, hey, it's eBay's money to spend as it pleases, and in the press release they describe
their plans to begin integrating Skype into eBay auctions in order to "streamline and improve communications between
buyers and sellers" as well as their intent to combine Skype with PayPal to "pursue entirely new lines of business"
that would monetize "ecommerce communications" on a "pay-per-call basis." Rockin', we guess.
