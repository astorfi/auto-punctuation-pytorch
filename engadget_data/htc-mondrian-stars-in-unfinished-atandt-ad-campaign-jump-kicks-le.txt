It's true -- though from this angle, it's a dead ringer for the Mozart, which looks just like the Shubert, too. The above picture comes from what appear to be a pair of mostly complete ads for AT&T's Windows Phone 7 push, which if real make the Mondrian look like it might be a flagship device. Perhaps those rumors of a 1.3GHz Snapdragon inside weren't too far off. You won't find real phones demonstrated in the videos after the break, but don't let that stop you from clicking through -- you do like watching oblivious folks flying through the air, don't you?
