Sure, not everyone will be as excited about this as others but for those looking for an extensive list of hardware and titles, this is the place to go. Just like every other promotional site in the vast space we call the Internet, there is a newsletter, trailers and clips, latest news and of course, a tech support site - really just a link to the manufacturers support sites. HD DVD peeps need not apply but for those that bleed Blu, this is for you.
