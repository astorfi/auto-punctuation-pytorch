That includes 30,000 units sold in Korea since its November 14th launch there, but Samsung doesn't seem to be dishing out specific numbers for the rest of the world just yet. Of course, as impressive as that is, it may well be all downhill from here once word of Russian president Dmitry Medvedev's frown gets around.
