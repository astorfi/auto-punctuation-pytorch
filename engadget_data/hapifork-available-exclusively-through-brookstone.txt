Designed by French entrepreneur and inventor Jacques LÃ©pine, HAPIfork was created out of research showing by eating slower, people can improve the way they feel, improve digestion and lose weight.

A series of scientific studies have highlighted the negative effects related to eating meals too quickly, including:

Weight gain - feeling full is felt after about 20 minutes. So, the faster you eat, the more you end up eating. Various studies have found that eating slowly may help overweight people;Digestive problems - food that is eaten too quickly is often poorly chewed, making your digestive tract work that much harder, which could increase the danger of acid reflux and bloating;Postoperative complications - eating slowly reduces the stress on weakened tissues in your body.
