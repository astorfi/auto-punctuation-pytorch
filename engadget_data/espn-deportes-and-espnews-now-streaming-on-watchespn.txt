If you've ever wished that WatchESPN would offer more Spanish-language sports and non-stop news, today's your lucky day. The streaming service now includes access to ESPN Deportes and ESPNews, both of which are available to TV subscribers through Apple TV boxes, mobile apps and the web. Xbox Live viewers will get the channels soon, the broadcaster says. Only some will appreciate the new WatchESPN content, but it's hard to disagree with getting some extra f√∫tbol coverage at no extra charge.
