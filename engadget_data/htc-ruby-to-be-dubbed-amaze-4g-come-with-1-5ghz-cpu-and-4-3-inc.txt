This time the smartphone's popped up in reports highlighting a couple important revelations: according to BGR,  the Ruby's slated to become the carrier's flagship and will be looked upon as the Sensation 4G's big brother. We're not so sure about it being a literal statement, since the Ruby is speculated to have the same 4.3-inch display as its sibling, but it'll definitely be more power-packed with a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU and HSPA+ radio with connection speeds reaching up to 42Mbps. But that's not all, folks: PocketNow, contributing some gossip of its own, is reporting that the phone will be called the Amaze 4G by T-Mobile, and will also have an 8 megapixel camera with dedicated still and video capture buttons. Now that leaks and reports are starting to pour in this quickly, it may not be too long before the Ruby Amaze 4G completely outrumors the Droid Bionic -- which is not an easy task by any means.
