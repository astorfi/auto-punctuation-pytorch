Well, he came by with the Grippity, and we got some finger-time with it. The keyboard's certainly not an immediately comfortable or intuitive typing experience by any means, but it's got a real charm to it. The designer also kindly did a demo for us, and even he -- the creator of the device -- wasn't exactly what we'd call lightning fast on it, but see for yourself in the video (and gallery!) after the break.P.S.- Yes, that's the inside of the Engadget double-wide trailer in the video -- we promise we'll have some more pictures as soon as all the real CES news dies down!
