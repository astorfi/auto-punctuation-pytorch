HTC America ended its Friday evening on the somber revelation that 20 percent of its workforce would be terminated. In all, roughly 30 employees and contractors were let go from the 150-member division, which stands as the latest sign of the company's financial struggles. A representative acknowledged the layoffs in a prepared statement, calling it "... a decisive action by HTC Corp (US) to streamline and optimize our organization and improve efficiencies after several years of aggressive growth." The news was first announced by The Verge, which obtained a letter from recently appointed division president Jason Mackenzie, who promised to "treat the impacted employees with the respect they deserved and provide them with resources to help bridge them to their next opportunity." We're still looking forward to bigger things ahead from HTC, but in the meantime, you'll find the company's full statement after the break.



Today's reduction in force is a decisive action by HTC Corp (US) to streamline and optimize our organization and improve efficiencies after several years of aggressive growth. Realigning its human resources against key strategic initiatives will help HTC more effectively advance into a new stage of growth and innovation. This is a hard decision that has direct impact on people who have contributed to the growth HTC has experienced the past several years. However, to achieve our long-term goals as a business and return maximum value to our shareholders, this is a necessary step to drive ongoing innovation, ensure our ability to create strong products like the HTC One, and forge strong customer relationships that solidify our future. HTC is proud of its employees and has a track record of hiring the best and brightest; we continue to hire in strategic areas and encourage impacted employees to apply for open positions that are a fit for their skills.
