Although you may not need portable lighting in your Travelodge hotel / tent hybrid, a little backlighting never hurts while staking your place in line for those oh-so-important launch events. Sporting a flashlight beam, lantern mode, FM radio, retractable antenna, and 3.5mm headphone jack, this multi-function device can be powered from any open USB port -- if your laptop is running out of juice, three AAA batteries will also do the trick. While you probably shouldn't expect an awful lot of candle power here, it'll provide a fairly good excuse to bust out your machine in hopes of finding a stray WiFi (or WiMAX) signal, and besides, brightening up your next campout will only set you back $12.[Via Uber-Review]
