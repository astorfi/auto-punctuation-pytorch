 By now, you're fully aware just how deceased Palm OS is, but Sling Media is still lookin' out for those loyal Treo owners out there looking to get their mobile TV viewing on. It wasn't too awfully long ago that we found that the SlingPlayer Mobile application would indeed be making a showing on Palm's handsets, and early last month we got a sneak peek that only made the anticipation that much more intense, but now we can all rest easy, sign up for the Palm OS Beta Program, and hope to get our go. So if you've made it this far without dashing to sign your own self up, well, we'll forgive you, but do your duty and hit the read link on the double if you want to secure your slot.[Via jkOnTheRun]
