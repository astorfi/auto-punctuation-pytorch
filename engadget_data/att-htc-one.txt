 HTC decided to reveal the oft-rumored One X+ earlier this morning, and it didn't take long for AT&T to announce its intent to carry the device in the "coming months." Fans acquainted with the original AT&T One X won't find much different on the outside -- we're still looking at a 4.7-inch Super LCD2 720p display, 8MP BSI f/2.0 rear camera with ImageSense and gorgeous polycarbonate build. Indeed, it's what's inside the LTE-capable phone that counts: a 1.7GHz quad-core Tegra 3 chipset, an impressive 64GB internal memory (nice, given the device still lacks microSD support), Jelly Bean with Sense 4+ and a nicely improved 2,100mAh battery.

 That's not all, folks: AT&T's also introducing another HTC handset for its mid-range lineup known as the One VX (pictured above on the right). The device, which utilizes a 4.5-inch qHD Super LCD2 display, is packing Android 4.0 (upgradeable to Jelly Bean after launch), a 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 MSM 8930 with 1GB RAM, LTE, a 5MP BSI f/2.0 ImageSense camera capable of shooting 1080p video, a VGA front-facing cam, NFC, Bluetooth 4.0, FM radio and 8GB internal storage. How about dimensions? It measures in at 9.19mm (0.36 inch) thick and weighs 4.4 ounces (124.7g), so it's slightly thicker and lighter than the One X+. We're quite curious to hear details on pricing and availability, but we haven't heard anything aside from the coming months (we'd like to believe, however, that AT&T wouldn't wait until after the holidays to push this out). Hopefully we'll get to play with the new device soon, but feel free to check out our galleries of picture-perfect press images below.
