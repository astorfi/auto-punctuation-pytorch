The Huawei Ascend P6 hasn't been officially announced yet, but that's never stopped the Chinese company from leaking information like a faucet. It's unsurprising, then, that we'd notice the upcoming 6.18mm-thin device sneaking through the FCC database before the inevitable June 18th launch. Naturally, the docs are thin on details, but this particular version has a microSD slot and uses pentaband HSPA+ and quadband GSM / EDGE radios, so you'll have no problem using this aluminum-clad beaut in most parts of the world -- including the US on AT&T and T-Mobile. No LTE to report, sadly, but we'll just have to wait and see if any variants make its way through the federal agency as well.
