That model, the STR-DN1010, is naturally a 7.1 A/V receiver, and boasts 110 watts of power per channel, along with four HDMI ports (including one with Audio Return Channel plus three component), support for Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, upscaling of any video source to 1080p, support for Sony's S-AIR wireless system, and a Digital Media Port to accommodate iPod docks and other accessories, among other standard fare. Look for this one to land in June for $500, along with three other new non-3D models (the STR-DH810, STR-DH710 and STR-DH510) that will run you $400, $300 and $230.
