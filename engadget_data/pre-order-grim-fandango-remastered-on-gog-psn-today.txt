On January 27, we all get to have another morbid laugh when Grim Fandango Remastered debuts on PS4, Vita and PC, Mac and Linux.

Today, you can pre-order Grim Fandango Remastered on PC at GOG.com for $14.99 and gain a bonus desktop wallpaper. PlayStation pre-orders are also now available and include a bonus dynamic PS4/Vita theme.

Grim Fandango Remastered pretties up the classic LucasArts adventure game with HD graphics, features developer commentary and a re-recorded score.
