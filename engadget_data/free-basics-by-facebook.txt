A few months ago, Facebook opened up the Internet.org platform to developers after being accused of violating net neutrality rules, mostly by users in India. Now, Zuckerberg's project has added 60 new services created by third-party developers, including BabyCenter for pregnancy and parenting info and SmartBusiness for novice entrepreneurs. Since it has undergone quite an overhaul, it has also been renamed to "Free Basics by Facebook" to distinguish it from the larger Internet.org initiative. The revamped website comes with a menu where its users in Asia, Africa and Latin America can choose which services to activate and access. In addition, the new mobile website -- now FreeBasics.com instead of Internet.org -- supports HTTPS just like the Android app does. Note that the platform is still open to developers, and those interested in helping out can get all the details from the Internet.org platform page on Facebook.
