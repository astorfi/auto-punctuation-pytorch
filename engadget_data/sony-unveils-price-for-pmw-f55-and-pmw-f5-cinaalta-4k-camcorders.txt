 Looking for a hearty new camera rig to spice up your next indie film? Start saving: Sony finally went live with pricing for its PMW-F5 and PMW-F55 CineAlta PL-mount cameras. Following an LA screening of professionally shot 4K and HD footage, Sony mentioned that the high-end camcorders can be had for $34,900 and $19,400, respectively. The steeper priced PMW-F55 has a sharper edge, of course, and can natively shoot 4K, 2K or HD footage through a global shutter. The (comparatively) less expensive F5 can handle 4K video too, but needs the help of the AXS-R5 RAW recorder (a $6,300 add-on) to pull it off -- it also has a narrower color gamut and a rolling shutter. Roll on past the break for a full list of prices and accessories.
