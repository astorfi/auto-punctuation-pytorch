        I
know, I know. "Who wants to watch commercials?" you're asking.
We're with you on that, but they're a fact of TV life. However, if you
paid big bucks for that
glorious looking HDTV and you're watching HD content, why do the
commercials have to be in standard definition? If we have to watch the
commercials, at least let us see them in HD. The Wall Street Journal
looked into this question and the answer is simple: cost. HD video and
Dolby Digital audio can add tens of thousands of dollars to production
costs. During one hour of the weekly NASCAR race in HD, there
were 21 commercials. Out of that total, none
of them were shown in HD. I'm more apt to be a couch potato during the
commercials if they were in high definition. How about you? Do you
think HD commercials equate to more sales value?Read (Note: WSJ subscription required)
