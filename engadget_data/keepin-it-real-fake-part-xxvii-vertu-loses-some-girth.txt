  If you're loving the Vertu Signature 2006 but the gargantuan 122 x 42 x 15.5mm dimensions have left a bad taste in your mouth -- not to mention the absurd price tag -- boy oh boy, do we have just the phone for you. The "Mars Bar size" miniature Signature knockoff, apparently made by CISC, comes it at a smallish 89 x 38 x 22mm. The chubby little bugger strikes a strong resemblance to its costlier role model if you squint, but that's where the resemblance ends: you lose a GSM band, leaving you with just 900 and 1800, the camera is a laughable "30k pixels," and we're guessing that our lookalike friend here doesn't sport the Vertu's jeweled key action. On the upside, internal flash is allegedly good for a hefty 128MB, and you can buy a small army of these for the cost of the genuine article.[Thanks, Nick]
