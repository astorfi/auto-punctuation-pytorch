The press release confirms all of what we already knew, along with bringing word that the cameras will support SD/SDHC cards in addition to Sony's still-kicking Memory Stick format. The best news is in pricing, however: the shooters will retail in two different kit types, with the L-series cams ringing in at $550, $650 and $850, respectively, when paired with the SAL-1855 standard zoom lens. The Y kit series adds a second lens, the telephoto SAL-55200, along with bumping the kit price $200 across the board. Pre-orders will start on May 18th, with the cameras becoming available in July. Oddly, while parts of the press site are live, the press shots are still on lockdown, beyond a nice stack of thumbnails -- we'll keep you posted.[Via Photo Rumors]
