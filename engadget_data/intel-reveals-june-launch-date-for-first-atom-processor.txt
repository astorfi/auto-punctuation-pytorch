 We've already heard about some of Intel's future Atom plans, and heard just how little it'll apparently cost the company to produce 'em, but now thanks to a PDF kindly let loose by the chipmaker, we finally have some official word as to when we can actually expect to see 'em. As UMPC Portal reports, the PDF released in conjunction with the currently-happening Intel Developer Forums indicates that the processor will get a worldwide launch this June, which is a tad later than some had expected. In related news, the PDF also mentions two Celeron processors intended for use with the same Diamondville platform that Atom uses, including the Celeron 220 and Celeron 440 (both Intel Core processors), though we somehow suspect those won't generate quite the level of interest as the bargain basement Atom.[Thanks, Steve]
