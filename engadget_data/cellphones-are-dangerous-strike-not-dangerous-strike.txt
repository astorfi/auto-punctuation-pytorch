The World Health Organization is denying reports in the media that it has made changes to its public health policy
surrounding the use of cellphones. They made a statement directly contradicting the reports, saying that they stand
firmly by their previous recommendations, which state that there is "no proof… of adverse health effects" due to the
electromagnetic fields associated with mobile devices (at least, as long as you don't
look at them). Which, you know, doesn't mean there aren't
any adverse health effects — only that there's no proof — so we're sure this novel isn't actually about to wrap anytime
soon.
