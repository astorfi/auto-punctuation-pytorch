About a week and a half ago we told you about Smash My
iPod, the project where a some kids collected four Benjamins, walked straight into an Apple store with a rolling
camera, and filmed it as they took their little white bundle of joy of of its packaging and promptly did a rather loud
dance upon it to the chagrin of the present Mac faithful. Well, now you can watch the video of the ordeal; especially
humorous was their belabored discussed of battery life and Apple Care extended warranty program packages with the Apple
Store employee during checkout (pictured). Apparently their next project will be something along the lines of Smash My
Network Walkman. Sounds good to us!
