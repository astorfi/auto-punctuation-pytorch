This time he's touching on, erm, the iPod touch, making an offhand (though firmly declarative) comment on a post about the Dell Streak: "if you wait a few weeks to buy the Touch, you'll get one with a Retina Display and dual cameras." The man's not one to fool around with such matters, so we tend to believe him here. It also helps that nothing he's saying would be really surprising -- a new iPod in September? With features trickled down from the most recent iPhone? Then again, that camera has proved elusive before.
