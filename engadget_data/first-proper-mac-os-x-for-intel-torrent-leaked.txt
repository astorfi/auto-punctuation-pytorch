Not sure what became of the torrent leaked a couple of weeks ago that had folks speculating that Apple was
intentionally seeding copies of OS X for Intel into the wild (though signs were pointing to fake), but there's now
supposedly a legitimate build that's been leaked, as "borrowed" from a test developer box at
WWDC '05. Folks are reporting that they've gotten it to
work by modifying the incorrect instructions from the leaker â€” if you wanna live on the bleeding edge, there's an
install guide
available.
