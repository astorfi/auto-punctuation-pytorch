The DIY-like software allows virtually anyone to sell and price their music on Mountain View's storefront. Musicians selling tunes through the service will keep 70 percent of their set list price, forfeiting the other 30 to the Android giant. Those taking the plunge will be privy to the same 90 second song previews as their label-backed brethren, as-well as the ability to have them shared for one free play on Google+. Ready to begin? Your ascent to superstardom awaits you beyond that source link.
