At last you'll be able to carry a DSLR in your pocket, with only some minor trade-offs in things like image quality, features, and usefulness. You can swap in your choice of three different magnetically-attached lenses, though -- and while you won't exactly get great pictures or video from the thing, you can at least store a lot of them thanks to the camera's microSD card slot. Look for the camera itself to set you back Â¥9,800 (or about $118), with extra lenses running between $30 and $60 (bundles are also available).
