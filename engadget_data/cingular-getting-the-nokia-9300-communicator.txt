Never thought that the Nokia 9300
Communicator would ever see the light of day here in the States — it was exactly one year ago today the phone was
announced in Europe — but apparently Cingular recently sent out an email to developers confirming that the 9300 would
be released over here. Probably too little, too late, since in the past 365 days there have been tons of introduced (or
announced) that make the brick-like 9300 seem a bit antiquated, but whatevs, we'll deal.
