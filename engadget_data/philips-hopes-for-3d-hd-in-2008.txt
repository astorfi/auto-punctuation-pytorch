       We'd be happy for more 2D high-def, but 3D is on the radarfor Philips according to top brass, Rudy Provoost. While Philips overhauls their product line they've decided to givethe whole 3D thing a try. We can't fault 'em for that, since it's been tried before, right? No need for thecontent to be in 3D from Hollywood since Provoost is thinking a 2D high-def disc might be upconverted. Uh, Rudy, we'renot even through the current high-def DVD format war, so let's not make things worse with upconversion, 'k? Philips isgeekin' out the 3D in their labs, so there's nothing to see here just yet, but you have to wonder if they'll push forsome silly 3D spec in the Blu-Ray format they back. Where's the sense and simplicity in that?
