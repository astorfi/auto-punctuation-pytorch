It seems plenty of you were enraptured by that hypnotic white Lumia 800 we paid a visit to yesterday, but in all the glossy fun, Nokia accidentally revealed the above press shot -- a white Lumia 900. The picture was soon lifted from Nokia's Conversations blog, but it remains on its Facebook page, flashing an exposed micro-USB port and front-facing camera that identifies this snow-white slab as the Lumia 900 kind. The press shot also flashes a view of that non-curved glass front; it certainly looks like our wishes are coming true. Now we just have to wait and see if this color option is ready for that plausible March release date.  Update: Dave Zatz was apparently offered a choice of white or black models when discussing his Lumia 900 pre-order options at a Microsoft store. Maybe we'll see this one from launch.  [Thanks to everyone who sent this in.]
