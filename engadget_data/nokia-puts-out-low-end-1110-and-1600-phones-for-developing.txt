Nokia's rolling out a pair of low-end handsets aimed squarely at the African growth market: the 1110 (pictured,
right), which has an inverted monochrome screen (white text on a black background) and the 1600 with color screen. Both
are basic, no-frills phones designed for low-cost delivery to developing markets, with the 1110 clocking in at about
$80US and the 1600 coming in at $104.
