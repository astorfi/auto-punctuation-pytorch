Taking lessons Microsoft learned from the update debacle that was NoDo, the company's eager to do a much more efficient (and quick) job of rolling out its latest revamp. While Redmond didn't offer any exact details on which phones would be the lucky recipients right away, it'll be keeping the masses posted through its "where's my phone update" page. If your handset is listed, hook it up to your computer, load the Zune client and there should be a lovely message waiting for you. As always, don't feel too discouraged if your device isn't available right away, since these rollouts have a habit of taking a bit of time to get to everyone.

In addition to the rollout, the Web Marketplace will also make its debut, giving Windows Phone users the opportunity to do what Android users already enjoy -- the ability to surf for apps online and have them downloaded directly on the phone with no sideloading required. There's one bit of sad news to relay to anyone that already has a Windows Phone, however: Microsoft confirmed to us that Internet Sharing -- the long-awaited mobile hotspot functionality -- will not be available for existing devices. There's no word on if this will be offered through a future update or if it's a permanent deal, but at least it's only a single thorn in an entire rose garden of good news.
