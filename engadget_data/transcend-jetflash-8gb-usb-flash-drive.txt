USB flash drives are hardly news unless
someone can push the specs. Funny to think that even
though it's been about a year since we first started
hearing about flash drives in this capacity,
Transcend's new JetFlash can still turn heads with 8GB of
storage (and decent 21MB/s reads and impressive 11MB/s writes). No pricing yet but expect to drop a grand for the big
GBs.

Update: Ding! Hot that this thing can be
had for under $650 direct from
Transcend. Thanks, nefarious.
