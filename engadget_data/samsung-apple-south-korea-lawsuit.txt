The latest development in Apple and Samsung's patent battle is a new court ruling in the latter's home country, and it's going against Samsung. The Washington Post and Reuters report that in a case covering three Samsung patents, and Apple products including the iPhone 4s, iPhone 5 and iPad 2 Judge Shim Woo-yong ruled against a sales ban and threw out Samsung's request for damages. The Post reports the patents cover things like multitasking, message notifications and how a device can display multiple messages from the same sender. This follows a ruling from late last year in the same court, where Apple was found in violation and ordered to pay Samsung $35,000 in damages, while Samsung was ordered to pay about $24,000 for its own patent overstepping. Samsung is of course considering an appeal of this latest ruling, ensuring that these two deep-pocketed tech giants will keep tying up courts around the world for the foreseeable future.
