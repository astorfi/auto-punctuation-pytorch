The car-friendly software company got its hooks into AT&T's Watson Speech API and used it to power a new voice-command system for it's own take on the "virtual assistant." Using the new speech recognition tool and Ma Bell's LTE network QNX was able to pull up websites, find a Starbucks (though, in New York City you'd have to be blind to not find one) and place calls. All in all, the demo wasn't too different from what we saw in Vegas in January -- in fact, we wouldn't be surprised to find out that Porsche was also utilizing Watson, long before it was announced. For a familiar, but still interesting demo, check out the video after the break.
