 Vizio not only recently announced a 1080p 47-inch LCD, but actually beat the predicted release of February by a month, giving retailers plenty of time to stock up on the sets before the Super Bowl. Even better, the GV47LF launches at the same suggested retail price of $1899 as the 720p set it replaces. Manufacturers are increasingly announcing and shipping 1080p-capable sets as the two next-gen DVD formats start to become more widespread from PlayStation3 and second-generation HD DVD sales. As for the GV47LF, it will offer 500 cd/m2 brightness, 800:1 contrast, and an 8ms response rate, along with two HDMI jacks, two component connectors, and removable speakers.
