Incorporated into a model called the iPod Sport, perhaps, this technology would use an accelerometer to gauge the pace of a person's workout, and encourage them to "take it to the max" by either increasing the tempo of a particular song (though hopefully not to the point where all your tunes sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks) or automatically changing to a faster-paced track. This is all well and good, but how about throwing in some Bluetooth while you're at it, cause the wire dangling from that runner's head in the illustration has got to go.[Via Unwired View]
