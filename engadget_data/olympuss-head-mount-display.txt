We're starting to wonder what bizarre government tax initiatives are tempting all these companies into dropping
boatloads of cash into wearable display
technology development that clearly no one's all that excited about, but Olympus is the latest on the bandwagon with
their HMD (Head Mount Display). Sure, it may just be another glasses-based heads up display system intended to give the
wearer essential details like email notification or train schedules and the like, but it's got the added bonus of
having a cable run down the back of your head and neck. Call us in a few years when it's all properly miniaturized and
wireless, ok guys?
