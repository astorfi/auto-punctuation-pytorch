Taking trips to Europe can be risky, but our Best Buy is old enough and responsible and can take care of itself, so we're okay with it taking a trip to the UK next year... even though we don't know exactly where it'll be landing. It's been talking about going for so long it'd be a shame to say no now. Yes, it'll be packing its blue shirts and yellow name tags so everyone will know what it is, and once it gets there sometime next year we're sure it'll call and tell us which franchise location will be first. So until then just try not to worry -- and maybe sign it up for some self defense classes or something.

[Thanks, Adam]
