 A month ago to the day we were weeping our poor hearts out as we heard that VIA and NVIDIA had canned whatever netbook plans the two had going on. Now, however, we're being given a glimpse of hope that all may not be lost... at least in relation to NVIDIA. During a webcast from the Credit Suisse annual technology conference being held in Scottsdale, Arizona, NVIDIA's CFO confessed: "We're not saying we're not interested [in the netbook space]; it's a matter of how the market will evolve." In other words, it's taking a wait-and-see approach before plunging in headfirst. Honestly, we're not too shocked to hear that it may still one day invade the swath of 7- to 12-inch mini-laptops out there -- after all, it already branched out significantly with Tegra and Tesla. C'mon NVIDIA, we've got legions of folks waiting to fire up Crysis on their next Eee, and you could be the one to make it happen.
