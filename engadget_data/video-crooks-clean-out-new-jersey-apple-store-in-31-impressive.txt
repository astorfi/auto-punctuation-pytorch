After studying said crooks in Utah, a trained team of larcenists headed over to Apple's Sagemore location in Marlton, New Jersey in order to one-up the duo by snagging even more goods in under a minute. As the surveillance shows, a single blunt object decimated the iconic glass doorway and enabled five hyped-up thieves to enter, snag 23 MacBook Pros, 14 iPhones and 9 iPod touches, and head for the hills -- all in just 31 seconds. Look, we aren't trying to glamorize crime or anything, but this is the stuff GTA heists are made of. Head on past the break for a look at the video, and please, don't try to replicate this at your nearest Apple store (without wearing a head-mounted camcorder and hooking us up with the footage, of course).[Via TUAW, thanks Mike]
