The screen has been shrunk down to 12.1-inches, and both SSD (64GB) and traditional hard drive options (up to 320GB) are on offer. The X200 runs up to a 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo processor, and up to 4GB of RAM, and will include wireless options galore, including UWB, WiMax and GPS. Oh, and that super-sexy asking price? $1,199. We like. It'll be out in August.
