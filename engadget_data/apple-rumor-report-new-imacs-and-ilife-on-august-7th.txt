The current hot gossip comes from ThinkSecret, wherein the oft cited "reliable sources" recount Apple's exact date (August 7th) for announcing the brand-spanking-new iMac, replete with updated specs and the sexy brushed aluminum casing we keep "hearing" about. The article also suggests that a new version of iLife will be emerging at the same time, but reports are less clear on a solid release date. Of course, both of these rumors carry no backup from the boys in Cupertino, so as of right now all we can do is play wait-and-see.
