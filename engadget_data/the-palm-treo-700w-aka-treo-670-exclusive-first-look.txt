We haven't spent enough time with the 700w for a proper review - we've literally had it in our hands for only a few hours - but we couldn't resist posting up this first look:



Horizontal screen orientation.   Treo 700w vs. Treo 650. The 700w is actually a bit narrower than the 650.   "Welcome to the Palm 700w smartphone"   Plug-and-play. Getting online with an SD WiFi card could not have been any easier.   With the battery removed.   A few confirmed specs: Windows Mobile 5.0, one megapixel camera, EV-DO, Bluetooth, 64MB of memory, still trying to conclusively determine the resolution of the display, but it looks to our eyes like it's 240 x 240 pixels, not 320 x 320. But we're not 100% on that, ok?
