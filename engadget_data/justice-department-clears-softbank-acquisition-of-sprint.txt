Softbank and Sprint have been on pins and needles ever since January, when the US Department of Justice asked the FCC to delay the carriers' merger as it scrutinized the deal over national security concerns. The two networks can breathe a little easier this weekend, as the DOJ just dropped its request for more time. There's "no objection" to the acquisition following a review, the agency says. Not that the companies are completely out of the woods: the FCC has to approve the buyout, and there's still the small matters of Dish's bids for both Sprint and Clearwire. Softbank may not want to drop its backup plan just yet.
