We hope you're ready to stream your favorite PS3 games to, well, a lot of things, because Sony is rolling out the private beta testing phase for PlayStation Now, emailing the chosen ones with a confirmation link and instructions on what'll go down next. Those that sign up will get "exclusive access" to testing the new game streaming service as well as the ability to offer their (occasionally scathing) feedback to the PS Now team behind it all. Requirements are pretty fair too: you'll beed a PS3 wired to the internet and a 5Mbps or higher broadband connection. In case you forgot to sign up earlier, you can catch up right here. From those we've heard that are getting the invites, it might be limited to the LA and DC areas: as mentioned at Neogaf, the site asks for your zip code during the sign-up process.
