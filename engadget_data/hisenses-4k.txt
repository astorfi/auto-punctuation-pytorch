Seems like this is the week to push out all of those budget 55-inch 4K sets before the holidays roll around. Following yesterday's Sears-centric announcement of a Seiki $1,500 set, Hisense is offering up the T880. The $2,000 UHD offering features built-in WiFi and a number of smart TV apps like Opera, Netflix, YouTube, Pandora, Twitter and Facebook. The company's also promising a 178-degree viewing angle, so you can sit as away from your family members as you want, while still enjoying the movie. The T880 is available through a handful of budget-conscious retailers like Walmart and Costco here in the States.
