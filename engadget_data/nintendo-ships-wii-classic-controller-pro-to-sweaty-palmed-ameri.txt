If you'll recall, the Big N assured us all back in January that the jumbo-sized Wii Classic Controller Pro would begin shipping to America in April, and sure enough, that's exactly what it has done. After giving the Japanese a few months head-start, both the white and black accessories are now shipping from none other than Amazon for the tidy sum of $19.99 apiece. And yes, gift wrapping is available for a nominal fee.
