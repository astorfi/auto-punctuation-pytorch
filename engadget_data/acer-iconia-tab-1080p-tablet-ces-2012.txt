The Android-based slate will be powered by NVIDIA's Tegra 3 and will boast a native 1080p (!) display, leaving us to believe that it'll be a 10.1-inch panel that you're staring at. Sadly, the company didn't give any extra details (no price, no release date), but we'll be digging for more as the day continues.

Update: Turns out it'll be dubbed the Iconia Tab A700, and it'll ship with a 1.3GHz quad-core Tegra 3, 1GB of RAM, a 10.1-inch "IPS-quality" 1080p display (!) and a customized version of Ice Cream Sandwich. HDMI and micro-USB ports are also included, as is a microSD card slot. Check out our hands-on with the device here!
