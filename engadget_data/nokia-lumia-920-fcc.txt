The global edition of Nokia's Windows Phone 8 flagship, the Lumia 920, has been given the thumbs-up from the FCC. The device, which supports five LTE bands used outside of the US and zero within, has already been WiFi-certified (the certification papers actually specify this model, the RM-821, as the Lumia 920.1, which leads us to assume the AT&T-friendly version might be the 920.2). We're quite certain this won't be widely available stateside -- and certainly not through a major national carrier -- so we'll remain on the hunt for another Lumia 920 to pass through the federal halls sometime soon.
