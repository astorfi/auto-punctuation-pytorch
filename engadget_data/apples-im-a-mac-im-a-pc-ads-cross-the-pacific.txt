The Japanese guy playing the Mac still needs to work on that scraggly-but-lovable-cool-dude look, though -- he's a bit too clean, in our humble opinion. Any Japanese-speaking readers care to tell us if these ads are funny, and how they compare to the English ones? Have at it in the comments. In the meanwhile, we'll be setting our Tokyo staff to work on interviewing their Hodgman equivalent.
