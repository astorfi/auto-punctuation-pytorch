 projectiondesign is apparently working on a 3D projection-based solution to fit anyone's need. If a rotating panoramic display or eight camera visualization system seems like overkill, try its latest 2D/3D 1080p projector on for size. When driven by a dual-head PC via DVI it can deliver 3D in 1080p at 60Hz from a single projector, courtesy of a pair of active wireless glasses kept in sync with the projector via IR. AVING reports the system is expected in Korea in September and has a few more pics from the presentation, but your guess is as good as ours as to when this might be available in the U.S., and at what cost.
