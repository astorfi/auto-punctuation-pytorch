Now BGR has some pics of what is certainly a Xoom case along with an entry in the store's inventory system, strong indicators that the tablet will indeed be soon available there. Of course, we're all still waiting on the LTE wizardry Moto is said to be enabling on the Verizon flavor, but we would naturally expect Sprint's version to be packing some WiMAX whenever it ships. Word is the tablets themselves will be arriving in stores sometime before the end of the month, but let's just wait and see what Sprint has to say before we get too excited this Tuesday morning.
