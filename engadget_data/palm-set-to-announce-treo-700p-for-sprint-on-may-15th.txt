 We weresort of hoping against hope that Palm would officially take the wraps off their new Palm-powered Treo 700p here at CTIA this week, but ahighly trusted source has confirmed for us that they won't be making an official announcement until Monday, May 15th(or thereabouts). That date could slip, of course, but it does jibe with the May 28th launch date that's been floatingabout the interweb. We'll keep poking around here at CTIA to see if we can find out any more details, cool?
