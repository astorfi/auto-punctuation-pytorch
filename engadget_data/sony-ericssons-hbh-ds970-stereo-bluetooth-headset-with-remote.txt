Yeah,it's not completely wireless since you still have those cables dropping down to the Bluetooth-embedded remote. But hey,you want the remote anyway, and by not strapping those bulky Bluetooth cans to your ears we expect you'llbe able to rock the house for the full 6 hours spec'd with less fatigue. Call coming in? No problem, son, since thecaller ID and number slaps right-up on the remote's display allowing you to accept or reject the call even if you arelistening to music on another Bluetooth-enabled device. Although it doesn't say in the announcement, that remote shouldwirelessly control any Bluetooth device throwing down the AVRCPprofile, Sony Ericsson ornot. Expect these to ship in the second quarter for a yet to be determined price. [via UnofficialClub Sony Ericsson, thanks Luis]
