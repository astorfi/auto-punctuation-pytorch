Samsung generated some buzz last month with its ATIV Book 9 Plus sporting a res-tacular 13.3-inch, 275 ppi touchscreen, but left people asking "when" and "how much?" Retailer B&H Photo-Video seems to have answered those questions, listing a $1,399 price and expected availability of August 20th (at the source). That sum will get you a 1.6GHz Haswell Core i5-4200U dual-core CPU, 4GB of DDR3 RAM, a 128GB SSD, Intel HD 4400 graphics, Windows 8, and of course, that 3,200 x 1,800 touchscreen. As we noted before, you'll be able grab more RAM, a bigger SSD and a Core i7 processor for the light-ish 1.39kg (3.06 pound) device if you're willing to pay more. Though those options aren't listed yet, they'd likely price you into MacBook Pro Retina territory -- but at least you'd get way more pixels.
