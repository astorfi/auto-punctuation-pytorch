The 4.3-inch PMP was chillin' in a docking station among the other P series devices, and we managed to grab some snaps. Just like the WAVE-HOME we caught before it, the interface seemed super smooth. The UI made the most of that expansive (and gorgeous) screen, and the FM tuner seemed to do its job. We got a walkthrough of the device on video after the break, and don't forget to check out the gallery below that shows the device in all its "in the wild" glory.
