The game comes from three brothers at UK studio Boneloaf, and it combines ragdoll physics, environmental hazards and gummy-bear-style characters in four-player deathmatches.

Gang Beasts is due out in a shiny new alpha version on Steam on August 29, Double Fine announced today. "The game is a local multiplayer brawler in the style of Streets of Rage or Double Dragon that allows you and your buddies to fight alongside each other and face off head to head," Double Fine said. "It's a jolly good time full of silly procedural animation and ragdoll physics that will no doubt insight giggles and guffaws."

Gang Beasts tore up the Indie Megabooth at Gamescom last week, and next it's heading to PAX Prime (Double Fine booth No. 117) and Fantastic Arcade.
