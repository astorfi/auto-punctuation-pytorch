Unfortunately, this occurred within the confines of a demonstration booth, not a fine German car. The heads-up display was certainly readable on the tinted screen. However, it was barely visible when we moved it to the side. Ok, it's a prototype device, but we left the booth wondering just how visible the speed and direction indicators would be along an open stretch of sunny PCH roadway -- especially when these are supposed to pop as early as next month in Europe for about $100. Best wait for a proper review before plunking down on this one.
