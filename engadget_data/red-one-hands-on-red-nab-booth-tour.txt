But there it was, plain as day in their booth, ready to manhandle for anyone willing to wait in the 45 minute line to get in. The ONE isn't so large on its own, but kit it out with any of the copious amount of accessories RED is launching with it, and you'll get a good idea of how serious a rig it can become. We also caught a glimpse of their REDCINE software, which pre-processes all the raw output video you shot. Check it out; prepare to wish you too possessed the talent to bankroll a movie with one of these bad boys.
