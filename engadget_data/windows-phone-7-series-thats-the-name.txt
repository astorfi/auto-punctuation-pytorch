The ensuing conversation went something like this:
Chris: Dude, I think I see something there underneath the sticker. I think it says "SEVEN" in all caps.
Thomas (staring intently): No way.
Chris: Yes, I'm telling you, "SEVEN." It's there!
Thomas: Fanboy. It's official, I'm covering MWC with an insane person... looks like I'm bouncing back to Amsterdam. Peace.
Well, turns out we were both wrong -- a little Photoshop magic (okay, a lot of Photoshop magic) reveals "7 Series" underneath the decal, just waiting to be torn off after Monday's big press event. The "7" is certainly no surprise, but the "Series" part of this is cause for some last-minute speculation -- are we actually going to see consumer and professional breakouts of the platform as we'd heard rumored a few times in the past? We'll know in less than two days. Follow the break for the full retouched image.
