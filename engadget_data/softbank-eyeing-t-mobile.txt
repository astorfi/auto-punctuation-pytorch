Softbank's plan A is still a $20.1 billion deal for Sprint, as it looks to enter the US wireless market. But, with stiff competition from Dish in the effort to acquire the black and yellow carrier, rumors are that it's keeping one eye on T-Mobile. You know... just in case. According to a report from Reuters, the Japanese company is in discussions with Deutsche Telekom for its share of Big Magenta. Softbank was involved in discussions last year to purchase T-Mo, before the MetroPCS deal was eventually struck, following the collapse of a proposed merger with AT&T. Obviously none of this is official just yet. But, if Sprint's shareholders reject the Softbank deal on June 12th, we wouldn't be surprised if it quickly made moves to purchase the second most beleaguered national wireless provider in America.
