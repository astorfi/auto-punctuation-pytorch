In fact, based on the reviews by Hot Hardware and PC Perspective, among others, this quad-core proc is the fastest desktop processor ever. While it's only 4-5% faster across the board than Intel's previous champ, the Core i7 965, world's fastest is world's fastest, right AMD? Better yet, the CPU is suitable for "significant" overclocking -- HH took it around the benchmark block at 4.1GHz and found only a "small voltage bump" while hitting a 50-degree C max temperature using Intel's stock heat sink. Look for the Core i7 975 to hit retail for a $999 list price which explains why the first gaming rigs wrapped around the 975 start at $8,000.Read -- Hot Hardware reviewRead -- PCPer review
