 After T-Mobile said yesterday that it won't be able to offer Samsung's Galaxy S 4 through its online store quite as soon as it expected, Sprint has today announced a similar delay. The carrier originally planned to have Sammy's latest flagship available through all retail channels this Saturday (April 27th), but "unexpected inventory challenges from Samsung" have meant that although online and phone-based sales will open on that date as planned, you won't be able to wander into a Sprint store and pick one up until those supply issues are solved. When that'll be is anyone's guess, but we imagine Sprint will get them into consumers' hands as soon as possible in the hope of improving its balance sheet. See Sprint's full statement after the break.

 Update: Samsung has also responded with an official statement, citing "overwhelming global demand" leading to inventory shortages. We've added the comment underneath Sprint's.



  "Sprint is excited to launch the new Samsung Galaxy 4. We had planned to launch this next generation of the award-winning Samsung Galaxy line-up on Saturday, April 27. Unfortunately, due to unexpected inventory challenges from Samsung, we will be slightly delayed with our full product launch. Sprint is one of Samsung's largest partners and we are working closely with them to launch in all Sprint channels as soon as possible. We expect to make GS4 available at www.sprint.com and Telesales (1-800-SPRINT1) as planned on Saturday with Sprint retail stores and other channels receiving devices as inventory becomes available."
  "Due to overwhelming global demand of Galaxy S4, the initial supply may be limited. We expect to fulfill inventory to meet demands in the coming weeks."
