 Acer's far from being a major player in the smartphone space, but to call it irrelevant would be grossly inaccurate. Up until now, however, the outfit has relied largely on Microsoft's mobile OS to power its phones, though even it seems shocked by the warm reception the Android-powered Liquid has received. According to the company's own Aymar de Lencquesaing, Acer recognizes that "there is definitely momentum behind Android," and he continued by stating that "the pace is faster than most would have anticipated one year ago." He went on to proclaim that the company was apt to pump out 8 to 10 phones in 2010, with next year's lineup being "much more balanced" in terms of the amount of Windows Mobile vs. Android handsets. Look out, world -- Google just might take over another huge portion of your life while you're fixated on the next great Black Friday deal.
