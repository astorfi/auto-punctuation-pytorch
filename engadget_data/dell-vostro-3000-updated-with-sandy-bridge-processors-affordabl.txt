We know, it's getting a bit repetitive at this point, but what if we told you this group blends together some awesome features and won't cost you more than $600? You'd be willing to hear more, right? Well, Dell's indeed refreshing its 13-, 14-, 15-, and 17.3-inch Vostro 3000 series laptops with those fresh Core i3, i5 and i7 processors, but it's leaving intact everything we loved about the series the first time around -- including, its aluminum build, backlit keyboard, and matte displays. On top of that it's also adding SRS Pro sound, HD webcams, and a new chiclet keyboard, which is a lot like the one we like so much on the Inspiron 14R and M101z. See we told you the features were worth hearing about. Internally, all four systems will be available with a selection of Sandy Bridge processors (with the 17.3-inch version getting some quad-core options), a variety of hard drive and SSD options, six- and nine cell batteries, and up to 8GB of RAM. We don't have the exact configuration pricing, but according to the press release below the 13-inch 3350 will start at $599, 14-inch 3450 and 15-inch 3550 at $499, and lastly the 17-inch 3750 at $549. See, mighty tempting prices -- especially after you take a look at the hands-on pictures below.
