Grab that box of sodium chloride, folks -- it's rumor time. Re/Code is reporting that Apple will hold its next iPhone event on September 9th. And while any publication can pull a date out of the hat and report on it, this particular entity has a good track record predicting Apple events (even when it was AllThingsD). This date places it just a few days after Samsung's upcoming product launch at the IFA trade show in Berlin; traditionally, this is where the Korean manufacturer announces its next Note flagship smartphone, so it's not too hard to see Apple taking on its arch rival with a similar-sized product. According to rumors, the company plans to introduce a 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch version of its next iPhone. Still, nothing's set in stone, so we'll let you know as soon as we get official word from Cupertino.


Update: Both Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal are also corroborating the September 9th report with their own sources.
