The carrier will tackle the phase out on a regional basis, starting with New York on April 21st. Those affected should have already received notification of the impending change, as Verizon will be doling out free digital adapters to keep said customers from pulling their hair out in frustration. Of course, it's not missing the chance to offer up more sophisticated set-tops to these very folks in hopes of coaxing them into bigger, clearer packages, but it's not like we're going to argue with Verizon trying to up the HD adoption rate around here.
