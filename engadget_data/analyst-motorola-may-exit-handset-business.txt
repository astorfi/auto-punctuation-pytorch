 Hey, that's what Nomura International analyst, Richard Windsor, told his clients in a note published this morning. Instead of handsets, Moto may choose to refocus on becoming an "enterprise and government company." While on a roll, Richard also raised speculation that a Chinese company might scoop up the troubled Moto before calling it "unlikely as those vendors don't have much of an idea how to fix Motorola's problems." Problems he attributes to the platform and software, not hardware. Man Moto, what a long hard fall it's been since your 2005 RAZR heyday.
