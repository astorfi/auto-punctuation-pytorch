A fresh report from Nikkei is pretty confidently talking about a new Nintendo DS destined to hit "within the year," though we aren't claiming to be full-fledged believers just yet. To be fair, this isn't the first we've heard of such a beast, though the translated description is pretty far out there. For instance, the new model will reportedly boast a camera that will be used heavily for games and offer a stronger wireless signal. Even crazier is the bit about "competing with cellular phones" and "exceeding the frame of the game industry." The article mentions that the device will eventually ship for ?20,000 ($189) or less, though it doesn't say what kind of sauce the author hit before writing commenced.[Image courtesy of Techeblog, thanks RS]
