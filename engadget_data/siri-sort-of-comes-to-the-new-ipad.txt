  Ever since Siri showed up on the iPhone 4S, she's been put to work in a variety of non-Apple approved ways and unofficially ported to other iDevices, including the iPad. Now Apple's next-gen iPad has made its auspicious debut in San Francisco with a splash of Siri on board. It's not the full voice assistant, but the new tablet does have voice dictation software that supports US English, British, Australian, French, German and Japanese. Not only that, but the dictation feature is available in third-party apps as well, so you'll be able to speak your tweets and status updates on Apple's new slate.
