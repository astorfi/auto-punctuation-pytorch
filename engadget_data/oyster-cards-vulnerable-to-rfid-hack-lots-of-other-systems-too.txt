And that's just the tip of the iceberg: a new report says that the system can be broken in minutes using a typical PC -- check the video after the break for a demonstration. We've also listed all the other now-potentially-vulnerable Mifare RFID implementations we could find, but there's got to be more -- put 'em in comments!
