That robot, plus a new humanoid called Atlas, have won DARPA contracts and so will be put into at least limited production, much like the company's earlier BigDog. Cheetah is said to run "faster than any existing legged robot and faster than the fastest human runners," while Atlas can "move through difficult terrain using human-like behavior," meaning neither running nor hiding will work. That leaves only fighting, so get ready to buck up.
