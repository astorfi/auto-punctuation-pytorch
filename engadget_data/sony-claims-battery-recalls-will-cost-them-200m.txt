 In a brief but pointed statement by Sony, hygienically entitled "Statement Regarding Sony's Support of Apple's Recall of Lithium Ion Battery Packs Used in Apple Notebook Computers," the mass manufacturer of defective batteries announced that the recalls we've been hearing so much about in the past few days are due to "microscopic metal particles in the recalled battery cells [that] may come into contact with other parts of the battery cell, leading to a short circuit within the cell. Typically, a battery pack will simply power off when a cell short circuit occurs. However, under certain rare conditions, an internal short circuit may lead to cell overheating and potentially flames." Ok, got it, we're with 'em, especially on the bit where they announced they're taking additional measures to ensure the safety of future batteries manufactured. So, howsabout putting a pricetag on all this carnage, eh? Well, between Apple's and Dell's six or so million units that are about to be recalled, it's going to set Sony back between ¥20 and ¥30 billion, or in dollar terms, between $134.2 and $201.3 million (or in per-unit terms, that's roughly $22 and $33 per battery). Now that, dear friends, is a spicy damned meatball.P.S. -Ok, so howsabout that markup on those batteries? Even after shipping, support costs, and costs per unit, your $100-$150 battery is still only going to cost Sony as much as $33 per. As if we weren't already angry enough.[Thanks, Tim]
