The hack is about as simple as they come, he merely rewired the Wiimote's IR sensor to the front of his NES Zapper, and hooked up the trigger to the Wiimote's trigger button. He plans to strap the Wiimote to his wrist, for easy access weapon changes, and while the mod is lacking in elegance, cyberpyrot claims his FPS performance has "vastly improved." Alright Nintendo, your turn. Video is after the break.
