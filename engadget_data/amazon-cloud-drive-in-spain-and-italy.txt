Pricing in these regions matches that of the UK, Germany and France, with 8 euros (around $10) netting you 20GB of storage for a year, on top of the complimentary 5GB you get for signing up. You'll be able to access this space through your browser, desktop apps, or any of the new Kindle Fires when they start hitting Euro doorsteps at the end of the month. Plus, Amazon's giving US customers the ability to share files with whomever they choose, and Mac users worldwide can now upload their iPhoto library hassle-free. With Cloud Drive now available, the Appstore ready to roll, and Fire hardware making its way to the Continent, we're starting to think Amazon quite likes it there.

   "Cloud Drive makes digital file storage simple and secure – two very important features for customers who want to organize and manage precious files like photos," said Russell Dicker, director of Cloud Drive for Amazon. "Now you never have to worry about losing important documents or photos to hard drive crashes, or not being able to access files that are spread between a number of devices. Cloud Drive stores digital files like photos, videos and documents all in one place that is easily accessible from any PC or Mac – and coming soon in Europe, Kindle Fire."

   With this release, Amazon Cloud Drive also now enables U.S.-based users to share the files they upload to Cloud Drive with friends and family. Users can visit www.amazon.com/clouddrive to view the files they've uploaded and select individual files they wish to share.

   In addition, Cloud Drive customers in the U.S. and Europe using Mac computers can now easily upload their iPhoto albums to Cloud Drive in as little as two clicks using the Cloud Drive Desktop App. Users can select the events they want to upload and the Cloud Drive Desktop App seamlessly uploads photos so they can be enjoyed instantly on Kindle Fire or from any web browser.
