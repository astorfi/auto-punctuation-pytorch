We're not sure exactly how many people a product like this would apply to, but Sanyo has developed a
dishwasher that doesn't need to be
connected directly to your water supply. Just attach the included "Water Supply Socket" directly to your faucet, and
run it until the dishwasher's LED lights up and its buzzer sounds. Inside the unit are two storage tanks, which
eliminates the need for a valve to control the flow of water to the dishwasher. A full load will use 9 liters (2.37
gallons) of water, which, last we checked, isn't a lot compared to other washers. Otherwise, you're looking at a
standard dishwasher.
