The new developer kit will add features like color camera settings and extended depth data, as well as more tools and samples like a UI demo based on Kinect's so-called human interface guidelines. Chinese users won't be the only ones waving hello for the first time this fall though, as Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, and Poland have also been added to the list. All told, 38 countries will be able to tinker with the Kinect by the end of the year, and Microsoft envisions an era "where we'll be able to interact intuitively and naturally" with our computers. Some of Redmond's userbase may want it to start somewhere else with that quest.
