If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a next-gen game trailer in 1080p at 60fps is at least five times as valuable. However, streaming such a clip without degrading the source material isn't exactly a cake walk, and that's why the latest teaser for Killzone: Shadow Fall is only available as a direct download from Sony. If you click over to the PlayStation Blog you can grab a video showing off the game's multiplayer that weighs in at a hefty 570MB for just over a minute of footage. Sony isn't the first to do this though, it's just the first to heavily publicize it: Respawn has 1080p 60fps footage of Titanfall for your downloading pleasure, too. If this is what it takes to get a better idea of how a game will actually look when we play it ourselves, we're all for it. However, we find it a little odd that Sony's file is in Quicktime format -- a codec that a PS3 can't play back natively.
