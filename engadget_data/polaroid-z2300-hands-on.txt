In the post film age however, the company has fought to stay relevant without completely sacrificing its identity at the altar of the digital photography gods. The solution has been cramming printers inside the bodies of its shooters (and partnering with questionably talented celebrities), hoping to recreate the experience of instantly coping a glossy copy to hang or hand out, while co-opting the benefits of the megapixel. The Z2300 is the latest in its effort to claim a chunk of the casual photography market. This 10 megapixel printer cam produces 2 x 3-inch prints that are also stickers in about 30-45 seconds. It's not quite as quick as the Polaroids of old, but at least you don't have to shake em.





   The Z2300 comes in white and black, both with a thin rainbow decal across the front and large red shutter button that plays on its retro roots. The paper pops out from a slot on the right hand side, while the left is home to the mini-USB port, power jack and a switch for landscape and macro mode. The controls around back, next to the LCD viewfinder, are pretty standard for a budget digicam -- with the exception of the print key. After snapping a photo you press the print key, select how many copies of your image you want, then confirm your selection. It's a little convoluted, but it ensures you'll never accidentally eat through an entire load of paper. And you could do that pretty quickly since the tray under the screen (which opens with a slightly flimsy feeling latch) holds only 10 pages at a time.
