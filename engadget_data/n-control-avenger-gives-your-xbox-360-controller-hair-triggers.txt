N-Control, however, has done just that with this insane lever-filled shell, which wraps around the gamepad to provide simultaneous control over a host of inputs at once. The idea is that you'll never need to take your thumbs off the analog sticks to swap weapons or reload, because you'll just flick one of those weighted levers instead. You'll also apparently gain a split-second advantage over opponents on the draw since the contraption constantly applies tension to each of the controller's triggers, making them easier to press. For $60, the Avenger even comes with a tripod, which could be a good move on the company's part -- it looks like you might need one to hold the beast up. Video after the break.
