See those images above? Those could become a familiar sight in the future if you religiously use Google's Calendar app for Android. This crisper, cleaner Google Calendar was recently spotted by Geek.com (which also spilled the deets on a test version of Gmail) on a phone loaded with unreleased features. If you notice, the new interface gets rid of the app's busy grids and lines, relying instead on blocks of color to distinguish one entry from the other.


What's more intriguing, however, is a new feature called daily agenda, which automatically emails you the day's full schedule. Since the updated calendar will also come with Google+ integration, or so the source claims, daily agenda emails will also include birthdays, giving you no excuse to forget anybody's special day. Other than these changes, you'll also reportedly see a parallax scrolling effect while flipping through months. Of course, the final product could be wildly different from what we're seeing here. We might have to wait a few more months to find out, though -- Geek.com believes Google will launch the redesigned calendar at the I/O conference in June.
