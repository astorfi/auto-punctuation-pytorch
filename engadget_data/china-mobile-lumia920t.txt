Unfortunately, the network itself isn't being so straight forward, announcing the news on Sina Weibo shortly before yanking the post altogether. China Mobile's dithering aside, we're fairly sure the 920T will gain TD-SCDMA and TD-LTE modems, but is otherwise the same phone we've pawed at for the last few weeks.
