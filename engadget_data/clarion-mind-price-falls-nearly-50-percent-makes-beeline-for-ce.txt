Nary eight months after Clarion's Atom-powered MiND MID went on sale for the not-at-all-seductive price of $649.99, the evidently undesirable device has dropped to around $350. Right now on Amazon, the red and white units are priced at $342.83 and $360.87, respectively, while the black version is still holding its value just a wee bit better. Unfortunately, something tells us this thing is on the REDFLY plan, which should put it within a cheap plastic bag in your Frosted Flakes by the year's end.[Via Pocketables]
