After launching its first 4K laptop in the UK, Toshiba has just announced US availability. Stateside, it'll be called the P55T, but as before, it's a 15.6-inch laptop with 3,840 x 2,160 resolution. That's a staggering 282 ppi, if you're scoring at home -- compared to, say 220 ppi for Apple's 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display. Driving all those pixels is AMD's 2GB DDR5 Radeon R9 M265X discrete graphics, a 4th-gen Intel quad-core i7 CPU and 16GB DDR3L max memory. Another hook is Technicolor certification, which ensures that each IPS display is individually calibrated for accurate colors. Along with the included copy of Adobe's Lightroom 5, that'll appeal to photographers and designers -- though the rather anemic 1TB, 5400 RPM mechanical hard drive is a letdown. It'll arrive on April 22nd at $1,500, a price that seems competitive with the few other 4K laptops. Meanwhile, Toshiba also announced some more mainstream models -- hit the break for more on those. 





As with the 4K laptop, Toshiba's other new models are similar to those announced in the UK, but with slightly different model names. In brief, you'll get three performance models: the 15.6-inch Satellite S55, 17.3-inch S75 and 14-inch E45. All can be had with up to 1080p resolution, Core i5 or i7 dual-core CPUs (the S55 is also available with an AMD A10 APU), 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Touchscreens are available on the S55t and E45t models. Prices start at $650 for the 14-inch E45.

Finally there's the "everyday stuff" laptops, as Toshiba calls them. Those include the C55/C75 and L55/L75, 15.6-inch and 17.3-inch laptops for each lineup, respectively. As the focus here is on value, the screens have less resolution, with a touchscreen only available on the L55. Toshiba isn't mentioning exact specs, but did say that they'll come with either Intel or AMD CPUs, 12GB of RAM max and up to a 1TB disk drive. The C series will start at $400, while the L models will run $330 and up, with availability for all models starting on June 22nd.
