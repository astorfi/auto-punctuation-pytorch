The disparate ecosystems of Windows Phone, Microsoft's traditional desktop and the Xbox 360 left a generation of Redmond loyals aching for a more unified front. Now Dell seems convinced that one is on the way: according to a blurb on the company's online store, Windows 8 apps will be capable of being "run on and synced" to the Xbox One. "Now your phone, desktop, tablet and TV can all give you a unified web and entertainment experience," it says. Although this aligns well with some of the company's goals, we'd still take it with a grain of salt -- Microsoft has said in the past that the Windows 8 apps won't be cross-compatible with the Xbox One without extra tweaking. It's not clear if the Dell statement is a misunderstanding, or merely a suggestion that app data will sync across devices to provide a more seamless experience. Still, we've reached out to the company for clarification, and certainly wouldn't scoff better cross-platform support in either form.
