What we got back was about 150cakes, some of which were so astounding we didn't even know how to react. We had a long weekend judging all these cakes,but we've got our winners, as well as a bunch of runners up we had to commend with an Engadget t-shirt. Big thanks toeveryone who entered, and don't worry, we've got more Engadget birthday cake galleries on their way.Clickon to view the winners' gallery!

Kirk, you're a freaking madman, and this is easily the bestbirthday present anyone's ever given us. We thought the competition was a lock until you came along and, well, took thecake. We tip our hats to you sir.Watch thevideo of the cake in action!Second place!Squeezebox Wireless David & Barbara G - AiboThis was easily the mosttechnically astounding cake we saw. The difficult shapes and attention to detail paid to Aibo is absolutely incredible.Hope it tastes as good as it looks!        Runners up (in noparticular order)Chyun G - Alienware PCIf we had a third place prize, it wouldhave easily gone to Chyun for her Alienware PC. This cake is astoundingly well made, and we're really sorry we couldn'ttake a taste.
