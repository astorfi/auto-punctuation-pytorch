Along with announcing a fresh Wii U lineup at E3 this week, Nintendo shared that it will launch its first free-to-play title during this fiscal year -- that is, by the end of March 2014. Industry analyst David Gibson tweeted the news live from the press event, adding that the move is intended to "boost digital sales," and confirming that the game won't fall under the Mario or Pokemon franchises. Nintendo isn't saying which platform its first free-to-play offering is destined for, but in any case this announcement is a good sign that the company is getting serious about downloadable content.
