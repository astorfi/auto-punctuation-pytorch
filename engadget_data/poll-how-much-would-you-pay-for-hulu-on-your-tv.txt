Not only has Hulu been willing to play cat-and-mouse games with Boxee, but in the EULA of the new Hulu desktop application, it specifically states that "You may not download, install or use the Hulu Software on any device other than a Personal Computer including without limitation digital media receiver devices (such as Apple TV)." Competitors have previously stated that Hulu advertisements are generating "scant incremental revenue," so with the recent Xbox 360 and Roku rumors we wonder, how much would you pay for Hulu on your TV?
