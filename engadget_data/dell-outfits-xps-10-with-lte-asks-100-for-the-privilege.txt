 The FCC told us that an LTE ready version of the Dell XPS 10 was coming, but there's nothing like official confirmation. In any case, it's here, and it runs on AT&T. Dell officially announced the variant's availability on its blog, identifying the radio the feds uncovered as a Qualcomm Gobi modem, a natural fit for the tablet's 1.5 GHz Snapdragon S4 CPU. The LTE option is only available for the device's 64GB configuration, and adds $100 to the price. Hey, nobody said getting LTE on your Windows RT tablet was cheap.
