Boy Genius appears to have scored some intel suggesting that Sprint will be releasing the V9m RAZR 2 next month, bucking the typical Verizon-first, Sprint-second trend. As with the KRZR before it, it seems that the two carriers will be rocking slightly different color schemes for the phone, with Sprint's taking on a slightly more understated monotone look. Naturally, the V9m will slot in on the upper end of Sprint's dumbphone lineup, featuring Power Vision (read: EV-DO) access and Sprint Music Store compatibility. Any Sprint peeps out there just sorta want to close their eyes and wake up in four weeks or so?
