Citing "people familiar with the project," AppleInsider says that the new "super-slim" keyboard will take its inspiration from those used on the latest MacBooks (seen above), which should please some more than others. Nothing more specific than that, unfortunately, although if the rumored August launch date is true, we shouldn't have to wait too much longer to check 'em out first hand.
