In a classic case of "if we don't play my way I'm taking my toys and going home," electronic voting machine
manufacturer Diebold has announced that it will no longer do business in North Carolina because the state refused to
grant an exception that would let Diebold keep its source code secret. After more voting machine blunders in 2004
(little things, like how it was discovered that even monkeys
can hack Diebold gear), North Carolina passed a law that requires e-voting vendors to place their source codes in
escrow as a precaution against future irregularities, meaning that the state is not even asking Diebold to reveal its
code publicly. Nonetheless, Diebold claims that because their machines contain some Microsoft software, they don't have
to right to release the code. Okay folks, which explanation sounds more reasonable: A. Diebold is willing to lose an
entire state's worth of business in order to protect Microsoft or themselves on the off-chance of a successful lawsuit
or B. Diebold is petrified that their code is so full of security flaws, and other "issues" that should it ever be
scrutinized, the company would most likely go out of business? Now before you answer, remember once again that this is
Diebold we're talking about here.
