RFID kid-tracking gear with the
idea that industrial robots make the best babysitters? If
you're Japan's Secom Corp., you get a robot bodyguard that can keep children in line and attack anyone who tries to get
fresh with the kids. The company's Robot X security guard currently rents for about $2,700 per month — mainly to
companies looking to enhance their security systems — but Secom hopes to branch out into playground security. A new
version can already send parents SMS alerts letting them know what their kids are up to. Oh, and just in case the
playground isn't enough, RFID robots are turning up in other spots, as well. So, if you think that trash can is
following you around, you may just be right.
