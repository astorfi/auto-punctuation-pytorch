  Those Vostro PCs we first heard about last month just got pushed out the door by Dell. The laptops consist of the 14.1-inch Vostro 1400, 15.4-inch Vostro 1500, and 17-inch Vostro 1700 while the desktops include the Vostro 200 Slim Tower and Vostro 200 Mini Tower. There's even a low-end, AMD-based 15.4-inch Vostro 1000 laptop starting at just $449. The laptops mirror their Inspiron brethren configurations only with a small-business mindset: all-black (only) slabs, zero pre-installed bloatware, a 30-day guarantee without restocking fee, choice of XP or Vista Business, and services designed for small businesses. Same goes for the Vostro desktops which start at just $319. All available now.
