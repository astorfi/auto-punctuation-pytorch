The 4.2-inch phone was the one of the bigger announcements at the event, sporting a 1.4GHz processor, an 8.1 megapixel camera, a Reality Display and the ability to convert 2D images into 3D. Like the new Walkman, however, Sony seemed largely interested in showing off the handset's ability to transfer content onto its line of Bravia displays. Check out a brief hands-on video with the new Arc after the break.
