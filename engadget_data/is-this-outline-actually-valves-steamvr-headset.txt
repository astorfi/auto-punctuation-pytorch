Valve only just announced plans to bring a "SteamVR hardware system" to the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, and now we might have our first look at it. The sleuths at SteamDB have dug up this outline of a headset on the Steam Universe signup page, and it looks a bit different from anything we've seen from the likes of Oculus, Samsung or Sony. A year ago developers said that Valve was working with hardware with a higher resolution and refresh rate than what Oculus had at that time, but things could be different now. We'll be waiting until next week for confirmation (that three cables = Half Life 3, of course), but this may be the first accessory for your next Steam Box. Oh, and remember that Steam Controller with the added thumbstick? Today the Steam Client beta got an update with support for the new controller -- see you at GDC 2015!
