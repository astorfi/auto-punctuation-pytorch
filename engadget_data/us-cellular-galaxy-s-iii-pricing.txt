As it turns out, USCC will be offering the 16GB GS3 for $200, while the 32GB flavor will cost you an extra $50. Here's the kicker, though: these prices can be yours -- after a $100 mail-in rebate. But hey, it's hard for us to complain too much, considering it's not too often a regional carrier gets a flagship device around the same time as any of the major national players.
