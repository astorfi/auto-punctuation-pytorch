  Okay, so right off the bat: do they even know what it means to drop the f-bomb in Canada? We've seen a lot of ridiculously-named products around here -- Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PooS come immediately to mind -- but this Eurocom model, with its allusion to the most hardcore cuss word in the English language, is by far one of the worst. Besides the unfortunate branding, however, the company's 17-inch D900K gaming notebook sounds like a pretty good performer; according to MobilityGuru the dual core AMD Athlon 64 X2 4800 processor and nVIDIA GeForce Go 7800 GTX graphics card help it to achieve pretty impressive benchmark results. You're also getting a 1,920 x 1,200 resolution display, DVD burner, 802.11a/b/g, DVI out, and 4-in-1 card reader for the $3,500 pricetag, though the 5,200 RPM hard drive and 1GB of pokey 200MHz DDR RAM keep this rig from delivering the outstanding results you'd get from a machine like Dell's XPS M1710. Still, if you can't afford a Dell (we never thought we'd actually say that) and don't mind lugging around 15 pounds of gear to get your mobile computing on, you may not find this particular F-bomb to be all that offensive.
