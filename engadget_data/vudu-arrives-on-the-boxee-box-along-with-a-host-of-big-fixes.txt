After a bit of a false start, Boxee's rolling out Vudu to the Boxee Box today -- you can either hold tight for the auto update in the next 24 hours, or trigger the manual update in Settings. Vudu's offering new users who sign up on the Boxee Box a $5.99 credit, which is the price of a single HDX rentals, so that's clever. Vudu remains Vudu -- 1080p/24 video, 5.1 audio -- but we'll obviously give it a look on the Box to check it out. As for other improvements, there are quite a few; highlights include better browser performance with HTTPS support, a sorting option to ignore "the" or "a" in titles, more deinterlacing controls, a whole host of bug fixes, and quite a bit more. Not bad -- we'll let you know if we discover anything crazy. PR and the full changelog after the break.

Update: Vudu's $2 for two nights deal applies to SD rentals, but you can get a single HDX rental for $5.99. 
      

 

Show full PR textWe have released a new version of the Boxee Box firmware. Your Box will update automatically within the next 24hrs or you can manually check for the update by going to Settings>System>Update (this is the update we tried to get out last week, but had to pullback after we received initial critical bug reports).As always there are many bug fixes and in this case lots of work on the Boxee Browser, but the big news in this release is VUDU.VUDU on the Boxee Box means: access to the largest selection of HD movies on-demand, new releases (same day as DVD), thousands of movies available for rental at $2 for 2 nights. We are psyched.The VUDU HDX format on the Boxee Box is a match made in geek heaven! (that normal people will appreciate, too). Video is 1080p HD at 24 fps. Sound is Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 surround. It takes advantage of some crafty engineering from VUDU dubbed TruFilmâ„¢ which optimizes the encoding, transmission and display of HDX movies on 40-inch HDTVs and larger screens. It's kind of hard to believe this stuff is coming over your Internet connection.Invite some friends over. Rent an HDX movie. You are guaranteed to gain new respect for your geekness and pass the crucial WAF test.VUDU is offering every new user who signs up on the Boxee Box a $5.99 credit towards a first rental/purchase.
