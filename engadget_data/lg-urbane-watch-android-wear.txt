LG is revealing what's (literally) up its sleeve for MWC 2015. It's an Android Wear smartwatch that LG calls its luxury iteration, with an all-metal body, gold and silver finishes and a natural leather strap (which can be swapped out, of course). Between the strap, the Watch Urbane also houses the same heart-rate monitor of LG's other smartwatch; it's not all about the looks. The company says that the new model isn't technically a sequel to the G Watch and G Watch R, but will "complement" its existing Android Wear offferings.




The Watch Urbane has the same 1.3-inch circular P-OLED display as the G Watch R, however, the engineers and designers have managed to shave down the bezel around the edges. That's luxury for you. The battery capacity remains the same (410 mAh), however, so if you're still waiting on a smartwatch to break through the three-day battery barrier, you might want to wait out for the next Android Wear round. It probably won't be far away. And then there's that pesky Apple Watch, something that LG appears to be directly competing with, replete with luxury pitch. Those all-important release dates and pricing will likely come direct from Barcelona -- and we'll be reporting all the MWC madness very soon.
