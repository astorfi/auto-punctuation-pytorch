Best of all, the whole experience is presented in the classic LCARS interface that should be familiar to any fan of The Next Generation (or TNG as the cool kids are calling it). In addition to serving as a reference for all things Trek, the app pulls in feeds from the official Facebook and Twitter pages. You can get grab it, in all its black and pastel-colored glory, for $5 at the source link and check out the gallery below.
