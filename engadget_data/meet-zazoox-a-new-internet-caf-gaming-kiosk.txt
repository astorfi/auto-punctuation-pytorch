We hadn't heard of them until today, when we read in the trade publication Kiosk Marketplace that Zazoox is a new pay-for-use game caf√© kiosk that can play PC, Xbox and PlayStation games alike. The company behind the gaming systems, Zoox Stations, says that it's installed 300 Zazoox (Zazooxes? Zazooxi?) on US Army bases domestically and in Germany. Currently, a Zazoox comes with games that include Halo, Call of Duty 2, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06, with each setup running a 26-inch LCD display, a PX620 mini-tower loaded with a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and 1GB of RAM -- and the best feature of all time, a "PC Reset Switch." Including its speakers and encasing, the whole thing (sans chair) weighs a hefty 300 pounds. No word on how much a Zazoox costs, or if its worth the 31 points that it would get on the Scrabble board. (And yes, we know that there's only one Z tile in Scrabble, so back off, it's ours, son.)[Via The Raw Feed]
