Wouldn't be the first of its kind on the market, but an anonymous tipster just sent us this photo of what appears to
be a new 8GB version of SanDisk's Cruzer Mini USB flash drive. We can't vouch for the authenticity of the image, but
it's probably time for SanDisk to up the maximum capacity of the Cruzer Mini line from 4GB to 8GB anyway, so it
wouldn't exactly surprise us if they announced this soon. No other details on when it might come out or what it might
cost when it gets here, but similar 8GB USB flash drives usually sell for north of a grand.


UPDATE
: SanDisk wrote in to say that an 8GB Cruzer Mini is not in the works and that the pic is a fake. Too bad, because
obviously the demand is out there.
