Now they've linked us to a host of new iPad apps with Netflix and ABC player being two of the most notable. The free Neflix app is said to be launching along side Apple's slate on April 3rd letting Netflix subscribers browse and manage their queues. More importantly, it will also allow subscribers to stream Netflix's online collection of videos. Of course, if this is true then we expect to see a Netflix app land for the iPhone and iPod touch as well in adherence to Reed Hastings' previous comments. 

There's also a free ABC app tipped for April 3rd giving iPad owners WiFi access to full episodes of shows like Lost and Grey's Anatomy. And with CBS seemingly getting into the HTML5 game we suspect that the demand for Hulu in the US will dampen if all this comes to fruition -- especially if Hulu adopts a subscription model. Not enough? Then check out the 1,350 (and counting) approved iPad apps in the source link below or preview 700 of them in a video after the break where you'll also catch a few more Netflix and ABC screenies. We'll have to wait until Saturday to see how many of these actually appear in the iTunes App Store.

Update: Looks like these apps are coming straight from Apple's app database since AppShopper is also showing Netflix and ABC Player iPad apps. Don't believe it? Then why not grab some screenshots of your own direct from Apple's servers. This is legit folks.
