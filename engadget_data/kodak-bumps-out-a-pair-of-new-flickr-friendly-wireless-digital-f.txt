Quite similar to their M820 and M1020 (pictured) counterparts in most respects, the new frames add WiFi, which brings with it services like Flickr, FrameChannel and Kodak Gallery. Unfortunately, the only way to add generic RSS feeds is FrameChannel, and all FrameChannel subscriptions include a monstrous banner ad across the bottom of each frame -- at least Kodak's partnership with Flickr is separate, so those subs are clean. Each frame includes 512MB of storage in addition to memory card slots, and they should be out next month for $250 and $280, respectively.
