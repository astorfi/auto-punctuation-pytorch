 Man, hasn't this one been a rollercoaster? After months in the courtroom, large sums of money being resentfully exchanged, and Immersion laughing all the way to the bank, it seems like the two firms have finally got over their beef with one another and are ready to make things happen -- officially. This slowly developing friendship has been waiting in the works for some time now, but according to a reported blurb by Sony's US PR head honcho Dave Karraker, the company is "currently in discussions with Immersion on how it can incorporate their technologies into Sony's products," but unfortunately, he concluded by informing us that "no timetable was set." Still, the inclusion of rumble features on PSOne and PS2 dual shock controllers in the latest PS3 firmware all but substantiate the post-lawsuit relationship, so we can't imagine (okay, so we can) this debacle dragging out too much longer.[Via PS3Fanboy]
