 Google's been emailing some good news for those that didn't snatch up its new smartphone within minutes of its online launch a few weeks back. Anyone that asked to be kept up-to-date with Nexus 4 news has been told that new phone stock will be available starting at 3PM ET (Noon PT) -- for US customers only. We've also heard rumors that customers will be limited to ordering up to two phones each, but at these prices, there's likely to be plenty of online traffic jostling for this 4.7-inch slab.

 Update: As of 3:08PM ET, it looks as if the Nexus 4 is sold out. These games are no fun, now are they?

 Update 2: Google has just posted this update: "Google Play is currently experiencing very high traffic. Nexus 4 is not sold out and will still be available for purchase. Please try again shortly. Thank you for your patience." So, keep trying, we wish you luck, and let us know how you get on in comments!
