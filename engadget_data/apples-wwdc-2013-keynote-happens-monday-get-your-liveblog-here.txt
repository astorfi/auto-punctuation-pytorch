It's sure looking like we'll be getting ourselves a seventh version of iOS come Monday morning, but we'd guess Apple has some other surprises in store for the keynote that will kick off WWDC 2013. New laptops? Probably. An updated desktop operating system? Possibly. A television? Unlikely, but hey, anything can happen. We'll be there to help you find out, liveblogging the keynote from start to finish and bringing you all the news as it happens. We'll also be doing a live, streaming broadcast before the keynote to whet your appetite and get you up to speed on what to expect from the day's Apple news. After the event we'll be streaming live again, to give you a video rundown of all the news -- and maybe an early look at the day's new products. You can find the link to the liveblog and the time to click it right here:
