The news first leaked out about this a couple of months ago, but someone who claims to have actually played with a
prototype of the fourth-generation iPod which is due out sometime soon says that you won't be able to actually watch
videos on its color screen (just look at digital photos), but that you will be able to connect it up to a TV via its
dock and use that to watch video clips stored on its hard drive. Why you couldn't just watch those clips on the actual
screen of the iPod itself is beyond us, except that perhaps Steve Jobs wants to prove a point about how video shouldn't
be watched on a small screen. The 4G iPod is also supposed to use Apple's new Home on iPod software which let's you
store your Mac's home directory on your iPod and then access it from any Home on iPod-enabled Mac.
