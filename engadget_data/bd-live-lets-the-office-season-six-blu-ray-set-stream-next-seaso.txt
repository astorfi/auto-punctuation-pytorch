 
Universal's list of special features for The Office: Season Six Blu-ray boxed set is pretty standard for its releases -- iPhone remote control, digital shorts, blooper reel etc. -- with the exception of one all-new feature. This time around, when season 7 episodes air on NBC, afterwards users with these discs can stream them, in HD, through their Blu-players via BD-Live. According to the press release users will have access to "the latest five episodes" but no word on exactly how long the window between them airing on TV and showing up online will be. We'll keep our DVR queue, but if these episodes are truly high quality and commercial free, it's at least a convenient bonus. Perhaps if they bumped it up to allow viewing before the episodes air, then Universal could be onto something, press release and trailer follow after the break.
