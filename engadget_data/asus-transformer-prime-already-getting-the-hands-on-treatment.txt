Nonetheless, here's the first hands-on (that we've seen anyway) of an engineering model of the pioneering tablet. According to Mr. Henrique Martin over at ZTOP, the Prime's big standouts are sound quality and speed (no real surprise there). He's also given us a glimpse at a couple of software updates courtesy of ASUS. It's not the most in-depth first look we've ever seen, but we'll take it.
