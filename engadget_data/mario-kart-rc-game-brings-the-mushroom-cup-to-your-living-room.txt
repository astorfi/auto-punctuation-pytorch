In addition to the usual remote controlled shenanigans, these guys have the ability to "shoot" virtual shells and bananas at other cars; power-ups are indicated on the controller via LEDs; and cars contain infrared sensors so you know when you've been hit with a weapon (which causes you to rumble and slow down) Cars are available from Amazon Japan to the tune of Â¥2,730 (around $30) each.
