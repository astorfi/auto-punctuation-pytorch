That makesTosh the first second (Sony's BDZ-S77 Blu-ray player andrecorder has been on sale in Japan for a few years) next-gen optical format to hit the shelvesÂ  -- a fullfour-months ahead of Sony's BDP-S1 Blu-rayplayer launch in July. Apparently, the HD-XA1 sports an MSRP of 100,000 yen ($940) and if purchased before 27April, comes bundled with HD DVD copies of Resident Evil and the Japanese movie Moonlight Jellyfish -- the lower-endHD-A1 does not seem to be available, yet. Tosh threw us an offiicial launch date of April for the US with the HD-XA1tagged for $799 retail while the HD-A1 comes in at a blue-light special price of $499. And just for kix, Tosh alsomentioned that those HDDVD-equipped PCs should drop sometime between April and June as well. We'll see, let's just get those players outthe door first, and some flix too, please to make the purchase really worthwhile.[Via Akihabara News]
