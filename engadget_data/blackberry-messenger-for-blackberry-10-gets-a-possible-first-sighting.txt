As long as N4BB's details prove legitimate, the centerpiece of the app will be its theming: owners can customize the chat bubbles and backdrops to fit their finicky ways. Of course, this being an efficiency-obsessed RIM, the theming should also be integral to keeping power consumption to a minimum: the darker the colors, the less energy a BBM conversation demands from a future BlackBerry's big OLED screen. We don't know whether any changes will prove more than skin deep, although the switch to the QNX-based OS might prove enough at first. We'll know everything soon enough should of a September release for the first phone be more than just a feverish dream.
