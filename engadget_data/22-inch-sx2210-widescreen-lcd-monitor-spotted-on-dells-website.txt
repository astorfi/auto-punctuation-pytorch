A product page and online manual for the widescreen LCD have surfaced on the company's site, and here's what we know so far: it's got 1080p resolution, a 2.0 megapixel embedded webcam, 1000:1 dynamic contrast ratio, 2 millisecond response time, 160 degrees horizontal / 170 degrees vertical viewing angles, and 300 cd/mÂ² brightness. Unfortunately, mum's the word on pricing or availability, but with an estimated March 19th launch for the new XPS, our fingers are crossed for a double feature.[Thanks, Tin!]Read - Dell.com listingRead - Product manual (PDF file)
