The first comes from Colorado-based photographer Louis Psihoyos, who claims that Apple ripped off his image of a wall of videos (seen above) in its imagery for the Apple TV. According to Psihoyos' attorney, Apple had actually been negotiating with the photographer for the rights to use the image but backed out of the deal and went ahead and used the imagery without permission. The second, slightly more tangential suit comes from songwriters James Gangwer and Tommy Dunbar, who are claiming that Avril Lavigne's song "Girlfriend" is a bit too similar to their song, "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" (no relation to The Ramones song of the same name). Apple gets roped in here for selling the song on iTunes, which the duo says makes them "guilty of allowing the infringement to continue." According to AppleInsider, both suits are still awaiting their first day in court.
