We put the new device next to our trusty old iPhone 3G to get a feel just how different the screens look with twice the pixel density and shot a little pseudo-macro video. There's a marked difference in the screens, even side-by-side with the EVO 4G, and we found that even from a distance we were able to read bodies of text we'd previously had to squint to discern on our classic iPhones. Hard to capture, it really is something you have to see first-hand... but until you get that chance, live vicariously through us after the break.
