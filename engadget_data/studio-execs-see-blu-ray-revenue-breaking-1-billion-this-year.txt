During the Home Entertainment Summit in Los Angeles, presidents at Warner Home Video, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, Lionsgate, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and Universal Studios Home Entertainment all agreed that the $1 billion mark would be surpassed this year, while Paramount Home Entertainment president Kelly Avery maintained that $750 million was a more realistic figure. Notably, the bigwigs did admit that the growing popularity of digital downloads could eat into profits, but even we'd agree that BD is probably safe from too much erosion in the short-term.[Image courtesy of Blu-ray]
