According to the clever folks at Audio Junkies, if you head over to the "accessories" branch of the Dell site and follow their specific browsing instructions (which include but are not limited to adding a pink and black Zune to your cart), you should find yourself in near-possession of an alarmingly affordable Microsoft music player. The AJ crew are even kind enough to suggest using PayPal for an additional 10 percent off, just in case the price cut wasn't deep enough for you. So, if you're looking for a bargain today, you might want to quickly read the step-by-step and then motor in Dell's direction, because this won't last for long.Update - Well friends, all good things must come to an end, especially when they're at the expense of large corporations -- and this good thing has ended. If you made it in under that cut, congratulations. If not, there's always next time...
