 

Details are about as scant as can be, and The Digital Reader claims the entire announcement was a mistake, but PocketBook USA just outed what could be the very first Mirasol e-reader in a CES 2011 press release. In addition to the newish PocketBook Pro e-readers spotted at IFA 2010, the company will apparently showcase a brand-new model with one of Qualcomm's transflective color screens, and to commemorate the long-awaited occasion it's tentatively christening the reader "Mirasol," too. Early whispers suggest the device cost a bundle and won't have a fast enough refresh rate (12fps) for video speeds, but we'll find out the truth of the matter come the first week of January. PR after the break.
