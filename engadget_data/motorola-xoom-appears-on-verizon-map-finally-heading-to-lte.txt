The Moto Xoom recently appeared on Verizon's Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) system, which means the device will likely become available later this summer. Unfortunately, MAP doesn't include any pricing information for the tablet, and there's no official word regarding availability, but current 3G Xoom owners should still be able to upgrade free of charge with a one-week turnaround via FedEx. We'll be curious to see how LTE affects battery life, considering some of VZW's other high-speed devices haven't fared so well, but we are willing to compromise ever so slightly in exchange for that lightening-fast 4G data.
