According to the paper, Amazon will officially take the wraps of the device sometime next month, with it to be priced between $400 and $500. As previously rumored, the Times is also reporting that the Kindle will let you wirelessly download e-books directly to the device from Amazon's e-book store, with a few offerings (like reference books) said to be included for free. The Times also apparently spoke to a few people "familiar with the Kindle," some of whom said that using the device's web browser was a "poor experience," with others also lamenting Amazon's choice to use a proprietary e-book format. From the sound of it, publishing execs are also pinning quite a bit of hope on Amazon and its device, with one even going so far as to tell the Times that "if these guys can't make it work, I see no hope."[Via CNET News.com, thanks Brian M]
