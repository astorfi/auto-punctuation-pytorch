Turns out he didn't just get a signed Halo 3 care package. Even more swag arrived this week, including (among other things) an Xbox 360 with signatures from the 360 team and Bungie, and even Bill G himself. Yeah, that Bill G. And we can tell you exactly how damned hard it is to get the man to autograph stuff, the last few times we saw him we asked him sign our chests -- no dice. The G-man's infamous signature after the break. Us? We're closing the book on this one -- well played, Microsoft.
