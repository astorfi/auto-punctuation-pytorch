 Apple has been on a roll for, well, almost as long as we can remember. Basically since the debut of the iMac, the company has been riding a rocket ship back from the brink of irrelevance. The iPod, iPhone and iPad have all led it to post record quarter, after record quarter, after record quarter. Now we're in the second quarter of financial year 2013 and it doesn't appear to be slowing down much. The company posted $43.6 billion in revenue during the quarter and net itself a handsome profit of $9.5 billion. While those numbers do represent the slowest rate of growth Cupertino has seen in years, it's hardly the fall from grace that some analysts were predicting. Compared to the same time last year, revenues are up from $39.2 billion though net income has dropped from the Q2 2012 mark of $11.6 billion. Still, the company managed to move more iPhones and iPads than it did during that quarter, and the drop from Q1's holiday-boosted numbers isn't particularly alarming. In total it moved 19.5 million iPads and 37.4 million iPhones during the three months ending on March 30th, 2013. In Q1 those numbers were an admittedly more impressive 22.9 million and 47.8 million, respectively. But, compared to Q2 of 2012, things are still looking up from the 35.1 million iPhones and 11.8 million iPads shipped.
 Things are a little less rosy around its non-iOS departments, but we'd hardly say the company was in dire straits. Mac sales were more or less flat both sequentially and year-over-year, falling just under four million units. Meanwhile, the iPod continued its steady decline, moving only 5.6 million units. That's not only more than a 50 percent drop from last quarter, but a 27 percent drop from the same period last year. The biggest contributor to Apple's revenue stream continues to be the iPhone, but the iPad is gaining fast and income from iTunes and its other software offerings continues to grow at an impressive rate.

 While the first year-over-year drop in profits in almost a decade might give some investors pause, there's little cause for concern for the future of the company. Cupertino's healthy war chest now sits at $145 billion in cash, up from the $121 billion and change it had at the end of Q4 2012. We'll be listening in to the conference call at 5 PM and we'll update with any juicy tidbits after the break.



 5:05 Tim Cook, acknowledged that growth and margins have decreased. Though, he defended Apple's performance saying that revenue numbers were still equal to that of five Fortune 500 companies combined.

 5:06 Cook also said that the continued drop in stock price was also frustrating, but said that much of that was due to factors beyond its control such as exchange rates and supply costs.

 5:07 He also briefly teased that there would be new hardware and software products and product categories to come in 2013... though, that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.

 5:10 Apple will more than double its capital return program, mostly through stock repurchases.

 5:12 CFO Peter Oppenheimer is on the horn now, talking up the company's performance and record revenues for the March quarter. The iTunes division also had its best quarter ever.

 5:13 Peter is talking up the iPhone's growth specifically in the enterprise market, highlighting moves at companies like Cisco.

 5:15 iPad mini sales grew "substantially" according to Peter (though he neglected to specify how much). Most of those sales were to first time iPad customers.

 5:17 Despite the continued decline in iPod sales, Peter says it's still the most popular PMP in most countries it tracks.

 5:19 iTunes saw record revenues in all categories, which has grown 28 percent year-over-year. And app downloads have topped 45 billion (up 5 billion since January), while iCloud has reached 300 million users.

 5:21 Peter also touted iOS's lead over Android in the enterprise markets, where one firm found that it accounted for 77 percent of business activations. He also took the opportunity to take a pot shot at Google's platform for its exposure to malware.

 5:23 In another round of self-congratulation, Peter cited a study that found that the iPad accounted for 82 percent of tablet-based web traffic.

 5:28 Peter says to expect between $33.5 billion and $35.5 billion in revenue during the next quarter, which is inline with what the company pulled in the same time last year.

 5:33 In response to a question about Apple potentially hitting a wall in developing nations, such as China, Tim says that the company enjoyed its best quarter ever in the country. He said that some of the disconnect in the numbers is attributable to timing issues, including the launch of iPhone 5. But said that the unusually large number of first time smartphone buyers means its a market ripe for growth, especially with the continued price drop of the iPhone 4.

 5:35 Peter says that he doesn't believe the competitive landscape has changed much in the smartphone field, just the names have. Now, instead of RIM (BlackBerry), the company's biggest hardware competitor is Samsung. Obviously, he believes that Apple still has the best product on the market.

 5:37 Tim was asked to be more specific about the timing of product releases. Unfortunately he declined to clarify beyond the fact that exciting new announcements would be coming during "the fall."

 5:51 Tim says that while "some customers value screen size," some customers value other factors such as color saturation, resolution and battery life. Not only that, but he feels its competitors have made significant trade offs in the decision to build larger displays. And as long as those trade offs are necessary, Apple will not ship a handset with a larger screen. Guess that means you shouldn't expect an iPhone Note in "the fall."

 5:56 Mac sales are down two percent, but Tim doesn't think its because the iPad is cannibalizing sales. Instead he cites the extremely weak PC market, as being the main culprit. He believes that there may be some people opting to pick up an iPad instead of a Mac Book, but mostly he thinks the drop off is due to customers extending their upgrade cycles.

 6:03 That's it folks. Call's over.
