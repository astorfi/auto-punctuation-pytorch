We tend to get kind of excited when Ricoh's got a new camera
out, but their 8-megapixel Caplio GX8 doesn't look like much of a standout besides that massive pixel count. The
1.3-second startup is a bit slow for our tastes, and the 3x optical zoom is a little disappointing for a Ricoh, and its
only got a 1.8-inch display, so its not much of an overachiever over its older
Caplio GX brother. But hey, it's got a hot shoe, up-close
flash mode so your macro pictures don't look jacked, and an SD port that can handle continuous 1.7-second interval
shooting until your card's all filled up, so it ain't all hurt.
