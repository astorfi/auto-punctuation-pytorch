But, see, this Japanese site did it on video, and we have to tell you it's extremely graphic and wonderful. And considering the fact that it takes two guys cumulatively nearly fifteen minutes to oh so ceremoniously pull this bad boy apart, it's really no wonder Sony's monster of a console will set you back a half a grand (or more).P.S. -Be sure to hit up part three, that heat sink is one of the most elaborate and impressive we've ever seen.[Thanks, Gustavo]Watch - part 2Watch - part 3Watch - part 4
