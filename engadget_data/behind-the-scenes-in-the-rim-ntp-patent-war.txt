 If you thought theBlackberry patent battle between RIM and NTP was just a fight between a successful wireless company and a greedy patentfarmer, this lengthy article from the Toronto Globe and Mail may be an eye-opener. It's the story of the late TomCampana, a failed wireless messaging entrepreneur, who founded NTP to protect his patents, which were all he had leftafter his business collapsed. It's enough to almost make you root for NTP, oddball patents and all.[Via Slashdot]
