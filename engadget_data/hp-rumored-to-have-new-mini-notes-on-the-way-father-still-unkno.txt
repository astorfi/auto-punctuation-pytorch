According to undisclosed sources cited by the always questionable DigiTimes, Hewlett-Packard is toying with the idea of bringing a few new infants to market in the Mini-note line. If all goes to plan, a WWAN-enabled Mini-note 2150 (13.3-inch, presumably) will hit the scene in early June. For what it's worth, a new 11.6-inch model is also mentioned, and as expected, the whole crew (however large) is apt to arrive with Intel Atom's within. Guess we'll just have to wait and see, folks.
