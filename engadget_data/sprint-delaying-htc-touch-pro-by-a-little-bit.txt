 
Bad news, Sprint users. That HTC Touch Pro you've probably been waiting for won't be ready for your soft, delicate hands on Sunday. According to an undisclosed contact at the carrier, the outfit is expected to "slightly delay [the] launch of the Touch Pro by HTC to ensure it has adequate inventory in all channels before making the device commercially available." If you're looking for specifics, we're told that consumers can expect the handset "in select national retailers by the end of the month and then in all Sprint sales channels (including online at www.sprint.com and Sprint stores) by early November." It's not that next month is really that far away, it's just that next month isn't on Sunday. Bugger.
