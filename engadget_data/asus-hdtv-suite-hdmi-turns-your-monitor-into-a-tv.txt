The box accepts a host of inputs from HDMI to coax, converts, finesses and upscales the signal up to 1080p, and outputs over DVI or VGA, turning your old display into a viable television. The multiple inputs and TV tuner support PIP, and there's also a bundled remote to control the on-screen menus, completing the TV makeover. Sadly, there's no word on price, but PAL and NTSC support hints that we might see this box hit our fair shores -- looks like it's time for a monitor upgrade, eh?[Via PCLaunches]
