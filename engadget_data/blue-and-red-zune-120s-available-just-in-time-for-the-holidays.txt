The folks up in Redmond have just made blue and red versions of the socializing little PMP available on its Zune Originals site. Prices start at $249, and the company suggests placing orders by the 19th to ensure delivery by Christmas Eve. Sure, It may not be a Gears of War 2 special-edition, but it's definitely an alternative to black. So if you've been looking for something to give that special someone -- and nothing on our guide matches your style -- be sure to hit Microsoft's site to check out all your options.[Via zunerama]
