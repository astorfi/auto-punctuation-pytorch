 
For the acronym-challenged, Audi is getting serious about its Multi Media Interface. The automaker's present system is widely regarded as the best of the best already, but it's staying one step ahead of itself with the revamped version prepped for the A8 luxury sedan. Within the whip, you'll find a 7-inch LCD with an 800 x 480 resolution alongside a DVD drive, 40GB internal hard drive, Dolby Digital 5.1 support, optional analog / digital TV tuner, Bluetooth, twin CPUs (800MHz and 500MHz), NVIDIA graphics for "genuine 3D maps" and an optional (but necessary, really) Audi Music Interface for connecting your favorite PMP. For those uninterested in the A8 (but suddenly obsessed with this new MMI), hang tight -- it will be hitting other Audi vehicles here soon.
