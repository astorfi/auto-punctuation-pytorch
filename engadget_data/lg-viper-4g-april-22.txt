   Pre-orders of Sprint's first LTE-capable device, the LG Viper 4G, begin tomorrow. The Now Network is keeping quiet on an official release date for the time being, but that isn't stopping the carrier from sharing a few crucial nuggets of information with its employees first. We got our hands on a screenshot apparently informing Sprint's forces that the device will be all yours for the buying on April 22nd, through your choice of retail sales channels and online stores. No new details are revealed otherwise, and we still don't know exactly when the LTE service itself will go live, but we're definitely seeing a light at the end of this tunnel.  [Thanks, anonymous]
