Branded as the CRVD, there's really nothing new inside the slightly slimmer case, but the 42.8-inch, 45-pound screen is still eye-popping in person, with a 2880 x 900 resolution, .36mm pixel pitch, and sub-.02ms response time. Bad news? It'll set you back $6,499 when it ships in April. Pics in the gallery, video after the break.
