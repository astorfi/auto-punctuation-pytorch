It's announced that it will end support of the Gmail app for BlackBerry phones on November 22nd. Those that have the app installed will be able to continue using it indefinitely, but it will no longer be supported by Google or available for download after the cut-off date (so you might want to grab it now if you don't already have it). In its place, Google is directing BlackBerry users to the mobile web app accessible through the browser, and it notes that it will "continue investing in this area."
