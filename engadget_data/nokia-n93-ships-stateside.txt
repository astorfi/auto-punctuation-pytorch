Nonetheless, Nokia USA is looking to see if it can't push a couple of the 3.2-megapixel video cameras (that just happen to have a phone built in) out the door alongside the E70. At $700 unlocked, S60 3rd Edition dominance isn't cheap, but the N93 fits the bill when you absolutely, positively must have the biggest flip phone in the room -- just be prepared to come up a bit short on reception, seeing how it lacks GSM 850.[Thanks, Scott]
