Vizio's latest 42-inch plasma, which certainly looked a-okay on paper for the price, recently hit the test bench over at CNET, and while the overall package was deemed enough to "satisfy casual viewers," those with even a single videophile gene in 'em should be wary. The unit managed to snag an extremely rare 6.0 out of 10 rating, with "highly inaccurate green primary color and poor grayscale tracking" as the two biggest knocks. Granted, reviewers did appreciate the rock-bottom price, respectably array of inputs and the "relatively clean image," but at the end of the day, you can only expect so much from a sub-$1,000 42-inch PDP. Give the full review a look and determine if it's sufficient for your wants needs.
