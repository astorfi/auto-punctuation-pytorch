 Sending commands to a Tesla Model S via a native smartphone app is already old hat for iPhone users who have one of Musk and Co.'s electric chariots, but Android users are just now getting their first crack at a dedicated app. Google Play has finally been graced with a beta version of the software, packing the look and features of its iOS counterpart. Armed with the application, Model S owners can remotely control charging, keep tabs on the car's battery level, adjust the cabin's climate, find and track the auto on a map, trigger door locks and more. Regarding bugs in the beta, Tesla warns that some UI glitches are on its radar. Jab the bordering source link for the download.
