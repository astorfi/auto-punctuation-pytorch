No,it's not because you're a squirrelwatcher (not that there's anything wrong with that). It's because of Acorn Computers,the pioneering manufacturer of the late 70s and early 80s, which quit the computer business in the 90s. Now, accordingto reports, Acorn is set to be reborn as notebook vendor. The revived Acorn will launch next week with four laptops,ranging from a 12-incher to one with a 17-inch display. Rather than running Acorn's old RISC OS, however, the new boxeswill be fairly convention Windows XP laptops, and will come bundled with Star Office.
