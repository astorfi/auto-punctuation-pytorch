Albertsons is taking this whole self-checkout thing to the next level at a few of their supermarkets in Dallas and
is just giving customers handheld price scanners they can use to ring themselves up as they go along. The scanners also
give you a running tally of how much you're spending, so you can make sure you don't go over your budget. If you change
your mind you just rescan it and press the minus key on the scanner, and once you're ready to pay you just go to a cash
register, scan a barcode on it, and then pay as you would normally.
