We had heard this rumor on the internets a little while ago, and now it looks like Swatch is really going
to come out with a SPOT watch (SPOT, of course, being Microsoft's Smart Personal Object Technology that uses FM radio
signals to send data to watches, like news, stocks, instant messages, etc.). You've gotta hand it to Microsoft, they've
manged to bag Swatch, Tissot Suunto and Fossil; not a bad line up for watches (place your bets
now on which watch makers will drop out next year). Hopefully Swatch will pump out some cool designs and get the costs
down more.


 The press release says "The traditional Swatch plastic case comes in a new chunky design and an extra-large size". Hey
fellas, nothing sounds good when you call it chunky, really. Girthy? Now that's hot.


 It'll cost $150 which isn't that bad for a SPOT watch, but you still need to pay the service fee for MSN Directâ€”that
said, looks like Swatch does include some free content out the box, called "Swatch City".
