Last we heard of Polaroid's Socialmatic camera, which promises to bring back instant prints with a modern flair, it was bound for store shelves in the first quarter of 2014. Here at CES, the firm's announced that the hardware is cruising for a fall release now that it's finalized the necessary legal agreements to make it a reality. For those in need of a refresher, the device runs Android to make sharing images a snap and packs a 14-megapixel cam on its front, a 2-megapixel rear-facing sensor, 4GB of storage with expansion via microSD, a 4.5-inch touchscreen and built-in WiFi. Zink's ink-free paper will do the heavy lifting when it comes to printing photos, so any vintage film can stay stowed in your closet. Polaroid's Socialmatic shooter is out in the wilds of the CES floor, so stay tuned for a hands-on.
