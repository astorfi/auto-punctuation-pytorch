The social giant's new Buy button (and associated e-commerce infrastructure) lets you make a purchase directly on the site. Once you click the button, which is currently being tested with select small business partners in the US, a pop-up will prompt you to confirm payment and shipping info, then complete the purchase, all without leaving Facebook. The tool is only available on select merchants' pages for the time being, including Modify Watches seen in the example above, though it could roll out to more companies if this trial is deemed a success.
