We're definitely not launching a "Sprayables" section or anything, but after Monday's post about that dubious
PhotoBlocker spray which is supposed to be
able to help you avoid getting caught by traffic cameras we couldn't help but indulge ourselves with another story
about dodgy sprays. This one's the Envelope X-Ray Spray, which is supposed to let you spy on other people's mail (with
the permission of the addressee, of course). You spray it on and it's supposed to make the envelope temporarily
translucent for about 30 seconds before it goes back to its original state without any indication that you'd done any
snooping (sureâ€¦and that janky illustration at right just seals the deal).
