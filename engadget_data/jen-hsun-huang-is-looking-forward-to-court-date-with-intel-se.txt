The Tegrasaurus Rex has taken a recent interview with Fortune magazine as an opportunity to eloquently lay out his side's case in the epic cross-licensing dispute between NVIDIA and Intel, and to let us all know that he sees "no reason" to settle with the Atom-making giant. Describing Intel's argumentation as "completely nonsense," NVIDIA's fearless leader tell us that he's eagerly anticipating the court clash scheduled for later this year. We can't yet confirm whether or not he finished it off with a "bring your popcorn" instruction, but all his recorded words await in video form just after the break.
