As a group effort between inventor Lucien Gambarota, Wharton grad and entrepreneur Doug Woodring, and California Fitness, "Powered by YOU" will offer exercisers the chance to use their own energy to power lighting fixtures, with excess energy to be stored in batteries. The 13 step, cycling, and cross-training machines will be soon be rigged to encourage members to reduce CO2 emissions as well as their waistlines. According to California Fitness president Steve Clinefelter, someone running an hour each day on a machine can generate 18.2 kilowatts of electricity and prevent 4,380 liters of CO2 from being released each year. It's hard enough battling the bulge on your own, so we're glad to see that these explorations in alternative energy can provide some extra motivation for living a healthy lifestyle. We, on the other hand, will continue to remain seated for the rest of our lives. [Via Inhabitat]
