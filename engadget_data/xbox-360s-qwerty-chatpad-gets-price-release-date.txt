Microsoft's Chatpad (as it's officially dubbed) will be part of the Xbox 360 Messenger Kit, which will also include a separate Xbox 360 headset. The two-piece bundle will run users a modest $29.99, which isn't appalling, but it is a tad unfair that a standalone unit (apparently) won't be offered at a lower price point for those who wish to sidestep the headset. Nevertheless, interested parties can mark September 4th down as the date to remember.[Via Xbox360Fanboy]
