That iQ2 HD set-top box is apparently right on schedule, with company bigwig Kim Williams stating that he was "very confident" that customers would be able to use said unit to access the looming HD+ service "well before June 30." Also of note, ongoing technical trials have been going quite well, with the last of the quirks reportedly ironed out just last week. Mr. Williams also confirmed that Foxtel's immediate plan after the iQ2 launch was to "deliver high-bit-rate, high-contention video (HD channels and HD VOD)," but sadly, he failed to mention specifics.
