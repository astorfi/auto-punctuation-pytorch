Between The Avengers, X-Men and the 900th Spider-man reboot, Marvel's feeling the movie love. The company's also doing all right on the TV front, thanks to the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. The next step? Netflix, obviously. You can already find a number of the publisher's superheroes over on the streaming service, and now its parent company, Disney, is looking for something a bit more original. All parties are no doubt hoping we've got that dreadful Affleck fiasco out of our collective consciousness long enough to give a new Daredevil series a shot. Also on the docket are bits starring Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage (woo!). The deal includes a "minimum of four thirteen episode series" and a Defenders mini-series.
