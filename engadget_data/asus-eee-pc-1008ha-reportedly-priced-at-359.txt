Reportedly, the base price will hover around Â£359 ($518), but again, we're not completely getting our hearts set on that 'til we hear something from the mouth of ASUS (or a legitimate distributor). Honestly though, that price sounds about right; as beautiful as it is, we were pretty underwhelmed by its very netbook-like performance during our brief time with it.[Via Electricpig]
