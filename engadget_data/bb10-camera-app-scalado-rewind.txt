 Impressed by the new camera tech on display in BB10? You're not alone. But did the folks at RIM have some help with the new "timeline lens" feature? Well, grab your salt shaker. If you recall, software that allows you to change the faces of those pictured via additional pre- and post-shot frames popped up in Scalado's Rewind last year. The ring UI that allows the user to navigate the extra frames from its border is quite similar to the functionality of BB10's editing feature. We've reached out to Scalado for further details on the matter and we're eager to hear its response. But until that happens, hit the video just past the break for a closer look at Rewind in action.

 Update: Our pals over at TechCrunch posted an official statement from RIM's Senior Manager of Public Relations Patti McKague on the matter. Our instincts were correct, as the two companies have been in cahoots over the BB10 camera app. Here's the full quote on the licensed tech:

  RIM has been working with Scalado on camera technology and has licensed some of the Scalado technology for the BlackBerry 10 platform. As shown during the BlackBerry World Keynote, RIM is planning a unique implementation of the technology on BlackBerry 10 to provide an incredible user experience, allowing for more customization by the user and enabling them to easily capture and share their perfect moments.
