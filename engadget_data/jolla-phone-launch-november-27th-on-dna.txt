We knew Finnish carrier DNA would be the first to launch the Sailfish-powered Jolla phone, and thanks to a tweet from Jolla HQ we now know that it will launch in Helsinki on November 27th. Unfortunately, that's about all we have to work with in terms of availability info -- the company hasn't said when the device will make its way to other markets. It has, however, shared that the first Jolla phone will be available both on and off contract and with "no SIM lock." Judging by Jolla's responses to fans on Twitter, it looks like those who placed pre-orders could also be getting the handset soon. Any other questions? The Finnish company is dutifully responding to tweets at the moment, so have at it.
