This one weighs in at 3.6 pounds and has a 1280 x 800 pixel, 12.1-inch widescreen active digitizer display, an Intel Core 2 Duo ULV processor, 100GB hard drive, up to 4GB of DDR2 SDRAM, Bluetooth 2.0, 802.11 a/b/g/draft-n, optional EV-DO or HSDPA module, and an ExpressCard/54 slot. OS options include Vista, XP, and FreeDOS.
