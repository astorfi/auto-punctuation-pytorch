 That MySpace and Yahoo integration wasn't theonly thing Helio rolled out for their user media services today; in addition to the leaned MySpace interface and customized Yahoo servicesportal, Helio users with the All-In Membership will get a slew of other things to keep them occupied whenconstantly fidgeting with the Kickflip's hinge.There's Helio On Top (H.O.T.) access, which is a simple 10-channel news and info aggregation feature, MMS picture andvideo messages, which can be sent up to 1MB per; free streaming video from major networks like MTV, Comedy Central,ABC, etc., $2.49 music video downloads (uh, what?), and of course those purchased, "gifted," or"begged" games, which are going for $5.99 to buy, or $0.99 to "rent" on your phone for a week.(The gifting and begging thing isn't only limited to games though, and can be applied to any purchasable content aswell.) Not a whole lot in there that we're super interested in, ourselves; but you know us, we're more the BluetoothDUN, A2DP, SlingPlayer, data overload types more prone to exploringmobile media on our own than holding a carrier's (or MVNO's) hand.
