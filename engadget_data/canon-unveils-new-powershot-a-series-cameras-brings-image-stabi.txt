  Thought Canon was done with the point-and-shoot updates after refreshing its ELPH lineup last month? Think again, as the company is updating its PowerShot A-Series shooters with six new models in a variety of colors. All the cameras pack a 16-megapixel sensor, 28mm wide angle lens and can take 720p video. First up is the A4000 IS, which brings image stabilization, 8X optical zoom and a 3-inch LCD for $200 later this month. The A3400 IS and A2400 IS make their debuts in March, and bring the same image stabilization as the 4000, but have a lesser 5X optical zoom. Additionally, the 3400 packs a 3-inch touchscreen LCD and costs $180, while the 2400 gets a smaller non-touchscreen 2.7-inch LCD and retails for $150. Meanwhile, the A2300 has the same specs as the 2400, minus the image stabilization, and will cost ten bucks less than its brother when it drops next month. Finally, the PowerShot A1300 and A810 each come with 5X optical zoom and a 2.7-inch LCD when they debut in April, with the A810 priced at $110 and the A1300 available for $120.
