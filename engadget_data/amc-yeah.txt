 
 In this post-DVD world, it can be tough to really enjoy a film without having a director talk on top of it. AMC's looking to fill in the void of contextual information left as many of us have moved from physical to streaming media, with the launch of Yeah! today at SXSW, an online streaming movie service featuring curated supplementary features for classic movies like Superman, Reservoir Dogs, Clerks and A Nightmare on Elm Street. The offering includes interviews with folks like Wes Craven and Richard Donner, facts about the films and quizzes -- there's 400 to 500 new pieces of content per film, according to AMC, which you can access "without obscuring the movie." Yeah! is available now in the source link below -- movies will run you $5 for a 48-hour rental. An iPad version of the service is hitting this summer.



 Update: We've added an interview with AMC Network's Lisa Judson, general manager of Yeah! You'll find it embedded below.
