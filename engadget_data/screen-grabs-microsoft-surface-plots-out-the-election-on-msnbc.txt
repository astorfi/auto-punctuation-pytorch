NBC News political director Chuck Todd will be the main handsman, using it to map out electoral votes and battleground states at first, but there are some other apps in the pipeline, according to Microsoft. Looks like the multitouch news wars have begun in full swing -- anyone taking bets on when the green screen gets totally replaced in the weather center?
