 It's back. After making a horrendous false start with the early promise of iPod touch support and the inclusion of the iPhone App in its Â£100 price tag, the TomTom Car Kit has returned to the Apple Store. In a big fat disclaimer, TomTom writes: The TomTom app for iPhone is not included with this TomTom Car Kit. The Car Kit dock is compatible with all iPhone models, but the TomTom app only works with iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G.We only see it in the UK store at the moment but it's likely to pop on your local store anytime now. Ships in 1-2 weeks.[Thanks, Joe W.]
