Key to its solution are so-called "self-assembled metal nanocrystals" which, when added to the flash manufacturing process, supposedly doubles the capacity of conventional chips. According to MIT's Technology Review, the crystals themselves are "grown" in a liquid solution and then spun onto silicon wafers -- not an entirely new process, but Nanosys has apparently come up with a chemical process that produces crystals that are more uniform in size and spacing than previous attempts by others. That's apparently been enough to attract the interest of Intel and Micron, who Nanosys says could be putting the technology to use as soon as 2009.
