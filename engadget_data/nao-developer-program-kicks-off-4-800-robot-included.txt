To do so, they'll have to sign up and quality for the just-launched Nao developer program, which costs â‚¬3,600 (or roughly $4,800) and will initially be limited to just 200 participants. That hefty price does naturally include the robot itself, along with a complete software suite, and "privileged access" to Aldebaran Robotics' source code. Interested? Hit up the link below for the complete details.
