 Based on this morning's leak, you already knew that LG's smartphone lineup was about to become more diversified, but now we're able to share concrete details of the Optimus F5 and F7, which will be unveiled at Mobile World Congress. As the naming scheme suggests, the Optimus F7 is the larger of the two with a 4.7-inch (312ppi) True HD IPS display, a dual-core 1.5GHz CPU, an 8-megapixel primary camera, 2GB RAM and a 2,540mAh battery. Meanwhile, the Optimus F5 will be targeted at those who prefer a more compact smartphone, as it wields a 4.3-inch (256ppi) IPS display, a dual-core 1.2GHz CPU, a 5-megapixel primary camera, 1GB RAM and a 2,150mAh battery.

 Common among both devices are Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean), support for LG's QSlide and Live Zooming software features, a 1.3-megapixel front-facing shooter, 8GB built-in storage, microSD support and LTE connectivity. The Optimus F5 will come to market first in Europe during the second quarter, which is to be followed by the Optimus F7 "in select markets."
