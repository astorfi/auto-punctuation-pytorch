We've got some fun charity stuff planned, but we didn't want to just pick one without asking you guys first. So we narrowed it down to our top eight charities, and we'll let you decide where our proceeds go this season. Thanks for voting!Update: Ok, it's off the pain page so it looks like Save Darfur is our charity this season! Thanks for the votes, and stay tuned for fun charity stuff.
