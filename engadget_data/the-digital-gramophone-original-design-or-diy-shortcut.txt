Designed by Yong Jieyu & Ama Xue Hong Bin, the Phonograph CD Player consists of a disassembled CD player with the laser positioned like a classic needle tracing a wax groove. While we like the idea of the exposed disc assembly, we imagine the sound to be fairly consistent with those early 19th century recordings. While the designers claim that their aim was to "analyze a product in its history and function and redesign it," we can't help but wonder if this isn't just a masked DIY gramophone kit available on Amazon.co.jp for years. Just sayin' is all. [Via Akihabara News]
