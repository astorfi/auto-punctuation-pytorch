Just in case you were curious to see what you'll have spindles of probably by this time next year, TDK's officially
started production of single and dual-layer single sided BD-Rs and BD-REs (which is just their nomenclature for
"BD-RWs"). They're apparently apt to hyping Durabis, the anti-scratch / smudge / dust coating on Blu-ray discs (even
though Durabis is standard for Blu-ray media), but no word on cost per disc. Just don't be surprised when it's, um, a
lot â€” you know the price we all pay for being an early adopter. Remember how much CD-Rs used to cost?
