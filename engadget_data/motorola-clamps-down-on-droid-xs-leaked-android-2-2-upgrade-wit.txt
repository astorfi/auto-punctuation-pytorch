We can't say whether it's just red tape or to protect customers from a EVO 4G-like non-final build, but for whatever reason Motorola's director of information security is asking sites like MyDroidWorld to remove the files ASAP. Given the company's recent history with the mod community, however, we imagine there's some sort of walled-garden reason behind it.
