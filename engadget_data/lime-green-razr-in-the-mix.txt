It looks like lime (or pistachio) green is up next, though it's still unclear if this one will even make it stateside. It should be noted that the color really is the only new "feature" we yet know of, but we're sure the hype will follow; new ways to spin the RAZR just keep coming, even with its successor inevitably on the horizon. We'll be interested to see which provider(s) add to their portfolio Moto's darling in yet another color.[Thanks, Ralf]
