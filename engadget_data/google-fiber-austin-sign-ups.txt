If you've been champing at the bit waiting for Google Fiber's Austin launch, today is your big day. Google is now taking sign-ups for gigabit internet access in the southern and southeastern parts of town. As in Kansas City, it'll cost $70 for data alone and $130 if you want TV on top. Other Austinites will get their chance in the future, Google says. Just be ready to act quickly if you're eligible -- there's a sign-up deadline for each qualifying neighborhood, so you risk missing out on Google's super-quick service if you're not careful.
