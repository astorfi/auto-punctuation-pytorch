Reader Andy scanned this pic from the November issue of XXL magazine that shows a green version of the SK3 from Lifted Research Group. No word on pricing (or a release date), but T-Mob charged a premium for those limited edition Sidekick II's, so expect this one to cost at least fifty bucks more than the regular version.[Thanks, Andy]
