 We've invited Myriad VP Olivier Bartholot back to our stage for a second year to talk about the company's products like iOS-based Android emulator Alien Dalvik. Join us after the break for a piece of the action.

 Update: Unfortunately Mr. Bartholot was unable to join us, but never fear, we had plenty to chat about.
