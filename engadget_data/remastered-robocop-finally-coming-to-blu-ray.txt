Reportedly, the remastered, unrated edition will land on October 9th for around $39 MSRP, but will strangely not include any bonus features. Nevertheless, the content has apparently been "authored in MPEG2" and will be delivered on a 25GB disc with DTS HD and French / Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital audio tracks. Here's to hoping this version makes it past reviewers, eh?[Via HighDefDigest]
