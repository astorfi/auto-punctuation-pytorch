The latest round of layoffs at the Sunnyvale-based chip maker amounts to 3% of its global workforce, and according to spokesman Michael Silverman, the "headcount reduction is part of the company's efforts to reduce [its] cost structure." The firings come a month to the day after a breakup was announced, and they'll affect every division of the company save for the manufacturing operations -- which are, in fact, precisely what's being spun off. Just another day in paradise, eh AMD?[Via MarketWatch]
