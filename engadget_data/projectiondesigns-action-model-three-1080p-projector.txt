Long as peeps keep releasing 1080p
projectors—the holy grail of HD home theater—we're gonna keep hitting 'em, alright. Latest on the block is
projectiondesign's Action! model three, a 7500:1 contrast ratio, 2500 lumen, DLP-based true HDTV monster, replete with
HDCP DVI, VGA, composite, component, S-video, Ethernet, and so on. We're not even going to ask what this thing costs,
but we have a feeling you could probably buy a cadre of lesser projectors for less.
