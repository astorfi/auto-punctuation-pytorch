It was so big, so dark, and so freaking expensive it was like a gadget from another time -- yet there it was, looking down at you from behind the counter at Babbage's. $649 in 1990? Yeah. Ouch. Anyway, people today can now experience that machine's greatness for a much lower price, with the PlayStation Network receiving 10 of the system's greatest hits, each selling for between $6.99 and $8.99. Yes, these games were already available on the Wii Virtual Console, but the PSN versions will support online competitive and co-operative play, which is truly worth getting excited about. All games will be hitting the PS3 on December 21, while Fatal Fury and Metal Slug will be hitting the PSP then as well. For other games, like Magician Lord and Super Sidekicks, you portable folks will just have to wait until January.
