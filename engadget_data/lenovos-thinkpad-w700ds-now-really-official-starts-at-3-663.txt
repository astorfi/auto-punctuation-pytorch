The dual screen beast is at long last being confirmed by Lenovo, offering up workstation performance along with a 17-inch primary display and a 10-inch secondary slide-out panel. Details about exact configurations are scant, but we are told that prospective buyers will be able to equip theirs with high-end Intel CPUs, optional RAID HDD / SSD setups, NVIDIA Quadro FX graphics, up to 8GB of DDR3 RAM, dual-link DVI / Display Port / VGA support, a 7-in-1 card reader, five USB ports, WiFi, optional WiMAX, a smartcard reader and a dual thermal solution to keep it from melting your legs and / or desk. Reportedly, the machine will be available today starting at $3,663, but as of now, it's still nowhere to be found on the firm's US website.
