 
Sparkle Labs -- an online DIY electronics kit maker filled with pep, cheer and other such disgustingly sweet things -- has just announced its new Papertronics kits. As the name suggests, these are paper toys with electronics inside them, with the kicker being that you have to construct your Spaceboy (above) or Aliengirl yourself, before activating them via contact with their "landers." Hey, it's not like you can be a gadget geek and not have an appreciation for the fine art of papercrafting. If your inner child still lives, you can check these out at the source link, and we'll just tell everyone you're buying them for your nephew or niece.
