We understand, so here's a way to satisfy those latent urges to own a helicopter on the cheap -- Brando is offering to exchange $39.90 of your blood money for a machine so simple that its protracted model name describes it almost in full. To complete the picture, you get a 3-channel IR controller, integrated gyroscope for balancing and a set of blinking LED lights on the sides for, you guessed it, nighttime flying. You should be warned though, the first functionality listed for this product is "decoration," so temper your expectations accordingly.[Thanks, Louie]
