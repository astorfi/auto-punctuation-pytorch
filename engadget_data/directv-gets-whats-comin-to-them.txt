 DIRECTV is one of the largest high-def provides in the world but alas, do they really provide true HD? Not really ever sense they turned turned down the bit rate as of 2004 and now provide what is called around the Internet boards as HD-Lite. [examples here]. This unsavory flavor of high-def is still a good picture but not everything it could be and finally, someone is taking action.  					Peter Cohen filed this lawsuit way back in November of '04 but it's finally seeing the light of justice thanks to a judges ruling against DIRECTV's request for arbitration. The stiff arm of justice will hopefully rule in favor of high-def lovers everywhere and we will keep you up to date as soon as we hear something.
