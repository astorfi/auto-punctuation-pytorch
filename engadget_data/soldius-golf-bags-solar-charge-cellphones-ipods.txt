 Because heaven forbid you miss a phone callduring your two to four hours on the course, Soldius has introduced a line of golf bags that feature solar panels forcharging cellphones and iPods. The Soldius comes with different tips for use with most popular phones, but the iPodadapter will cost you extra. Seems like the perfect addition to our game day must-haves along with the Segway GT golf cart, Quartz GyrosensorPutter with LCD, nanomaterial golf balls, andstupid talking Hook/Slice swing meter.The Soldius bags cost from $200 for what must be little more than a paper sack to $800 for luxurious, smartphone-worthyleather.[Via Cnet]
