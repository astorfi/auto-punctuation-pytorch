But if a $99 version of Windows 2003 Server with great image backup software, drop dead simple remote access, and mindless RAID, weren't enough to get you to check it out, perhaps the new Media Center features in Power Pack 2 will do the trick. Officially released tomorrow, Power Pack two will be installed via Windows Updates and among other things -- like remote access enhancements and backup fixes -- includes extra support for Windows Media Center. Now we're not exactly sure how this new functionality will compare to great 3rd party solutions like Recorded TV Manager, but we have our hopes up that this is a prelude to tuner support.
