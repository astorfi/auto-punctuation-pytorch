The best part sure isn't the 8-ports of USB 2.0 action, the Â¥5,980 (about $52) price tag, or even the fact that it weighs as much as a laptop at 5.18-pounds. No, the best part is "Fake Gold" engraved right up top to impress the ladies. Class man, real class. Oh, and be sure to check their pirate pitchman after the break... arrrg![Via Impress]
