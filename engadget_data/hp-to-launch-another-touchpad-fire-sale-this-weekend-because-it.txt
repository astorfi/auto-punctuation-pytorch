According to a release the company sent out to employees this week, the redux will kick off on December 11th at 7 PM, on HP's eBay Store. There, consumers will be able to get their hands on a refurbished 16GB or 32GB model for $99 and $149, respectively. They'll also have the chance to get a case, charging dock and wireless keyboard as part of a $79 bundle, though the sale isn't entirely lawless, with each buyer limited to a maximum of two Touchpads. Interested parties should get their clicking fingers on the ready -- before the British invade.

Update: The slates in question have curiously appeared on HP's eBay Store with their original $499 and $599 pricing. Still, there's roughly an hour to go before HP's self-imposed deadline.

Update 2: And it's live! Did you make it all the way through? Let us know in comments.

Update 3: Looks like they're gone. We're getting "Invalid item" errors on all four listings.
