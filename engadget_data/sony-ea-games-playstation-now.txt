Sony's game-streaming service, PlayStation Now, has taken big leaps since being introduced earlier this year. However, the platform still lacks a bit when it comes to the amount, and quality, of content it offers access to. Starting next month, though, PlayStation Now is adding some big games to its library, thanks to a new deal from Sony and EA. Bejeweled 3, Dead Space 3, Mass Effect 2, Mirror's Edge and NBA Jam On Fire Edition are all coming to the service on December 2nd, which is great news for those of you with a PS3, PS4, PS Vita, PS TV or a compatible Sony TV. You'll be able to rent any one of these for as little as $1 per day, although there will be other pricing tiers available -- it depends on how long you'd like to keep them.
