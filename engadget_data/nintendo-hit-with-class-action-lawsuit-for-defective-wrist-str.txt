       It's all fun and games until somebody busts out a class action lawsuit. We were all enjoying thwacking each other in the face and busting up our televisions so very much that it looks like nobody thought to start any profiteering on this whole Wiimote weak sauce wrist strap meme -- until now. Those clever cats over at Green Welling LLP slapped Nintendo with a lawsuit citing "Nintendo's failure to include a remote that is free from defects" as a "breach of Nintendo's own product warranty." Apparently the nefarious straps were engineering the whole thing, since GW LLP claims "Owners of the Nintendo Wii reported that when they used the Nintendo remote and wrist strap, as instructed by the material that accompanied the Wii console, the wrist strap broke and caused the remote to leave the user's hand." Given the fact that the basic premise of these claims is a tad bit off (we're fairly certain those straps have been breaking after the Wiimote leaves the hand) and that Green Welling's main demand from Nintendo is that they replace the straps (done and done), we can't see this lawsuit getting too terribly far, but we suppose we'll have to wait and find out.[Via Slashdot]
