 All those digital games you've purchased on your "Deluxe" 32GB Nintendo Wii U have been accruing virtual points, and now you can cash out those virtual points for some virtual currency, as Nintendo's "Deluxe Digital Promotion" website is now live. All you've gotta do is sign in with your Nintendo Network ID on this website, click through some terms of service agreement business, and you're in like Flynn. The breakdown of dollars to points is 1 to 10 -- a game that costs you $14.99, for instance, equates to 149 points. For every 500 points, you can cash out for $5 / £5 / €5, which spits out an activation code you can then apply directly on the Wii U's eShop. Might we suggest using those points for Little Inferno?

 As our superfriends at Joystiq point out, points won't collect for games downloaded through the original Wii Shop Channel (even when accessed via Wii U), nor on 3DS digital games, nor on season passes / digital subscriptions (such as Call of Duty Elite). Bummer! Of course, it seems likely that 3DS digital titles will eventually be added to that list when the handheld gets access to Nintendo Network IDs. Whether those points will retroactively apply is another question altogether; we're gonna go out on a limb here and call that possibility doubtful. Also, beware, the promotion is time-limited -- make sure to cash in your credits by March 2015. The promotion runs until December of 2014, and codes must be redeemed on the eShop by "the end of June 2015."
