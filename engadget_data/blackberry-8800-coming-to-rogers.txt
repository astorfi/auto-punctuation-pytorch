The fact that Rogers would offer the upcoming BlackBerry 8800 seemed like a foregone conclusion, and now we've got some proof in the form of a Rogers-branded spec label. Nothing unexpected here: 64MB of internal (expandable) storage, quadband GPRS / EDGE, GPS, and an MP3 player, with no mention of a camera. No word on a release date, but seeing how the packaging seems to be already prepared, it probably won't be much after the presumed 3GSM announcement next month that these things start filtering into stores.[Thanks, FeRbS and BroG]
