It features a 7-inch, 800 x 480 display for secondary information on the outside and a Voodoo designed water cooling loop on the inside to keep the fire down on up to 2x CPUs (up to 16 cores) and 4x GPUs. The system tops out with a pair of 3.2GHz Core 2 Extreme QX9770 processors, 8GB of 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM, and support for "next generation" NVIDIA and ATI graphics... at a price. Starting at around $7,000 and available exclusively to existing Voodoo customers at launch sometime later this year.
