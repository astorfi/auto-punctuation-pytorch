According to a blurb on Sea Launch's own website, the "mission is now on hold." Further reports clarify that an undisclosed "issue" is causing the holdup, and Sea Launch will be updating with information as its team investigates. Unfortunately, your guess is as good as ours as to when this bird will finally get airborne.[Thanks, Tig]Read - Sea Launch postpones DirecTV 11 satellite launchRead - Sea Launch's statement
