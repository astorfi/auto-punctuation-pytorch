 Although Sharp has already busted out 10- and 12-megapixel sensors for ultracompacts, the firm is toning it down a bit and making things even more compact with its latest 8.28-megapixel 1/2.5-inch CCD rendition. The company achieved the resolution "using the 1.75 μm x 1.75 μm pixel cell, which is claimed as is the industry's smallest class," and comes in at 60-percent of the volume of Sharp's previous model. Presumably hoping to cram these things into wafer-thin cameras of the future, it plans to start shipping the 10- x 10- x 3.5-millimeter sample packages later next week, while volume production of the ¥4,000 ($33) sensors are scheduled for April.
