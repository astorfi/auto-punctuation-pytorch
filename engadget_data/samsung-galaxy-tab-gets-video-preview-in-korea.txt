Android 2.2, WCDMA 3G, 802.11n WiFi, a 16:10 screen ratio, a front-facing camera "dedicated to video calling," SDHC memory expandability, and a DMB tuner for those TV-crazy Koreans are all listed on the spec sheet, but you'll be wanting to see the Galaxy Tab's UI in motion. It really looks silky smooth and should give the iPad cause for concern. Speaking of the iPad, there's a size comparison against Apple's slate and Samsung's own Galaxy S handset as well -- all yours after the break.

Update: Fast-loading video embedded after the break.
