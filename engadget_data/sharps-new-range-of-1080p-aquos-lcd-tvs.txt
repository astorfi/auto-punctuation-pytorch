Looks like Sharp's gotten around to updating their line of
Aquos LCD TVs, ho hum, right? But then you find out
they're all 1080p—every last one of 'em—and the 57-incher apparently even has a 4ms refresh rate. But when you find out
the cheapest one, the 37V 37-incher, goes for ¥546,000 (about $4,900 US), and the 65V 65-incher goes for ¥1,680,000
($15,000 US), that's when you return to the 1080p waiting game, hopes crushed that you'll be able to get a name-brand
panel affordably in the near future.
