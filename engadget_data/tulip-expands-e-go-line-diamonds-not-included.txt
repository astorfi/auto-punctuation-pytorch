No, Tulip hasn't lowered the price of the $355,000 E-go; the company has expanded theline to include a series with prices more accessible to mere mortals (though still higher than what you'd expect to paybased solely on the specs). At CeBIT, the company officially unveiled the full E-go line, which basically consists ofone $4,000 Turion based laptop with an 80GB drive, DVD burner and media features including a claimed seven-hour batterylife in DVD-player mode. The main selling point of the laptop, besides its early iBook-inspired shape, is theavailability of a dozen different skins, enabling you to customize your E-go with everything from faux zebra fur toreal leather. E-go's motto, displayed on the company's web site with no apparent irony: "It's all about theinside." If you really believe that, we somehow suspect you won't be buying a $4,000 zebra-fur, toilet-seat-shapedlaptop (though it does also come in basic black if you really can't resist).[Via PC World
