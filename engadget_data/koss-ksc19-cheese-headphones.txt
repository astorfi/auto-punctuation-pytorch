We're not quite sure who Koss is (or rather, was) marketing these
headphones to besides maybe Green Bay fans to wear with their foam cheesehead hats, but if you want a set of KSC19
Cheese headphones, it's gonna set you back 25 bones. We're half tempted to get a pair just for the can they come
packaged in, but we're probably going to hold out until they release a Jarlsberg version.


[Thanks, Mike]
