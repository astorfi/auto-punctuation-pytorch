See, Dell, you're not the only company getting bad publicity over spontaneously-combusting laptops -- everyone seems to be in on the fun. Read on for a close-up of the offending battery after it was ejected from the docked notebook...[Thanks, Stian]Update: SÃ¸lve Skrede, the owner of the battery shot us an email saying that his G4 battery actually was not one of the ones recalled! Curiouser and curiouser.
