 Humax's Freesat+ FOXSAT-HDR has been available for a few weeks now in the UK, but if you've been holding tight to your Â£299 in hopes of finding some reassurance, you've arrived at the right place. For UKers uninterested in signing up for a pay-TV pack from Sky or Virgin, Freesat is your only option for snagging broadcast HD. The kids over at Pocket-lint were able to take the 320GB HD DVR for a spin, and when the ride was over, everyone in the cart was all smiles. Boasting an impressive array of connections, a classy design, simple setup, intuitive EPG and gorgeous picture quality, there wasn't much left to hate. Even SD material was said to look just fine, with the only real gripe coming from the not-exactly-intuitive media hub functions. Reviewers didn't hesitate to hand over their wholehearted recommendation, though they did lament the lofty price tag. Maybe wait a few months and pray for a price drop? Decisions, decisions.
