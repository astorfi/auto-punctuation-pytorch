Both phones now appear on Sprint's website, accompanied by a smattering of pics and long list of tasty features for you to ponder over. The M1 music phone sports a two-megapixel camera (with auto-focus and flash), Bluetooth, 1GB of memory, and all the other musical niceties we suspected would grace this slim-ish device. The SPC-7000 hits with a 1.8-inch LCD, "durable, rugged design," swapable faceplates, T9 text input, and a rubber "Dura-Grip" in case you get a struck by the butterfingers. The M1 will run you $349.99 sans a contractual agreement, or $199.99 with, while the SPC-7000 only requires $179.99 without a contract, or a lowly $29.99 after inking in for two years.Read - Sanyo M1 on Sprint-Nextel; [Via SlashGear]Read - Sanyo SPC-7000 on Sprint-Nextel
