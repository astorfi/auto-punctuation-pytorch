Laser projected virtual keyboards? So 2004. These days, tech firms are dreaming up completely invisible typewriters, or at least Syntellia is. By marrying a Leap Motion sensor with its own Fleksy predictive keyboard, the company has created a system that seems to let you type on thin air -- with the aid of Fleksy's predictive text correction, of course. A brief teaser video of the project shows a pioneering air-typist hammering out "kalr tgw ltsp," which Fleksy deciphers as "make the leap." Syntellia's SXSW Interactive Accelerator preview of the project won't officially debut until tomorrow, but the impatient can check it out right now after the break.
