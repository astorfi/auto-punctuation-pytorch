While that distinction seems unlikely to stick for long, the camera is certainly tiny, measuring just 4.4 mm in diameter and 15 mm in length, with a bendable "snake" attached to it to keep you from losing it. Of course, you'll have to make do with a 320x240 resolution, but you will get your choice of standard or wide-angle lenses. No word on what it costs, but those willing to order 'em in bulk can apparently get in touch with Misumi for a quote.
