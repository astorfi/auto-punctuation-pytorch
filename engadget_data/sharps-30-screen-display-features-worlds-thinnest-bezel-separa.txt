Sharp's new LED backlit PN-V601 60-inch LCD monitor hopes to resolve this a bit with a 2.4-mm bezel width on the right-side and bottom and 4.1-mm bezel along the left-side and top. The result is a meager 6.5mm display separation when inserted into a 5x6 matrix of 30 adjoining LCDs as demonstrated above at the product launch. Check the impressive results in the video after the break, it's a little like watching the opening scene of The Dark Knight through razor-thin chickenwire. Ok, not really, but it's worth a look anyway.
