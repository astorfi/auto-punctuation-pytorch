 
There you go, folks. Google says it wants you always connected, now it's helping you do it. 100MB of free Verizon data, each month for 24 months, will be yours as a complimentary extra when buying a Chrome OS netbook. $9.99 will give you unlimited access for a single day and there are no contracts to fiddle with. Obviously, and sadly, this is a US-only hookup. If nothing else, this announcement provides some neat context to the joint net neutrality policy that Google and Verizon dished out back in August.
