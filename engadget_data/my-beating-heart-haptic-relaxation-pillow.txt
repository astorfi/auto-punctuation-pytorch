We've seen various devices that purport to use the rhythms of the heartbeat to
soothe infants and small animals, and now the creators of My Beating Heart hope to take that concept to frazzled,
harried adults. The colorful, $120 heart-shaped pillow doesn't just have a sound chip; it uses a rumble pack-style
haptic system so that you can feel the heart beat as you hold it. Or, in the words of the manufacturer, "the effect is
that as someone hugs the Heart for a long period, whether consciously or unconsciously, it feels like hugging a real
heartbeat." We're not quite sure about that, but we do have to give the developers props for making these by hand
(including hand-programming each unit's haptic controller) in the, er, heart of New York City.
