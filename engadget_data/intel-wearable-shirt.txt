The next biggest thing in wearables is apparently something that's already technically... wearable: A smart shirt. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich came to the Code Conference wearing a shirt laden with sensors capable of monitoring your health, such as heart rate and even emotion. These sensors can communicate with an app on your smartphone.



          
 
 
 The shirt, which should be coming out sometime this summer, contains a battery which isn't meant to be wet (though Krzanich insists you can take it out in the rain), so you'll just need to make sure you take it out before you put it in the washer. The company doesn't plan to make the actual shirts, but it's working on building the sensors embedded within the literal wearable. This is only part of Krzanich's vision, which includes "eyes, ears, wrist and torso," so this likely won't be the last we see of intriguing new use cases for wearable tech. No word on pricing or availability yet, but keep your shirt on -- we'll make sure to let you know as soon as we hear word.
