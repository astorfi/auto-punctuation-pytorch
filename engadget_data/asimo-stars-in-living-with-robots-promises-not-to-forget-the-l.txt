Living With Robots, which just premiered at Sundance Film Festival, was directed by Joe Berlinger (who directed Metallica's Some Kind of Monster) and tells the story of a humanoid robot that gets stranded at home while his family flies overseas for Christmas. Instead of calling the police, he stays home -- alone -- and bravely fights off Joe Pesci and some other guy whose name we can't remember. [Editor's note: This is patently untrue. Actually, the film promises to investigate "humankind's keen interest in robots and how robots can challenge the impossible by saving lives while also holding the promise to become more integrated and helpful in daily life." So there.] Interested? We bet you are! Check out the PR, and the eight minute commercial short film, after the break.
