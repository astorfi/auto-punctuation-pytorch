Upping the ante on its long-standing lineup of home entertainment controllers, its new flagship unit sports a sleek silver and black finish, a 3.5-inch color touchscreen, internet programmability, rechargeable batteries, and a slew of one-touch activity options. Aside from completely pimping out any living room table, you can control nearly every electronic facet of your home via the IR emitter, and if you toss in the RF-enabling Harmony Wireless Extender ($149.99), you can dictate the gadgetry in any room of your crib. Sporting the Smart State Technology also found in the Harmony 890, the 1000 allows for automated control of various systems / activities with a single button press, and with an online stockpile of 175,000 devices at your disposal, setup shouldn't cause too many headaches. If you have enough remotes to supply a small Radio Shack, and you're looking for one ring remote to rule them all, the Harmony 1000 can get your setup(s) under control for $499.99 later this fall.[Thanks, Gristle]
