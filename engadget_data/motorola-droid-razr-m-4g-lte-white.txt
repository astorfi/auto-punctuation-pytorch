Wait no longer: we just got handed the above images showing the Kevlar-clad device complete with a bleached trim, a design choice that appears to follow closely after the original white Droid RAZR. It's unfortunate, however, that Motorola and Verizon have chosen to continue this trend of merely changing the color of the phone's edges and calling it a day. Does the new look change your overall opinion of the midrange smartphone? Feel free to sound off below.  [Thanks, Anonymous]
