Images of a "Polaroid Camera Phone" have surfaced on Mobile Korea, and the device looks more like a "hey, wouldn't
this be cool?" type concept than anything, so we're not expecting to be popping a SIM card into one anytime soon. The
phone is labeled HS-RSS, and seems quite small for being a
mini photo printer, much less the added camera phoning
and media playing the device is supposedly capable of. Yeah, really not holding our breath on this one, but we can't be
denying the idea they're playing around with here.
