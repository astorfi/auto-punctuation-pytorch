So not only has Hitachi gone all perpendicular on us,
they've also gone a little bit nutty. But it's all in the name of enlightening us about the wonders of
perpendicularness, so we forgive them. Plus, this animated flash video explaining perpendicular recording gave us more
chuckles than most sitcoms can pull out of us in an entire season. Your host, the "lonely little DAP," leads you
through this anything-but-dry musical adventure â€” let's just say it involves disco and backup singers. We'd really like
to humbly request that all companies send us press releases in this format in the future.
