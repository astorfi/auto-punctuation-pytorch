Kobo quietly launches Vox Android tablet with 7-inch display, Gingerbread, $200 price tag
Kindle Fire vs. Nook Tablet...fight!

PocketBook, primarily known for its e-readers, introduced the A 10 this week at IFA -- that's "A" for Android and "10" for 10-inches (well, 10.1 inches). The Android in this case is Gingerbread, nothing particularly exciting on that front, in a world that has largely moved on to Honeycomb in all its iterations, but at the very least, the company is doing some cool stuff on the design front in a world of infringingly lookalike devices. The body was reportedly inspired by an airplane wing, encased in white plastic that forms a wedge on the rear. The tablet's a bit on the chunky side, with a row of actual physical buttons located on the bottom of the bezel. On the rear is a white plastic around a soft, rubbery back.

	The tablet is a bit less exciting on the inside, with 4GB of storage, a 1GHz TI OMAP 3621 processor, WiFi and optional 3G. Not surprisingly, given the company's history, the device is reading-minded, with proprietary software built around the e-book experience and page buttons built in. The company is also looking to possibly position the device for the educational sector.

	The A 10 should be hitting Europe around October, with a price tag of less that â‚¬300. The company is also planning on US availability for the tablet but isn't offering much in the way of specifics on that front.
