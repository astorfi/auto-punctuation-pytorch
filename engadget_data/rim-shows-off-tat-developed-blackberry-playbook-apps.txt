Those include a scrapbook app that takes advantage of four-fingered multitouch, and a weather app dubbed "Aura" that was built with the WebWorks platform and makes use of the PlayBook's accelerometer -- both of which are relatively simple, but are intended to demonstrate how easy and quickly developers can build applications for the PlayBook. Also on display at Mobile World Congress this week was fairly impressive media player that can be used when the tablet's connected to a TV via its HDMI port -- it will not only let you view videos, but play games (albeit just a Rubik's Cube in the demo) and even view 3D content as well. Head on past the break to check them out on video.
