If you're peddling wireless speaker systems that offer internet streaming support, it's only natural to want to get cozy with Spotify. Sonos' latest update for its iOS and Android Controller apps does just that, and you can now log-in to the streaming service using your Facebook account. What's more, version 4.1 makes handling mixtapes easier, as you can access, edit or build new Spotify playlists from within the app. Revising your Sonos playlists, or creating new ones altogether, has also been tweaked so you no longer need to involve the 'now playing' queue. Lastly, the alarm function can now be set to wake you with the sounds of your preferred subscription service, taking you straight from dreaming to streaming.
