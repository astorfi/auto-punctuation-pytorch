Matt Rosoff over at cnet news offers this tease:"I can't say much, but I've seen what Microsoft's planning, and befitting its status as a software plus services company, the real advances aren't going to be in the Zune hardware, but in the Zune software and associated services." Sooner, rather than later though Microsoft, your target isn't standing still.
