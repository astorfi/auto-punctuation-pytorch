Well, it looks like Nintendo isn't the only gaming company that thinks Apple is the "enemy of the future" -- Sony has now also taken aim at iPhone gaming in a new PSP ad featuring Kevin Butler's pint-sized counterpart, Marcus Rivers. In it, Marcus reminds viewers that the iPhone is built for things like "texting your grandma and calling your girl," while the PSP is "built for big boy games," some of which can be had for as little as $9.99. See the whole thing for yourself after the break.
