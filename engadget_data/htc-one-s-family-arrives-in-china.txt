 
 HTC has delivered smartphone triplets to the Chinese market: the HTC One ST, SC and SU -- and while the devices have identical guts (except for network gear), each has its own housing, carrier and color scheme. All three carry 4.3-inch 800 x 480 screens, dual-core 1GHz processors, 1GB RAM, 4GB storage, a 5-megapixel camera with 5 fps continuous shooting, Beats audio, dual-sim / dual standby capability and Android 4.0 with HTC sense 4. But the HTC One ST, destined for China Mobile, brings a curvier 9.2mm thick design and choice of three colors, including a now pass√© red. The One SC for China Telecom has a squarish, 8.9mm asymmetric two-tone design, and three color choices as well, including a burnt orange for the more fashion forward. Finally there's China Unicom's HTC One SU, with a similar body to its SC counterpart, but featuring powder blue as an accent color. No pricing has been announced yet for the entry-level spec'd models, but consumers there may want to check their wardrobes before picking up one of the bolder models.
