Bell is running a Twitter competition to celebrate, and the Ts and Cs suggest that Canucks might have to dig deep into those winter coat pockets for a total of CAD $629 off-contract. The Optimus LTE has already been given a detailed video tour courtesy of Bell's retail arm, albeit under the guise of the Optimus Eye, and is keen to show off its 4.5-inch HD AH-IPS display, eight megapixel camera and 1.5GHz dual-core processor. 4G fans can toss their name into the hat at the sign-up page below and spare a thought for their southerly neighbors -- we still have no sniff of a release in the US.
