 Rest assured, this isn't the first (nor the last) time you'll see products launch before the official specs get ratified, but JEDEC is doing the honors today by introducing the DDR3 (Double Data Rate 3) memory device standard. Key improvements that were noted include a 1.5-volt power supply, increased operating temperature range, memory device reset, burst chop, dynamic on-die termination, output driver calibration, and write leveling among others. The standard is reportedly intended to operate over a "performance range from 800 to 1600 MT/s (million transfers per second)," and while we certainly appreciate the details finally coming forward, the bevy of product launches from months past sure dampened the thunder.
