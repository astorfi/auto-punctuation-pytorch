Well, it looks like you're in luck, as the company has just let loose some matching 17- and 19-inch models that each come in under $200. From the looks of it, the $199, 19-inch S1909WX is by far the better bargain of the two, with it boasting a 1440 x 900 resolution, a 1,000:1 contrast ratio, a 300cd/m2 brightness rating, and an HDCP compatible DVI port. The 17-inch S1709W, on the other hand, packs the same resolution and will save you twenty bucks, but you'll have to make do with a 600:1 contrast ratio, 250cd/m2 brightness, and nothing more than a plain old VGA port, not to mention just 17-inches of screen real estate. Sold? You know where to get 'em.[Via Electronista]
