Specs for six (and press photos for four) Lumix cameras have come to light. Here's what's the gang reportedly found, in a nutshell: the very compact, 14.1-megapixel FP3 has a 3-inch touchscreen LCD, 4x zoom, shoots 720p 30 frames per second video, and comes in a variety of colors; the FP1 similar in stature but with 12.1 megapixels and a 2.7-inch non-touchscreen LCD instead. The Lumix F3 drops the "very compact" look of the FP1 but is also 12.1 megapixels / 3x zoom, 720p 30fps video, and 2.7-inch LCD. The FH20 has a 14.1 megapixel sensor, 8x zoom, 720p video, and a Venus Engine IV image processor, which is also reportedly claimed by the FH1 (12 megapixels, 5x zoom) and FH3 (14.1 megapixels, 5x zoom). It's just that time of the season, eh?
