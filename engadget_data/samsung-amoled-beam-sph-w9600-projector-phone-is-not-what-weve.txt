Beam SPH-W9600 we previewed back in January into its South Korean home. So yeah, it's the same 5 megapixeler with T-DMB TV, Microsoft Office and DivX codec support, and improved DLP pico projector that replaces last year's W7900. But if it's all the same to you Sammy, we'll be waiting for the true projector phone successor -- your Beam i8520, codenamed Halo -- said to be launching this summer.
