Ok, shipping isn't really the right term. The first group of RED ONE users all flew out to RED HQ in southern California to pick up their 4K cameras, and we can't say we're not jealous. We'll leave the rest to you to discover for yourself, once they start talking timecode and whatnot we tend to zone out.[Thanks, Jacob]
