TalkTalk has enjoyed its fair share of positive press in recent months, thanks to its new carrier deal with O2 and the acquisition of Blinkbox Movies, but there could be some rougher times ahead. In an email to customers, the quad-play provider confirmed that it was the target of an intrusion at the end of last year, which saw attackers steal personal data including names, addresses, phone numbers and TalkTalk account numbers. The company says that it has confirmed a number of cases where scammers have used that information to tease more sensitive details like bank account and credit card numbers from customers.



TalkTalk remains confident that "sensitive" data, like a customer's date of birth, bank or credit card details weren't compromised, but that probably won't come as any consolation to those who may have already been contacted by a malicious third party. The company says it has taken "urgent and serious steps" to secure its systems and warns customers to be wary of any phone or email correspondence purporting to be from them.
