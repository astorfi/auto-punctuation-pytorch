  The Nokia Lumia 900 is still fresh in our mind from this afternoon's announcement, and fortunately it didn't take long for us to get our hands on the new LTE-laden device. The newest phone in the Lumia series is packing a 4.3-inch ClearBlack display, 1.4GHz single-core CPU, 512MB of RAM, and sports a 8MP Carl Zeiss f/2.2 camera with LED flash that's capable of cranking out 720p HD video capture, as well as a 1MP front-facing camera that uses f/2.4. The 1,830mAh battery is inclusive due to the phone's unibody polycarbonate build and can't be removed, but we're happy to see that the Lumia 900 will be able to crank out the LTE for a decent amount of time.You won't find a huge difference in outside looks between this and its predecessor, the Lumia 800, aside from the presence of a frontward-facing camera and the obvious larger display. The larger phone was still comfortable to hold in our hands, and felt just as solid as ever with its polycarbonate build. When it comes to firmware, we weren't given the luxury of playing much with the handset since it was an early prototype model that is nowhere near its final status. The SIM card wasn't activated either, so we were unable to take its LTE capabilities for a test drive. Nokia and AT&T haven't been able to confirm exactly when we can expect the new device to actually be available in stores, nor the pricing at which it can be purchased with, so we're just going to have to dream of the phone in our slumber at night; at least we know exactly what to dream about, right?
