In a nutshell, it's a more feature-filled Ojo with much more than just video calling -- namely calendar, notes, plus it packs a WiFi phone in the back of the unit (pictured above). The video after the jump doesn't quite do justice to the smoothness of the interface, but your mileage may vary depending on the fatness of your fingers. iriver reps told us that they estimate the unit to be priced at less than $400 to make affordable enough for people to buy more than one. Feel free to peep our original post for all the juicy tech specs, and don't forget to point your friends in this direction if you don't wanna feel like a loser if you drop four bills.
