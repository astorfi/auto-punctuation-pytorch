Instead, it decided the issue was the screen -- in particular the format -- and rumor has it that Moto is working on a new tablet (probably not the Xoom 2 we've glimpsed) that ditches the 16:9 ratio for the more square 4:3 found on Apple's slate. Supposedly the non-widescreen device will sport an extremely pixel-dense 2048 x 1536, 10-inch display and run Ice Cream Sandwich when it lands later this year or early next. We're not entirely convinced this will pan out and, honestly, we've always preferred the more more modern widescreen format -- but, if the iPad sells with it's old-school ratio we suppose it's worth a shot.
