 We know tons of aging Dreamcast fans' hearts skipped a beat today -- us included -- when Sega made a rustle with the brand name at the USPTO. But as it turns out, the recently filed trademark application is just a renewal on brand, and doesn't express any intentions to do another Dreamcast console. In fact, Sega further explained to GameDaily, rather flatly we might add, that they have "no plans to get back into the console business." We know, we're already reaching for the Zoloft, too, but did anyone really think Sega wanted to make one last go of game consoles when even mega-players like Sony can't keep it together?[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
