Kodak may have thrown in the towel in the
   DSLR market, but that doesn't mean the company has
   completely abandoned the high-end photo market. In fact, according to the company, it's gone to the absolute
   highest end, with two new CCDs that are among the largest available commercially. The KAF-31600 boasts 31.6
   megapixels, and the KAF-39000 has 39 megapixels. The CCDs are targeted at pros, and will be incorporated into
   digital backs for medium-format cameras. One early customer is Phase One A/S, which plans to use the CCDs in its
   previously announced P30 and P45 backs. How much
   will 39 megapixels run you? No pricing is out yet, but Phase One's current top model, the 22 megapixel P25, goes
   for about $30,000. That puts it at over $1,300 per megapixel, so don't be surprised to see the P45 going for as
   much as $50K.
