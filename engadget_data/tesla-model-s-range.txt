So you're fortunate enough to be shopping for a Tesla Model S, but you're anxious about just how far the electric sedan's variants will go on a full battery. How do you know you won't be stranded on the roadside because you bought the wrong edition? The automaker clearly wants to put that range anxiety to rest. It just posted a detailed look at the driving range you're likely to get from the Model S based on a slew of factors, including the equipment you use and how you drive. There's a range estimator, too, if you want to see how each of those factors comes into play.



It's no secret that the entry-level Model S 60 has the shortest range, while the 85D is the long-distance champ. Also, some of the efficiency tips for gas-powered cars still apply to varying degrees. You'll lose about 3 percent of your range if you opt for the big 21-inch performance tires, and opening the windows or turning on the air conditioning is a no-no. Both your speed and consistency matter as well. You'll eke a little extra mileage out of your ride if you cruise on the highway, and resisting the urge to mash the throttle will go a long way -- you'll go around 350 miles if you stick to 55MPH in a warm climate.

These figures are still somewhat optimistic, of course, and assume that you're not coping with unpredictable elements like traffic or snow. However, this is a rare chance at seeing how well an EV copes with your driving conditions before you take the keys. And if you're really, truly concerned about driving as far as possible in a Tesla, you can always try scoring a used Roadster.
