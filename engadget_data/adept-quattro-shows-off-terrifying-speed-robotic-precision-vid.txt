 
See that blur in the image above? That'll be the Adept Quattro, a machine claiming the title of being the world's fastest industrial pick and place robot. On the evidence of today's video, we're not going to argue. Being demonstrated as part of the first National Robotics Week, the Quattro took on a WiiMote-controlled moving platform and still effortlessly conducted its job at a pace that would make even Usain Bolt feel inadequate. The person controlling the platform tries his best to confuse the machine with rapid changes of direction, but whatever he does, the chips are placed and removed from their repositories with unerring precision. Go past the break to see the Quattro in action.
