The most recent rumor, reported by BusinessWeek, indicates the streaming video site is talking to CBS and Viacom about getting their properties on what will be called "Hulu Plus" and cost $9.95 a month and potentially offer subscribers more shows and more older episodes. Traffic dipped significantly after Viacom yanked The Daily Show and The Colbert Report from Hulu in April, we'll see if a share of that premium money is enough to lure them back, and if the long rumored service ever actually launches.
