Using thin-film technology, European researchers have developed a
new tactile display for blind computer users that they say will cost a fraction of the price of traditional Braille
displays. When the film receives a signal from the computer, it can curve upward or downward, forcing a plastic pin
into the display area of the module. The device has yet to be commercialized, but has already created a buzz, winning a
â‚¬60,000 prize from the ONCE foundation in Madrid.
