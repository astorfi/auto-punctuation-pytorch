Another Bluetooth GPS receiver,
another review. This one comes from iPaqHQ, who got their hands on Holux's tiny GPSlim 236 receiver. According to them,
it's small, light, and works really well. And it apparently has great battery life. What more could you want? Well, it
would be nice if they could knock a few bucks off that $169 price tag.
