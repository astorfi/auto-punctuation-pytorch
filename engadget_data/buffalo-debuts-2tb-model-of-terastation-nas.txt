Buffalo has introduced a 2TB model to their
"TeraStation" line of Network
Attached Storage (NAS) devices. The product code on this one is "TS-2.0TGL/R5," where the R5 refers to the device's
RAID-5 support. It is set to be released in late December in Japan for what equates to about $2,036 USD. You'll find an
ethernet interface with 10Base-T, 100Base-T, and 1000Base-T support alongside two USB 2.0 ports. Just to give you an
idea, on a network of 10 computers, 2TB would allow each user to have just over 200GB of storage space (MATH).
Not too shabby if you ask us, but given Buffalo's track record with the TeraStation line, you may want to hold off
until a review or two comes in.
