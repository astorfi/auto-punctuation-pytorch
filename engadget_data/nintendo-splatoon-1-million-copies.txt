For the most part, Nintendo kept quiet during E3 2015 -- at least in comparison to PlayStation and Xbox. But today the company's celebrating a huge milestone for Splatoon, the magical third-person shooter that was recently launched on the Wii U. Nintendo announced the game has sold over 1 million copies since being released, making it one of the most successful Wii U titles to date. In a press statement, Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime said, "This milestone puts us in a nice position as we prepare to launch 11 more exclusive Wii U and Nintendo 3DS games before the end of the year, plus amiibo, digital offerings and games from our third-party partners." So, if you don't have a Wii U or a 3DS, now might be the time to reconsider.
