Walking through Times Square yesterday on our way back from a meeting on 43rd Street we were handed an ugly
car-shaped keychain promoting Yahoo's revamped Yahoo! Autos website. We wished we'd stuck around longer (or maybe
looked up), because besides handing out crappy keychains, Yahoo had also set up one of the giant billboards at Broadway
and West 43rd with an interactive racing game that you can playÂ from your cellphone. You have to call
1-800-660-4402 to get in the queue to play, and once you're in you press 2 to make the car go faster and 8 to make it
go slower.
