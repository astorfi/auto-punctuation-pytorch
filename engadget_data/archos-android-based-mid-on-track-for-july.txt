The key bit is that the company is apparently planning to release the device "at the start of Q3 2009," which is actually fairly specific as far as these announcements go, though no doubt still subject to change if Archos sees fit. Otherwise, the only word on the MID is that it will pack some telephony features and, of course, include all of Archos' usual multimedia applications.[Via SlashGear]
