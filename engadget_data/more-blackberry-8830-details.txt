       Just when we're down in the dumps about our 'Berry, here's some good news that should brighten up the day. New intel suggests that Verizon is planning to release the BlackBerry 8830 (aka Cyclone) on May 14 for the business channel and May 29 for consumers. A couple other bits of information as well: there's support for microSD cards up to the standard 2GB, and the media player supposedly supports -- get this -- iTunes music. Check out an additional pic (fuzzy, but helpful, we promise) after the break.[Thanks, HTC Kid]
