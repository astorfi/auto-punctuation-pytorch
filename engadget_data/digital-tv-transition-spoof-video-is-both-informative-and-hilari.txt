 
By now, you've probably seen at least one DTV transition commercial, and if not, you're clearly not watching enough television. Criticisms aside, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to point you at what will unquestionably be the most hilarious (albeit informative) digital TV conversion ad of all time. We won't even bother trying to explain what happens in this 1 minute, 53 second masterpiece, but as you can glean from the photo above, this is a can't-miss experience. Jump past the break and mash play.[Thanks, Sean]
