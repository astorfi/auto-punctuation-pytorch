 
While we're probably still years or decades away from getting our very own animatronic clones, Google's released the next best thing for the time being. Available on the Android Market is this Androidify app, which, as the name says for itself, lets us mere mortals craft our Android mascot lookalikes. Hell, you can even slap on some facial hair or a baby droid while you're at it. We'll say no more -- see the app in action after the break, if you're not already busy dishing out your new avatar across the web.
