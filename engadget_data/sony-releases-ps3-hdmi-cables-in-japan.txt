 While it didn't see fit to include one in the box (ours notwithstanding), Sony's more than happy to sell you an HDMI cable to keep your brand-new PlayStation 3 Sony-branded through and through, releasing a range of cables of varying lengths to coincide with the Japanese PS3 launch. Available in 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 meter varieties (approximately 3 to 10 feet), the cables comply with HDMI 1.3 specs and feature 24k gold-plated connectors for that extra touch of class (and improved signal quality). Keen observers of these sort of things will notice that that's three more cables than Sony has announced for release over here -- so if you're looking for more options on this side of the Pacific, you'll have to either go third-party or get importing. Prices in Japan start at 3,500 Yen (about $30) for the shortest cable, with each increment costing an extra 500 Yen, topping out at 5,000 Yen (just over $40) for the ten footer.
