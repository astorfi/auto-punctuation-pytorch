While they've both apparently yet to be completely finalized or approved by Microsoft, the company is nonetheless showing off its Onza controller and Chimaera headset for the Xbox 360, which both stick close to Razer's usual design cues, and naturally include plenty of features tailored to demanding gamers. That, of course, includes a cord on each instead of batteries to cut down on any latency, and some adjustable tension analog sticks and a programmable multi-function button on the controller. Still no indication of a release date, but Razer is expecting to sell the controller for $50 and the headset for $130. Hit up the gallery below for a closer look at each.
