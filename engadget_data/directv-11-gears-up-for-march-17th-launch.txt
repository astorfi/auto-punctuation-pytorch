We've been counting down to March for some time now, and while we knew the DirecTV 11 satellite was undergoing final preparations for launch, we still had no idea exactly what day it was set to blast off -- until now. Reportedly, the "Odyssey Launch Platform and the Sea Launch Commander have departed Sea Launch Home Port for the equatorial Pacific," and the liftoff is expected to occur within a 58-minute window at 3:49PM PT on Monday, March 17th. Best of all, live coverage of the mission will be available as of 3:30PM on the same day, so those with nothing better to do can check this thing out as it goes down just weeks from now.
