Apple may have been too hasty in rolling out its Apple TV 6.0 update last week, but it's been quick to make amends. The company has just re-released the upgrade with a new build number -- and, presumably, fixes for the connectivity and reset issues from the initial rollout. Otherwise, the new firmware offers the same AirPlay from iCloud support, iTunes Music Store shopping and iTunes Radio streaming that we saw a few days ago. We haven't heard of any hiccups with this latest revision, but let us know if you encounter anything serious.
