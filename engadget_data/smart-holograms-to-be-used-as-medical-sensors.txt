A company with roots in Cambridge University is working to develop "smart holograms" that can be used as sensors to
detect everything from blood-glucose levels to food freshness. The company, aptly (if not creatively) called Smart
Holograms, has already produced a prototype contact lens that can be used by diabetics to track their sugar levels, as
well as a patch that can read a person's blood-alcohol level. The holograms work by incorporating polymers that swell
or contract on contact with specific chemicals or biological agents. As the polymer's shape changes, embedded images
can be altered as well, providing a visual readout.
