Sources told Reuters that the chipmaker's notebook CPUs will power 109 different laptops over the months to come, compared to only 40 laptop models last year. It seems part of the newfound success is attributable to HP -- which announced twelve mainstream 'tops just last week -- but we're more interested in the mysterious quad-core Phenom II X4 machines leaking out the likes of Acer and Dell. What can we say? We're suckers for a surprise, especially of the portable, multi-threaded variety.
