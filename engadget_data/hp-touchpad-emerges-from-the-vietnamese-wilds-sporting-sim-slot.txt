Anyways, without those meddlesome PR representatives to keep them from prying at ports, the Vietnamese gadget hounds discovered that the slate has a slot for a SIM card. While we can't attest to the vintage of this particular prototype -- and thus say whether the TouchPad will still have a SIM when it ships -- it's safe to assume that HP was at least considering GSM frequencies at some point during its development. Video after the break.
