VP Adi Berenson tells us the company's already signed deals to put PrimeSense inside HTPCs by the end of the year, and has at least one cable company ready to launch a gesture-controlled set top box by summer 2011. The end goal is to provide natural human control over TV-based media consumption, said Berenson, who's working to get cameras in TVs themselves sometime late next year.

Like Kinect, these solutions will have a pair of 640 x 480 camera sensors to measure user position in 3D space, but don't expect them to have motorized tilt functionality or voice recognition -- PrimeSense said it won't be able to make those available for manufacturers, as they're all Microsoft ideas. The gesture recognition has reportedly evolved, though, and we're eager to check that out soon. See what it used to look like in our GDC 2010 preview.

Update: Just to be absolutely clear, this is not Microsoft's Kinect that's slated for an HTPC and set-top-box near you, but rather PrimeSense, the 3D camera sensor technology behind it.
