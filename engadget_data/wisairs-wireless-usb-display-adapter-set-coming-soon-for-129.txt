 It's debatable whether wireless USB is on its way out or on its way in (for real this time), but regardless of which way it's swaying, Wisair's got some availability you should know about. The outfit's Wireless USB Display Adapter Set, which is a screen-centric variant of the kit introduced back in November, will be available this quarter in the US and Europe. Based on Wisair's WSR601 Wireless USB single chip solution, the device offers up VGA and HDMI connectivity options, supports resolutions up to 1,400 x 1,050 and is USB-IF certified. If you're struggling to understand the purpose here, the two-piece bundle enables USB-equipped PCs to stream content to TVs, monitors and projectors sans cabling, and it'll do so for just $129. Now, if only it were 1080p compatible...
