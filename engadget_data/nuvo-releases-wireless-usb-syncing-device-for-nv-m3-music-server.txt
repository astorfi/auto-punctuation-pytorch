NuVo's Wireless USB Syncing Device (NV-USBW) enables the NV-M3 (pictured) to be installed without regard for where the user's PC is, as the Wireless-G connection that is provided enables PlaysForSure tunes to be streamed sans cabling anywhere within the home. That being said, we sincerely hope you didn't expect this thing to be cheap -- otherwise, the $399 pricetag for the NV-USBW is likely to be a real stunner.
