With this year finally coming to a close, YouTube wants to make sure you haven't forgotten about the memes, moments and people that stood out throughout 2014. Using some of its most popular content creators, the website has posted its YouTube Rewind video covering the past 12 months, which has become a tradition for the Google-owned site since a few years ago. Dubbed Turn Down for 2014 (because TD4W, amirite?), the video mashup plays to the tune of hit songs like All About That Bass, Fancy, Happy, Let it Go and, of course, Turn Down for What. YouTube also revealed its Top 10 list of music videos, one that was topped by Katy Perry's Dark Horse and sits just shy of 716 million total views.
