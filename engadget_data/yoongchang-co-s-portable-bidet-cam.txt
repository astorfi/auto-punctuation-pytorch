Ah yes, a portable bidet with all the things we'd expect from sanitary Korean electronics: antibacterial silver-nano
coating, extendable nozzle, trochoid pump, everything you need to keep fresh. There's just one thing that we're kind of
unsure of. It's that bit about having a "simple and new disign with digital camera." We have a feeling there was maybe
a little something lost in translation, but just in case we're the ones who are missing something, we encourage all
users of portable bidets to make sure their devices adhere to all normal privacy standards. Because really,
what could be more annoying than your your bidet taking snapshots when you're not good n' ready?
