In fact, rumors have started to circulate that the 28nm-based chip would be pushed back to 2012. Turns out those rumblings aren't entirely inaccurate. While the latest polygon pushing silicon will start being churned out before it's time to buy a new calendar, final products won't start shipping until next year, as a company rep told TechSpot. Kepler's descendent, Maxwell, is still expected to land sometime in either 2013 or 2014, but there's plenty of time for that timetable to slide back a bit too.
