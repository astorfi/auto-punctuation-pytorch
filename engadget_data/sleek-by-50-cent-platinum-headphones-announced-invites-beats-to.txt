 
It's official. The cans we saw teased earlier in the week have just been made official by Sleek Audio and Curtis Jackson (otherwise known to the world as 50 Cent), with the rapper himself dishing out cash and input to make it happen. We're told that they were designed by 50 and engineered by Sleek, and are the first headphones ever to offer 'Wireless Hybrid' technology with military-grade metals. More specifically, the Sleek by 50 Cent Platinum headphones utilize Kleer lossless wireless technology, with a 60 foot range and a micro-USB rechargeable battery. If you run out of juice, there's a detachable mic cable that can be jacked in for continued listening. The cans themselves house a pair of 50mm dynamic drivers, a customized internal amplifier and a call-out to Dr. Dre. Just kidding. Maybe. We're still waiting on a price and release date, but we'd expect 'em to ship soon for just a touch more than HP's Beats -- you know, given the wireless and all.

"I know music and I've tried everything on the market as far as headphones go, but I wanted something different, something better, that really pushed the envelope and gave all music fans a new way to listen to their favorite artists," said 50. "I was fortunate to find Sleek, the technology they employ and their knowledge of how we hear music truly blew me away.

By combining our knowledge of acoustics and hearing aid science with 50's experience as a recording artist we've created something that music lovers of all genres are really going to love." Getting to the heart of why we use headphones to listen to music... to escape.Music listeners don't use earphones and headphones to enjoy music to be part of a group, they use them to escape. Music can take you places you've never been before, it can ease your mind during a trying time, or allow you to escape the physical pain during a long run.

By utilizing Kleer lossless wireless technology, Sleek Platinum headphones offer true, uncompressed wireless sound. Music lovers can enjoy over 60 feet of range, wireless track and volume control, and even sync up to four headphones to one audio source. If the micro-usb rechargeable battery runs out, the detachable mic cable can simply be plugged in for continued listening. Form enhances function through advanced design technology. Beyond the wireless technology, critical points of the Sleek Platinum headphones construction incorporate military-grade carbon fiber and metal accents strategically placed for both form and function. These materials are used to house two pro-tuned 50mm. dynamic drivers, powered by a customized internal amplifier for unparalleled audio performance.
