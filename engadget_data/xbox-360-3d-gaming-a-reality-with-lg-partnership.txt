From the looks of the Korean press release, LG and Microsoft have entered into a memorandum of understanding to jointly market LG's new 3D televisions along side 3D-capable Xbox 360 games in South Korea, then later expand the partnership throughout the Asia Pacific region. If we're reading this correctly then it appears set to begin by bundling Xbox 360 3D games with LG 55/47LX9500 LED televisions sometime at the end of June. In other words, we're not seeing anything specific claiming new Xbox 360 hardware, just like we've seen on the PS3.

Update: Here's a statement direct from Microsoft US on the partnership and the future of 3D Xbox 360 gaming:

3D games are available today on Xbox 360 and will continue to evolve. Today, you can buy a 3DTV and wear glasses to play games like Avatar and "Batman: Arkham Asylum." The promotional partnership with LG announced in South Korea today is specific to the South Korean market, but is further evidence that as 3D adoption grows, Xbox 360 will support 3D games and entertainment.
