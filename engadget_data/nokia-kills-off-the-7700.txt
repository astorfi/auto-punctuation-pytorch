They made a huge deal about it when they announced it last October, but Nokia is quietly killing off their new 7700
smartphone even before it ever had a chance to come out. The 7700 was supposed to be their mediacentric handset, with a
huge 640x320 pixel touchscreen, a built-in FM tuner that worked with Nokia's new Visual Radio service, an MP3 player,
and the ability to stream video off of the Web. The 7700 was also the last model due to be released with sidetalking.
Sidetalking is dead, we'd like to promise we won't mention it anymore, but you know how much fun it is to beat a dead
horse.
