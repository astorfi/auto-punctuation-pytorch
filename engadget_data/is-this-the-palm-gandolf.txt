We have no idea where this pic came from or if it's real, but if it is, it'll represent a pretty big design departure for Palm -- it actually looks pretty HTC-ish to us. The source says this EV-DO unit is actually the much-rumored "Hollywood," and will debut on Sprint for under $200, but we'll believe it when we see it.
