In this case, it's the previously announced update that brings the TouchWiz UX to the tablet, and adds things like Samsung's Live Panel, Mini Apps, and a newly redesigned Media Hub interface. That will first be available to the press during a media event on August 3rd, after which Samsung will open the doors at its Samsung Experience store to the public from 1PM to 6PM, and let any Galaxy Tab 10.1 owner side-load the update onto their device. Needless to say, we'll be there to bring you all the details if you aren't able to make it yourself.
