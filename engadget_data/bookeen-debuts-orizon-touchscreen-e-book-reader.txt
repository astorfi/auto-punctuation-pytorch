That includes a 6-inch touchscreen display, built-in WiFi, Bluetooth, ePub support, and an accelerometer for portrait or landscape reading. No indication of a release date just yet, but this one should run about $250, and Bookeen still isn't quite done with the Opus -- it'll soon be available a whole range of colors.
