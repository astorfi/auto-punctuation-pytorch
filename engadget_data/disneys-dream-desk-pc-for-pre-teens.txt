We'd dismiss this as just some Mickey Mouse machine, but the Disney Dream Desk PC literally is a Mickey Mouse
machine, just one that's aimed at pre-teens (at least the ones young enough to not be embarrassed to have one of these
in their room when their friends come over). It's got the signature Mickey Mouse ears that double as speakers and more
whimsical styling than you'll find in most PCs, but otherwise it falls into the lower end of the spectrum: a 2.66GHz
Celeron processor, a 40GB hard drive, and 256MB of RAM. Should be out later this month with a retail price of $599, and
a whole line of matching Dream Desk peripherals like a printer, game controller, and a digital camera.
