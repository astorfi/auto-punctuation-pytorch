A report this week from the government agency calls out the product with a safety warning, charging that the cartridges they examined contained "carcinogens and toxic chemicals such as diethylene glycol, an ingredient used in antifreeze." The FDA says it can't confirm the extent of the health issues, as it's only done limited testing and it hasn't been formally submitted for review, but it doesn't look quite as risk-free as previously touted. Don't say the WHO never warned ya. So remind us again, what's the point in smoking one of these over an old school cigarette?[Via Switched; thanks, flatlander85]
