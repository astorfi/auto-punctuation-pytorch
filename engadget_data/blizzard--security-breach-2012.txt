 According to a recent Blizzard security update, now might be a good time cook up a new password. Blizzard's security team found that its internal network has been illegally accessed, and answers to personal security questions, authenticator data and cryptographically scrambled Battle.net passwords have found their way into the perpetrator's hands. The team is confident, however, that the compromised data isn't enough to give the attacker access to user accounts, and says that there is no evidence to suggest financial data (credit cards, billing addresses and customer names) were accessed. Blizzard President Mike Morhaine recommends that users update their passwords all the same, and we couldn't agree more. Check out his official statement at the source link below and get that Diablo III account locked down.
