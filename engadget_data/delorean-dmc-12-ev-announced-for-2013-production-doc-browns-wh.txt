It's in part thanks to the eponymously dubbed DeLorean Motor Company of Texas (not to be confused with long defunct DMC), which is known for its modernized restorations of the famed auto -- using original parts with slight modifications incorporating newer accoutrement. The automaker took to its blog this weekend announcing a partnership with Epic EV to make this "all-electric" DMC-12 a reality. Your Houston News reports that it's rated for 260 horsepower with a maximum speed of 125MPH -- although, we all know there's no need to go past 88MPH. It's expected to cost about six-figures, which sadly won't include a Flux Capacitor, but you could always run the app for that with its in-console iPhone holster. The DMC-12 EV is set to be released in 2013, and should be an excellent match for anyone who secured some of those Marty McFly-approved Nike Air Mags a few weeks ago. You'll find full details in the links below.
