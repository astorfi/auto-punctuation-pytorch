PalmSource, the company behind the Palm operating system, just dropped a bombshell on the
industry by acquiring China MobileSoft Limited, a Chinese software company that has been working on a version of Linux
for cellphones and mobile devices. What's the dice? Windows Mobile has been putting the hurt on PalmSource lately
(they've been losing both licensees and marketshare), so the plan here is to strike back with a new Linux-based version
of the Palm OS that would have the robustness and flexibility of Linux and the ease of use of Palm. No word on when
this new Palm/Linux OS might become a reality, but PalmSource says that they're still going to introduce Palm OS
Cobalt, the next version of the software, next year.
