What is crazy here is the size of these "portable" audio appendages. The 24-Watt uBoom (pictured) is a 3kg behemoth measuring nearly 60cm (23.6 inches) across and positively swallowing up whatever notebook you care to plop into it. That's not to say it's inconvenient, maybe you like exercise. On the other hand, the uBoom Q is about half the size and sips power from the USB connection, but then it only pumps out 2.4 Watts. Check out both after the break.  [Via Electronista]
