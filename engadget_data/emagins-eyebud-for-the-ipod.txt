If you're ready to throw down $600 forwhat's perhaps the ultimate (or at least the most ultimately expensive) iPod accessory that isn't diamond encrusted,you too can rock a 105-inch "sized" screen in your field of vision while managing to look merely like somebizarre technomad, a marked improvement from previously straight up creepifying HUDs.[Via iLounge]
