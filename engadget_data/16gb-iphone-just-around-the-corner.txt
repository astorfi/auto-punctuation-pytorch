We just got a pair of tips purporting inside AT&T info that both point to the 16GB iPhone showing up shortly. One person spotted the phone in AT&T Wireless inventory, listed as not in stock, while the other tipster was fairly certain about a release this Tuesday or the next one. Obviously this is all hearsay at the moment, so don't go hawking that 8 gigger just yet, but we'll see if Apple's going to serve us up a Papa Bear-sized portion of gigabytes soon enough.Update: We just received word from multiple sources that the O2 staff has been notified of the 16GB iPhone launch at 1:30pm UK time. Price: Â£329. That will likely translate to $599 in the US like the original 8GB iPhone, $499 if we're lucky.Update 2: Pocket-Lint trucked on down to the O2 emporium on Oxford Street in London and have confirmed the 16GB iPhone with shop staff.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
