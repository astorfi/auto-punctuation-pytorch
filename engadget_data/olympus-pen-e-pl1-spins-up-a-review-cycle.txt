With a 720p movie mode, a 14-42mm kit lens, and access to the growing catalog of Micro Four Thirds glass, it really looks like a guaranteed win for the company, but it's always good to run it through a few tests to make sure. While it sports a body rather richer in plastic than its senior siblings, we're told the E-PL1 still feels robust in the hand, and its control scheme is commended for being accessible to novices and including a dedicated video recording button. Image quality is ranked, as was to be expected, right on par with the costlier models with only the more professionally inclined ISO 3200 and 1/2000th shutter speed proving limiting. Get reading for fuller impressions as well as some sample video shot with the E-PL1.
