Of those, there are five regional sports networks, three more premiums, and finally three new HD channels that are new to everyone. We expect the three regular channels to be mostly stretch-o-vision at first, but there should be plenty of new HD content when they start to launch their original programming. There are still some obvious channels missing like National Geographic HD, Food HD and HGTV HD, but expect to see them anytime now. We don't know about anyone else, but we're excited that we won't have to wait six months to watch BSG in HD anymore.
