Lucky for those of you possessed of mammoth mitts, AT&T's made good on its word and'll be adding HTC's 4.7-inch Titan to its line-up on November 20th. For the $199 on two-year contract price, you get to take a crack at that WVGA Super LCD panel and the refreshed Windows Phone Mango OS running beneath. It's a single core 1.5GHz phone living in a dual-core world, but this big guy's such a standout, you'll hardly even care.
