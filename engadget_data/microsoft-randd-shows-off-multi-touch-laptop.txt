Whatever the case may be, this multi-touch screen looks pretty damn good to us (kind of like Surface on a notebook), and the technology they're using (off-the-shelf laptop, IR sensors) gives us the impression that these might come to market sooner rather than later. Be sure to watch the video after the break.[Via istartedsomething, thanks Mitchel T]
