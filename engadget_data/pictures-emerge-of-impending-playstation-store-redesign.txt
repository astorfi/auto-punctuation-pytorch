Apparently the refacing will start on April 3rd and finish up in around a fortnight, but until the job is finished, "no additional downloadable content will be posted." Of course, existing content will remain available, and chances are you'll appreciate the updates when all is said and done, but we know how tough it'll be to not log on weekly and eagerly sniff for all new material. Hit up the via for lots of pictures -- we're told it'll help the sting.[Via PS3Fanboy, thanks Kiwi616]
