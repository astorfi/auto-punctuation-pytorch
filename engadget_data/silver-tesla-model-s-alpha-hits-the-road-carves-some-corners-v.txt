Tesla has just released a tasty video of the Alpha version of the Model S carving some corners, and while this isn't the first time we've seen the car in motion this is the best taste of the Alpha we've yet been given. Check out the video after the break and, no, your speakers aren't broken, it is that quiet. Oh, and if you'd like to know more about what's going on under all that chrome and silver make sure you peruse our chat with Chief Engineer Peter Rawlinson.
