At long last, pieces are beginning to come together. According to EA Sports' official Grand Slam Tennis page, said title will be available for the Wii on June 18th. Hop over to a recent Nintendo Power article about said game, and you'll find producer Thomas Singleton asserting that the MotionPlus accessory is "due out prior to Grand Slam's release." So, putting one and one together, we've come to the conclusion that Nintendo should ship its MotionPlus add-on prior to June 18th, or at least prior to whatever day Grand Slam Tennis gets delayed to.
