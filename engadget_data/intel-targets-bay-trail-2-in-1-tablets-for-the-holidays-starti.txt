Intel is in the middle of its Computex 2013 presentation, and it's already putting a target price for some of those tablet / laptops we're expecting around the holidays: $399. While more premium experiences will be powered by Intel's fourth generation Core "Haswell" CPU, the quad-core Atom "Bay Trail" are going in cheaper ultrathin and light notebooks with touchscreens with 2 in 1 editions swinging the keyboard out of the way for use as tablets. That puts them slightly above the $200 floor predicted by Intel execs for basic touchscreen laptops, we'll see if any of the numerous OEMs on stage can bring out convertible devices worth the extra cash this holiday season.
