 The rumored Nokia 8600 "Luna" just got a lot more real now that a suspiciously similar twin is teasing us from the Carphone Warehouse site. The site dubs the phone the Nokia High Fashion because it's "so new it doesn't even have a model number." Sure, whatevs. At least they know that it's "coming soon" with an "on-screen menu system," 2 megapixel camera for photos and video, MP3 player, and 1GB of built-in memory. It's also likely to be sporting Series 40 under that sliding, semi-transparent hood. Nice.[Via Stuff.tv]
