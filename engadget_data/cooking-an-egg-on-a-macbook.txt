 Alright, so maybe you didn't want such a warm welcome when using your MacBook, but the list of unadvertised capabilities of these heat-emitting notebooks is growing. Most recently a pioneering fellow decided he liked his eggs over hard -- hard drive, that is. While his MacBook was operating within the manufacturer's specifications (read: likely folding for Engadget or some other such process-intensive task), the underbelly of this beast got toasty enough to literally fry an egg. While probably not the most efficient way to fix breakfast, it's definitely among the most entertaining we've seen, and certainly helps substantiate the, ahem, smoking reviews this machine got.
