DirecTV Everywhere will soon become much more useful for travelers eager to watch their favorite shows. As of November 21st, the satellite TV provider is expanding its out-of-home TV streaming selection to include more than 30 live channels, such as HBO and Showtime. Subscribers will also have access to more than 100 channels when at home, and 19,000 on-demand shows through DirecTV's website. The company's Android tablet app is receiving a makeover as part of the expansion -- an impending update will stream both live and on demand video to tablets of all sizes and multiple OS versions. Customers will just have to wait a short while before they get access to DirecTV's wider world of content.
