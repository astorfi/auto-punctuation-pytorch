 Homeowners with wireless dead spots or the need tostream HD content from room-to-room will soon have a new option from Netgear and Design of Systems on Silicon to pipedata through a building's existing electrical infrastructure. This new 200Mbps Powerline HD technology uses DS2chipsets to allow bandwith-hungry multimedia content to be streamed from a PC to products in any room with anelectrical outlet, providing plug-and-play convenience at the expense of wireless freedom, as devices on the receivingend of the signal must remain tethered to the wall. The new Netgear/DS2 hardware will be on display next month atCeBIT, and should be available to consumers sometime in the second quarter of this year.
