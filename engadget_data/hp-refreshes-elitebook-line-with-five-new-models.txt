 
 HP is in full-on laptop-unveiling mode, and the company's business line isn't getting left out -- in fact, it has five new models -- including an 11-incher, a first for this series. The boardroom-bound EliteBooks are making the step up to Ivy Bridge, but it's also adding the option of LTE across the board. All models will ship with SRS Premium Sounds PRO and an optional 720p webcam. We have a complete breakdown of the models past the break, and you can find hands-on shots, along with the official press release below.




 The 2170p is the first 11-incher in the EliteBook line, and weighs in at 2.9 pounds. It's compatible with the same dock as HP's w-, p- and b- series, so businesses that want to upgrade to newer EliteBooks won't have to invest in new peripherals. So far, we simply know the processor is an ultra low voltage Ivy Bridge CPU, predictably coupled with Intel integrated graphics. Keyboard backlighting will be a customization option. The entry-level configuration will go for $999.

 If the naming doesn't give it away, the 2570p is an update to the ultraportable EliteBook 2560p. It has the same 12.5-inch display and weighs 3.6 pounds, making it slightly lighter than the 2560p. The 2570p is clearly the 'tweener of the EliteBook series: more powerful than the 2170p but a step below the larger models. The 2570p will start at $1,099 and, along with the 2170p, will be available on June 22nd.

 Moving on up, the 14-inch 8740p makes its official debut. We saw this business-rugged laptop last month, when a review leaked ahead of Intel's Ivy Bridge launch schedule. The 8470p replaces last year's 8460p, and it keeps the starting weight at 4.56 pounds. It makes similar claims about battery life as the previous model, too, promising 36 hours of runtime with both the extended battery and SSD. The 15-inch 8570p, a refresh of the 8560p, offers similar specs minus the display size. Both the 8740p and 8570p are available with dual- or quad-core Ivy Bridge CPUs, integrated graphics or an AMD Radeon 7570M graphics card with 1GB of dedicated memory and a choice of hard drives, SSDs and self-encrypting drives. Both models are also made to withstand the elements outside the office, and they pass MIL-STD 810G testing for dust, vibration and more. Both models will go for $899 starting on June 4th.

 Last is the EliteBook 8470w workstation, available with a 14-, 15- or 17-inch screen. The 14-incher has AMD graphics, while the 15-inch and 17-inch versions have an NVIDIA GPU with 4GB of video memory -- up from 2GB. HP retooled the trackpad and added a 50-percent brightness option to the backlit keyboard (for the 15- and 17-inch models only), but it kept the chassis from last year's w-series workstations. Availability and pricing aren't yet clear; HP simply says the 8470w will ship this summer.
