  Ever since T-Mobile and AT&T began touting their HSPA+ networks as "4G," the debate on the term's legitimacy has raged on. Regardless of how you feel about the matter, one thing's for sure: Apple's finally taken sides on the argument, and the company's all for it. In today's iOS update, Cupertino features an "updated AT&T network indicator," which means you'll see a 4G icon whenever you're in HSPA+ coverage. Granted, this doesn't actually mean you'll enjoy faster speeds -- you'll just have a warm and fuzzy feeling knowing that another G just got added to your screen. Such an action makes us wonder if Apple's slowly losing its ability to stand up against AT&T's wishes, not to mention the demands of other US carriers.
