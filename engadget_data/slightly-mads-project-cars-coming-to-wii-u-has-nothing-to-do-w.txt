  Slightly Mad Studios has added Wii U to the list of platforms for its crowd-funded racing title, Project Cars. Project Cars -- standing for "community-assisted racing sim" -- is already planned for release first on PC in 2013, and later on Xbox 360 and PS3.Slightly Mad's crowd-sourced approach to Project Cars allows fans to invest in the game and to access frequent builds, provide feedback throughout its development process and possibly add "video game producer" to their resumes.
