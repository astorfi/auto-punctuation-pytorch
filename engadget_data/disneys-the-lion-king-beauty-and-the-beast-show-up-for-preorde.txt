That includes an 8-disc collection pictured above with The Lion King on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy, The Lion King 1.5 on Blu-ray and DVD and The Lion King 2 on Blu-ray and DVD for $74.99, as well as a standard two disc set with just The Lion King on Blu-ray and DVD for $29.99. Also of note is a listing for Beauty and the Beast on Blu-ray 3D for $34.99. Check The Lion King's announce trailer again after the break, we'll let you know when special features, specs and release dates are available.
