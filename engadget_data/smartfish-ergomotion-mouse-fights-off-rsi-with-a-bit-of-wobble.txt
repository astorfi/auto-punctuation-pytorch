The ErgoMotion Mouse is a pretty straightforward wireless laser mouse, with large right and left click buttons, a nice big scroll wheel, and its own little USB wireless dongle. What makes it different is a truly odd raised platform that allows the mouse to tilt in all directions -- apparently providing for more natural motion. We tried it out for a bit, and while it certainly provides a fresh method of using the mouse, the very fact that it's working out more arm muscles simultaneously means that there will probably be a bit of fatigue at the outset. The ErgoMotion Mouse is available today for $50, and you can check out some video of it in action after the break.
