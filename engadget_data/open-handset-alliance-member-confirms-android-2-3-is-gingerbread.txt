Now it's looking confirmed that Gingerbread is indeed 2.3, with Alvaro Fuentes Vasquez, member of the leadership team at the Open Handset Alliance (and who shall now be known as "The Gingerbread Man"), delivering this tweet:

Prepare your Nexus One (Developer version) for Android OTA update 2.3 (Gingerbread) in the next few days :-D
That's some good news for many N1 owners, and of course means it's time for those who possess other Android handsets to start with the hoping and the waiting.
