Not like we've ever really needed Unkie Mossy to tell us the score, but you gotta love his money quote on how his
very own nano is
"badly scratched" only a month down the
line:



I have never tested or owned any portable electronic device that picked up as many scratches as quickly as the
 iPod nano.



Well, guess that settles that!
