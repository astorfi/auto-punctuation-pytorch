The banding, as mocked up above using ascreen shot of the issue, apparently makes normal color gradients impossible, kind of like knocking your monitor backdown to 256 colors after all these years. There a number of Anandtech (1, 2, 3) and Dell forums (linked below)threads on the topic; one user blamed the LG panel, as the issue has seemingly cropped up in some shipments of theL2000c, their 20-inch widescreen presumably based on the same panel, while others are claiming it's the DVI input.Anyone here seen this issue themselves, care to share your experiences?[Thanks, Ciber]
