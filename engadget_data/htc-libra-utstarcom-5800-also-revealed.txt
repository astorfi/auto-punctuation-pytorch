Details are yet scarce (so what else is new), but the super thin device will have a compacted keyboard (even by HTC's standards) with an offset space bar as well as an external numeric keypad. But wait, it gets better. EV-DO Rev. A radio. Q1 2007 launch. GSM version inbound for 07. Yeah, we know, we're pretty stoked too.
