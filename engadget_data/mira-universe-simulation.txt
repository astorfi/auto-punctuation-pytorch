 A universe that only exists in the mind of a supercomputer sounds a little far fetched, but one is going to come to live at the Argonne National Laboratory in October. A team of cosmologists is using IBM's Blue Gene/Q "Mira" supercomputer, the third fastest in the world, to run a simulation through the first 13 billion years after the big bang. It'll work by tracking the movement of trillions of particles as they collide and interact with each other, forming structures that could then transform into galaxies. As the project's only scheduled to last a fortnight, we're hoping it doesn't create any sentient characters clamoring for extra life, we've seen Blade Runner enough times to know it won't end well.
