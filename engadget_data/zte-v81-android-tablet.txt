 Not quite content with the release of its Grand S earlier this month, ZTE looks to be preparing a new tablet to go along with that aforementioned flagship handset. The V81 -- which will presumably make its official debut at this year's Mobile World Congress -- is, according to the company's own website, said to be boasting an 8-inch (1,024 X 768) display with a dual-core, 1.4GHz CPU (mum's the word on chipset specifics), 1GB RAM and 4GB of internal storage that can be expanded to up to 32GB via microSD. Speaking of which, other listed incisions include a full-size USB and HDMI, while a 3,700 mAh battery and Android Jelly Bean are also part of the relatively decent spec sheet. Naturally, pricing and availability details are still slim, but it shouldn't be too long before we learn more on that front -- in the meantime, there's a gallery filled with V81 press shots after the break for you to peruse over.
