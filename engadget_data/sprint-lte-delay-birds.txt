 Sprint mentioned that one of the holdups to get its LTE network rolled out is waiting for fiber-optic backhaul to be connected to its network sites. Of course, the company also mentioned a very different reason: birds. It turns out that some of the towers have become home to some avian families determined to hamper the uptake of high speed internet, which won't be activated until they migrate. We wouldn't advise you go with a stick trying to poke the nests from the sites -- we suspect the Humane Association is on the lookout for angry nerds.
