Twitter's coders have decided to inaugurate the App Store's arrival on Macs around the world tomorrow with a new version of their client for the platform. Such is the scuttlebutt coming from Razorianfly, who also managed to snatch up the screenshot above, though further details are predictably scarce. All we're told is that the new Twitter for Mac will have the option to perform real-time updates, native re-tweeting support, and a funky option described as "drag and drop" tweets. Well, there had to be some intrigue to this software update.
