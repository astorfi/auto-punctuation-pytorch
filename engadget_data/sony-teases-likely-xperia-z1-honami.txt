It appears that Sony is about to finally put an end to the rampant Honami smartphone speculation on September 4th. It just released a teaser video showing various oblique angles of the camera-centric handset, rumored to be called the Xperia Z1. Previous reports pointed to a 21-megapixel sensor, 4K shooting capability, a Snapdragon 800 processor, and a 5-inch, 1080p display. The video after the break shows its apparent waterproof talents as well, so a September 4th launch would put an end to the all the leaking.
