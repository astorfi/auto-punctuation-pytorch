Speaking at the company's Worldwide Partner Conference today, Windows chief Tami Reller announced the RTM timeframe, giving manufacturers ample time to prep new systems before the busy holiday season. A preview of Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows 8.1, has been available to download for several weeks, so you don't need to wait until autumn to take the refresh for a spin. You can snag that pre-release version at the source link below.
