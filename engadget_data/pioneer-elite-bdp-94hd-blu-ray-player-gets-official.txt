This second-generation Blu-ray player sports silky smooth 1080p output via HDMI, and supports Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital Plus, 7.1 surround sound, Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA), and "seamless home theater integration via HDMI Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) technology." Additionally, this device features an "enhanced version of Pioneer's Home Media Gallery home networking feature," which includes IP networking and a new user interface to access media files stored on their computer. The BDP-94HD should hit US shelves this month and will purportedly include two mystery BD films for a nice round $1,000. Click on through for another angle.
