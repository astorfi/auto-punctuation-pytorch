 Talk about distracting. While LG was discussing washing machines and other smart appliances, we couldn't take our eyes off the 55-inch OLED display sitting on the side of the stage. It's one of two new sizes being added to the family, alongside the enormous 84-inch model. The first thing you'll notice, if you've seen its bigger brother is that, all things considered, this is a fairly modest set. Well, relatively, of course. The next thing you'll pick up on is just how sharp the thing is. While playing some slow-motion video of liquid flying through the air throughout the event, it was impossible to take our eyes off the thing.

 We managed to get a little closer after the end of the event, and caught a glimpse of some really great viewing angles on the set -- though those were hampered a bit by the glossy finish. If you're not watching the screen on stage at a CES press event, however, that shouldn't be much of a problem. Also apparent once you approach is just how thin the set is -- the bezel, too. The TV will run $12,000 when it starts shipping in March, so start saving those pennies now.
