It's been sliced, it's been diced, it's been flaunted before. The ASUS MeMo Pad FHD 10 LTE -- a mouthful, we know -- was all but announced when CEO Jerry Shen brandished the slate on stage during Qualcomm's keynote at Computex. While we got our mitts on the dual-core Atom-based (Clover Trail+) non-LTE model in Taipei, the Snapdragon-equipped LTE version's been shrouded in mystery -- until now. ASUS just posted an official promo video on YouTube that outlines the tablet's specs: 9.9mm thick (vs. 9.5mm), 572g (vs. 580g), quad-core processor, stereo speakers, Miracast support, 5MP AF camera, 10-inch 1,920x1,200 IPS panel (178-degree viewing angles), 10-hour battery life, microSD card slot and an optional Folio Key keyboard cover. Not. Too. Shabby. Of course, it's unclear exactly which quad-core Qualcomm SoC the device features, but with LTE in the mix, we're guessing there's a Snapdragon 800 on the menu. Hit the break for the promo video.
