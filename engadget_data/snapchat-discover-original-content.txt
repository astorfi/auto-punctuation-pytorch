Back in August, Snapchat introduced the Story feature, allowing users to contribute snaps to a live feed for major events like the World Cup. That same month, details of the ephemeral sharing service's news and ad plans feeds also surfaced. Now, Digiday reports that not only will there be news, but the app is aiming to be a bit more ambitious. According to that site, when the newsy Discover feature goes live, it'll include original content from Snapchat on top of the posts from other media outlets (around a dozen, according to previous reports). In recent months, the company has nabbed writers and video producers formerly of MTV, News Corp and The Verge. The app is pushing animations for holiday to users' feed already, but the new project is said to bring videos that are several minutes in length. And what about those ads? The report claims they'll appear as both pre-roll content and Snapchat's usual disappearing messages. While there's not much info on what Discover will look like when it arrives, it seems all that new content will reportedly start to rollout this month.
