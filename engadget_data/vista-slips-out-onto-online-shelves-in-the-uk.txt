We're sure the Microsoftian repercussions will be swift and just, but for now you can snap up an OEM copy of Vista Home Basic for the low, low price of Â£54.99 in the UK ($109 US) from the oh-so-busted Overclockers UK online store. Of course, OEM operating system purchases aren't exactly on the up-and-up anyways, so this is just all the more exciting, right?[Via The Inquirer]
