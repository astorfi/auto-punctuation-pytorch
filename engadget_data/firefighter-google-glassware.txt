Not for firefighter Patrick Jackson, though, who's combined his talents for programming and winning wearables to create apps that help him and others out on the job. At this point, his software can push emergency calls to Glass and direct responders to locations and nearby hydrants with Google Maps. Currently, he's working on being able to pull up floor plans and other relevant information about buildings before entry, as well as vehicle diagrams and instructions for aiding in-car rescues. Jackson's #ifihadglass application also outlines the many benefits of streaming live video from an incident, so all he appears to have overlooked thus far is a warning system for Kurt Russell's worst enemy.
