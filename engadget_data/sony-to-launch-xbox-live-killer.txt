 Word is spreading like wildfire around the gaming community about a supposed scan from the upcoming Marchissue of PlayStation Magazine that seems to indicate Sony is planning to launch a "full-frontal assault" onMicrosoft's Xbox Live service. This new "PlayStation Network" is promised by a Sony insider to meet or exceedall of Live's capabilities and incorporate both the PS3 and PSP. Since no further details are available, we're gonnaconsider this "bigger than Live" talk to be just primping until we actually see some specs and screenshots.It's not a big surprise that Sony is heading in this direction--a recent online questionnaire signaled as much--theonly surprise here is why it's taken them so long to get their act together (and the current fragmented online optionsdon't count).[Via Joystiq]
