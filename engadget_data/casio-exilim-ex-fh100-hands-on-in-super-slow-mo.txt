The latest in its series of high speed cameras is the Exilim EX-FH100 point and shoot. It does 10 megapixel stills, high speed burst capture and up to 1,000 FPS video. Like with other Casio models, the higher the frame rate, the lower the resolution, but you can get a full VGA image at 120 FPS. At $349 it's practically a bargain if you absolutely need to do slow motion, and while it's a bit chubby and heavy in comparison to "fashionable" point and shoots, it's plenty capable as a stills camera to keep this from being a one trick pony. Check out the slow-motion capabilities after the break.
