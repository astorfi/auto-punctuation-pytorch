Early indications are the D3S is just as hot, adding a 720p24 video mode to the mix and allowing use of the camera's full aperture and ISO range while recording. Important, that, because this camera offers a ludicrously high maximum ISO value of 102,400 -- approaching night vision territory. That's thanks to a new 12.1 megapixel sensor, which is paired with a vibration mechanism to reduce dust. How well does the sensor perform? Nobody is apparently allowed to show us just yet, but tell us they have, with words like "simply incredible" and "fantastic feat" used to describe its low-light shooting. Seems we'll have to wait a bit longer for full reviews, but these previews will surely whet your appetite. Oh, and the cost? A mere $5,199.95.Read - Pocket-lint Nikon D3s hands-onRead - Digital Photography Review D3s hands-onRead - LetsGoDigital Nikon D3s "review"Read - TechRadar Nikon D3s "review"
