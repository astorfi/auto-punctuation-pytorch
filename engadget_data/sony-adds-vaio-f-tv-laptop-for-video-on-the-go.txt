The Vaio F TV serieswill, as the name implies, include features for viewing TV on the computer, including a built-in tuner, 15.4-inchdisplay, MPEG encoder card, remote control and dual-layer burner. However, it looks like Sony's hoping to have it bothways with these; the F TV series will come with Windows XP Pro, rather than MCE. [Via Akihabara News]
