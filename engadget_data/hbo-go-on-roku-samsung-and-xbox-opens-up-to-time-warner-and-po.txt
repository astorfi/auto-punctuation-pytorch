There's also a few small pics of the updated menus for Xbox 360 and Roku flashing the TWC logo, as well as currently unsupported providers Bright House Networks (both), as well as DirecTV and Comcast (Roku). We've contacted both HBO and Time Warner Cable for comment but have not received a response yet, but we'll keep an eye out for an expanded activation menus hitting our devices soon.
