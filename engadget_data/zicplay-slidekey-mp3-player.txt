Swiss manufacturer Zicplay will be unleashing a new MP3 player on the British Isles in mid-November, a small
flash-based model called the Slidekey. As its name suggests, this unit has a four-line, seven-color display that slides
away from the base to reveal a circular navigation button and the standard, never-used voice recorder. The Slidekey
will come in three capacities, 1GB (which adds an FM tuner), 512MB, and 256MB, for $178, $107, and $89,
respectively.
