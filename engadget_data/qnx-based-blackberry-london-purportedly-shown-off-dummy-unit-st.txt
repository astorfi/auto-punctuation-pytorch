  If the above image is to be trusted, what you spy with your little eye may be the very first BlackBerry smartphone to sport RIM's QNX-based operating system, known more recently as BBX. With bold angular lines that smack heavily of the P'9981, this touchscreen slab (code-named "London") is said to be thinner than the iPhone 4 and will dutifully stand tall when placed on its side. Before you get too excited, however, keep in mind that the above image could very well be a concept, prototype -- or, even a masterful forgery. For what it's worth, The Verge was informed that this model is merely a dummy unit, although the actual device is alleged to contain a 1.5GHz dual-core TI OMAP processor with 1GB of RAM and 16GB of on-board storage. An 8-megapixel rear camera is also said to be in the mix, along with a 2-megapixel front-facing shooter and a June 2012 release date. Sure, it's easy to be excited about Waterloo's forthcoming wares, but sadly we're forced to take this one with a heapin' spoonful of skepticism. So, who's hoping Mr. London becomes a reality?
