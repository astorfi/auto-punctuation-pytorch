The cloud storage outfit made a recent build (2.1.8.6 to be exact) of its mobile software available for download as a sneak preview of sorts. A few fortunate subscribers got first dibs, but you can grab a look for yourself at the improvements. The tweaks include video thumbnails, improved video playback on both ICS and Jelly Bean, a Nexus 7-friendly UI and the ability to open Dropbox files directly from other applications.
