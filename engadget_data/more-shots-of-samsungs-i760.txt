We came by a few "wild" shots of Samsung's i760 -- it's finally powered on and we can finally confirm it's running Windows Mobile 6 Professional. Unfortunately, it looks like they've yet to fix that godawful frontal-key layout (call and end on the sides? no Windows and ok button? are you kidding?). Judge for yourself in the photos, friends. Coming soon to a Verizon-covered neighborhood near you.
