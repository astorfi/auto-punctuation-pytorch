 While it's not like we really needed another highfalutin executive to takes sides, Disney's CEO is making sure you aren't holding out hope for a Cinderella remake on HD DVD. During a recent analyst call, Robert Iger reportedly responded to an inquiry about his take on HD DVD by stating that Disney has "made its bed with Blu-ray because it believes more in that format for a variety of reasons." Among those reasons were beliefs that Blu-ray boasted a sales record that "outpaced" HD DVD, and even went so far as to suggest that the forthcoming Pirates release would "widen that gap" even further. Interesting, Iger also suggested that once prices on standalone players begin to fall for both camps, retailers will likely choose to stock just the BD players as it attempts to simplify its inventory. Oh, and in case that wasn't bold enough, he even stated that the US is practically the only remaining nation where Blu-ray hasn't quite finished HD DVD off, but that it was only a matter of time before America followed suit.
