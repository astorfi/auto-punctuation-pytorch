Why not try on a pair of these itan ITN-VR10 headphones from RWC then, which vibrate in your ear (like a mosquito?) in reaction to what they perceive to be a large, booming force. These buds feature a standard 3.5-millimeter mini-jack for connecting to your favorite handheld game console and will last about 15-hours off battery. Available in Japan starting June 26 for about Â¥3,980 or $35.[Via Impress]
