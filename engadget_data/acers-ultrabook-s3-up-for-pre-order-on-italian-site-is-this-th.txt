A report over on Notebook Italia points to an Italian retailer's live pre-order page for an Ultrabook S3 -- naming that matches the Aspire S branding on the company's IFA booth. The notebook, listed as retailing for around 786 euros (or $1,133), is purported to include a Core i5 processor, 4GB RAM, 320GB of storage and an additional 20GB SSD. Much has been made of ASUS' and Intel's desire to hit the Ultrabook market at a sub-$1000 price point and, currency conversion aside, it's looking like Acer could also hit that target for its planned 13.3- and 11-inch ultraportables. With the Taiwanese electronics maker's official IFA presentation just two days away, expect to get the full skinny on these anorexic notebook entries.
