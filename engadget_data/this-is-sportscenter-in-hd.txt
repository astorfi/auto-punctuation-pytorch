The last new ones I noticed were one of the anchors stealing LeBron's throne from his desk at the ESPN office, Dwyane Wade editing his own highlight, and the Crocodile Hunter taking down the Florida Gators' mascot. It is entirely unlikely that I noticed the extra visual quality present in this spot due to the presence of tennis star (& sometime model) Maria Sharapova. Nope, no chance whatsoever. Did they only switch recently or have I just been missing the extra details?
