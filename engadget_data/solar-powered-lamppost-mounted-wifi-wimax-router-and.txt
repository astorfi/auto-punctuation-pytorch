A partnership between London-based sustainable development firm Kolam and Singapore-based networking expert Nex-G
Systems has yielded a solar-powered WiFi router/WiMax router/surveillance cam that can be situated atop a streetlight
(which is also solar-powered). The access point by StarSight uses a high gain omni antenna and a high gain parabolic
antenna to provide access/security to both developed and developing regions; it is already in use in Cameroon, with
plans for deployment to India, China, and Morocco.
