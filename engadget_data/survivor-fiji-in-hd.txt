 There has been one question that new HDTV fans have asked over and over again "When is Survivor going to be in HD?" According to the CBS.com the answer is February 8th 2007. Over the years we have come to trust their grid and although it has not always been 100% accurate in regards to what is going to be in HD, we are hoping that this time it is right. We may have to wait till next week to find out for sure, but if it is indeed going to be in HD, than this is truly a watershed moment, like with Good Morning America went HD. **Update** Ken H from AVS has confirmed with CBS, Survivor is NOT in HD this season.[Via HDTVMagazine]
