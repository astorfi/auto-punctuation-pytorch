We know you've got questions, and if you're brave enough to ask the world for answers, then here's the outlet to do so. This week's Ask Engadget inquiry is from Eric, who needs help overcoming a memory condition with regards his wallet. If you're looking to ask one of your own, drop us a line at ask [at] engadget [dawt] com.


"Hello! I've got a problem whereby I can forget things, and I've lost my wallet on more than one occasion. Naturally, the lack of technology makes it difficult to find, so is there a way I can add a tether (to alert my phone when it goes out of range) or a GPS tracker to save yet more tedious calls to cancel my credit cards? Thanks!"



That's an interesting puzzler, and certainly one that we think we should throw straight out to the wider community. What have y'all seen that'd help our friend Eric overcome his burdens and keep his wallet close to hand? You know where to leave your comments.
