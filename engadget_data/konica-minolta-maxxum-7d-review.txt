Luminous Landscape has a review of the
Maxxum 7D, Konica Minolta's new 6.1 megapixel prosumer
digital SLR which hasÂ  a contoured grip and design that allows for ergonomic handling, a big 2.5-inch LCD for
viewing, and fits most Minolta SLR lenses. The 7D's uniqueness comes in KM's Anti-Shake technology, which unlike other
SLRs, is built into the camera itself and not in the lenses, allowing for stabilized images no matter what lens you
use.
