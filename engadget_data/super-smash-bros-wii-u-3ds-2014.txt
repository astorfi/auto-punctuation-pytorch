Microsoft's got the Xbox One, Sony's got the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo? Nintendo's got Megaman. In its pre-E3 broadcast, the console maker has announced that a new version of party favorite Super Smash Bros. will be arriving on the Wii U and 3DS at some point next year. The company has taken the chance to freshen up the smashing lineup, adding the Villager from Animal Crossing and adding Megaman from, er, Megaman to the roster. If you'd like to see the announcement trailer for yourself, head on past the break and scrub forward to the 34 minute mark where it's now available in its standalone glory.
