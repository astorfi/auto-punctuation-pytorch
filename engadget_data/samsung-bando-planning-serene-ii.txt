 We'd figured that one asinine-looking piece of kit was enough out of Samsung's collaboration with Bang & Olufsen, but it seems our Korean and Danish friends might beg to differ. Telecoms Korea is reporting that Samsung believes the Serene somehow "greatly enhanced the image of Samsung mobile phones" and will be launching a follow-on model in early 2007. We're crossing our fingers this isn't all going to go down, but if it does, we suggest they lower the usability bar a little more by putting the keypad underneath the battery cover this time around.
