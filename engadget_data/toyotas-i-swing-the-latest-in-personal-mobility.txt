personal mobility vehicle. It can travel in either
two-wheel (Segway) mode when traversing a
busy sidewalk or "swing" into three-wheel mode for some good ol' fashioned street racing. The i-swing has joystick
control or can turn in response to body movement  as if "you were on skis." As part of the proposed concept, the i-swing would use artificial
intelligence to enable it "to grow, learning the habits and preferences of users" and then presumably replacing us all
Bridget Fonda SWF-like.
