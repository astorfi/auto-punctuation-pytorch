Not that demand doesn't outstrip supply on both. So did you get one? How do you like it? If not, that's cool, no shame in the game if you tried. But we want you to tell us about it. What happened? Did you get bum-rushed and smack into a pole like that one guy? Good luck out there everybody, and congrats to those like Triforce above, who were rewarded for their patience and effort.
