Although not officially due until September, reports are trickling in from around these United States of Gaming of an early release. Not too much of a surprise, we guess, what with European retailers all showing a Friday retail launch. One interesting thing to note is the SKU: at least one of these early rigs reads CECHK01, not CECHL01 as seen in the FCC... hmmm. SKU pictured after the break.[Thanks, Mr. Abulia] Read -- early 80GB Core PlayStation 3 Read -- CECHK01 SKU [Warning: sub req'd]Read -- Europe release on Friday
