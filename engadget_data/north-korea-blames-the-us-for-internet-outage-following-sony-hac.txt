It may appear we've reached a climax in the Sony Pictures hack saga - what with The Interview finally seeing a theatrical release - but the international finger pointing is alive and well. Today, North Korea's National Defense Commission is accusing the US of causing nation-wide internet outages, while likening the government to a snot-nosed child playing games. According to Reuters, a statement from the Commission carried by the country's official news agency KCNA reads:



The United States, with its large physical size and oblivious to the shame of playing hide and seek as children with runny noses would, has begun disrupting the Internet operations of the main media outlets of our republic.




A spokesperson for the government went on to call the situation "truly laughable," and again denied accusations that it was involved in attacks on Sony Pictures, calling for the FBI to back up its claims.

The Associated Press reports that the National Defense Commission's went on to accuse President Obama of being responsible for The Interview, a film it referred to as "illegal, dishonest and reactionary." An anonymous spokesperson furthered the accusation with a stereotypically racist depiction of the President: "Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest."
