The Boomslang Collector's Edition 2007 will make its debut at this summer's DreamHack, will be limited to 10,000 units worldwide, and will be encased in a sleek titanium housing. Moreover, the mouse will glow green from underneath to add that final dash of 1337-ness at a dark LAN party, but there's no word yet on DPI nor price.[Via Electronista]
