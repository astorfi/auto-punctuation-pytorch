While its rumored release date has come and gone, non-functional models such as this are commonly offered to consumers in a retail setting to poke and prod to their heart's content. Nonetheless, the hands-on offers a few interesting details, such as a soft touch backside and insight into the redesigned keyboard, which is described as "the best one yet on a Droid handset." Whether we agree with that assertion will be determined come review time, but if you're interested to see the collection of up-close and personal shots with Moto's latest slider, be sure to check the source below.
