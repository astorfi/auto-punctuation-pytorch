Rest easy, George Jetson, Bang & Olufsen has brought its Automatic Color Management, previously seen in the BeoVision 4, to the top-of-the-line BeoVision 9 plasma. The 50-inch plasma display that already has an integrated center channel speaker with an acoustic lens will be adding the auto-calibration feature in July. You'll definitely notice the added feature -- every 120 hours of viewing, a robotic arm with a camera (pictured) will flip down from the top of the display, take a white balance measurement, and adjust the set accordingly. Sounds great, but no word in the press release regarding pricing or an upgrade of the panel to 1080p. Seeing as the outgoing version of the BeoVision 9 goes for about $20,000, would that be too much to ask?UPDATE: The spec sheet [warning: PDF link] on the B&O site still shows a 1366 x 768 pixel display for the BeoVision 9, but our sources say that the $19,900 price nets you a 1080p panel. - Thanks, Alex!
