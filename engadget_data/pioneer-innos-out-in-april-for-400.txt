 Been waiting to snag one of those sweet Pioneer Inno XM players that took the cake at this year's CES? Well your patiencewill be rewarded at some point this month -- they may have missed their first quarter launch, but XM's got the PioneerInno on pre-order for that expected $400 cash money. Not a peep yet regarding the Samsung Helix we were extra specially stoked about, but this shoulddo the trick in the mean time for portable live sat rad.[Thanks, candlebougie and Dave M]
