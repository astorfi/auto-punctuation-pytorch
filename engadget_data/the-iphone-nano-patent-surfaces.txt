The above concept image shows an intriguing possible solution to this market need, as it appears that the design is all-iPod (not iPhone). We like the iPod design with a phone thrown into the mix ala click wheel; we really do. We'd love to see this device from Apple as the iPhone nano, and with a patent recently on a "touch pad with symbols based mode," maybe the iPhone nano is on its way. For the legit needs of a cellphone simpleton, this may just fir the bill if it ever materializes.
