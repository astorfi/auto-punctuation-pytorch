 

Whether or not your cable TV provider has decided to offer live TV streaming to your mobile devices, you can do it yourself with the new HDHomeRun iPad app from Elgato. Paired with one of SiliconDust's new HDHomeRun Prime CableCARD tuners, the $17.99 app can tune into cable channels that are sent without encyption or are marked copy freely (varies from provider to provider) and even allows users to record them right on the app. Restrictions include that it only works on the iPad 2, with standard definition MPEG-2 channels and (for now) only the most recent HDHomeRun hardware is supported. Check out the video demo for more information on exactly how it works or click the source link to get to iTunes and buy -- in a market suddenly flooded by CableCARD tuners maybe this extra functionality is just what's needed to tip the balance between one device or another.

The App works in conjunction with the Silicondust HDHomeRun PRIME line of CableCard™-enabled network tuners, and it enables users to stream and record live premium cable TV to iPad 2. Whether you want to watch the news in the kitchen while you make dinner, or the baseball game on the patio on a warm evening, or late night TV without disturbing anyone, the HDHomeRun PRIME App enables viewing and recording of live cable TV anywhere in your home's Wi-Fi network. 		Elgato's HDHomeRun App and Silicondust HDHomeRun PRIME together deliver premium television and DVR capabilities to iPad 2. The HDHomeRun PRIME device sends the TV signal straight to the HDHomeRun PRIME App, so there is no need for the user to turn on a computer. This saves energy and adds to the ease of use that users have come to expect from Elgato products. In addition, the HDHomeRun PRIME App lets the user record programs directly to their iPad with the option of transferring those recordings from the iPad 2 to a Mac or PC. 		Elgato's latest solution streams cable TV "copy freely" channels to iPad 2. Users with Verizon FiOS or Comcast cable television have a particular advantage, since the majority of channels from these providers are sent with a 'copy freely' flag. And naturally, users receive all the unencrypted digital cable TV (Clear QAM) channels offered by their cable provider. 		"With our new HDHomeRun PRIME App, we wanted to offer iPad 2 users even more accessibility to their favorite TV programming," said Adam Steinberg, Elgato's VP of Marketing. "Our HDHomeRun solution opens up a world of TV viewing options for users. Couple this with the fact that you don't need a computer to enable the streaming of live TV to iPad 2, and the constraints of archaic TV watching are a thing of the past." 		"Elgato is an innovative leader for TV content control on Apple devices. Silicondust has collaborated for years with Elgato to ensure users the ability to control digital TV on their home network, using the HDHomeRun line of products," said Theodore Head, Silicondust's President / CEO. "This new app continues our vision of Freedom Across Your Home Network allowing you to Watch, Pause, Record Live Digital TV Anywhere in your home, and now from your iPad 2." 		The HDHomeRun PRIME App is available for the introductory price of $17.99 from the App Store on iPad 2 or at:		www.itunes.com/apps/hdhomerun. 		HDHomeRun PRIME is available for $249.99 from http://www.hdhomerun.com/products/hdhomerun/prime 		To view a video demonstration of HDHomeRun PRIME, click here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spBMS2yMCzk&feature=youtu.be 		*Note that Elgato's HDHomeRun App is only compatible with Silicondust's HDHomeRun PRIME hardware, not previously debuted HDHomeRun products.
