 It's really that upcoming 21Mbps HSPA+ action that has us all hot and bothered, but T-Mobile USA took a nice little interim step today in announcing that its entire 3G footprint has now been upgraded from 3.6 to 7.2Mbps. Considering that AT&T won't be at 100 percent 7.2Mbps coverage for some time to come, this is a nice little boost -- of course, T-Mob's got a smaller network to contend with, so it's a trade-off for customers. Can someone do us a favor and drop us a line when we can finally have both a blazing network and coverage everywhere? At the same time?
