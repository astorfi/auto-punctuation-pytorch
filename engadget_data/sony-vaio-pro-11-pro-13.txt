If you've been mourning Sony's decision to discontinue its super-thin Z Series laptop, you can at last dry your tears: the company just announced two flagship Ultrabooks that should more than make up for your loss. For starters, the VAIO Pro 11 and Pro 13 each weigh less than the Z, at 1.92 and 2.34 pounds, respectively -- in fact, Sony claims they're the lightest touchscreen Ultrabooks ever made. They also last longer on a charge and have an optional sheet battery that promises to double the battery life, providing up to 14 hours on the Pro 11 and 13 hours of use on the Pro 13. Presumably, they're faster too: both ship with Haswell processors, and the 13-inch version in particular will be offered with PCIe solid-state drives. And, lest you worry Sony evolved the Z too much, its flagship laptops are still made of carbon fiber from top to bottom. 

Either way, you'll have your choice of Core i5 and i7 processors, with 1080p IPS displays, NFC, backlit keyboards and Exmor webcams all standard. Just about the only things you won't get back from the Z are a dedicated GPU and an optical drive. (And who wants a DVD writer, anyway?) If nothing else, perhaps the price might convince you to settle for integrated graphics: these machines are considerably more affordable than the Z, which started at two grand. Now, in the year 2013, you can pay $1,150 and up for the Pro 11, or $1,250-plus for the Pro 13. They'll be available June 9th with black and silver color options, but if you have to know more now, we actually have a review of the Pro 11 ready for your perusal. (Spoiler alert: we like it. We like it a lot.)

Latest Windows 8 Mobile PCs Combine Sony's Display, Digital Imaging, and Sound Technology with Innovative New Form Factors
TAIPEI, TAIWAN, June 4, 2013 – Sony today introduced the world's lightest touch-enabled Ultrabook™, the VAIO® Pro, perfect for the mobile professional or student on the go who demands premium performance in an incredibly light, durable and ultra-sleek design. In addition, the next evolution of the slider hybrid PC, the VAIO Duo 13, features an improved design and a multitude of new use solutions with its unique form factor and versatile pen solution. The new VAIO Pro and VAIO Duo PCs are the latest additions to the comprehensive summer portfolio for VAIO which includes the existing family-friendly VAIO Tap 20 and entertainment-centered VAIO Fit.
Distinctly SonyDrawing on Sony's TV heritage of delivering the best picture quality, the new VAIO Pro and VAIO Duo lines feature TV technology which results in a sharp and gorgeous Full HD (1920 x 1080) display. The same TRILUMINOS Display for mobile technology in Sony's top BRAVIA® models recreates incredibly rich natural colors in the new VAIO Pro and Duo PCs. Due to a wider color range, the technology renders hard to reproduce reds, blues, and greens more accurately, giving mobile devices the ability to display intense colors better than ever before.
In addition to TRILUMINOS Display for mobile, the new VAIO PCs employ Sony's super resolution picture engine, X-Reality™ for mobile. X-Reality for mobile analyzes each image by comparing each frame to its built in database and reducing visual noise, replacing corrupted pixels and correcting black levels to optimize quality, creating the sharpest videos, regardless of the content source. The combination of these technologies ensures that VAIO users truly experience a level of picture quality that exceeds expectations.
In addition, the Exmor R® for PC CMOS Sensor technology developed by Sony provides high-quality camera functionality.
The display technologies and exceptional camera quality are fused with Sony's ClearAudio+ to provide a louder and clearer sound that is distinctly Sony. With unique sound processing technologies, listeners hear dynamic bass and soaring highs with clarity and less distortion for an unmatched music and movie experience.
"By combining the power of Sony's display, digital imaging and sound technology with new and innovative form factors, VAIO is offering a variety of new ways for consumers to interact with their PCs," said Pedro LaFarga, SVP, Sony VAIO & Networked Products Division. "The PC landscape is undergoing a tremendous amount of change and Sony VAIO is leading the transformation with new ultra-portable devices that enhance and enrich individuals' lifestyles in both work efficiency and play."

While increasing the screen size and minimizing the bezel in order to maximize the viewing experience, the new VAIO Duo 13 was still able to maintain nearly the same footprint and weight as the original VAIO Duo 11.
Surf Slider® DesignThe newly engineered Surf Slider® design features a slimmer hinge allowing for a quick and seamless transition between tablet and laptop modes. With one hand, users can slide the sturdy screen back to reveal a full-sized backlit keyboard and track pad.

Camera and Pen solutionsVAIO Duo PC's 8-megapixel rear-facing camera features the Exmor RS for PC image sensor and makes it possible for the first time to take images of documents clear enough for the computer to recognize and tag text in the photos. The Exmor RS for PC image sensor technology combined with the new CamScanner application enables users to take crisp images of documents using the computer's camera as if it were a scanner and edit and organize multiple documents. CamScanner also has the ability to straighten images of documents and photos taken at odd angles, allowing individuals to focus on taking photos of important material instead of lining up the perfect shot.
Conveniently stored on the side of the PC in an ink well or clip, the intuitive digitizer stylus allows for a more accurate and natural writing experience. Simply pick up the pen from its holder and instantly wake the PC to write, draw or tap the touchscreen effortlessly.
