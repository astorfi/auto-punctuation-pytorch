Stanford professor Mark Cutkosky brings us yet another robot that's taken
cues from biology, and yet another robot that
climbs walls — the Spinybot uses 10 pairs of tiny spines
on its toes to scale concrete, stucco or brick. Its tail rests against the wall to provide extra balance, a mounted
video camera sends back the visuals, and a 400-gram payload can be delivered to its destination — although this initial
version of the Spinybot has some work to be done on the software side before it can autonomously inspect buildings and
deliver the goods. Like the Snakebot, one of its proposed
applications is surveillance, so if you see one of these hanging out in a dark alley you might want to stash your
stash.
