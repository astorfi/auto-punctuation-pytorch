 Granted, nothing was set in stone in regard to the Eee PC's release date, but those hoping to snag one before heading off to college may be out of luck. According to a user who inquired to Asus about the launch status of the diminutive machine here in the US, he was informed that current estimates show the device "hitting the market in mid-September to early-October." Unfortunately, the response also included the wee fact that specifications aren't yet "100-percent firm," and considering that the aforementioned dates are mere months away, that kind of uncertainty isn't exactly comforting.[Via Eee User, thanks Devon]
