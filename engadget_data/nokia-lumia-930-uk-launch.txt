Smartphone aficionados might be familiar with the combination of 5-inch 1080p display, quad-core Snapdragon 800 chip and 20-megapixel camera, given the 930 already exists in the US as the Lumia Icon. This international edition comes with Windows Phone 8.1 right out the box (no developer loophole required), and we've just learnt it'll be available in the UK from July 17th. We don't have a SIM-free price to report currently, but you should be able to pick one up on contract from most major carriers and retailers from around £33 per month. Each handset will come with a wireless charging pad included in the box, and until the end of July, each purchase will also come with a special starter pack including a portable wireless charger, Bluetooth speaker and £20 app voucher.
