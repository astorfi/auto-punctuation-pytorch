The feature, which adds large previews of websites along the right rail with a simple click of a magnifying glass, has popped up at random for various users over the past couple of months (Google's stealthy testing process), but now it's available to just about everybody. Once it's activated you can tab through the previews with your arrow keys, and Google automatically loads up all the preview images if you look just one (to aid with the "instant" aspect). Expect civilization to come to a grinding halt tomorrow or maybe the day after.
