 Is that an exodus we smell, or what? Nary 24 hours after Motorola's chief marketing officer decided to start his weekend early by parting ways with the company, along comes word that the (now-former) president of Motorola's Mobile Devices business is doing the same. According to a breaking release from Moto, Stu Reed's departure is "effective immediately," and Greg Brown, company president and CEO, made mention that the outfit "appreciates [his] many contributions and wishes him the best in the future." As of now, there's no word on who's lined up fill Mr. Reed's shoes, but it seems the pool of choices could be dwindling.
