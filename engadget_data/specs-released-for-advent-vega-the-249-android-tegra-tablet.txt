The biggest modification is the size, down to 10-inches from 15, though the 1GHz NVIDIA Tegra chipset is still in there with its 1080p abilities in tow. Alas, a 1024 x 600 resolution on the capacitive touchscreen puts something of a damper on that, but HDMI output means it'll tickle the pixels nicely on your HDTV. There's a 1.3 megapixel webcam, 802.11bg WiFi, a 3G SIM slot, 512MB each of ROM and RAM, and naturally microSD expandability, with a 4GB card included. The OS is Android 2.2 (Market support unknown) and battery life is rated at a quite impressive 6.5 hours of 1080p video, enough to watch both the animated and JCV-featuring Street Fighter movies in one sitting. The best part? The thing is supposed to hit giant UK retailer Dixons next week, on October 18, for Â£249 -- just under $400 American. That's an unsubsidized price, and a rather attractive one at that.

Update: Video after the break, and Android Community managed a hands-on. Thanks, Kevin.
