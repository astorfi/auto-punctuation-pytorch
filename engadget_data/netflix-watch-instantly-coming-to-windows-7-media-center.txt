No hard release date yet or big surprises here as Vista owners got this access some time ago and Extenders still don't support Silverlight. The good news though is that the app will be full touch screen capable, so for those with the right hardware you'll have the same great improvements you have in the rest Windows 7. Media Center fans might also be happy to hear that more features were promissed in regards to "TV on the PC."
