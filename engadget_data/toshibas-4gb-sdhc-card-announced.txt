 Toshiba has been quietly undercutting the US, SD card market for years hawking their wares under the brands of PNY and Dane-Elec among others. Now, they've stepped out from behind the curtain with their new, self-branded, 4GB SDHC (SD 2.0) cards which will initially feature a minimum write speed of 4MB/s (class 4) with the promise of 32GB cards in the coming years. Said to begin shipping globally in September for an undisclosed price, Tosh's foray into these next-gen, SD-incompatible cards for FAT32-enabled hosts will join Panny's roughly $265, 4 gigger to help keep the price down on yet another memory card format nobody wants.[Via DigitalCameraInfo]
