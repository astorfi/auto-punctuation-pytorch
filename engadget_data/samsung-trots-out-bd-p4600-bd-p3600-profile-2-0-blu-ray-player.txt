It only takes a glance to see that Samsung has certainly broken away from the boxy mold with its latest BD decks, and we couldn't be happier about it. The BD-P4600 -- which we spotted on the show floor a few days back -- is just 1.5-inches thin with a piano black design, ruby highlights and a clear, "prism-like edging." Both units support Profile 2.0 (BD-Live) interactivity, DVD upscaling, DivX support (huzzah!), touch sensitive controls, 1GB of internal memory and a pair of USB 2.0 ports. Of note, one of those USB sockets will get filled with an included 802.11b/g/n WiFi dongle, but those still wary of cord-free internet can hook things up via Ethernet. Finally, we'll mention that the pair decodes the latest high-res audio formats and includes an HDMI 1.3 port, while the P3600 includes 7.1-channel analog audio outs for good measure. Take a wild guess at the pricing and availability -- you might be close.
