Oh Peter Aloisson, we know you're killing this world with your 30k cellphone pricetags, but your aim's gotta be
pretty damn true to take on a million dollar project. That's right, dude's whipping up a solid gold phone with about
2,600 natural blue diamonds for "a German manufacturer" who intend to use it for promotional purposes. Hmm, which
German cellphone manufacturer that burns money faster than a cash furnace could they
possibly be referring to?
