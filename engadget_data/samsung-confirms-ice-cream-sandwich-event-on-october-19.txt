Of course we've already had a whiff of what it looks like in a video, and sampling the new Music and Google+ apps gave us another good look. But now we're set to see it for real, and if all goes well we might just get some new hardware out of the deal, too. Will this be the day the Nexus Prime makes us think that flat smartphones are... well... square? We'll be there live to let you know as it happens.

	The event takes place 10:00am HKT, which is conveniently 10:00pm EST on October 18th. A primetime liveblog and gadget unveiling? Can't wait.
