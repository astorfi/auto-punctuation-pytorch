Overall, they found the beta a major improvement over Vista and predict the final release will put Microsoft in consumers' good graces again. Here's hoping that apparent January beta release comes to fruition so we can sweep that other OS under the rug a little bit faster.Update: Looks like Tech Cast News is down, standby for innovative Ballmer-based conspiracy theories.Update 2: ... and it's back!
