That bit of information comes from a French reseller, who says that he's already ordered the new laptops but wasn't told exactly what the updates would be -- although the betting still seems to be on LED backlighting and a Santa Rosa upgrade. Lending a tad more credence to this latest rumor is the fact that a June 5th launch would coincide with the start of Apple's Back to School program, whereas a WWDC launch would cause a spec change a week into the promotion. Either way, it looks like we won't have to wait too much longer to put this round of rumors to rest.
