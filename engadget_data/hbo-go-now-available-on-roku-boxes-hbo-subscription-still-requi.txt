HBO Go streaming has been pushed to Roku boxes around the known universe. As of now, Roku addicts can tap into unlimited access to over 1,400 HBO programs (that's movies, original series, sports, comedy, etc.), with one mondo stipulation: you have to be an HBO subscriber via some pay-TV company. Of course, HBO Go can also be accessed via your laptop, and you've probably got some form of HBO on-demand already, but look -- this is better. This is comprehensive. Use it, and don't ask questions. Capiche?
