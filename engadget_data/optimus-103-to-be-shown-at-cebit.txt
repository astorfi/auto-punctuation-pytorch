According to Art's LJ, they've been hard at working optimizing the key sizes and shapes for interchangeability; they're now down to three size, which should come in handy when keys start dying off and you don't want to run to the store for another $1200 keyboard. That late-2007 deadline is still in effect, so ogle at the potential, and cross your fingers for the waiting to come to an end.[Thanks, Nicholas M]
