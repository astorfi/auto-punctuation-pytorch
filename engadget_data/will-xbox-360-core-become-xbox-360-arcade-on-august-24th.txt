Word on Box Street is that Microsoft is about to upend the low-impact Core units, add an HDMI port, throw five free XBLA games in the mix, slap on a wireless controller, and put a new line of text somewhere on the box. Otherwise the system will remain the same -- AKA no hard drive, white finish, and a target of constant ridicule by your friends, and will be made available for â‚¬279 (or about $376). The whole thing makes you wonder if this could have something to do with that discontinued SKU rumor we keep hearing about in the US. Can't wait to find out? Join the club.[Via Joystiq]
