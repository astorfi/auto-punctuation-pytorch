The newest member of the overflowing Eee family, the 900A continues the mix-and-match product development trend -- it's basically a 901 in the case of 900, but with a crappier webcam (.3 megapixels) and no Bluetooth. Yep, same 1.6GHz Atom proc, 1GB of RAM and 8 or 16GB SSD as the 901, just in the case of the 900. Why would anyone want to spend â‚¬299 ($465) on this? Totally unclear -- just like the entire Eee PC lineup.[Via jkkmobile]
