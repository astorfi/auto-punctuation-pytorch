Over in Japan, Tamagotchis had long ago
learned how to speak cellphone, which apparently resulted
in some serious miscegenation because Bandai America is now coming out with a Tamagotchi that lives wholly inside your
mobile (Ghost in the Cell? We had to, we had toâ€¦). The new mobile version of the nauseatingly popular virtual pet toy
of yore (does 1996 count as "yore"?) is set to take over roll out this summer, and will also include a
bunch of new features such as a journal mode to keep track of your "parenting" endeavors and a facts feature so you can
get to know your pet's "personality." But the best part is that this Tamagotchi version is more resilient than the
originals, and can stand as much prolonged neglect as you lavish on your real pets. Did we say that out loud?
