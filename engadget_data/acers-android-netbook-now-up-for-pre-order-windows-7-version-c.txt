However, the company is apparently a little unsure of its open source OS offerings, so it's throwing Windows on there as well. Your $349 will get you a dual-booting machine with good 'ol XP taking up the other partition -- a good thing, that, because Android in this application has been said to be half-baked at best. Meanwhile, Acer is also showing off a version of the D250 running Windows 7, which is set to hit Japan next week. Hopefully a Win7/Android super combo will soon be on offer as well, which sounds a bit more tasty than WinXP/Android.[Via netbooked]Read - Android Aspire One D250 Pre-OrderRead - Windows 7 Aspire One D250
