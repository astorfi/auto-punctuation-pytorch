 Actually, I'll still have to wear glasses because my eyesight is so poor. I just won't have to wear 3D glasses. Newsight Corporation just demonstrated their real-time 3D HDTV images at the IFA show. No special glasses are required because of the method and technology used.Utilizing software processing, HD video streams are passed through a converter chip that creates eight stereo views on-the-fly. A proprietary filter is applied so that each of the eight views is projected in eight slightly different directions on an LCD monitor. The human eye detects the different scenes and perceives a three-dimensional view. According to Newsight, they intend to apply this technology to one of the 2006 World Cup events. I can just imagine people ducking from a soccer ball that will never hit them.
