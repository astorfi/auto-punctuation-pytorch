 PSP? We don't need no stinkin' PSP. While
the rest of the world falls before the PlayStation Portable juggernaut (or
doesn't), Benjamin Heckendorn, who created the
Portable PlayStation 2, is hard at work on a portable game console for the rest of us: the Phoenix 2600, based on the
venerable Atari 2600. Heckerdon is currently working on a prototype, and expects the final custom-made product to go
for about $300 with the trade-in of an existing 2600. Yes, you have to give up your original console; but that seems
like a small price to pay for the looks of envy and incredulity you'll get when you whip this thing out and launch a
round of Asteroids or Pitfall.
