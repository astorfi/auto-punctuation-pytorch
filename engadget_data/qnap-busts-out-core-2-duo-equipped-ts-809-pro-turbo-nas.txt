Enter the TS-809 Pro Turbo, an 8-bay behemoth capable of housing 8 SATA hard drives (up to 16TB, or .98 million copies of Friday the 13th, when 2GB HDDs are widely available). The unit gets powered by a 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo, which definitely means that your next NAS may posses more processing power than the antiquated PC it's connected to. Additionally, there's 2GB of DDR2 RAM, read / write rates of 126MB/s and 111Mb/s (respectively), and support for a litany of business-related advanced features. Mum's the word on price, but you can bet it'll be up there.
