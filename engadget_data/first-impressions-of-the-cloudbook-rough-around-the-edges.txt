 The folks over at Laptop already hooked us up with some unboxing pics of Everex's Cloudbook, and now they've posted up some quickie first impressions of the would-be Eee killer -- and it looks like Everex could use that extra delay time to polish things up. The Cloudbook's gOS build was found to be reasonably speedy and the minuscule trackpad designed for thumb usage actually grew on the reviewers, but what really killed the machine was a host of video glitches Everex says are the result of the wrong OS version being installed on the machine. Still, we're not ready to give up on this little guy yet -- we'll wait to see what the formal reviews say before crowing the Eee the winner of this round.
