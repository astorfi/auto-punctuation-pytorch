 
Listen, E3, we had some good times. We shook like maniacs for your motion controllers. We jammed with the band (and our resident DJ, Stab Master Arson). We skated all over the place. We liveblogged like crazy. We basically took your news flow and funneled it into a succinct package of mind-blowing media snacks. But that was then, and this is now. We had to hightail it out of town, because a certain someone needs our special brand of tenderness... and that certain someone is Apple's WWDC in San Francisco. We'll miss you E3, but only a little bit.Seriously guys, gear up for WWDC this coming Monday (June 8th), where some kind of new phone or something might get announced. Here's the page you'll want to plant yourselves at (feel free to bookmark), and here's what time you'll want to do said planting:07:00AM - Hawaii 10:00AM - Pacific 11:00AM - Mountain 12:00PM - Central 01:00PM - Eastern 06:00PM - London 07:00PM - Paris 02:00AM - Tokyo (June 9th)
