The first thing we'd do with it is go back to 1989 and stop them from making that second
sequel, but some guy is selling a 1981 DeLorean on eBay that's been tricked out to look exactly like the one used in
the Back to the Future movies, complete with the time machine consoles, exterior flashing lights, and the
all-important flux capacitor.
