Not only did we happen to come across a purported leak of the device itself, which suggested the handset would pack a 4.6-inch display and an 8 megapixel camera, but now a placeholder has popped up on Amazon's German site with a few contrasting specifications -- most notably, a 4.7-inch screen and a 12 megapixel camera. We're still a bit skeptical, because this is far from official, but the fact that the smartphone is shipped and sold by Amazon itself adds a wee bit of credence to the product listing. Only time will tell which set of specs -- if any -- are the correct ones, but the build-up to the Galaxy S III just got a whole lot more interesting.
