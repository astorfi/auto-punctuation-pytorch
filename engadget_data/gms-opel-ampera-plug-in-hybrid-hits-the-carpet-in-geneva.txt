It's looking pretty "fit," as they say overseas, and will go into production late 2011. Internals are just what we're used to with the Volt, with a 16kWh lithium-ion battery that takes the car 60km (about 37 miles) and a gas powered generator for recharging the battery once depleted, that can extend the range to more than 500km (about 311 miles). Videos galore are after the break.
