We first picked up on this peculiar "confectionery affection" back when Engadget Spanish featureda chocolate PSPas part of a contest they were running, and we recently spotted an even more intricate Chocobox 360controller (wireless, of course). Well now we've seen a sculpted masterpiece that "takes the cake" in thisnascent art, an entire chocofied Xbox 360 console that's located in Microsoft's European BeNeLux headquarters, thatmanages to look both entertaining and delicious at the same time. Microsoft engineers say that they are very close toproducing a fully functional version of this chocolate 360, but they're being held back by a problematic power brickdesign- apparently the darn thing keeps melting itself on startup.[Via Joystiq]
