Well, we've got some phenomenal news for you: Microsoft has placed its Photosynth application up for grabs on the Marketplace. It's simple, the app -- which doesn't cost a dime -- will let you shoot some 360-degree photos in both landscape and portrait mode. Additionally, you'll be able to share those all-around shots with your friends on Twitter as well as the newly public Zuck network. You can snag Redmond's Photosynth v1.0 now straight from your WP device or from the Marketplace link below -- let's just hope you can give that London panorama a run for its money.
