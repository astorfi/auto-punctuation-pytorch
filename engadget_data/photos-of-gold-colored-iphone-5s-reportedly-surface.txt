Tired of Apple offering iPhones solely in black or white? If photos obtained by MacBoutic are accurate, you'll get some variety soon... and some bling, for that matter. The repair shop's images reportedly show an iPhone 5S shell in a simulated gold color, supporting recent spec predictions from KGI analyst (and frequent AppleInsider tipster) Ming-Chi Kuo. While it's difficult to verify the snapshots when MacBoutic has erased all logos, this doesn't look like an aftermarket project; the hue extends to normally inaccessible parts of the phone, for example. As a result, we won't be surprised if we see a flashy gold iPhone at Apple's rumored September 10th event.
