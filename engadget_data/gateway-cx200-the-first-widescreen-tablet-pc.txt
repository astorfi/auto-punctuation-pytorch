We caught a long hands-on gander at Gateway's new CX200 about a month ago and really dug it—PC Magazine had a look,
too, and pronounced the convertible tablet fairly droolworthy. The widescreen 14-inch display is crisp and on a sturdy
hinge, the components fast, and the feature set overall quite decent for its $1905 (configured) pricepoint. Weighing in
at 6.9 pounds, the unit is powered by the fast Pentium M 770 processor, 1GB RAM, and an ATI Mobility Radeon X600 on the
graphics tip. Battery life is about five hours, with add-on options available. The pen is thick and comfortable
compared to other tablet styli, though there tends to be a slight delay at times in using it. Still and all, the CX200
is a workhorse of a tablet if you're looking for a machine that can serve in lieu of a desktop workstation—and the
widescreen, ain't nothing like it.
