According to CE Pro, FCC documentation has been found describing something called the Verizon Home Monitoring Gateway and Home Monitor Service. Apparently based on technology from 4Home, the Z-Wave compliant system uses a Westell-branded Control Point gateway featuring Internet connectivity and automation capabilities. The site also describes widgets for controlling surveillance cameras and various room modes, such as "Home," "Away" or "Movie Time!" Devices can be accessed and functions scheduled either through a web browser or directly from Verizon mobile phones equipped with a "4Home" button. Neither Verizon nor 4Home have yet commented on any of this, but we're keeping our eyes peeled.
