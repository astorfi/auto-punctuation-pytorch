This new so-called Avatar Digital Binocular Sports camera, however, will never be saddled with labels like "boring" or "practical." It's big selling point, as you can see, is 21x optical zoom that gets further bolstered by a blinding 40x digital zoom, all of which apparently must be managed without such niceties as auto focus. On the business end of the equation is a 2-megapixel camera with a 2.5-inch LCD, which just so happens to also double as a full-fledged media player with a curiously familiar-looking interface (check it out after the break). The best news? It's available to order right now for just $128, or even less if you buy 'em in bulk. Never to early to start that holiday shopping.[Via Red Ferret]
