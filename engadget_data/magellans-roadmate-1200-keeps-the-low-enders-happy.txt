Turns out, the company has oh-so-quietly released a (relatively unsightly) RoadMate 1200, which has managed to slip under the radar until now. Spotted online in a number of locations for less than $200, this 3.5-inch navigator features a QVGA touchscreen, a Centrality Atlas processor, QuickSpell / SmartDetour functions, 1.3 million POIs, NAVTEQ maps of the continental United States / Puerto Rico / Hawaii on a 1GB SD card and a rechargeable Li-ion that's good for around three hours. It's a real yawner, we know, but there's a decent chance this thing's pricetag could sink even lower on Black Friday with a little luck.[Via NaviGadget]
