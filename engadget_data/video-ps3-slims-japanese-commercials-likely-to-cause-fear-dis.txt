The Japanese company has a long history of discomforting, unexplainable advertising that rivals a David Lynch movie -- in fact, Lynch even directed his own television spot back in the PlayStation 2 days, itself reminiscent of UNKLE's "Rabbit in Your Headlights" music video from years before. This latest set of videos for the PS3 Slim in Japan is no exception. Turn off all the lights, raise the volume of your speakers, and bow down before the masters of unnerving gadget promotion just after the break -- we included the Lynch ad, too, in case you were interested.
