 We've already heard about NVIDIA's apparent interest in getting into the netbook space, despite the fact that it dropped its own grand designs with VIA not too long ago, and it now looks like it could be wrangling its way into other Atom-based territory as well, at least if DigiTimes' latest reporting is to be believed. Supposedly, NVIDIA has been working on getting its MCP79 chipset to support Intel's Atom processors, but it's apparently only focusing on desktop-bound nettops during the "initial period," and leaving the more plentiful netbooks for another day. Unfortunately, there aren't many more specifics than that, but ASUS, Gigabyte and MSI are apparently welcoming the partnership, and saying that it'll give them "more pricing flexibility."
