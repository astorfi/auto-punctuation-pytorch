Unfortunately, there's absolutely zero information on this piece outside of what you see in video posted after the jump, but the sleek clamshell design already has our attention. Judging by the Day Zero news bullets over on Intel's site, we know the firm's aiming to unveil "smaller form factors with improved power efficiency," and judging by the looks of this one, it certainly fits the bill. We'll keep you posted if more details emerge.
