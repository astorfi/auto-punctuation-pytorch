In a refreshing salute to minimalism, this pup features a 2.2-inch QVGA display on a device apparently dedicated to digital TV and DMB and FM radio -- no attempts to cram in a bunch of PMP features here folks. Said to be dropping in Korea on May 23rd for about $140. But hey, judging by the pics we're calling prototype on this one so who knows. [Via Akihabara News]
