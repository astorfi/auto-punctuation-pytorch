 As things go from bad to worse, AMD just slipped the shipping date of their 2.4GHz Phenom 9700 and 2.6GHz 9900 CPUs. Announced for Q1, the quad-core CPUs are now expected for Q2. That means their 2.8GHz and 3GHz procs, expected in late Q2, will likely slip as well. However, that's not all good news for Intel fans if Intel chooses to delay the release of their own processors to maximize sales of existing processor line-ups. In the mean time, AMD is expected to focus on its tri-core "Toliman" processors. Well, there's always hope that you can accomplish in court what you couldn't in the marketplace, eh AMD?
