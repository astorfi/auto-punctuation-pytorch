Showing off a funky, cutaway hinge (likely due to missing battery), the Eee PC 901 features Intel's Atom processor as expected, Bluetooth, 802.11b/g, and now 802.11n too (hoozah!). The card reader supports MMC/SD/SDHC cards and the WiMax chipset is Intel's Link 5150. Keep in mind that the Link 5150 is a dual-mode WiFi and WiMax module. In other words, there's no guarantee the 802.11n will carry over to the WiMax-less 901 being announced tomorrow. A few more pics after the break, all the rest at our Chinese site.
