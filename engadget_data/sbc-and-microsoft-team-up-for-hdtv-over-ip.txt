We're jazzed to hear high-def TV will soon be coming over
Internet lines with SBC Communications' Project Lightspeed; they intend to lay over 38,000 miles of fiber to bring 18
million households by 2007 up to speed with 15 to 20 Mbps, which, of course, should be more than enough bandwidth for
HDTV. So SBC is teaming with Microsoft for IPTV services, which will provide an alternative to cable and satellite,
with standard definition and high-def offerings, video on demand, and digital video recording. We're sure it's going to
be heavily DRM-protected, but what can you do?
