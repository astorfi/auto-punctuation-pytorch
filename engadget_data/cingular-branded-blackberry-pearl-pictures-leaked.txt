In our opinion, the new color is a welcomed change and it breaks up the bland keypad by removing the black coloring on the bottom half of the numeric keys, and lightening up the color of the brushed metal on the side of the phone. Now the only questions remain, when will Cingular stop playing with our emotions and release it? Oh, and did they change those horrible keys?
