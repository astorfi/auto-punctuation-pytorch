The so-called tabletop PC is a Windows 8 device targeted at families as it can easily convert from a very traditional upright position to a full flat profile. The device is still a work-in-progress, as one of the company's reps confirmed to us, so it could hit shelves later this year with a much slimmer profile and less weightier feel. We spent some time getting to know this sliding slate, so follow on after the break to see how it fared.





 
 Surprisingly, the Tap 20's stand is incredibly sturdy and consequently takes a bit of effort to budge. We had to use considerable force to shift the unit from its upright position and down so that we could use it as if a "surface-like" tablet. The resolution across this 20-incher's IPS panel comes in at 1,600 x 900, keeping it just below full HD. It's evident from the product demo and pre-loaded software that Sony is gearing this as a family-friendly PC. To make use of its 10-point multi-touch functions, we sampled a quick game of Fruit Ninja and were pleased with its responsiveness. Hopefully, further optimizations are on the way and a more compelling software suite.

 There's no concrete release or price point for the Tap 20 as of yet -- much of that depends on Microsoft's Windows 8 plans, so consider this your first taste of what's to come this holiday season.

 Update: We were given some specs in error and have amended to clarify.
