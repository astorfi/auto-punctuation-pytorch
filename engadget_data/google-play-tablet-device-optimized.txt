As promised a month or so ago, Google Play is implementing a few changes today that'll push tablet-optimized apps to the forefront. That is, if you're using a device not quite small enough to be considered a phone (though we admit there are certain handhelds that bridge the gap). Indeed, tablet users will now see a "Designed for tablets" section prominently placed as the default view in top lists. Similarly, apps that don't meet the tablet criteria will get shelved as "Designed for phones." It's a relatively simple switch, but hopefully this will help owners of new Android tablets get started on their app libraries right along with their magazine, movie and book ones.
