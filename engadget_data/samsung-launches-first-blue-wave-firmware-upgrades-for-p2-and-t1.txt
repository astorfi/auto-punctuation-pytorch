       Samsung's delivering its promised P2 and T10 firmware updates that finally unleash the Bluetooth capabilities of the devices. More updates are promised down the line, but this first round of the "Blue Wave" allows Bluetooth-based file transfers, as well as phone integration. You can manage most phone functions from your DAP -- including making calls and browsing the contact list -- as well as have your music interrupted by incoming calls. Not a bad start at all, Samsung.
