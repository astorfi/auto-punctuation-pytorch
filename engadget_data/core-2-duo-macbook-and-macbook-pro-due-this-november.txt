       Good news for all of you's eyeing those jazzy laptop numbers of Apple's, but still waiting for them to get out of the cro-mag era and entertain some Core 2 Duo processors. We just got word from an IT guy at a Swiss university who claims to have the gotten the scoop on upcoming MacBooks from some sales reps. Apparently they've confirmed Core 2 Duo processors will be making their way into upcoming MB and MBPs this November, and were even kind enough to let our tipster "pre-order" a C2D MacBook. Sure, it's all hearsay, and we knew this was happening sooner or later, but it's nice to get at least an inkling of when these long-overdue laptops are going to make into onto our laps lap's thermal protection.
