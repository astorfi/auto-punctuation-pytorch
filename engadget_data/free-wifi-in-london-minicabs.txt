 London may be late to the LTE party, but it's more than making up for its laggard mobile ways by bulking up its citizens' access to WiFi. The Tube's been acquiring hotspots in preparation for the crush of Olympic fans expected to use public transport, and now it's time for taxis to do the same. The Inquirer reports that Greentomatocars, a London minicab service, is now equipping every car in its fleet with free WiFi. Each cab has its own SIM that affords passengers up to 7.2Mbps downloads and 2Mbps uploads, and gaining access merely requires you profess your affection for gratis internet -- the password is ilovefreewifi.
