Reuters is reporting that Cupertino is taking the Korean manufacturer to court in Japan, over alleged patent violations pertaining to the iPhone and iPad. Japan's Kyodo news agency first reported the news, citing unnamed insiders who claim that Apple is looking to halt sales of Samsung's allegedly patent-infringing Galaxy S smartphones, while seeking Â¥100 million (about $1.3 million) in damages. According to the sources, the first hearing was held in a Tokyo District Court on Wednesday, though a court spokesman would not comment on the pending case. Neither Samsung nor Apple have commented on the suit and details on the patents in question remain unclear, but we'll keep you posted as we find out more.

Update: Ryuji Yamada, CEO of Japanese provider NTT DoCoMo, is now saying that Apple's lawsuit will not have any effect on next month's Galaxy Tab launch. "We have heard from Samsung that there will be no obstruction to sales," Yamada confirmed.
