New in-the-wild shots give us -- and the North American S60-loving public -- newfound hope that the phone's gonna actually happen, but it'll emerge as the "E71x." That's a new suffix for Nokia, so we really have no idea what it might mean -- more internal memory would be cool, but we're not really counting on it. Word is that it'll be available for something in the $150 range when it finally hits, so if the 6650 isn't your cup o' tea, hang tight. (And by the way, guys, we're totally digging the black.)
