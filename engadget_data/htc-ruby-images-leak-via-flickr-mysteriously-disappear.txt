The photo sharing service outed the shots as being taken by an HTC Ruby, a white-backed smartphone with a dual-flash camera and 3.5mm audio jack. Really, that's all we know. The last phone HTC codenamed "Ruby" turned out to be the HTC Arrive, so maybe this gem will shine with a Mango-tinged hue. Then again, Android is just as likely to use cameras and headphone jacks as any other OS, so really it's anybody's game. Hit the break for a bonus reflecto-shot and tell us what you think this phantom phone ought to run.
