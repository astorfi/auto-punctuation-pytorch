Acer's got a variety of hardware on display at its Computex press conference venue, including a TBA smartphone and tablet. The handset appears to be quite large -- it's definitely of the phablet variety, though it's unclear exactly what size the display is. The device on stage is running the stock Jelly Bean OS. The tablet, for its part, is at least seven inches -- possibly larger -- and running the latest version of Android as well. Acer's press conference begins in just a few minutes, and we expect to have plenty more details to share then.


Update: The slate on stage looks remarkably similar to the Iconia A1, which made its debut last month in NYC. Acer is keeping attendees at a distance, so we can't confirm for sure, but the resemblance is clear even from a few feet back.


Update 2: And the phone is called the Liquid S1 -- we've got all the details and a hands-on here.
