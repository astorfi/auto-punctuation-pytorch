OQO's senior VP Bob Rosin confirmed bad news, saying a firm shipping date was partly the reason behind the vendor's decision. Furthermore, he said that it was "unlikely" any more Model 2+ units would be produced, though not indicating how many were currently manufactured and ready to go. Worried about the company's future? Yeah, us, too.
