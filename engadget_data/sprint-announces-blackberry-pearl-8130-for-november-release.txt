High on the touted feature list is the integrated GPS, which Sprint is teaming with its Sprint Navigation service to provide real-time routing and traffic alerts -- but we certainly can't forget the 3.5mm headphone jack, stereo Bluetooth support, 2 megapixel camera, and externally accessible microSDHC slot, all of which make the device a worthy successor for anyone that got a kick out of the original GSM Pearl. Look for it in stores next month, with pricing to be announced closer to launch.
