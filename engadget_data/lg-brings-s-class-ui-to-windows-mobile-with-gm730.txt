The GM730 brings the same 3D interface into the wide world of Windows Mobile, along with 7.2Mbps HSDPA, 2Mbps HSUPA, quadband EDGE, and Internet Explorer Mobile 6.0 into a package just 11.9mm thick. Sadly, LG's elected to do nothing but 900 / 2100MHz with the 3G here, so North Americans are left out of the equation at this point -- but much of the rest of the world can look into picking it up in the first half of the year.
