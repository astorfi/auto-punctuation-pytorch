BG was able to obtain the svelte new RIM device by any means necessary through completely legitimate channels for preview. From the initial pictures, the 8800 is thicker than we anticipated, only beating the current 8700 by a marginal amount. This device is setup for Wi-Fi, so it only makes sense that T-mobile might be getting this version. We should know more when the device launches later on this month on the orange splat. Check out some more pics after the break!
