The post goes on to suggest that the deal is still being negotiated but Netflix will be on the hook for two season which could cost it more than $100 million. Right now Netflix is flush with the cash of its 20 million strong subscriber base, but so far it has focused on enhancing it's $8 / month streaming package by spending on quantity, not necessarily quality new content even after deals with Relativity Media and Epix. A deal like this changes things completely and puts it directly in competition with the pay-TV biz, but we'll wait and find out how much of the rumor is true before putting up a deathwatch for HBO, Showtime and the rest.
