It looks like that "Something Big" that Nokia was hinting about earlier this morning might turn out to be the Nokia Lumia 625, if this leak by Finnish publication Puhelinvertailu is to be believed. The specs appear to match what was revealed a few days ago on China's certification site; it'll apparently sport a 4.7-inch Gorilla Glass 2 IPS WVGA (800 x 480) LCD, a 1.2-GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor, 512MB RAM and a 2,000mAh battery. The leak also hints at a rear 5-megapixel camera with 1080p recording, a front-facing VGA shooter, Bluetooth 4.0 LE and interestingly, an LTE variant with support for European bands (though we wouldn't rule out North American support later down the line). It's difficult to say exactly how the phone will actually look like up close, however, so it's a good thing we'll be up bright and early tomorrow at 9am UK time (4am Eastern) to see Nokia's unveiling.


Update: An additional image of the alleged Nokia Lumia 625, which we've embedded after the break, has just surfaced on @evleaks' Twitter feed. Unfortunately, this latest render tell us nothing new about the handset apart from Nokia's continued design practice of colorful polycarbonate shells.


Update 2: @evleaks isn't done posting Lumia 625 pics just yet apparently, as he's just tweeted yet another render of Nokia's latest, but this time in a cascading arrangement. You can take a look at it after the break.


Update 3: Yep, there's another Lumia 625 image from @evleaks, and that's after the break as well.
