 
 True to its pledge, ASUS has hauled the backlit keys and 1920 x 1080 IPS displays of the Zenbook Prime UX31A stateside, where it just made the Amazon scene in Core i7 and i5 Ivy Bridge flavors. The 13.3-inch Ultrabooks also have 4GB RAM, Intel HD 4000 Graphics and 128GB or 256GB solid state drives, depending on the model, and weigh in at a stark 2.86 pounds. The priciest Core i7 configuration with a 256GB SSD will run $1,599, and the lower-end Core i5, 128GB SSD version is $1,149. Some models are out of stock already, so if want to shell out, check the source for the product page.
