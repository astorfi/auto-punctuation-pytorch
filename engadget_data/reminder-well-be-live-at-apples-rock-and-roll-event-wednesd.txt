We're pretty much just expecting new iPods, but you never know -- we might see a new tablet, the iPhone 3GT, or even El Steve himself. It's all going down at 10AM PDT (local times below), but you can start speculating right now.  Here's where to tune in, and here's when: 
07:00AM - Hawaii
10:00AM - Pacific
11:00AM - Mountain
12:00PM - Central
01:00PM - Eastern
06:00PM - London
07:00PM - Paris
09:00PM - Moscow
02:00AM - Tokyo (September 10th)
