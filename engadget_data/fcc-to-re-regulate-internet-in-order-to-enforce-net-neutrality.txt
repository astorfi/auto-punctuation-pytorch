Just as we predicted, the FCC is getting ready to take major steps to overcome that court decision ruling the agency doesn't currently have the ability to impose net neutrality under the agency's internet regulatory framework: the Wall Street Journal reports that FCC chairman Julius Genachowski has decided to "reregulate" internet service, thereby giving the agency the specific authority it needs to impose and enforce net neutrality. It's not clear exactly how the FCC will do that at this point; the easiest option would be to simply reclassify ISP as "common carriers" just like phone services, but we've heard that Genachowski has been searching for a "third way" in the past few weeks, and the WSJ says the current proposal will only enforce parts of the common carriage regulations to ISPs. We'll see what happens.
