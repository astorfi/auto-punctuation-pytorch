You've now had a few hours to digest our feelings on the iPhone 5s and 5c, but now it's time to replicate the bulk of that experience on your existing Apple devices. iOS 7 is appearing as an available software in your settings panel now, or at least in the very near future. If you own an iPhone 5 / 4S / 4, an iPad 2/3/4, iPad Mini or the 5th generation iPod touch, then you'll be entitled to witness Sir Jonathan's first grand attempt at a UI revolution. Also, don't forget that iTunes Radio will be making its big debut alongside the new operating system today, so at least you'll have some smooth grooves to chill out to while your phone updates.
