We know how you're all fed up with bloated, oversized USB flash drives, so it's a good thing Kingmax is busting out
the Super Stick, a new USB flash drive that's just 39 x 12 x 2mm in size and weighs a mere 5 grams (and comes in sizes
from 256MB to 2GB). That's good enough to wrest the title of "World's Thinnest USB Flash Drive" away from
PQI's Intelligent Stick, which clocks in at a pudgy
2.8mm.


UPDATE: Snap! Looks like the iDisk
Diamond is a hair thinner.
