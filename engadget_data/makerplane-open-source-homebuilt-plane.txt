The open source aviation organization will allow you to download its plans and schematics for free, then build your plane's parts using CNC (computer numerically controlled) mills and 3D printers. If you don't have one of those lying around, you'll be able to go to a "makerspace" replete with all the necessary tools to get your wings whipped up, instead. As for keeping the blue side up, open source avionics software will also be included, allowing bold dabblers to create digital flight instruments and displays. For now, the group is working on its first set of plans, led by an aeronautical engineer volunteer, and hopes to have that design (shown above) flying in time for the Oshkosh airshow in 2014. While you're waiting, start looking for trusting souls brave enough to fly in a small plane you built yourself.
