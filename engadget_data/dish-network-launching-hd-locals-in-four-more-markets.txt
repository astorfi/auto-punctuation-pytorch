 After the onslaught of rapid-fire HD locals launches in March, all has been quiet on the DISH Network front -- until now. Four more markets can gleefully celebrate the homecoming of HD locals via DISH: Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Tampa, Florida, Cleveland, Ohio and Richmond, Virginia. Each of the aforementioned locales will be receiving their respective local ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX stations save for Milwaukee, which will sadly miss out on CBS. You're all giddy, aren't you? The HD locals go live for these four regions on April 10th at 6:00AM ET -- yeah, tomorrow!
