The company has hit 650,000 apps in the App Store -- 225,000 of which are specific to the iPad. Customers have downloaded 30 billion of the apps since they became an option four years ago. Developers also have a good reason to salivate: there are now over 400 million iTunes accounts with credit cards, and they've been paid a total of $5 billion for all of their app sales. Whatever pressure exists to support other platforms, Apple wants its coders to know they're taken care of.
