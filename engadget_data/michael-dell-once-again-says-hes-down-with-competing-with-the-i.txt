 Ugh, make it stop. Every few months, someone in the media asks Michael Dell the inevitable question: "Do you plan on competing with Apple's iPhone?" While speaking recently in the Citi Technology Conference in New York, the chief executive stated that "I think you will see us with small screen devices," and he continued on to state that we the people will see Dell producing "smaller and smaller devices that have capabilities of the [iPhone]." Without missing a beat, he also proclaimed: "Not in the near-term." Alrighty then -- anything we didn't already know?
