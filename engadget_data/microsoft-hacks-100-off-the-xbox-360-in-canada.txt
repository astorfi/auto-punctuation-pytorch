 With all the price cutting that's been going on here in the US, it's no surprise that our allies to the north are seeing drops of their own on the Xbox 360. According to Microsoft, Canadians scouting one of its consoles can now snag the Premium package for $399.99 CDN, the Core for $299.99 CDN, or the Elite for $499.99 CDN. Notably, those who have an unhealthy appetite for all things Halo can look for the Halo 3-themed iteration to land next month for a respectable $449.99 CDN. So there ya have it Canucks, now don't say Redmond isn't lookin' out for you, too.[Thanks, Matt]
