As always, set your browsers on autofire-refresh and watch out for late-breaking developments.

There was a big ol' Apple in there, but no banner we could easily spy.This truck was pulling in as we got there; wonder what that satellite connection is for? Well, we'd guess it's for their London broadcast.
