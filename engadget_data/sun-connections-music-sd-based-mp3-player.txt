Unlike some other totally different digital audio players, the Music+ relies on SD/MMC cards for storage (topping out at 2GB) and also seemingly only plays back music according to the file name order. The unit itself measures about an inch and a half square and weighs less than an ounce, with its battery promising some eight hours of continuous playback. Sun Connection's also managed to keep the price low enough, just 2,980 Yen ($25 US) -- of course that also means you'll have to supply your own SD card.[Via AV Watch]
