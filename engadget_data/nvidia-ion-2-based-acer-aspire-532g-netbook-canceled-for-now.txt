And we hate to be the bearer of this bad news, but it turns out we could be waiting forever on the 10-inch, 1080p-playing netbook. Blogeee is reporting that bugger has been canceled in France due to technical issues with NVIDIA and Acer drivers, and when we followed up with our Acer contact here in the US, we were told that the 532g would not be launched in the "upcoming back-to-school cycle." It's truly not looking good for the little laptop, not to mention it's extremely disappointing not to see any other Ion 2 netbooks on the market almost five months after its launch. Well 532g, we'll always look back on our time together at CeBIT fondly. Sniff.
