Now, cloaked by an increasingly usual (and irritating-for-Engadget) confidentiality agreement, today saw the passage of... wait for it... the OQO Model 02 computer. All we can tell you is that it passed on the 5GHz band (which would imply 802.11a), as well as on two frequencies in 2.4GHz, implying 802.11b/g and Bluetooth -- unfortunately, nothing there listed for cellular frequencies (which mean that might be left to a Model 02+ or some such thing). Oh, and the unit will be 3.5 x 5x5-inches (although thickness is still unknown -- compare to the current OQO at 3.4 x 4.9 x 0.9-inches). More as we get it!
