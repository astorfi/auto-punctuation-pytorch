IS. The S2 IS is a 5 megapixel unit with 12x optical zoom, 1.8-inch vari-angle LCD, DIGIC II image processor, USB
2.0 interface, PictBridge support and its namesake Image Stablization feature. Like its predecessor, it sports a bunch
of camcorder features for shooting video at 30 or 15 fps at 640 x 480 with stereo sound.
