The model Toshiba had on display was behind glass and wasn't actually powered on, but we did confirm that it will have an 11.6-inch display and will be powered by Intel's Atom Oak Trail processor. That's all we were able to get out of the company, but apparently that very tablet was on display at CES, and Notebook Italia gathered there that it will have 64GB of storage and 2GB of RAM. So, what's the hold up on the slate? According to Toshiba's Marco Perino, the company's putting a bit of "Toshiba flavor" on top of the OS to make it more touch-friendly. He also said that it may not come to all parts of the world as different regions will determine the local demand. We're not sure anyone is holding their breath for this one, but we'll keep you updated if we should hear more. Hit the break for a few more behind-glass shots of the tablet.
