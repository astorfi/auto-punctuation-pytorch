Nokia also unveiled their Nokia 6110 navigator, their second device of the day -- after the E90 -- to flaunt both GPS and HSDPA data. The S60-based 6110 combines GPS and AGPS (assisted GPS) with quad-band GSM/EDGE and UMTS 2100 for up to 3.6Mbps of hot HSDPA data. This beast brings a 2.2-inch QVGA display throwin' 16 million colors, a 2 megapixel camera with sliding lens cover and flash, and MicroSD expansion to augment the onboard 40MB. The handset touts a 3.5-hour (GSM) and 2.5-hours (3G) talk-time or up to 11 days (GSM and 3G) of standby. The 6110 is expected to ship in Q2 for an estimated pre-tax, pre-carrier-subsidy price of â‚¬450/$583. A few more pics after the break.
