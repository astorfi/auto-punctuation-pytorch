 There's no consumer application of this yet, but we can hope (and drool) can't we? BrightSide showed off a new LCD technology at this week's SIGGRAPH show that we would love to see become mainstream.According to the Vancouver-based manufacturer, they have introduced the world's first Extreme Dynamic Range display. A matrix of LCD LED backlights helps the LCD panel achieve 10 times the brightness and 100 times the contrast of today's LCD sets. We'd like to see BrightSide hook up with both an LCD manufacturer and also with Oakley. The whole "brighter screen" thing would be a nice HDTV and sunglasses cross-promotion.
