  Mea culpas all around after last week's show -- not our finest hour, but we're not willing to give up on Ustream altogether just yet. Apparently, we're not alone, as several people joined us live this week while we got back up on the Ustream horse again. We get grumpy with Microsoft's efforts this week, and somehow still maintain hope for a Media Center + Windows Home Server future. Don't confuse us with sunny, happy wall-people, though -- there's plenty of grousing to go around as we cover the rest of this week's news.
