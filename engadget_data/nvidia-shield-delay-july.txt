NVIDIA's Shield won't arrive on its previously announced date of June 27th, instead moving its launch date to an undetermined point in July. A statement issued by NVIDIA explains the delay ambiguously, citing "a mechanical issue that relates to a third-party component" -- the company confirmed to Engadget it's an internal component, but wouldn't go into any more detail.


"We want Shield to be perfect, so we have elected to shift the launch date to July," the statement reads. We pushed the company for a specific date but were rebuffed -- "We'll update you as soon as we have an exact date," was all we were told. We'll have a full review of the Shield just ahead of its July launch; for now, we've got a hands-on with the final version from mid-May to tide you over. Head below the break for that video.
