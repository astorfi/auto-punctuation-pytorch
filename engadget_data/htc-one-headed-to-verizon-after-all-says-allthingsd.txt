 If you read the comments on our HTC One review, you'll find a lot of cheesed-off Verizon customers wondering why Big Red isn't planning on selling it. Turns out, you guys might be getting yourselves a pretty 4.7-inch flagship after all. AllThingsD is reporting that Verizon is indeed planning to offer the phone, right alongside AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile. The only catch is that the VZW model might arrive a month or two after the others, thanks to Verizon's notoriously long testing process. The keyword, of course, is "might" -- so far, neither Verizon or HTC has made a comment, which means all our angry Verizon-bound readers might have reason to be mad after all. Needless to say, we hope you don't.
