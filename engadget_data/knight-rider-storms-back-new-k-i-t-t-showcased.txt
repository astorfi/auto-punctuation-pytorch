Starting in February, an updated version of the classic will be hitting NBC, and while we could spend hours gushing over the cast, our eyes are fixed on the star pictured above. The new K.I.T.T. will be played by a Ford Mustang Shelby GT500KR, and while three versions will make appearances, it should come as no surprise to hear that out personal favorite is the driverless K.I.T.T. Remote. Go on, indulge in the links below for more pictorial goodness, we won't tell anyone.[Via TVSquad, thanks to everyone who sent this in]
