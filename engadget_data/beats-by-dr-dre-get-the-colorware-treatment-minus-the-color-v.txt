 
Now, you'd think ColorWare would be working furiously to release some flashy iPad 2s, but that's not what we're getting today -- instead we now have a pair of Monster headphones to complement that ever-so-necessary neon Dyson Air Multiplier we assume you've already added to every room in your tastefully decorated mansion. These very limited edition ColorWare "Chrome Beats" headphones don't actually have any color, but they admittedly do look pretty slick, excepting the $1,000 price tag necessitated by this perfect storm of overpriced branding. ColorWare is only decking out 50 of these 'cans, so grab that platinum card and head over to our source link to get your pair.
