The company can now claim rights over the design of the right half of the device, where the camera hangs over the eye and where the innards are housed within the band along the side. It's also patented the nose-pad sensor that knows when it's being worn, plus the ability to represent ambient sounds on the screen with range and direction info. Finally, it's also got rights on using each eyepiece as a separate display, with the example shown above demonstrating a map in one eye and navigation instructions in the other. The more we sift through the paperwork, the more we're reminded of the Dominion Warship headsets from Deep Space Nine -- but that could be just because we've been locked indoors for too long.
