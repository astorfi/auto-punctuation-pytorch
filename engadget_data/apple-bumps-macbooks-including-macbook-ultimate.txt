AppleInsider is reporting a new white version upped to 1GB of RAM, and an 80GB drive for $1449 -- which is what you'd pay to configure a stock WhiteBook with the above options online. Apple is apparently still keeping the margin on the BlackBook though, with the "MacBook Ultimate," your regular 2GHz BlackBook with 1GB of RAM (instead of the stock 512MB) for -- you guessed it -- the same $100 price bump you'd pay to configure it yourself online, thus topping it out at $1599. Tricky.
