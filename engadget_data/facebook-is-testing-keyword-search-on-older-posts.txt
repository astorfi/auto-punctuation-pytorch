Along with a "satire" tag and stickers in comments, it appears the social network is testing a feature that'll let you do a keyword search on old posts from people in your network. To be clear, the search will only be on posts that are meant for you to see. In other words, posts that your friends published as private will still be banned from your curious eyes if you're not the intended audience. Additionally, this test is apparently mobile-only. A Facebook spokesperson gave us this statement: "We're testing an improvement to search on mobile. In this test you can use keywords to search for posts you're in the audience for on Facebook." It seems the test has rolled out to a limited few for now, though seeing as it seems a bit of a no-brainer for us, we won't be surprised if this is rolled out officially some time soon.
