Despite having been revealed to be a hoax, "toothing"—which supposedly people using Bluetooth-enabled cellphones and
PDAs to hook up for anonymous sex—made a guest appearance on an episode of CSI: Miami last night, with Delko
said to have been engaging in a little toothing the evening before the action takes place. This comes just six months
after they managed to work a reference to
flash mobs into the show (damn, those writers are with it!).
