Well, it looks like someone over at the company's eSupport site uploaded a troubleshooting doc for the yet-to-be released S1 and S2 tablets, and we have the leaked screens to prove it. Listed under the very helpful heading of "How to find the Android Honeycomb operating system version installed on this tablet," conflicting pics of the "About tablet" screen point to both a 3.1 and 3.2 software destiny. Also on board for this illicit peek, is a shot of the slates' space-tastic homescreen, in addition to its app drawer where we can clearly see bundled Sony apps like Chumby, Crash Bandicoot and Crackle. While we're inclined to believe Honeycomb's latest and greatest will ship on the pair of black beauties, the site offered no other confirmation of the OS goods. Head on past the break for an extended look, and place your bets in comments below.

Update: The page has been removed from Sony's site.
