   This is the Netbook Navigator NAV13X Windows 7 Ultrabook and if we're honest, we think it's a very attractive looking device. That said, we're not so sure it's going to be on sale for too long, which is a genuine shame. Despite being called an Ultrabook, it's not an Intel-sanctioned device, which won't go down well with Santa Clara's lawyers. Secondly, it's actually a netbook running a 1.86GHz dual-core Atom CPU with 2GB of RAM and a 32GB SSD, with build to-order options running to larger memory and storage. Thirdly, we're fairly sure we've seen industrial design like this before, and given the litigious nature of the company involved, we expect a metric ton of cease-and-desist notices to be delivered to Navigator's New Jersey HQ before the weekend's over. However, if it can survive the barrage of paperwork from two of the industry's biggest companies, it'll arrive very soon, setting you back a slight $500 sans OS or $600 with Windows 7 Home Premium.
