Looks like Verizon Wireless has decided to internally announce their newest Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone to the lineup, the Black Motorola Q. Now, we know that it looks similar to its silver brother externally, but it comes with a software update named MOL2. This update corrects such issues as the Goodlink data stall issue, adds jog dial control via Bluetooth headset and improves battery life. Expect this black bad boy to cost an extra $50 across the board and to be out on the web December 12th and in retail January 12th. So how far behind will Sprint be? Guesses, anyone??[Thanks, Corys00 and HTC Kid]
