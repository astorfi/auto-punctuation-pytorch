 Catering to the highest of the high-end in speakers will grab the attention of both consumers and designers, and KEF has contracted Ross Lovegrove, who designed such throw-aways as the Walkman and the iMac, to create this spendy new "Muon" series of speakers. These curvy monsters are carved out of a six-foot block of solid aluminum using computer-aided manufacturing and take a week to create. The four-way, eight-speaker setups weigh 253 pounds each, and will retail for Â£70,000 ($140,500 USD). If you've got the pocketbook, better have your butler write out a check right quick, as the edition is limited to 100 pairs.
