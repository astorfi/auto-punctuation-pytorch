Take cognitive science professor John Long, for instance, who is currently conducting a Preyro robot experiment in a Vassar College lab that intends to "allow robots to mimic animals far better than before." To him, he's just hoping to study evolutionary patterns in order to better understand how certain tweaks to things like fins and tails affect performance in the place we call reality. Though, there's a very real possibility that this research could accelerate the impending robot apocalypse by at least a score. Oh, what we'd give to be incognizant of the truth.
