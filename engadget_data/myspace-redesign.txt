 A totally revamped and unrecognizable MySpace has just gone public, enticing new joiners with a track by Justin Timberlake -- who now owns a good chunk of the business alongside Specific Media. Based on the limited access teaser we saw back in September and the image above, this fresh incarnation of the social network retains the emphasis on music ("FREE Unlimited music and videos!") except with a more commercial (and actually less social) approach. In a similarly modern twist, the site lets you sign in with a Facebook or Twitter account as well as with your old MySpace details, which means there shouldn't be too many barriers to at least exploring it.
