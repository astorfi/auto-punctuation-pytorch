If you'll recall, LG was tooting its own horn just last week about having the first digital-to-analog converter box to be certified for the US Commerce Department's coupon program, and if two and two really equal four, the unit you see pictured above is indeed the device that was previously referenced. The DTT900 was developed and produced by LG, but it will apparently be sold under the Zenith brand name -- you know, so it'll blend in better with that 80s-era TV.
