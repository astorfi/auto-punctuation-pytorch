Now we have all seen what could possibly be the best Internet streaming video to date, which is available on ABC.com and while it looks good, it isn't HD. ABC is looking to change that by making real HD available on their site, and in the same resolution we are used to seeing on ABC. There is no word on what bit-rate the 1280x720p video will be delivered in, or even what codec will be used, but based on ABC's track record, you could say; we have our hopes up. Hey ABC while you're at it, why not get some of that HD content on our Apple TV, lord knows it needs it.
