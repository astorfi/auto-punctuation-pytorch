The so-called HTC Holiday is indeed real, and it'll soon be gracing Ma Bell's airwaves -- and not just the HSPA+ ones, either. We've confirmed that the Holiday will be amongst the first handsets to launch in AT&T's LTE markets, bringing with it a rather gargantuan frame, a 4.5-inch qHD touchpanel, 1.2GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of memory, an 8 megapixel rear camera (with flash), 1.3 megapixel front-facing shooter, 802.11b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 3.0 and a foursome of capacitive touch buttons below the panel. Software wise, it'll ship with Android 2.3.4 and HTC Sense 3.0, and while we haven't been able to nail it down with 100 percent certainty, there's a better-than-average chance it'll go by "Waikiki" upon launch -- if "Holiday" doesn't work out, that is. We'll be bringing you more as it arrives; for now, cut loose in the gallery below!
