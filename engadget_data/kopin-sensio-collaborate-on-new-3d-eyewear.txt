 We're still trying to figure out exactly who is buying up these gaudy 3D goggles, but apparently, the market is still lucrative. Consequently, Kopin and SENSIO have teamed up to deliver a new set of 3D eyewear, which "combines Kopin's BDM-922K binocular optical engine with SENSIO's S3D-220 decoder chip technology." Reportedly, the device will output "full-color, VGA-quality (640 x 480 resolution) video, creating the effect of a virtual 48-inch display viewed from a distance of seven feet," and it'll play nice with both NTSC and PAL signals. No word just yet on a price or release timeframe, but there's plenty of other options if you just can't wait around to boost your geek factor exponentially.
