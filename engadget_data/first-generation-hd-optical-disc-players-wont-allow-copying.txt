 More bad news for consumers: PC World isreporting that the first generation of high definition optical disc players will not allow content to be copied orstreamed to other discs or devices thanks to their implementation of the AACS interim standard -- withthe "interim" part meaning that it lacks provisions for managed copy. So even though the content that you buyfor your brand new Toshiba HD-A1 /HD-XA1 HD DVD or PioneerElite BDP-HD1 / Samsung BD-P1000Blu-ray player (or players, if you're really hardcore) will work on future-gen machines, and media with thefinalized AACS protection will likewise be backwards compatible with your device, early-adopters will be unable to domuch more than enjoy all that HD goodness on stationary displays until both a hardware and software hack are in place, it would seem.Still, if you've gotta catch the great selection of moviesavailable at launch, at least try scoring a replacement warranty for your first-gen player because you knowhow these types of products have a tendency to "break" at just about the same time that they're replacedwith something better.[Via eHomeUpgrade]
