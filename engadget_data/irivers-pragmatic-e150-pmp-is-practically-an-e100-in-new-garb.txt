Now it appears to have reared its head and is out in Korea for the equivalent of $78 for the 4GB and $100 for the 8GB models. Officially dubbed the "all in one pragmatic player," its speaker grill is more aesthetically pleasing and the buttons are no longer separated from the body, but otherwise it's pretty much both seasons of the E100 in syndication, with 2.4-inch QVGA screen, XviD support, etc. It's actually 2mm thicker than its predecessor, if that sort of thing is a make or break deal for you. Still, the price is nothing to scoff and there's three colors to chose from: black, silver, and pink. No word on US release, but it's only a matter of time.[Via DAP Review]
