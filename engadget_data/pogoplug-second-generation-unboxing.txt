Cloud Engines' new iteration of Pogoplug just landed on our doorstep, oddly enough packed with an unopened pack of microwavable popcorn (something tells us we're missing a joke here). We're still in the plugging-in-and-testing phase, but no point in depriving you of the unboxing fun while we do that, right? Right. Enjoy the gallery below.
