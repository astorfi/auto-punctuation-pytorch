Huawei is announcing an event in London for June 18th that'll celebrate beauty, glamour and inspiration. Although, we also hope to see a phone being launched. If the leaks are accurate, then this could be the official arrival of the 6.18mm-thick P6-UO6 with a brushed metal enclosure. It could possibly be joined on stage by the Huawei Edge, which we saw back in March. Either way, we'll be there to see what beautiful, glamorous and inspirational smartphones Huawei's chairman Richard Yu has to show -- hopefully something with sequins.
