By now, you've likely heard a thing or two about the new iPhones' flexibility, and Apple has offered a word on the matter. The Wall Street Journal reports that the Cupertino-based outfit only received nine complaints of bent devices and that the damage occurring due to regular use is "extremely rare." It also maintains that both the new iPhone 6 and its larger sibling went through durability testing to ensure they'd stand up to daily use. Of course, the interwebs have been littered with videos of folks purposely trying to flex their mobile wares in far from "normal" conditions. Unfortunately, there's no word on if tight trousers are in fact to blame.
