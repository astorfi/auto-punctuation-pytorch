According to a studio representative speaking with HighDefDigest, the outfit's "entire HD DVD slate is currently in flux," which could mean absolutely nothing or that the company won't be dishing out any more red titles whatsoever. 'Course, that leaves certain hits like Charlie Wilson's War up in the air, but hopefully Universal will either get these stragglers out on HD DVD or convert 'em to Blu-ray, at least.[Thanks, Kiwi616]
