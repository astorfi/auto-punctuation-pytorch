 As if filming a commercial dissing Microsoft for Vista upgrade hassles wasn't enough, Apple has issued a warning to iTunes users that they should wait for Apple to issue a patch before making the switch to Vista. Apparently some users are encountering problems playing purchased music and videos, synchronizing address book contacts and calendar dates, and slowed response time, along with the occasional outright corruption of connected iPods. Such problems don't affect everyone, but they're pervasive enough for Apple to advise users to wait on the upgrade. According to Apple spokesman Derick Mains, "Although iTunes 7.0.2 may work with Windows Vista on many typical PCs, Apple is aware of some known compatibility issues and recommends that iTunes customers wait to upgrade to Windows Vista until after the next release of iTunes, which will be available in the next few weeks." We're guessing Microsoft is a tad bit miffed that one of the most popular pieces of software on Windows is incompatible with its fledgling operating system -- it's not like Apple didn't have ample warning of the launch -- but in all fairness, it took Microsoft's own Zune a few weeks to catch up to Vista, at least in the Business incarnation.Update: Thanks to the comments below pointing out that Apple has indeed released what appears to be at least a partial fix to the Vista / iTunes problems, specifically to "repair permissions." So if after that dire warning above you're still willing to give it a shot, you can grab the iTunes Repair Tool for Vista 1.0 and give it a whirl.
