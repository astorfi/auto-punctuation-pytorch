Given the quantity of rumors that are floating around, it's hard to think that we won't be seeing a Sony phablet intermediate-size phone/tablet device in the near future. One of the folks over at ePrice is claiming that the Xperia ZU (for "Ultra") will come with a 6.44-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 IPS LCD display with a pixel density of 342ppi. Internals-wise, it's said to run a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 with 2GB RAM, 16GB storage and a 64GB microSD card slot, as well as a 3,000mAh non-removable battery. On the imaging front, there's a 8-megapixel Exmor RS sensor primary camera and a 1.3-megapixel Exmor R up front. The same tipster let slip that the ZU won't come with a stylus, but will be receptive to third-party styluses and should arrive on June 25th, so we'll be waiting for an invite to Sony's July 4th Paris launch with bated breath.
