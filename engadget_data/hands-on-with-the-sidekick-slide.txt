We played ever so briefly with Motorola's Sidekick Slide for T-Mobile at CTIA this week, and we think some folks might like this one better in person than in photography. Does that make it better than the LX? Not really -- you're dealing with a smaller screen here, not to mention that you sacrifice the trademark pivot action -- but for a hundie less than its stablemate, it might see some retail action after all. Click on for the closest most of us'll get to a Slide until the November 7 launch!
