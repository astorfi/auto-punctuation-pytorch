The new HD1010 adds improved image processing and stabilization, new "face chaser" technology for stills and video, and amusing new 300fps slow-motion mode. Nothing compared to Casio's freakish EX-F1 but a nice novelty for shooting the kids' sporting adventures. Sanyo also tossed in a new 7fps continuous still shot mode which snags images at the sensor's maximum 4 megapixel resolution. A minor bump for sure but it makes for a compelling offering at the (relatively) low asking price of $800 when it hits the US in July (Japan, June 20th).Update: Akihabara News went hands-on in the video posted after the break.[Via Impress and Akihabara News]
