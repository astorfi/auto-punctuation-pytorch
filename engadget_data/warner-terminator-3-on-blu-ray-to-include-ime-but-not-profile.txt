High-Def Digest confirmed that Warner is including the PiP commentary from the HD DVD release by putting two copies of the movie on the disc, one with commentary and one without. This has been done before, most notably on The Descent, and should have the benefit of being viewable even on older (or newer) Blu-ray players. The bad news is that whenever updated hardware and software exists to support more BD-Java, there may not be anything new to watch for a while (we're hoping for The Matrix Trilogy).[Thanks, domerdel]
