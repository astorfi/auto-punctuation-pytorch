This is a fleeting discount, however, with the slab sale starting tomorrow and ending Sunday. But at $400 and $500 for the 16GB and 32GB versions, respectively, it might just be worth the asking price. Now, we wouldn't go skipping any meals, but if you've got the cash and an undying allegiance to a dying brand, we say go for it. A list of terms and conditions can be found at the source link below.
