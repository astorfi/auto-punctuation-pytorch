 Cricket gave us a pleasant surprise when it committed to carrying the cheap-yet-cheerful HTC One SV this month, and it's making good on that promise today. The Android 4.0-touting smartphone is on sale now for a lower than expected $330 contract-free, albeit only for those shopping online. It's not the most powerful device on the network, but it also strikes a balance between bargain pricing and speed: buyers get LTE, rapid-fire photography and a modern dual-core processor without having to splurge on a flagship like the Galaxy S III. Hit the source link if the middle road sounds like the best road.
