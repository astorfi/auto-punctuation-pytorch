The laser -- which is just 5.6mm in diameter and outputs a 532 nanometer, pure green light -- was shown off as a working prototype at CEATEC. QD says their green laser (the hardest type to make) will be well-suited to gadgets like cellphones and laptops because of its low power consumption and wide operating temperature. Mass production is seemingly planned for next year, with the hopes that each little laser will run $10, cheaper than the one currently available, which is manufactured by Corning. You know what we always say: rave on.
