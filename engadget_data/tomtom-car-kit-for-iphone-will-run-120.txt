The kit, which will be sold separately from the navigational iPhone app, will be available in October (that's almost now!!). While we still don't have full details on what the whole package will include, it's officially going to run you $119.95 (or 99.99 if you pay in Euros). Check out the teaser video after the break to tide you over until the awesome, GPS-infused release date is upon us.
