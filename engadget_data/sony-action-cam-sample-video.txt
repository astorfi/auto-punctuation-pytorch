 We're quite familiar with ruggedized camcorders here at Engadget, be they from GoPro or Contour. However, Sony recently entered the extreme video fray with its Action Cam, and we got the chance to do a little POV recording with one. The videos produced were on par with what we've seen from the Action Cam's competition -- a nice wide view and decent quality. While we've seen other such cams have trouble with color balance, the Sony's was accurate both indoors and out and it adjusted to transitions from dim to bright environments quickly. And, while the SteadyShot image stabilization tech didn't eliminate all the shakes in our videos, it did noticeably reduce them. That said, you don't have to take our word for it, head on past the break and see the results for yourselves.
