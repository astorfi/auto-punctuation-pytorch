Three separate sources are cited in a report claiming that RIM intends to run software built by QNX on its virginal tablet effort, the BlackPad. It's curious that the company is opting against upscaling its BlackBerry 6 operating system into the tablet space, though one of the sources suggested that's due to legacy code hanging around in the still new OS, making it easier to just start afresh when building the slate's software package. It shall be very interesting indeed to see how well this $200 million investment works out for RIM; it'll certainly be the biggest departure from the BlackBerry maker's conservative norm.
