Just look at that cold-blooded killer up there. And Dexter's no choir boy either! Yes, the Nokia N8 is well and truly out and about now, as evidenced by its first appearance on American television, serving as Dexter von Murderink's trusty sidekick. Nokia does deserve kudos for the subtle product placement here -- you wouldn't even know it was an N8 if you weren't looking out for that portly lens compartment and the signature shade of dark grey. Which, of course, we were. Video after the break.
