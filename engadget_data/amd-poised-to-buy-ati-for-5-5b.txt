It's looking especially probable that Bloomberg's got ahold of some inside information that says AMD is positioned to acquire ATI for 5.5 billion smackers. We know the big buyout rumor mongering is starting to sound redundant, but we'll all find out one way or another come Monday (or this week, anyway) when either AMD and ATI ink the deal, or the two companies continue to go it alone in their respective blood-wars on Intel (and to a lesser extent, NVIDIA).P.S. -For what it's worth, the WSJ also thinks the deal's about to go down.[Thanks, Ben]
