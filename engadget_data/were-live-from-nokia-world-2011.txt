 

You've probably already gathered from our liveblog teaser and early look at one of tomorrow's announcements, but we're just settling in at Nokia World. And it really does feel like we're a world away from the conference's host city on London -- the venue Nokia selected to host its growing event is quite a distance from Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and that famous big clock tower downtown. Stay tuned for plenty of Windows Phone (and perhaps even Symbian) coverage throughout the week, and don't forget our liveblog of today's keynote!

Pro tip: Use the "nokiaworld2011" tag for direct access to this week's Nokia news!
