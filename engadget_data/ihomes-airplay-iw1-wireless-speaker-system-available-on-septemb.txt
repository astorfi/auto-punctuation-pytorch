Yesterday, the company announced that the iW1 will be available on September 26th, for $300. For that price, you'll be able to stream music from your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, using the system's two three-inch woofers and duo of one-inch tweeters with Bongiovi processing. The six-pound iW1 also boasts a rechargeable lithium ion battery, allowing you to easily tote it to your next house party, and can be wirelessly connected using iHome's Home Connect app, available for free on iTunes. Blast past the break for the full press release, or hit up the source link for more detailed information.
