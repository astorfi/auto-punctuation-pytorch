The project will include new next-gen console and PC games, but Eidos' goal is grander than that. Writing on the company's community site, Eidos Montreal head David Anfossi says, "The concept behind Deus Ex: Universe is to create an ongoing, expanding and connected game world built across a generation of core games."

The plan is to add to the Deus Ex franchise on a "regular basis," and to "deliver a deep conspiracy" that will stretch across multiple games. Beyond the PC and console games, Deus Ex: Universe will also span across other media, including mobile games, books and graphic novels, says Anfossi. He adds that Eidos Montreal is "already into production of the starting point for Deus Ex: Universe with a new game for PC and next-generation consoles," and that "most" of the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution team is on board.

Anfossi also shared the above concept art, a sneak peek of things to come. It's an example of a "trans-humanism segregation," which will be a core theme of the next game. "The people in this segregated class have reshaped their environment," says Anfossi, "nostalgic for their ideal of Cyber Renaissance."
