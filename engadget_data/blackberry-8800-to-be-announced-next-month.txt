 Never mind announcements, we want RIM's Pearlescent (sorry, we can't help ourselves) 8800 series in our grubby paws. Alas, we'll take what we can get, and rumors are brewing that we might see a formal announcement at 3GSM next month in Barcelona. We're a little bummed that the latest gossip has this thing shipping without a camera -- not to mention the knowledge that a 3G version is in the works -- but if this thing drops post haste on Cingular and/or T-Mobile after the announcement, we know a few folks that should be game.
