Not much looks to have changed with the device itself in the past month or so though, with it still promising to "simplify everyday family and media interactions" and, just as importantly for OpenFrame, "drive new revenues for service providers" -- it'll handle phone calls, too. Unfortunately, while OpenFrame is still saying we can expect to see the first devices based on the platform early next year, it's apparently not yet ready (or able) to announce exactly who those OEM partners might be.[Via HotHardware]
