While we're guessing Kota's few notches below Pleo on the robo-evolutionary ladder, the 40-inch tall toy at least has movement sensors on nine areas of its body, and is able to react to you by moving its head, tail, mouth, and horns, not to mention play "adventure-themed songs" at the push of a button. Look for it to be available this fall for about $300, with six D cell batteries required to power it.[Via Popgadget]
