Like any responsible corporation, Microsoft must keep an eye on developments in computing and align its resources accordingly. And when the majority of its wealth comes from the 1-2 punch of Windows and Office, you can bet Microsoft is looking at every opportunity that comes along. So while we fully expect Microsoft to take a wait-and-see approach to the numbers Apple can generate from the current dead zone between laptops and smartphones, at least we finally get to use the image above in a post.
