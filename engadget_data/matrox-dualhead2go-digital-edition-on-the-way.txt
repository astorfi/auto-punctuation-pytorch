 Matrox just kicked out a new version of their DualHead2Go called the DualHead2Go Digital Edition that'll let you connect two 1920 x 1200 analog or digital displays (up to 3840 x 1200 stretched across two displays) to the VGA port on your desktop or laptop. It's compatible with both Windows (2000, XP, and Vistas), as well as OS X 10.4, and should be out sometime this quarter at a retail price of $229.[Via MacMinute]
