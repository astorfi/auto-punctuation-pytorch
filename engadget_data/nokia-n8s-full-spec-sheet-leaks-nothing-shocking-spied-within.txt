Unwired View's published what it believes to be the full N8 spec sheet. So what do we find contained within? Well, no shockers, to be sure, but here's what we know: the phone will boast a 3.5-inch capacitive touchscreen OLED, a 680MHz CPU, 256MB of RAM, swappable microSD capacity up to 32GB, and a 12 megapixel cam. Now, there are also a few rumored features floating around, which include a DRM-free Ovi music store, and LAN IEEE802.11 b/g -- so we'll let you know for sure when we do if those features are going to hit reality. Until then, hit up the source link to check out the full listing.
