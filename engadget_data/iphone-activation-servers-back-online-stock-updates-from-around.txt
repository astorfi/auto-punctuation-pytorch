AT&T just told us that the servers are back online, though, and that activations are occurring for 3G customers -- we're guessing that means first-gen upgraders are seeing things work as well. Lines are still killer right now, but now that the servers are back up, let's hope the chaos subsides a bit. We'll be filling in stock / line situations worldwide after the break as they come in, let us know what's up by you in comments or email iphone AT engadget DAWT com!Update: Most AT&T stores are out of stock -- if you must have an iPhone today, it looks like an Apple store is the only way to go. Have fun in line!Update 2: You guys are amazing -- keep those updates coming in! Right now it looks like the best place to nab an iPhone is Brandon Mall, in Tampa, Florida: plenty of stock and only 20 people in line. Who's up for a road trip? So much for that -- see below.Update 3: It looks like Apple is starting to cap lines so that stores can close by midnight or so. How crazy will it be if there are four hour lines for this thing again tomorrow? Keep those updates coming!Final update for the night: Apple's capping lines so that most stores can close by 11, or midnight at the latest. We'll do this all again tomorrow, thanks for all your help!NYC:Cube, 4:12pm ET: Line is two to three hours, they don't anticipate running out of stock.Soho, 7:42pm ET (updated): Lines have been cut off so the store can close later tonight.
