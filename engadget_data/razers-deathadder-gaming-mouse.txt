Helping the DeathAdder earn its sinister moniker is the so-called 3G infrared sensor at the heart of the mouse, boasting an impressive 1800 dpi resolution, as well as Razer's trademark 1000 Hz "Ultrapolling" technology and a barely there 1ms response time. To keep all that precision under control, Razer's outfitted the mouse with rubber-coated buttons up top and some smooth-sliding Teflon feet on the underside -- lefties, however, are out of luck, as this one's tailor made for right-handed use. Look for the DeathAdder to hit just in time for the holidays at a not-unreasonable price of $59.99.[Via Randomly Accessed, thanks, Steve]
