Update: It hit another snag. The rocket went into "safe mode" right before launch due to some shutdown condition. There's still the possibility of a later launch, however, so we'll keep you posted.

Update 2: Supposedly they're going to try again with a 2:45 launch. Fingers crossed!

Update 3: And there she goes!

Update 4: They achieved earth orbit! Major milestone for private and commercial space exploration: congratulations, SpaceX.
