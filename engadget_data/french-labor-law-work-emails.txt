Sure, the French have it sweet with a 35 hour work week and five+ weeks of paid vacation. But (Mon dieu!) workers there are still bombarded with job-related emails when off the clock. Almost a million of them won't need to put up with such rude intrusions anymore, though. A legally binding deal signed by tech industry employers and several unions in France means many companies are now forbidden to contact employees electronically after their work day is over. The plan was hailed by worker groups, but not everyone was happy. France has a large digital sector, with a big presence by Google, Facebook and others, and many critics claim that France already has too much bureaucracy. Still, such labor-friendly laws are understandably popular with the public. Given all the cuisine, wine and other pleasures on tap, who wants to hear from le boss?
