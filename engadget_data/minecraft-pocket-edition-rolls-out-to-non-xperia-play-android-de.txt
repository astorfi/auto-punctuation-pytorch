An updated version of the app has hit the Android Market today, bringing with it support for a range of additional devices running Android 2.1 or higher -- although it's still said to be "Xperia Play optimized." Same $6.99 price tag as before, but there is a free demo version available if you're still not sure about the whole Minecraft phenomenon.
