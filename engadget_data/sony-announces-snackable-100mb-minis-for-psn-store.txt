 
Over in beautiful Cologne, Germany, Sony has just confirmed what we've suspected for months now. Exclusive to the PSN Store, loyal Sony gamers will soon have access to a new segment of titles, ones that'll be available anytime and anywhere that there's an internet connection. The 100MB (or less) selections -- which are being officially called Minis -- are designed to take advantage of the "smaller development cost on the PSP," and if all goes well, we'll see 15 games (such as Tetris, Hero of Sparta, MiniGore and Fieldrunners) launching on October 1st. There's been no mention yet of how expensive these "snackable" apps / games will be, but we're holding Sony to its promise of 50 by the end of 2009.Update: Press release after the break.
