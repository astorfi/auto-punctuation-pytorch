 Now, you're gonna have to takethis with a relatively large grain of salt, but Dean Takahashi of The Mercury News is reporting with some amount ofcertainty that Microsoft is, in fact, developing a portablemultimedia and gaming device (that ain't the Origami), andthat they're aiming to take over the world of portable devices. No, not "portable media devices" or"portable gaming devices." They're going after portable devices straight up, supposedly expecting to go headto head with the DS (Lite), PSP, andiPod -- three of the biggest brands in the (youth) consumerelectronics market -- all at once. Takahashi also cites other examples of the project's progress, which is supposedlybeing led by J Allard, and designed by by Xbox system designer Greg Gibson, including some 30 supposed Transmeta engineers assigned to work on a secret MS project,which he speculates could hit in 2007.[Via Joystiq]
