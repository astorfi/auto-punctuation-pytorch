We know that the two companies have collaborated in the past, with old Jobsy and Volkswagen head Martin Winterkorn supposedly sipping brandy and regaling each other with tales of their salad days, but up until now the closest we've seen to an actual product was that Space Up! blue concept interior from back in November of last year. Will you finally have the perfect set of wheels to dock your iPhone on the go? Doubtful... but feel free to dream.[Via Autoblog]
