We've got a feeling they spent more time developing this one than they did thinking of reasons it should be
developed (uh, yeah, you know what we mean), but Sharp's announced a new dual-display technology (which Babelfish
translated to "veil view"—we kinda like it) capable of showing completely different screens at different viewing
angles. Apparently with mass production already started, Sharp wants to get these things in notebooks asap—but we can't
help but wonder if their reasoning is a little flawed. If this is supposed to be a technology used to protect your
information from shoulder surfing interlopers, what does it do to protect your screen from the person peeking behind
you who's far less likely to be detected than the one sitting right next to you?
