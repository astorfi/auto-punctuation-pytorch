According to swarms of e-mails from folks around the US, the retailer everyone loves to hate has decided to rid its stores of films on the red format. We've heard some reports that the discs are simply being shipped back to studios, but nevertheless, it seems that the 30-percent-off sale has reached an abrupt halt. Truthfully, we can only imagine that the other big box retailers will follow suit in short order, but it is somewhat interesting to see such a notable store purging its shelves before the format has zero titles on deck.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in][Image courtesy of Aaron S.]
