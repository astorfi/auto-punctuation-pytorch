If you needed further proof tablets are affecting PC usage, the BBC has something it wants to you show you. Eight months after it first saw iPlayer viewing on tablets overtake phones, the broadcaster reports that over Christmas, the rise in iPad, Hudl and sales of other slates helped push tablet viewing past PC streaming for the first time in iPlayer history. The BBC says it saw almost a million downloads (941,000 to be exact) of its iPlayer mobile apps between December 21st and New Year's Day, as viewers rushed to catch up on the Beeb's festive programming. Although PCs overtook tablets again before the New Year, the return of big shows like Sherlock could positively skew tablet viewing figures once more, giving us an idea of what trends to expect in the coming year.
