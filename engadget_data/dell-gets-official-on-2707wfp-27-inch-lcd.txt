Along with all those specs we've already blown by you, like 1920 x 1200 resolution, 1,000:1 contrast ratio and a 6ms response time, the display features Dell TrueColor Wide Cold-Cathode Fluorescent Lighting, a 9-in-2 media card reader, that beveled glass base that has people talking -- mixed reviews so far -- and a solid aluminum chasis. Dell also packed in a height-adjustable stand with tilt and swivel, along with four USB 2.0 ports. The monitor is available now, with a $1,399 pricetag.
