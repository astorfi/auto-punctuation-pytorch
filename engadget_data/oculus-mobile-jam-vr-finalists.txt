Oculus VR's apps and games contest for the Samsung Gear VR Innovator Edition is in full swing. The 2015 Mobile VR Jam contest received quite a number of interesting submissions, including a game that puts you in the POV of a bullet, one that wants you to fight blind, and another that lets you text and drive without putting real people in danger. Alas, the company has no choice but to narrow the entries down to 61 finalists for the competition, 37 of which are games and 24 are apps or experiences for the virtual reality headset. Before any of them wins part of the $1 million prize pool, though, a panel of ten judges will examine them further in the next few days until they come up with a list of winners for June 3rd. You can browse through a select few of the finalists below (in addition to the ones we listed above, all of which made the cut), but you can also look at the full list on the contest website.
