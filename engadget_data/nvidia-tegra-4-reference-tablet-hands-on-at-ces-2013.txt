 During our on-stage broadcast with NVIDIA, while we got another look at Project Shield, we were also surprised by the appearance of NVIDIA's new Tegra 4 reference tablet. Previously out of reach over at the chipmaker's CES space, we got to exclusively handle it and play some Riptide GP 2 (another first). The device -- which won't ever make its way to consumers -- was incredibly light, while the 16:9 11-inch display beamed out Android 4.2. There's a raft of ports for developers to meddle with, including micro-USB, HDMI and storage expansion, as well as some indentations for docks and fixtures.

 In our hands, it's unerringly light -- and the NVIDIA guys seemed pretty proud when we mentioned that. Performance on the game and basic navigations was unsurprisingly very slick -- the game we tried was developed specifically for NVIDIA's new mobile chip. However, we weren't able to steal a glance at the web browser or other functionality, but we're likely to see and hear a lot more next month at Mobile World Congress. After the break, we've got some playtime with Riptide 2 and a video tour of the device.
