CTIA always has its fair share of dodgy goods, from mildly quirky to downright laughable, we see all kinds. The Cell-Mate admittedly touches on all of these but is surprisingly useful, comfortable, and at $14.99, dirt cheap. The box includes the wire headset and a couple Velcro adhesive pads that you apply to your set; slap one on to your phone, attach to the wire frame and you're ready to talk handsfree. Our own Paul Miller agreed to put it through its paces including: assembly, a test call, and then a fast lap around the press room here at CTIA. Please join us after the break as we torture test the Cell-Mate.
