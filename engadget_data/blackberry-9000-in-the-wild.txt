RIM's been taking on increasingly sharp competition as of late -- even in its traditional corporate strongholds -- and we'd expected and hoped to see something less evolutionary and more revolutionary from these cats. On closer inspection, though, we find that the phone is leaving a very positive second impression. The phone's lines seem flow really well (dare we call a BlackBerry "sexy"?) without losing its purpose-suited stance exuded by the 8300s, 8700s, and 8800s of yore. The real kicker, though, might be the beautiful user interface, which has been totally revamped from the ground up; gone is the cartoonish look and feel of the current lineup, replaced with a modern, warm theme with wireframe icons and slick animations. Another big win: as Vodafone's slide deck mentioned, the 9000 features both WiFi and HSDPA, confirmed by this particular example's info display. Too little, too late -- or is this thing a genuine threat in the marketplace this year? Follow the break for a video of the hot new UI in action![Thanks, BaggedLunch]
