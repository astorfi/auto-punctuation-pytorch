The laptops in question include the Studio XPS 15 and Studio XPS 17 (seemingly successor to the XPS 13 and XPS 16 pictured above), which are said to pack Core i7 processors, an unspecified NVIDIA graphics card, and up to 8GB of RAM and a 750GB hard drive on the XPS 15, and up to 16GB of RAM and a 1.2TB hard drive on the XPS 17. As for that statement from Dell France, it says that while it doesn't normally comment on rumors, there is a "strong likelihood" that the systems mentioned will be marketed in the near future, and that they'll be "great machines" that are "slim and sleek."
