It's been something of a mixed week for BlackBerry, but it's good news for those with an affinity for its BBM service (but an allegiance to other phones.) If you're over on the Apple side of the fence, it looks like rollout has begun, with BBM showing up on iTunes in New Zealand, with more territories sure to follow. Meanwhile, Android was set to land on the Play store at around 7am ET, but has yet to break cover. We'll keep an eye out, and update this post once it's live. Or, like many others, keep refreshing the source link until it shows up!
