We'd imagine that all the slick new features that don't require new hardware (like NFC support) will be there, and we're definitely interested in playing with this built-in WiFi calling stack. We'll let you know what we find -- won't you do the same?

Update: Looks like our flood of tips came from people who were seeing their N1s get a different, less-interesting update. Google tells us that Gingerbread isn't rolling out just yet, but is coming. Of course, we'll let you know when the actual 2.3 update hits the OG Nexus. Ah, the heady optimism of hope.
