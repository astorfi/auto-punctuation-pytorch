Maybe it's a little early yet, but there's no denying we're hella scary-obsessed enough about technology that
someone equated our site with the holiday of fear. So thanks, Josh, for immortalizing Engadget in pumpkin form; your
creation now joins the ranks of the Engadget logo in
Legos and
cellphones.


 P.S. Josh, in a week or two would you please send us a video of you smashing the hell out of this thing? Thx.


 Yr pals,

 Engadget
