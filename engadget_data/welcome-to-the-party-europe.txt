        Take your shoes off though, I just put in new carpet. And the first thing broadcast in HD?Why Tom Cruise of course, while I don't agree with their choice of Minority Report (I'm a Top Gun/Days of Thunder guy),it does make a great show in high definition what with the CG and blowing stuff up.Germany's ProSiebenSat.1 will be the first to broadcast nationally on Sunday, although aregional cable channel apparently started showing science programs on Tuesday (don't they know? Tom Cruise has done the scientific research).Rival German broadcaster Premier will launch its own HDTV transmissions on December 3. BskyB, CanalSat and Ski Italiahave all promised to have their high definition ready for next years World Cup, which will be a showcase for thetechnology in Europe.
