Mobile-review has published a run-down of a device it claims is called the LT30p -- aka the Mint we first heard of back in January -- which also appears to possess many of the specs we'd want from a high-end phone. The front side hosts a 1280 x 720 4.3-inch LCD, while the rear boasts the same 13-megapixel camera as the GX, and there's a microSD slot on the side too. Internally, Mobile-review says ICS is running off a 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 with 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, which all sounds healthy enough -- but since the build quality looks a bit suspect and we don't know for sure that this is a final production handset, we'll wait for IFA fever to paint a fuller picture.

 Update: Although Mobile-review says it has a 4.3-inch screen, a side-by-side photo with the GS III after the break suggests the Mint's panel may be slightly larger than that.
