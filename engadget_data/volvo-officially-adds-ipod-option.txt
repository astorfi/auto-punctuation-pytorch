To build on the
story we brought you during MacWorld comes the official
word from Volvo that they will offer two options for iPod connectivity across their 2005 model line-up. One type of
adapter offered in the S60, S80 and V70/XC70 models features the glovebox connector similar to the one used in BMW's
but unlike that set-up Volvo's will allow you to select tracks and control volume from steering wheel controls.
Unfortunately the S40, V50 and XC90 will use a dashboard mounted FM modulator adapter. But on the upside Volvo will
feature custom playlists on iTunes featuring today's "best" Scandinavian artists. Pricing for either adapter hasn't
been announced yet.
