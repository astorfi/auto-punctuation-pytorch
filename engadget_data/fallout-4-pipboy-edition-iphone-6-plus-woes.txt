Thanks a lot, Bethesda. After the outfit's first E3 media briefing, I pre-ordered the Pip-Boy Edition of Fallout 4 because of course I want to put a real-life version of the game's stat-tracker and menu system on my forearm. All good, right? Well, I'm also in the market for a new phone and was eyeing an iPhone 6 Plus because it has a better camera and battery life compared to its smaller sibling, the iPhone 6. That's where the problems arise: Bethesda recently announced that the real-world Pip-Boy comes with foam inserts that fit the iPhone 4 and 4s, 5 and 5s and the 6 in addition to the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5. The company also promises a customizable foam insert that'll accommodate "most other popular" handsets.



You'll notice that neither the iPhone 6 Plus or Galaxy S6 are listed there. Bethesda says that the reasoning behind the size restrictions is because it wanted to keep the dimensions of the real-life Pip-Boy faithful to those of the in-game model. However, this seems a bit short-sighted. The iPhone 6+ and the Galaxy S6 might be bigger, but they're also pretty popular and represent the best handsets made by their respective manufacturers.

The fact is, this isn't a life-or-death situation and I'll survive either way. But I do have a conundrum on my hands. Do I go for a smaller phone that'll work with the now sold-out Pip-Boy edition of the incredibly anticipated game, or do I stick with my original plan and buy Apple's flagship device? I'm not the type to upgrade my phone that often, and with what a contract-free 6 Plus will run me I'm going to use it until its metaphorical wheels fall off (or it's rendered obsolete via firmware update). I'm not a cosplayer either, so having a totally functioning Pip-Boy on my wrist isn't a huge deal. If my handset won't fit into the plastic sleeve, though, I'm not sure I need to drop $120 after all.

And just when I thought I'd had my new phone issues sorted, too...

What should I do?
