The beta version of Syntellia's Fleksy keypad for Android phones and tablets has arrived on Google Play, months after it first became available on the company's website in January. However, there's a catch: You can only download it if you join its Google+ community as a beta tester. To do so, simply log in with your Google account, click Join then navigate your way to Download Fleksy Beta at the sidebar. Note that when you activate the keyboard via Settings, you'll be warned that it can access everything you type -- even your credit card details -- except your passwords. It takes practice to get used to Fleksy's predictive text engine (as you can see above, it forcibly replaced "Hi, Engadget" with "Hi, Schaefer"), but if you're searching for the elusive touch keypad of your dreams, it's worth giving the erstwhile iOS exclusive a whirl.
