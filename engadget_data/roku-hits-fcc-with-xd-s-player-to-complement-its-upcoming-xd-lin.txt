There are still plenty of plugs in the back, including HDMI, USB, Ethernet, component video, composite video, optical audio, and Ethernet, and the 802.11n a/b/g/n WiFi makes its requisite appearance as well. Since we don't know too much about the XD line yet, we're not sure set the XD S apart, but prior experience in the CE space suggests that "S" stands for "small" or perhaps "scintillating."
