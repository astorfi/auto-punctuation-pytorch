Looks like the once (and in our hearts always) PlayStation phone has popped up on Sony Ericsson Canada's site, and will be exclusive to Rogers -- that is, if a certain tip that Mobile Syrup has received is to be believed. Either way, it looks like it's less than a week until we get all the sordid details.
