 Nintendo's Wii U has yet to launch in Japan, but over there it's been revealed that the innovative Nintendo TVii app will be available when the console launches December 8th. Interestingly, the IR remote functionality that we've already seen packed in will cost 100 yen ($1.21) from Nintendo's eShop. The TV guide data will be pulled from Rovi's G-Guide service, ready to pull up even when you're not using the console, or in the middle of a TV show or video game. We still don't have an exact release date for the i.TV-based feature in North America (it's due in "select" European regions next year) but at least gamers can enjoy their Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and YouTube access until then.
