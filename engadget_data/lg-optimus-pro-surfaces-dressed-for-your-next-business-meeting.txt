It's tough to avoid mentioning the company when looking at these shots unearthed by Italy's Android World blog of the forthcoming LG Optimus Pro, whose form factor ought to prove comfortably familiar to BlackBerry devotees. According to the site, the Gingerbread device has a 2.8 inch screen, a three megapixel camera, an 800MHz processor, and will run â‚¬179 ($249) in that country. Not much more info is available at present, but there's a video after the break, and the source link has a few more shots, if you need help imagining it in your hand at your next board meeting.
