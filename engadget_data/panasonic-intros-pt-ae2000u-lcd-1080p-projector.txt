This HT-centric LCD projector rocks a stunning 1,920 x 1,080 native resolution, puts out 1,500 lumens of brightness, and features a 16,000:1 contrast ratio for good measure. Sporting a subtle, black design, the projector also includes Panny's Detail Clarity Processor to sharpen up those edges, Pure Color Filter Pro, and Smooth Screen technology to "reduce the black lines between pixels." Furthermore, pro users will likely love the Split Adjust mode -- which "allows users to split the screen into two halves, one to make picture adjustments and one to see those adjustments as a baseline reference" -- and the trio of HDMI ports should keep you satisfied for the time being. No word on pricing just yet, but watch for this one to hit dealers in October.
