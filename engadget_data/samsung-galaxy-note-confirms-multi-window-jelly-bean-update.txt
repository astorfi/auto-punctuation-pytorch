 That previously-spotted Premium Suite upgrade for the Galaxy Note is on its way, with Samsung revealing all the details on its site. With a refreshed UI appears very similar to its successor, the respectable Android slab will also lay claim to Air View, Multi-window apps and the addictive easy clip function that allows you to crop and share images and text with the stylus. Thanks to that Jelly Bean update, owners of Samsung's original phablet can also start dabbling with Google Now, which will continue to pluck information from your search history, location and timezone. There's no word yet on when the refreshed Premium suite will find its way onto devices anywhere, but with Samsung already singing the update's praises, it shouldn't be far away.
