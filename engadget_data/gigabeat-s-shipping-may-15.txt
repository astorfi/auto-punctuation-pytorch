       We've been waiting for a chance to pick up a Toshiba Gigabeat S media player since we first got a chance tocheck it out at CES in January. Andnow it looks like the wait may soon be over. While Toshiba has yet to officially announce a US rollout, Engadget readerOne.Person pointed us to HIDEF Lifestyle, which has the model available for preorder, with a ship date of May 15th. Ofcourse, it could just be a ploy to bring in pre-orders, and we should point out that Amazon -- which is usually apretty accurate source -- has the Gigabeat S listed with a May 30th ship date. Hey, after waiting since January, eitherdate is fine with us, though we wouldn't mind getting our hands on this before Memorial Day, so we can break it out assoon as we open the Engadget beach house.[Thanks, One.Person]Read: HIDEFLifestyleRead: Amazon
