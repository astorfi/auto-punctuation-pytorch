Unfortunately, the "world's most advanced e-book reader" limits the LendMe feature to one 14-day period per book, ever, and that's only if the publisher gives permission. You also can't read the title yourself during the loaner period. Of course, nook's biggest competitors can't do this at all and LendMe works on any B&N eReader supported device including the Mac, PC, iPhone, iPod touch, and BlackBerry. One-time is certainly better than no-times, eh?
