Best Buy's mobile accessories site is listing both phones, complete with pictures, and while there's no information provided about the handsets themselves, this certainly would seem to point to a release in the very near future. Oh, and if you had any doubts these handsets would be compatible with the many and myriad Bluetooth headsets on offer at BBY, you need worry no more.

[Thanks, Matt]
