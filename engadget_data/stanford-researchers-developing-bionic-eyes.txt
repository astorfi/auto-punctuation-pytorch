Researchers at Stanford University are developing a "bionic eye," using a retinal implant linked to a goggle-mounted
camera. The implant is said to be able to provide higher resolution than similar devices being developed at the
University of Southern California and Chicago Medical Center. The system has already been tested in rats, which were
able to respond to patterns of stripes waved in front of them. The research is being funded by the U.S. Air Force and
VISX Corp. We assume the latter wants to commercialize the technology, while the former is apparently hoping to create
a race of cyborg pilots with super vision.
