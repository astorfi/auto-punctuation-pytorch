A viral video for the "Nokia Vasco" has just wrapped according to cameraman Danny Gagatt's tweet above. That sets the expectation then, that the launch of what everyone expects to be Nokia's first Symbian^3 device is just around the corner. Plausible since Gagatt's slip (since removed) tips The Mill -- the same visual effects company used by Nokia for the N900 nuthouse job. Besides, it's almost mid-April so we expect things to get official right quick.
