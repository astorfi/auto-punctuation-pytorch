Looks like the integrated
GPS on the Gizmondo is good
for something after all. Word is that, after a robber stole a Gizmondo unit from the company's London store, he was
tracked by GPS and got a text message from the company letting him know they were onto him. The thief immediately
returned the device. We're not quite sure exactly how the staff at the store accomplished this, but we hope they're
only able to do it with display units. After all, while the Gizmondo is capable of phoning home with tracking info via
GPRS, we'd like to assume that, in most cases, this has to be activated by the purchaser, and isn't on by default. Or
is our Gizmondo tracking us right now at this very moment?
