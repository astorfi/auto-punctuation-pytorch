That's because Western Digital recently signed an agreement to make its WD TV Live HD network media players compatible with Microsoft's "Play To" feature, allowing you to push media right to your TV from a Windows Media Player 12-equipped PC. While the feature actually snuck its way into firmware revision 1.02.21 in late March, WD only just began trumpeting its inclusion today... possibly to let memories of its disastrous prior update fade. Whatever the reason, the box is not the "first network media player compatible with Windows 7" -- Denon has four receivers that predate it. Press release and an example of what 'Play To' looks like, right after the break.
