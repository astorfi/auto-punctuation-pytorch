Microsoft's giving you the chance to try out its Edge browser before Windows 10 drops on July 29th, along with other new features that will come with the platform. You'll have to download Windows 10's latest preview build for PCs to take it for a spin, but make sure to back up your favorites first, because you're going to say bye-bye to Project Spartan for good. The company has incorporated several user suggestions to the browser, including a home button, a more customizable New Tab page, password autofill, as well as the ability to import favorites/bookmarks from other browsers and to play music from a minimized tab.



Cortana can now issue flight or work alerts, and it can help you send emails without typing anything: simply recite the recipient's email address, the missive's subject line and contents in that order. Windows Photos app now also supports GIFs and has an "Open with..." option. Finally, Skype WiFi has been completely replaced with Microsoft WiFi, which you can use to buy access to hotspots in chunks of time using Windows Store's payment methods. Redmond's announcement details all the new build's features, so check it out first before loading the preview OS on your computer.
