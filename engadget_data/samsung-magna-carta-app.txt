Samsung has launched the Magna Carta app, the vehicle through which one million Galaxy S 4, S III and Note II owners will be able to download Jay-Z's latest opus for free. Download it today, and Mr. Carter (Carter / Carta, geddit?) album will arrive on your handset on July 4th, three days ahead of the CD's global release. Users will also get behind-the-scenes footage, lyrics and track sharing options. It's available for free at the Play store, with the obvious caveat that it'll only work on the aforementioned trio of phones. After all, if you're having phone problems, he feels bad for you son, he's got 99 problems, but Samsung's patronage ain't one.
