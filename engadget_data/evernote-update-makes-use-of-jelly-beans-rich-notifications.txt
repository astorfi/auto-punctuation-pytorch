Now, one of our favorite apps, Evernote, is tapping into their power. Version 4.2 of the note-taking giant's program offers quick shortcuts to edit and share uploaded notes from the notification pull down. Those notifications are also delivering a lot more context than they used to. Rather than a simple alert that a note has been uploaded, you're now presented with a thumbnail of images captured and a snippet of your text entry. Power users will also be glad to hear those notifications will no longer pile up, as multiple ones will be condensed into a single entry as they do with Gmail. There's also the usual bevvy of bug fixes and performance improvements, which is never a bad thing.. Hit up the source to download it now.
