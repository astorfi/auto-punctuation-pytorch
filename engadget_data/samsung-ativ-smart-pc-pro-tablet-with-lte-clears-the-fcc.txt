 It's been increasingly tough to keep all of Samsung's Windows 8 tablets straight recently, with changing names adding to the confusion, and it looks like you can add one more variation to keep track of. A new Series 7 model, the ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T, has turned up at the FCC today boasting some hereto unannounced LTE connectivity -- although that doesn't come as a huge surprise considering Samsung's already delivered a non-Pro ATIV to AT&T. Of course, that "Pro" designation means you'll be getting an x86 processor and the full-fledged version of Windows 8 instead of RT, but it's not clear what other changes this version might have in store compared to non-LTE model.

 Correction: As some have pointed out below in the comments below, the non-Pro model does also come with the full-fledged version of Windows 8, not RT.
