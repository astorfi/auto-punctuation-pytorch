Not a lot, and in today's episode we'd like to introduce you to the packaging and subsequent de-packaging of an LG KG800 Chocolate phone, courtesy of MobileBurn's Brad Kellett. It's only a few short, beautiful pictures, but because the likelihood of your having one in the States is so low, we'd like to show you how LG turned it out. (Hint: they did well.) Enjoy.
