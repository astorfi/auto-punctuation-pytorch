 In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line. Granted, claims by the JuiceTank's creators that their product is "the first ever iPhone charger and case in one" may be a bit overblown, but its design is certainly novel enough to make us give it a second look. The product looks like a pretty standard hard-shelled iPhone 4 / 4S case from the front -- flip it over though, and you'll see two charging prongs embedded in the back. Click the button just below and they'll pop up, allowing you to plug the handset directly into the wall -- no cords or separate chargers needed. Of course, this initial version is made specifically for North American-type outlets, so if you live outside the region or travel a lot, the novelty might be lost on you. If you're covered, however, you can pick up a limited edition green version by being one of the first 400 people to pledge $40 or more. Check out a video explanation / plea after the break.
      

 

    Previous project update: Still time to get in on some of that robot fighting action -- 21 days to be exact. Currently the Mech Warfare Robot Arena is at $2,441 pledged out of a goal of $6,000.
