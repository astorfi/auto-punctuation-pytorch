Yeah, you know thin is so
in, yo. LG is the next kid on the block
to throw down an ultra-slim phone with its SD-290. It's wearing the Cyon badge which means it won't likely be touring
outside of South Korea anytime soon (or ever), but it's noteworthy in that it's a slim slider as opposed to the
RAZR and the
Samsung SCH-V740 which are both
clamshells (and at 17mm is a tad thicker than either of them). Beyond that it's doing a 176 x 220 color TFT, 1.3
megapixel camera, TransFlash storage, IR and transferring via USB 2.0. You'll have to throw down the equivalent
$300-350USD for itâ€¦ in Korea.
