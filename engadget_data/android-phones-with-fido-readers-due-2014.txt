The FIDO Alliance hinted that mobile fingerprint readers would play a part in its passcode-free strategy, and it turns out that we'll see those readers quite soon. Group president Michael Barrett tells USA Today that Android smartphones with FIDO-based fingerprint readers should be available in about six months, or early 2014. While the Alliance isn't saying which companies are launching those devices, we'd expect FIDO members like Lenovo and LG to embrace the technology first. As for other platforms? Barrett believes that Apple's Touch ID could work with FIDO, but we wouldn't count on it when Apple is still hesitant to embrace third-party developers.
