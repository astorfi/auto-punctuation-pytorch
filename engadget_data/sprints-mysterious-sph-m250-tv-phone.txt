The phone is Samsung's SPH-M250, which looks to be a version of Sammy's SPH-B250, a DMB phone for Korea (2 megapixel camera, 128MB memory and Bluetooth if you're keeping track). The interesting thing about the phone is that it is only approved for the 1900MHz band, unlike other Sprint phones which are dual-band. So while it's possible that the phone is just for watching EV-DO movies in the comfort of that swivel screen, Phone Scoop thinks it more likely that there were antenna issues with Sprint's 2.5GHz mobile TV tech. They've already been running tests on TDtv technology, a method that uses 3G spectrum for live DMB-esque TV channels up to QVGA resolution, and this SPH-M250 could be for more testing, or to maybe even launch their TV service. We won't hold our breath.[Via Phone Scoop]
