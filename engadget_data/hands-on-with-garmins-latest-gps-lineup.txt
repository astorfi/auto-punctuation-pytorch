We got a chance to handle a few of these, and we must saw we're pretty impressed by the thin form factors and sharp touchscreens. The new MSN Direct features probably won't revolutionize your GPS experience, and features like news snippets seem downright gimmicky when faced with the full-on internet access most of us currently enjoy on our phones, but plenty of folks will still find use for the gas price tracker, live traffic updates and movie times, and the interface really couldn't be simpler.
