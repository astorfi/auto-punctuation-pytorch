The next round of downloadable content for Mario Kart 8, a pack featuring tracks and items from the Animal Crossing series, will hit the Wii U on April 23rd, Nintendo announced today. The DLC pack was originally scheduled to launch in May. Hooray!


Also heading to Mario Kart 8 on April 23rd is a free update that adds a 200cc speed class, meaning players who have mastered the existing races get a brand new challenge. That's bananas! The update also adds support for more amiibo, Nintendo's Skylanders-style action figures.
