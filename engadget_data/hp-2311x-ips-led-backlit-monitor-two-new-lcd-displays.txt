Accompanying the 2311x is the 20-inch 2011xi IPS LED backlit monitor, which for $170 offers 178-degree viewing angles and a 1600 x 900 resolution. Both versions will start shipping in the US on June 24th.

 HP is also updating its selection of LED-backlit LCD monitors. The 20-inch W2071d and 23-inch W2371d sport resolutions of 1600 x 900 and 1920 x 1080, respectively, and both include VGA and DVI-D inputs. The 20-incher will go for $140, while the 23-incher costs $200 -- no word on availability yet.
