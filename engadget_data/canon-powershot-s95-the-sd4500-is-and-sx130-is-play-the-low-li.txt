The S95 update ($399.99 in late August) to last year's S90 combines Canon's DIGIC 4 image processing, a 10-megapixel high-sensitivity CCD sensor, and wide f/2.0 lens to enhance image quality and reduce noise at high ISO levels without resorting to a flash. It features a new high dynamic range (HDR) mode, 720p video recording, and mini HDMI for throwing that video up to the living room flat screen. the S95 is also the first PowerShot to feature Hybrid IS image stabilization to help with macro shots. The SX130 IS ($249.99 in August), meanwhile, offers a 12.1 megapixel CMOS and 12x optical zoom lens that relies on optical image stabilization to keep things stable. A 3-inch LCD, 720p video mode, and Miniature, Fisheye, Poster, and Super Vivid creative modes. Rounding things out is the Power SD4500 IS with 10x optical zoom, optical image stabilization, and a 1080p video mode with Dynamic IS that helps further stabilize the video while the shooter is in motion -- a first for a digital ELPH. Canon's even slapped in a 240fps super slow motion mode (at an unspecified resolution) from Casio's bag of tricks. Expect it to hit retail in September for $349.99.

These cameras achieve photographic brilliance with Canon's HS (High Sensitivity) SYSTEM for improved low-light shooting in the S95 and SD4500 IS cameras, High Definition (HD) video recording, High Dynamic Range (HDR) in the S95 camera and a more intelligent Smart AUTO mode, among a range of others. The pro-shooter seizing the last summer sunsets with the S95 camera, the dad recording his son leaving for college on the SD4500 IS model, the aunt capturing a photo of her nephew's football team with the SX130 IS camera - these new PowerShot cameras showcase extraordinary image quality with every shot.Achieving great images in low-lightWhether shooting a large family photo at a sunset wedding or capturing a historical monument at night, the new PowerShot Digital cameras capture clear, exceptional images in low-light settings thanks to Canon's HS SYSTEM. Canon's DIGIC 4 Image Processor combined with a 10-megapixel High Sensitivity CCD sensor in the S95 camera or a CMOS sensor in the SD4500 camera, make up Canon's HS SYSTEM. The HS SYSTEM enhances image quality and helps reduce noise at high ISO levels. It also helps to accentuate a number of hard-to-get details in images with decreased lighting. When used together, Canon's HS SYSTEM and the f/2.0 lens in the PowerShot S95 camera, enables users to capture dimly lit scenes without a flash, resulting in a more natural look for photos."Image quality consistently remains a top priority at Canon and with each generation of PowerShot cameras, we look to build the features and technology that will best improve a customer's experience with our cameras," said Yuichi Ishizuka, executive vice president and general manager, Consumer Imaging Group, Canon U.S.A. "New features, like the Canon HS SYSTEM for enhanced low light performance and high-speed shooting, helps consumers to capture images in dimly lit settings, further increasing the beauty of a moment."Shooting HD at its bestWhen it comes to capturing a child walking for the first time or a person diving into a pool on vacation, shooting HD video is the ideal option.

Combined with stereo sound, the inclusion of HD video capabilities in the PowerShot S95, SD4500 IS and SX130 IS cameras, along with outstanding still image quality, help make these models the ultimate image-capture devices.Capture natural beauty with High Dynamic Range (HDR)Excellent for outdoor shooting, the new S95 camera is the first Canon camera to feature the in-camera, HDR scene mode to help shooters capture the full magnitude of a scene that consists of very dark tones and bright highlights. With the use of a tripod, one push of the shutter button yields three sequential images with various exposures, and then combines them into a single optimized image within the camera. As a result, the image showcases a better range of depth and detail found in natural settings.Get Smart with new shooting scenesCanon's Smart AUTO now features 28 shooting scenes to help automatically adjust to different lighting or movement levels to obtain the best image possible. Another new feature for the less-experienced shooter to utilize is the Best Image Selection option found in the SD4500 IS camera.
