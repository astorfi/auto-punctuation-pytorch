OnePlus has heard your frustration about the drip-feeding of information leading to its next phone, but according to co-founder Carl Pei, it's going to "keep doing things differently." For the OnePlus 2, that means taking advantage of new technology just to announce the thing. On July 27th at 10PM ET, OnePlus new Snapdragon 810-powered cellphone will be revealed with a streaming virtual reality presentation. Just to make sure the fans can tune in, it's working on a free OnePlus Cardboard headset that owners of its first phone (pictured above) can use to watch. Sign up on the website for more info on the headset, and clear your schedule. So far, what we know about the phone is its CPU and that it uses a USB Type-C connector (check after the break for a video of Pei using the phone's charging cable to juice up a Macbook), but you should be able to see the new device in 360-degree surround next month.
