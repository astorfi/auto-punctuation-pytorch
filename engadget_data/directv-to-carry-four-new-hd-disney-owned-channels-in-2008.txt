       While they can hardly count these towards the 100 they promised for this year, there is no doubt DirecTV knows that when you are making deals; think long term. Starting in early 2008 ESPNEWS HD will launch as a 24 hour HD simulcast of ESPNEWS when the new studio is complete and will be carried by DirecTV. DirecTV will also carry ABC Family HD, Disney Channel HD, and Toon Disney HD, also released sometime in 2008. These will be the first family oriented HD channels as well as the first 24 news channel to go HD assuming CNN or someone else doesn't beat them to it.[Via DBSTalk.com]
