  We've already seen the device in the real world, but now it's confirmed -- this portable Neo Geo is legit and heading to both the US and Europe. Blaze is crafting the retro gaming handheld with SNK's blessing and 20 baked-in titles confirmed, including Metal Slug, King of Fighters '94 and -- yes -- King of the Monsters. It'll tie into the Neo Geo's 20th birthday and the manufacturer promises that the new device will deliver the same arcade thrills "in a more affordable manner," although there's still no pricing specifics.
