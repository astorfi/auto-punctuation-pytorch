 Tired of waiting for Black Friday? Just plain terrified of getting mauled? If you happen to fit into either of the aforementioned categories, take heart, as Dell's got you covered. The firm's 15.4-inch Vostro 1000 -- which was listed earlier this year for as low as $449 -- has now dipped $50 lower to crack the oh-so-crucial $400 barrier. The all-black lappie features a 1.7GHz AMD Athlon 64 X2 TK-53 processor, Windows XP Home Edition, an XGA panel, 120GB 5,400 RPM hard drive, 1GB of DDR2 RAM, a DVD writer (with dual-layer DVD+R write capability), ATI's Radeon Xpress 1150 integrated graphics set, 802.11g WiFi and a four-cell Li-ion battery to boot. Nah, this budget machine won't satisfactorily churn through any advanced audio / video editing, but we'd bet it can handle Doom just fine.
