While some have bent to the will of Ballmer and Co., Red Hat and Canonical (makers of Ubuntu) are holding their ground. Red Hat says it will not pay "innovation tax" to Microsoft, while Canonical's Mark Shuttleworth more poetically describes the aforementioned deals as, "Trinkets in exchange for air kisses." As far as we can tell, that's the kind of talk that immediately precedes a bar brawl.[Via Digg]
