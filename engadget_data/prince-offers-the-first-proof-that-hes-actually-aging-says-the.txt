In fact, the diminutive all star has been quoted in a Mirror interview as saying that the "internet's completely over." He explains: "The internet's like MTV. At one time MTV was hip and suddenly it became outdated. Anyway, all these computers and digital gadgets are no good." Now, we know that the artist formerly known as "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" is going to (deservedly) take a lot of flack from the "internet" for this one -- after all, nobody likes to hear that they're "over," right? But, in his defense, he was never really into the internet to begin with -- as is evidenced by the awesome YouTube clip below.
