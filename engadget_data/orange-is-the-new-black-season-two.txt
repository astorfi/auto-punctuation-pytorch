Should you fancy Piper Chapman's prison-based predicament more than Frank Underwood's political conniving, you're in luck. The second season of Orange is the New Black will hit Netflix on June 6th -- less than a year after the series debuted. As The Hollywood Reporter tells it, Laura Prepon won't return as a regular on the show, but Danielle Brooks (Taystee) and Taryn Manning (Pennsatucky) will. The latter of which should be a clue that Chapman showed at least some restraint during the first season's closing moments. Of course, if you've made it through House of Cards' second season, you're already privy to this info as there's a poster after the season finale. We've embedded a teaser trailer after the break if you're jonesin' for a peek at Crazy Eyes' ... well, crazy eyes.
