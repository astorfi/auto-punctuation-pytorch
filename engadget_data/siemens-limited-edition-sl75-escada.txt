Not sure whether BenQ's recent acquisition of
Siemens' mobile biz will mean the end of all these deathly ugly "fashionphones" (please let the answer be yes), but
apparently they're doing another phone jointly-designed with the cats from
Escada. This one's a limited-edition
gold-colored version of the SL75 that's listed as having
a 1.3 megapixel digital camera and built-in media player software.
