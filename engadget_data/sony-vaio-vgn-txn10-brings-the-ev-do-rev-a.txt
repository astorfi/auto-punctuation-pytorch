Previously, only available on Cingular's EDGE network, Sprint will be packin' their Power Vision network into this 2.8-pound, sub-incher giving subscribers 450-800 kbps downloads and 300-400 kbps upload speeds (on average) when they begin upgrading to Revision A. For their part, Sony brings that 11.1-inch widescreen display, Core Solo proc, WiFi, Bluetooth, up to 11-hours off battery, and dual-layer DVD burner with Instant Mode for soaking up media without the need to boot into XP. It's not clear when, exactly, this combo will all come come together, but the notebook will cost you about $2300 when this whole thing kicks off in Q4.
