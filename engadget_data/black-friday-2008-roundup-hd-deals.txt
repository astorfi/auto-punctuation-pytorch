 
Let's face it -- it's easy to get overwhelmed when it comes to Black Friday. For starters, it's the day after Thanksgiving, a day in which you're likely already stressed out about what to cook, where to clean, who to invite and how to get off work early. The last thing you need is more stress when thinking about what HD gear you'll be adding to your collection a few days from now. Thus, we've scoured the intarwebz and scrubbed the deal sheets in order to present a slimmed down, easy-to-digest guide of where the best buys on high-def-related kit will be on November 28th. Hop on past the break to start making your list.[Image courtesy of SmackShopping]
      

 

Before we get going with the deals, we'd like to point out that this list is by no means exhaustive nor complete. Some retailers wait till the last possible moment to reveal their deals, and leaks can happen each and everyday. To that end, we'd encourage you to keep a close eye on BlackFriday.info for up-to-the-minute changes and additions to Black Friday deals, and of course, you can survey our own coverage of the glorified shopping day right here. Have fun out there, and be sure to point out deals not mentioned in comments below.Amazon 42-inch Panasonic 720p plasma HDTV - $699 42-inch Samsung 720p Plasma HDTV - $699 Hourly Lightning Deals from 12:01AM to 11PM PST Read - Amazon Black Friday releaseRead - Amazon Black Friday storefrontBest BuyThe following deals are limit 1 per customer; doorbuster special; available early online.
