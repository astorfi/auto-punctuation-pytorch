 According to a "well connected source" in the Wired camp, the iPod mills in China are hard at work as we speak, churning out next-gen iPod Touch models with integrated cameras and microphones. This certainly jibes well with the tips we've received regarding both this device and a cam-equipped nano -- although we're still skeptical about the rumored OLED iPods. The article goes on to suggest that once you add a mic to the mix, all you need is a MiFi and the Skype application for "the iPhone experience" on Verizon's (or Sprint's) network. Seems like an awful lot to go through just to avoid AT&T, but we suppose that it's good to have options.
