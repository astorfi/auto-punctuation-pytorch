Both of Alienware's flagship gaming laptops have received a well deserved refresh today, with the 17-incher (starts at $1,799) getting a Mobile Core i7 CPU and twin GPUs; the little brother has also been tweaked somewhat, and it starts at a reasonable-for-Alienware price of $1,399. In related news, the $499 23-inch OptX AW2310 LCD has been announced for the 3D gamer set, offering up a 1080p resolution and support for NVIDIA's 3D Vision Kit.
