 Another week closer to CES and not much changes in the selection of content for your favorite HD movie format. Sony pictures continues to disappoint with their transfers this week with Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, which is especially disappointing considering it is a dual-layer disc and packed full of extras. Fox brings out a new release that we are sure someone is waiting to see with The Devil Wears Prada. Paramount brings WTC to both formats and some will refuse to watch it no matter what medium it comes on. Blu-ray would be catching up, but Image is releasing 3 music titles on HD DVD this week and despite the almost definite Blu-ray fanboy's protest they do count. HD DVD 136 vs Blu-ray 121.Blu-ray
