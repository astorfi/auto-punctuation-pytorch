It's menus can be popped up at any time and seamlessly display additional info, or allow Sharp tech support to directly access the panel and help Grandma program her favorite channels. That's all a part of "Aquos Advantage", its new end-to-end Panasonic Plasma Concierge-style support service. The "Special Edition" 94U line is the high end, featuring 27,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio, 120Hz frame rate and new backlight system in Sharp's latest ASV panel thats 28% thinner than the last. The top of the line 65-inch LC-65SE94U model will be available this month with an MSRP of $10,999, the 52-inch soon after for $4,199, and the 46-inch version in February for $3,199. Check out the gallery for a look at the Aquos line's latest and greatest.
