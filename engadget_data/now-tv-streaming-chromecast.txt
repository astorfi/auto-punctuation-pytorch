Ever since Now TV launched, subscribers have cried out for Sky to support more streaming devices. Today, the company answered some of its critics by announcing it's built Chromecast functionality into its Now TV apps on both iOS and Android. If you own one of Google's £30 streaming dongles, you'll now be able to beam movies, TV shows and sports coverage over to your big screen by simply hitting the new Chromecast icon inside the updated apps. While Sky knows today's launch will give customers less of an incentive to buy its £10 Now TV set-top box, it hopes it'll be able to lure new subscribers to the service as it battles Netflix and Amazon for a share of the UK streaming market.
