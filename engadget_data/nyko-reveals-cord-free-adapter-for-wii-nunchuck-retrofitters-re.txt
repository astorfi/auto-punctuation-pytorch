Fret not, Wii faithful, as Nyko is coming to your rescue once more. The aptly-titled Cord-Free Adapter for Wii Nunchuck enables current wired Nunchuck owners to simply holster their peripherals, wind up the cord and enjoy all sorts of wireless freedom. Granted, we still feel that this February-bound accessory is priced a touch high at $19.99, but hey, it's cheaper than buying an all new third-party 'chuck, eh?
