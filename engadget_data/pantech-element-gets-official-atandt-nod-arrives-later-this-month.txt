  Well, we saw this coming and now it's gone all official. Pantech's premier Android tablet will be arriving on AT&T and, more importantly, it's coming January 22nd, matching the specs from our leak earlier. A refresher? Well, there's a 1.5GHz dual-core processor and 16GB of storage, with room for expansion through microSD. The eight-inch slate will arrive on Honeycomb 3.2, although there's no news yet on an Ice Cream Sandwich update. Price-wise, expect the Element to set you back $300 on a two-year contract or $450 off-contract. Check it out in action in the video after the break.Update: Check out our CES hands-on here
