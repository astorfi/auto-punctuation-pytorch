It's no secret that Samsung's working on a next-gen Galaxy Note, but little did we know that it might come in three screen sizes. We've previously seen the model number SM-N900 pop up in a number of places, and this time, our friend @techkiddy spotted the screen sizes alongside some new names on Zauba, a database that somehow tracks India's import and export shipments.


Unlike the rumors out there that only mention a single screen size, Zauba lists all 5.5-, 5.7- and 6-inch versions of this supposed Note III, and that these are all shipped to India "for R&D purpose." If true, this would match the multi-size strategy of the Galaxy Mega. Additionally, there are a handful of variant names here: SM-N900A, SM-N900AI, SM-N900P, SM-N900R4, SM-N900S, SM-N900T and SM-N900V. We're not quite sure what the differences are, but some of these are tagged with multiple screen sizes, so they're probably just packaged with different radios. Regardless, we have a feeling that JK Shin will tell us everything at IFA in September.


Update: Adam from Samsung Updates has explained what these model numbers mean. Go take a look.
