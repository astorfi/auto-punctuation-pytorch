The original PlayStation, throughits original and PSone iterations, has sold over 100 million units, and we're sure brought joy to millions of usersworldwide, ourselves included. (Oh come on, Syphon Filter? Final Fantasy Tactics? Parappa? These are true happiness.)Of course, you'll always be able to grab a PSone on eBay if a Spyro urge hits, or just dive into your storage shed todredge up your original PlayStation, but can we ever truly go back to those days of our youth? The good news is thatSony is working on a PSX emulator for the PSP, and you can alwayspop an old game into your PS2 or PS3, so hopefully we'll never be far from a little bit of (relatively) old schoolaction.[Via Joystiq]
