 Happy friday, everybody! Once again we're kicking off the weekend by giving away an Xbox 360! Before we roll on this one, we have to let you know who won the last: Derren, you've got a 360! (To all the other Derrens that entered -- we've already contacted the winner, so if you didn't hear from us, sorry, you didn't get picked this time!) So, the prize is an Xbox 360 Premium bundle, which, just in case you haven't been reading Engadget for the last year or so, comes with:

Xbox 360 console (soon with 1080p output!)
20GB drive add-on
Wireless controller
Xbox headset
Component high def AV cable
Ethernet cable

We're also throwing in a PowerSquid black Surge3000 for the winner to make sure you've got enough juice and plugs for your console, HDTV, etc., courtesy of our pals at Flexity. You'll have until Thursday the 19th to enter; we'll pick somebody at random who tells us in the comments which accessories they plan to buy for their 360 (or have already bought for their 360 if they already have one):

You may enter other Engadget contests, however...
You may only enter this contest once; if you enter more than once on this particular contest post you'll be automatically disqualified and barred from all future giveaways. (Yes, we have robots that thoroughly check to ensure fairness.) You may enter future Engadget relaunch giveaway contests though!
You can only win once. (If you win and then try to go for a second prize during our relaunch giveaways, you'll be automatically disqualified, etc.)
Contest is open to everybody worldwide! (This is a US unit, however.)
You will be shipped your 360 when all the contests are up, so sit tight!

Good luck, and be sure you've entered our other contests, as well!
