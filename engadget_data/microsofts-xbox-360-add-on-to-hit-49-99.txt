With HD DVD hung out to dry by everyone and their long lost cousin, it's simply a matter of time before players are being traded for rides on the carousel. Nevertheless, reports are already circulating that Microsoft's Xbox 360 add-on drive could sink to $49.99 in the not-too-distant future, which may actually make it worth grabbing for the very respectable library of HD DVD titles already out there. Whatever you do, don't pay full price for this thing.  [Thanks, Steve]
