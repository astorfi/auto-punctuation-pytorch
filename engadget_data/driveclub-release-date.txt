Evolution Studios may have missed its chance to make Driveclub a PlayStation 4 launch title (and a technology showcase) by quite a wide margin, but it at last has some firm release dates. The socially-savvy racing game should reach North America on October 7th, while Europeans will get it a day later. As Sony previously explained, the nearly year-long delay comes after Evolution went "back to the drawing board" to rework large parts of the game, taking on a new project leader in the process. Patience may prove to be a virtue in that case, although we don't envy Driveclub's odds of success when it's launching on a very, very busy day. The title now has to vie for attention with potential blockbusters like Alien: Isolation, Dragon Age: Inquisition and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor -- there's no certainty that gamers will have the cash to spare.
