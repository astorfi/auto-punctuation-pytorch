 Sure the SX160 is a bit of a bulky superzoom, but it's got nothing on Canon's beefy PowerShot SX50 HS. As with the similarly named SX500 IS, the SX50's got a big, protruding lens and flash, though the added girth make it look a bit more like a DSLR. Part of its width can no doubt be chalked up to its 2.8-inch vari-angle LCD, which can be swiveled away from the body of the camera to help vary viewing angles. Also, like the SX50, the SX500 has a devoted button for Zoom Framing Assist, which does a quick zoom out to help you reframe subjects on the fly.

 Above the display you'll find a play button and a cushioned viewfinder. To its right, you've got the Record, Display, Menu and access to settings like Macro and ISO. You'll find the rest to the settings -- plus ON / OFF and access to that big 50x zooming to the right of the flash. The PowerShot SX50 HS will run you $480 when it drops next month.
