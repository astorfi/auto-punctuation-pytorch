Companion to the more recent XSi new DSLR has a larger 2.5-inch screen 10 megapixel sensor, live view display, 3fps burst shooting, DIGIC III image processor, seven point AF, and a bundled EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens. Unfortunately this is only going live in Japan today -- we'll be stuck waiting until next month for the US launch, which will supposedly place it in the $600-800 price range (we know, it's wide, we've got very little to go by right now). One more shot of the rear after the break.
