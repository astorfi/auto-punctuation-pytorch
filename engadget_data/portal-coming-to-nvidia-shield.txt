You won't have to stick to a PC or TV to play Valve's iconic games in the future. The developer is teaming up with NVIDIA to bring the original Portal to the Shield handheld -- in other words, Portal is coming to Android. The two haven't said just when the space-defying puzzle title will be available on the Shield, although it unfortunately sounds like other Android devices may be out of luck. We've reached out to see if there's a possibility of a wider release. Still, it's good to see Valve dip its toes in the mobile gaming waters, unlike certain companies. And hey -- it'll be as good an excuse as any to get reacquainted with your Companion Cube.


Update: An NVIDIA spokesperson says that the company isn't discussing "additional devices and/or device requirements at this time."
