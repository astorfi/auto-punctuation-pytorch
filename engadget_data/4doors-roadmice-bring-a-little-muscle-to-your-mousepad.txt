They're wireless mini modern muscle car mice that replicate the look of autos like the Dodge Charger, Chevy Z06 'Vette, and Ford Mustang, complete with two-button hoods, 800 dpi optical sensors, scroll wheel induction cowls, and even working headlights for safe clicking at night. Each one comes with a USB receiver, six-month unlimited mile warranty, and a vaguely authentic looking title certificate if you register online. Yeah it's all a bit cheeky, and we're thinking that lip-spoiler on the back of the Camaro wouldn't do your palm any favors, but, for $45 in a variety of colors, they're cheaper and more useful than the other bits of automotive memorabilia scattered around your office.[Via Autoblog]
