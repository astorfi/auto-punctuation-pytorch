 Britain, rightly or wrongly, is crawling with surveillance cameras for spying on its citizenry. But there's a whole class of cameras that could be used for security purposes that MI5/MI6 may have forgotten about: webcams. On Friday, a Beatles fan happened to be watching the webcam that's trained on Mathew Street, a nabe in Liverpool that houses the famous Cavern Club, where the Fab Four got their start. This astute fan watched from his home in Dallas as three perps were breaking into a sports store. He picked up his phone and called the Liverpool police -- and the suspects were arrested.
