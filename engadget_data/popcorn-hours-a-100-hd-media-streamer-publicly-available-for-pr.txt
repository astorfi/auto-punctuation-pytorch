Previously, folks had to actually sign a list just to be blessed with the privilege of placing an order, but now it seems supply is at long last flowing in nicely. The company has even set up a forum to keep customers informed of order status, but we wouldn't dillydally around -- these are still being sold on a first come, first served basis.[Thanks, leland]
