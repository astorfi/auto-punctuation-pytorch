The $250 ObamaBot stands 6-feet tall and regurgitates stump speeches by the president-elect while presumably cleansing the Earth of any naysayers. ObamaBot's University of Florida creators see the world as so imperfect, that they'd prefer to pal around with robots who would target their own planet. Run little girl, run... change is coming.
