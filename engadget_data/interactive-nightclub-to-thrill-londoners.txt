Dubbed the "first interactive bar in the world," each wall will be lined in blank canvas so that projections can be beamed out and altered on a whim to really get you trippin'. Additionally, there will be "hundreds of LEDs" to treat your retinas to, and the bar itself will even be touch sensitive, allowing you to alert the bartender of your drink needs by simply laying your hand down. Sounds like a bloody good time for you blokes (and dames) in the area, but for the rest of us, we'll have to settle with a few more stills after the jump.
