 AMD wasn't kidding around about trimming and down and driving hard after profitability. The company just struck up a deal with Broadcom to swap its TV-chip unit for $192.8 million in cash to help fight debt and seek out profitability. Broadcom is getting 530 AMD employees out of the deal and AMD's considerable experience in the digital TV chipset game, which will become the "core" of Broadcom's line in that market. The deal should close by the end of the year, and is unrelated to AMD's efforts to spin off its foundry biz.[Thanks, Keith L]
