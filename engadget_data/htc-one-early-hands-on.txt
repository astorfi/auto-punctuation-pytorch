 The HTC One launch event has just begun, but we've already got our first hands-on! Not a lot of details at this point, as the phone is still being announced on-stage, but a kindly gentlemen sitting in the audience who had a handset let us try his out for a few moments. Early impressions are that the phone feels great in the hand, very thin and very well made. The UI customizations, meanwhile, are another story entirely. Very Windows Phone-like, we're not sure traditional Android fans are going to love it. Enjoy the pics for now, we'll be back with more details soon!
