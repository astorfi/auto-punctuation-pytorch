 
 Looks like LG and Toshiba aren't the only TV manufacturers dreaming of a platform-independent future for Smart TVs -- Panasonic has joined the Smart TV Alliance too. Founded to help build a non-proprietary ecosystem for Smart TV apps, the Alliance's ranks have grown to include Panasonic IBM Specific Media, ABOX42 and TechniSat. Smart TV Alliance president Richard Choi is optimistic that the new members will help it mend a fragmented market, giving developers a chance to focus on building apps, rather than navigate compliance processes. A CES developers conference hopes to get them started, too -- introducing the latest SDK's upcoming features, including updated HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript specifications, as well as support for new video codecs and 3D video. Technical presentations will be available this Wednesday for folks in Sin City. Everyone else? Check out the Alliance's official press release after the break.
