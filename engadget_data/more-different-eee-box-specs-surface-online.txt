 We've already heard about some supposed specs for ASUS's forthcoming Eee Box desktop PC, but Trusted Reviews has now turned up some slightly different ones, which it claims come from a "very reliable" source. While that source apparently couldn't confirm that the desk-bound Eee would in fact be an Atom-based box as many are speculating, the source reportedly did flat out say that the system would be launching with 2GB of RAM as standard, and a 160GB hard drive (not 1GB and 80GB as we had previously heard). It'll also supposedly be running the same Linux distribution as the Eee PC, and be available in white only to start with. What's more, it seems that this particular source's information should be able to be verified one way or another soon enough, as he/she is also saying that ASUS will get official about the Eee Box on June 3rd at Computex in Taiwan, with an actual release set to follow sometime in the third quarter, in the UK at least.[Thanks, Argie]
