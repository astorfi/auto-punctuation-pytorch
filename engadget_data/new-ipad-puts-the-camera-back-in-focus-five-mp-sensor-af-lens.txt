  Tired of taking average shots with that 1280x720 non-AF camera module in your iPad 2? Well rejoice! The new iPad packs a five megapixel backside-illuminated sensor, five-element f/2.4 autofocus lens with IR filter and captures video at 1080p -- slightly better specs than the iPhone 4. Apple's built the ISP (Image Signal Processor) right into the new A5X chip, enabling features like face detection and image stabilization -- just like the iPhone 4S. We're expecting some pretty impressive performance from the iSight -- as it's now called -- so stay tuned for our hands-on later today.Update: Check out Apple's sample pictures in the gallery below.
