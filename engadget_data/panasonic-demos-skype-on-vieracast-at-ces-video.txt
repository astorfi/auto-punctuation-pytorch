Unlike what Skype previously told us, the webcams involved were only capturing average-quality VGA video at 22fps instead of 720p, and they'll cost you a hefty $200 each if you happen to be a lucky owner of a VIERA Cast TV. Let's hope those four built-in mics (to increase gain for the distant couch) are worth it. Video after the break.
