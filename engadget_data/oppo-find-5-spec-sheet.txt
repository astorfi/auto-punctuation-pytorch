 Quad-core APQ8064 chip: check. 5-inch 1080p display: check. That's right, it's the Oppo Find 5 again, but this time we're seeing the phone's full spec sheet courtesy of the manufacturer's overly simple US website -- we've already verified this with our contacts. Apart from the fact that Oppo will be selling the much anticipated Find 5 in the US, the product page also lists an unsubsidized price of just $499, which isn't bad when you look at the $600 HTC Droid DNA off contract. The specs also mention Android 4.1.2, a 2,500mAh battery, NFC, 16GB of built-in storage and 2GB of RAM, as well as compatibility with T-Mobile and AT&T's 3G networks. Now all we need are some pictures, but we'll even get to touch it at the Beijing launch event next Wednesday.
