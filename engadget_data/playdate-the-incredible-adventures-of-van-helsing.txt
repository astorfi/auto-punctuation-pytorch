       Creatures that go bump in the night, beware: Van Helsing lives. But just how "incredible" are the monster hunter's adventures, especially if he isn't played by Hugh Jackman? Find out with Sean Buckley and myself as we trudge through The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, which is part of Xbox One's free Games With Gold promo for December. As always, you can catch us starting at 6 PM Eastern / 3 PM Pacific as we stream for two hours on Twitch. Either tune in on this very post, the Engadget Gaming homepage, or, if you want to chat along with us, Twitch.tv/Joystiq. How weird will horror in December be? There's only one way to find out.
