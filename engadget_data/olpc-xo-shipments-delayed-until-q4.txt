 You'll have to take this with the usual hefty grain of salt, but according to China's Commercial Times, OLPC manufacturer Quanta has been forced to push back its target ship date for the XO from July to sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. Leading to this speculation is the fact that Quanta has apparently yet to release its orders for various parts and components set for inclusion in the laptop, which would seem to indicate that a July ship date would be tough to meet. It would also, of course, seem to make the promised ten million laptops before year's end a bit unlikely.[Thanks, Eric]
