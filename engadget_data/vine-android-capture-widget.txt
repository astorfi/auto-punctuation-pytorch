A new of version of Vine for Android brings the app up to par with its iOS sibling, which received bug fixes and new tools earlier this July. In addition to new channels, Vine 1.3.1 gives you a hand in making better six-second clips by introducing the focus, grid and ghost (shows your previous shots) camera tools. You can now also revine -- the company's word for repost, Ã  la retweet -- friends' posts from within the app and mute all the short but rackety videos through a new button in the menu. The most notable entry on the changelog, however, is the Capture widget designed to launch recording mode right from your home screen. It's exclusive to Android at the moment, but who knows what surprises Vine may have when it launches on WP8.
