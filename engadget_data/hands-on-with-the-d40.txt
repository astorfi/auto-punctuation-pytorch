It's light, it's fast, and it's a lot of fun to fool around with for amateurs photographers like us (and we do mean amateur). Click on for a ton of unboxing shots and to see how the D40 looks in the buff alongside an older sibling.
      

 

What, the side of the box is just as interesting!It comes with a battery, charger, power cable (for the charger), USB cable, and strap.So close.There she is.Hello, beautiful.This obviously doesn't show a lot of scale, but wow is this thing small for a DSLR.Now for the comparisons to the completely moderately sized D70s. Keep in mind, the D70s is by no means a large DSLR.Sorry, son, those old batteries won't work anymore.Notice: no camera info LCD. All that's emulated in the actual main display now.SD slot, we're so over CF.With that bundled 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor lens.Let's turn 'er on.Look familiar?Nice, up to 1600 ISO.Love those RAW options.The full LCD even emulates the old school LCD it's missing.
