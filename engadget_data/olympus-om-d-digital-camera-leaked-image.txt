   Some would say that "one picture is worth a thousand words," but all we're visualizing here are a few camera-driven buttons and a small portion of Olympus branding. Though, 43 Rumors is claiming that this is indeed the soon-to-be new addition to the OM series, which is expected to get unveiled next month. Olympus is no rookie in the Micro Four Thirds game, so it shouldn't come as a surprise for the rumored specs to be a decent upgrade in comparison to its PEN shooters. Allegedly, the rig may sport a magnesium chassis, 16 megapixel sensor with HDR optimization, up to 25600 ISO and a 3-inch OLED swivel display (because Olympus knows you love gadgets with rotating screens), amongst other features. Tickle your fancy? Well, best start saving now, as word on the web is that it'll set you back a cool $1,100 when it's revealed.
