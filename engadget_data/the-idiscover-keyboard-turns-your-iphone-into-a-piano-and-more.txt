Sure, there are nifty apps that allow you to simulate a keyboard on your iPhone, but Ion Audio has gone ahead and created a physical one to match the newly announced iType. The iDiscover keyboard, along with the companion iDiscover Keyboard app, has 25 keys and effectively turns your iPhone into a music studio complete with synth-action keys, and pitch and modulation wheels. Better yet, it doubles as a controller for MIDI software on either Mac or PC.
