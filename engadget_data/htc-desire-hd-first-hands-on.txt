Yes, having played extensively with the EVO 4G over the last few months, we can definitely say that the Desire HD is an authentic recreation of the American blockbuster, though it lacks the kickstand around back -- likely in an effort to reduce thickness, we suppose. In fact, HTC has eliminated the battery cover entirely, replacing it with a Legend-style slot (side-mounted this time) -- take a look at a shot of it both open and closed after the break. The phones HTC had on display here felt extremely smooth and snappy... though, as we all know, Android tends to bog down a bit over time, so the proof will be in the pudding after these things have been in customers' hands for a month or two.
