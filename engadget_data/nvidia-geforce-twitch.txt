NVIDIA's GeForce Experience software is getting an update by the end of the year that'll add Twitch streaming directly from the application. The company says that Shadowplay, its DVR-esque service that automatically captures the last 20 minutes of gameplay video, will arrive on October 28th in beta. A live demo was shown of Ubisoft's Splinter Cell: Blacklist, streamed directly out and shown running natively on via GeForce Experience on a desktop. It looks like we're getting demos of all of today's NVIDIA announcements in the coming hours, so stay tuned!
