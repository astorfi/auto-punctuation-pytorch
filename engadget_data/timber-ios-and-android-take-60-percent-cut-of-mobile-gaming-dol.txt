Well, peer through the cloud of leaves and sawdust and you'll see that the job is done: the two newcomers will generate $500 million more than DS and PSP titles this year, according to stats from Flurry. Click past the break to see the trend since 2009 crystallized into a cold, hard pie chart.

On the other hand, there's a bit of good news for everybody: the overall American mobile gaming market is growing at a rapid pace -- this year's total revenue of $3.3 billion represents a 25 percent increase on 2010, so new devices like the PlayStation Vita and the Transformer Prime should find plenty of room to take seed.
