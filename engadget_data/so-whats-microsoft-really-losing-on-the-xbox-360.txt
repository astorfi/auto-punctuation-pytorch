We don't really know for sure — we haven't had a chance to sift through all of J. Allard's emails to Bill yet — but
iSuppli estimates that a Premium Xbox 360 sets
Microsoft back $470 (-$71), not including the packaging, power supply, cables, and accessories estimated at $55 (-$126)
or the somewhat more inestimable costs of research & development, marketing, cost of business, etc. (-$???) The
moral of the story? Be a sweetheart and buy loads of games for your 360 or you'll make Microsoft cry and there won't be
an Xbox 720, mkay?
