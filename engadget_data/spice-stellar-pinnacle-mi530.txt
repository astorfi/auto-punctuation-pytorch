 The large phone juggernaut rolls on with word on yet another contender raising its head in India, this time from the Spice stable. While the headline-grabbing 5-megapixel front camera may not be a world first, the Stellar Pinnacle Mi-530 rocks some decent specs for its Rs 13,999 ($260) asking price. The 5.3-inch qHD (960 x 540) IPS display hides a 1.2GHz dual-core chip, 1GB of RAM, 16GB storage, a microSD slot, dual-SIM support and an 8-megapixel rear snapper, all powered by a beefy 2,550mAh battery. We'd have preferred a more recent version of Mountain View's mobile OS instead of the Android 4.0 that the smartphone ships with, but it does attempt to spice up the offering with a bunch of software tricks, including Popup Play and Direct Call. Hardly ground-breaking, but hey, at least self-portrait addicts can indulge themselves without their hands tied.
