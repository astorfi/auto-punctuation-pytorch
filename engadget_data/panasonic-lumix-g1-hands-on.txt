The build quality shows that Panasonic isn't kidding around here: the camera is a hefty and solid, with a decent shutter click and no-nonsense manual controls. The 3-inch LCD also doesn't disappoint, though the digital viewfinder is a tad disorienting, and precise focusing could be an issue. Yes, we fully recognize the irony of taking crummy photographs of a camera, but work with us here.
