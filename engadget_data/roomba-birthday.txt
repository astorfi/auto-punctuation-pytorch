Understandably, iRobot's looking back over the period, revealing that since then, it's sold over six million of the units -- with each one covering an average of 705 miles in its lifetime. Along the way, that army of Wall-Es-in-the-making have consumed around two million pounds of dirt, including the odd Lego brick, pet snake and wedding bands -- although, as the videos below demonstrate, it's normally quite friendly to children and animals.
