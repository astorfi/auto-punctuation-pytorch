The execs -- Samsung VP Kim Hun-soo,Microsoft Korea president Yoo Jae-sung, and Intel Korea prez Lee Hee-sung -- were gathered for what is being describedas a "Steve Jobs-like" product demonstration gone horribly awry, with support staff forced to uncomfortablyascend the stage several times to help out their equally-uncomfortable bosses. Among the various mishaps were a batterythat went dead after only a few minutes, an apparent inability to call up the on-screen keyboard for advancing aPowerPoint presentation, and another presentation that went into rapid slideshow mode on its own. While having onedevice fail in a demo happens all the time, seeing multiple units go down and/or befuddle the very people who makethese things causes us to stop and rethink our commitment to the UMPC lifestyle that looked so fun and carefree in theteasercampaign.[Thanks, Guillermo]
