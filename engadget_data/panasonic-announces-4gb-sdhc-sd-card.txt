 We're not sure why they keepworking on ancient memory card formats like SecureDigital (if it's not thumbnail-sized or smaller, we're notinterested), but advances in this venerable format continue unabated, with cards now trickling out that support the newSDHC (for SD HighCapacity), or SD 2.0, standard. Panasonic has just announced a 2.0-compliant 4GB model that appears to fall under theclass 2 category of the new format's rating system (out of 2, 4, and 6), which refers to the card's minimum transferspeed in MBps. SDHC cards, which are only compatible with FAT32-compliant current-gen readers, promise capacities ashigh as 32GB, while offering the DRM-friendly security features that content producers love to frustrate us with.Panny's first entrant into the SDHC game will be available worldwide this summer.
