The first question from the audience, however, revolved around the rumored tablet version of the service. Spotify founder Daniel Ek acknowledged that it is indeed "in the works," otherwise evading the question, insisting that the event was all about the Coke partnership, to the relief of the two beverage reps who joined him on stage.
