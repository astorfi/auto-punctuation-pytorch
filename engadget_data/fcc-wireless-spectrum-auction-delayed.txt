The lead-up to the government's wireless spectrum auction is going to be a little longer than expected, according to the Official FCC Blog. Partly because the government needs to finalize the event's rules and bidding structure. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler writes that he wants to make certain that the event's infrastructure is up to the challenge, too.


"For the incentive auction to be a success, we must also ensure that the operating systems and software to run it work from the moment the first bid is placed, until the final broadcast station is relocated," Wheeler writes. "Only when our software and systems are technically ready, user friendly, and thoroughly tested, will we start the auction." This nebulous answer puts the final auction in the middle of 2015. If you were planning on accessing that sweet wireless bandwidth, you'll have to wait until then.
