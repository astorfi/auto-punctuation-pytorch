Hot on the heels of the charmingly obtuse T-Mobile Vibrant ("A Twitter approaches to synchronising data to allow access to your status"), Sammy's new Galaxy Tab promo site is a virtual treasure trove of almost-but-not-quite English, starting with a launch animation that offers you "More relief on the go" straight through to a video call demo that suggests you and a co-worker share a "cosy time." Uh, no thanks. Greatest hits in the gallery below.
