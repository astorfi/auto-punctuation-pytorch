  The device that started as a $10 laptop, graduated to a $35 tablet and settled on a $60 reality is about to get its first successor: the Aakash 2. Like its predecessor, the new Aakash is twist on a DataWind Ubislate, namely the Ubislate 7+. According to TechSnapr, $40 (or 2,000 Rupees) buys a 7-inch capacitive touchscreen, a 3200 mAh battery and a 700MHz ARM Cortex-A8 processor -- nearly doubling the oomph of the original. Datawind, however, pegs the Ubislate 7+ at familiar 2,999 Rupees (about $60), noting that the unbranded hardware runs Android 2.3 and features WiFi and GPRS connectivity. Students in India should be able to pick up the budget-friendly slab sometime in April, just like Kapil Sibal promised last month.[Thanks, Pravesh]
