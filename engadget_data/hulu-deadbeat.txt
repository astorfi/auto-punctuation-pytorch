It's not the first original series to hit the streaming site, but Lionsgate is delivering some seasoned vets for its upcoming Hulu show, Deadbeat. Co-created by Cody Heller and Brett Konner of FX's talking dog show, Wilfred, the "supernatural comedy" series will be produced by Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment and directed / executive produced by Flight of the Conchords / Arrested Development's Troy Miller. The first ten episodes are set to begin production in the fall and will begin airing next year.
