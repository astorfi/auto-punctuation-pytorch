The Webtop-enabled device just waltzed through the FCC complete with imagery, and not just in crude drawings: we're talking outside and inside shots here. Originally shown off at Motorola's Droid RAZR reveal, the latest addition to the laptop dock family comes with the most features of them all -- it's laden with a sizable 14-inch display, ethernet and VGA sockets, SD card slot, 3.5mm headphone jack, front-facing camera and 6-row keyboard. Sounds great, but how's the Webtop on it? Guess we're going to find out sooner rather than later. Browse the gallery below to get your visual fix.
