 According to a study by ananalyst at financial firm Sanford Bernstein, both Wal-Mart and Costco are "looking ... closely" at biometriccheckout systems, which would allow consumers to pay via finger-scan (neither company would comment on the report). Touse the system, customers would register at an in-store kiosk, where they would provide credit-card information thatwould be attached to a fingerprint. At checkout, the customer would place their finger on a scanner, and theappropriate credit info would be pulled up. According to the study, biometric checkouts -- which are already in use inbranches of some supermarket chains, including Albertson's and Piggly Wiggly --could save Wal-Mart as much as 20% in processing costs. Of course, privacy advocates are likely to balk at providingmajor retailers with fingerprints, but we sort of assume that, as big as it is, Wal-Mart's already got the ability tocollect any data that they want, and withholding our prints isn't going to change that.
