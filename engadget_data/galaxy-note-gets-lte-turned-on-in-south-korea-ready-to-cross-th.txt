It's also enticed us with the inclusion of an LTE radio on spec sheets, and now Sammy has flipped the switch on that high speed capability, giving us another reason to drool over the jumbo handset. According to a Google translated press release, the Note is destined to ride waves of domestic LTE, though we certainly hope it'll bring such capabilities to the US. Speaking of, some shots have surfaced of a suspiciously Note-like device sans a tactile home button, favoring four Android capacitive buttons instead. Could Sammy be taking a page out of its Galaxy S II playbook and applying it to the stylus-packing superphone? We can't say for sure, but there's more at the source so you can draw your own conclusions.
