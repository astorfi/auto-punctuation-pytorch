If you'd rather control your iPod's speaker system without actually squinting from 20 feet away trying to read that cluttered playlist from afar, Zicplay's oddly-titled EWOO can probably help. Similar in nature (and design) to Keyspan's TuneView and Alive Style's Popalive, this presumably Bluetooth-enabled remote comes with its own proprietary docking station that holds your iPod and transmits the menus directly to your EWOO remote. The dock outputs out via optical digital or analog stereo, and channels video via S-Video, while the remote weighs in at 60 grams and sports a battery life of "about 10 days." So if you're not a proud owner already of one of the two aforementioned alternatives, you can pick this flavor up for $129 next month.[Via MobileWhack]
