Yes, the same sort that delivers agonizingly slow refreshes on the latest Kindles and such. It's a simple H.264-encoded clip (the same one with the chubby rabbit you've probably seen a dozen times before) played on a TI OMAP3621 processor. Power consumption in this mode is said to be no more than a non-backlit LCD, which is quite frugal indeed. No word on which actual readers this will debuting in, but according to E-Ink-Info.com it will be "available on the next-gen e-readers to appear soon." Check out the demo embedded below.
