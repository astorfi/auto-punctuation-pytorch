According to a recent blog posting on the site, Blu-ray is dubbed "the remaining high-definition disc format," and it also noted that consumers that have "been waiting to jump into high-def have a clear path to follow." According to Peter Faricy, vice president of movies and music at Amazon, the firm is now "recommending Blu-ray as the preferred digital format," and it fully expects to update its High-Def 101 page accordingly over the next few days.[Via Blu-ray, thanks to everyone who sent this in]
