A joint venture between Canon and Toshiba called SED Inc. has unveiled an
SED
(Surface-conduction Electron-emitter Display) panel with a 100,000:1 contrast ratio which is,
well, pretty damn impressive (feel lucky if your current LCD rocks 1000:1). The company's first SED panel, by
comparison, had a contrast ratio of just 8,600:1. Apparently, the key to such a large
jump in contrast ratio was a broad reduction in black luminance, from 0.04 cd/m2
to 0.003 cd/m2, which they achieved by improving the
electron-emitting source property. Or, in plain english, blacks look blacker, which is always a good thing. No word yet
on when you'll be able empty your bank account and hang one of these things on your wall.
