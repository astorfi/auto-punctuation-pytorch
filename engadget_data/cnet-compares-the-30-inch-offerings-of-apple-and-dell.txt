Hateto spoil it for you, but Apple's offering does win by a slim margin, due to its more accurate and vivid color, alongwith its better grayscale differentiation. But the $300 cheaper 3007WFP held its own, with more input options andbetter text performance. We guess it all comes down to whether you're going to be scanning Excel spreadsheets orscanning for headshots, but it looks like both displays have plenty to offer.
