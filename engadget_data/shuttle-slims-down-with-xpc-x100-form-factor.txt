The 2.13-inch tall WMCE unit holds a 1.83GHz Core Duo processor, 512MB of RAM, ATIMobility Radeon X1600 graphics which are upgradeable via MXM, 250GB SATA II HDD, digital audio, 802.11a/b/g WiFi, amemory card reader, DVI, and TV out. Shuttle hasn't quite pinned everything down, so we don't know the price yet, andthose specs could change, but we'll know more soon since they're displaying the X100 at CeBIT next month.
