 This is it folks. The first commercial application of an amazing system. We all want our HDTVs to do more, like read RSS feeds, get weather and sports info and heck, even traffic conditions would be nice. The ACAP can do that and Samsung has converted one of their newer plasmas to work with the system.Â  The system utilizes Java apps and an Internet connected HDTV to produce what you are seeing in the Samsung demo. There really isn't much more info about this model yet but you can bet your HDTV that this type of system is the next big step in high definition televisions.
