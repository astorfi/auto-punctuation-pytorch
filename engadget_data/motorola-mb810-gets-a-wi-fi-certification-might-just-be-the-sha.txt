Just as the weekend was getting kicked off in earnest, a new Moto handset managed to get its own stamp of approval from the fine folks at the Wi-Fi Alliance, and pictures of something that might be the Shadow appeared on laptopmemo. The MB810 is said to be equipped with both 802.11b/g/n as well as a cellular data connection, though it's impossible to tell from the paperwork whether it'll be outed in GSM or CDMA form. The leaked handset at laptopmemo is said to have a 4.3-inch capacitive touchscreen, an eight megapixel camera with HD video capability, and a slider QWERTY keyboard. Are they the same handset, and is any of this real? We should know whether or not this guy has slipped through the cracks under another moniker in due time, but if you're anything like us, "due time" won't ever come soon enough.
