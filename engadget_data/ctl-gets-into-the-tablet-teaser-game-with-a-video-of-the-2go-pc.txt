Unlike some others CTL's done its teaser video of its 2go PC Slate just right by revealing most of the vitals including the full specs and availability. In case you don't feel like hitting the read more link to watch the short clip, here's the Cliff Notes version: The 10-inch capacitive touchscreen slate is powered by a 1.6GHz Atom N450 processor, 1GB of RAM, and has two USBs and a 2-megapixel webcam. That's right, a netbook with its keyboard chopped off. The software overlay that you see in the blurry picture above is actually Intel's Blue Dolphin interface for the Classmate PC, so perhaps the company is planning to use that to skin the underlying Windows 7 Home Premium OS. It should all be ready by early June for that popular $499 tablet price, but in the meantime CTL, we wouldn't object to you giving HP a call and teaching them how to make a teaser vid!
