But slapping that pup into the Q1 UMPC for any reason other than the rights to another "World's First [insert product category]" placard to prop-up at trade-shows is just, well, overkill. Yeah, the Q1-SSD's instant-on media feature should now be faster (not exactly instantÂ  judging by reviews) but is that really worth the bump from an already expensive $1200 US green equiv in Korea to $2,430 -- nearly five times the target price for this market segment!? Still, these high-capacity flash drives with lower power consumption, better shock protection, and faster data access are indeed the future of ultra-portable computing. Golf-claps all around Sammy, for this glimpse into the future.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
