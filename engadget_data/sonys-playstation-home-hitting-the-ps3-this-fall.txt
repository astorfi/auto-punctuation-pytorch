 The rumors were swirling, but the New York Times just confirmed that Phil Harrison is expected to announce the new PlayStation Home service at his GDC keynote, which takes place in San Francisco in a couple of hours. The service is supposed to take elements from Xbox Live and Nintendo's Mii avatars, along with tossing in virtual prizes -- a more tangible version of XBL's achievements -- to wag in the face of fellow fanboys. Phil Harrison also wants gamers to take part in YouTube and Flickr-esque content creation, but how that will tie directly to the PlayStation Home service is unclear at this point. What is clear is that Sony is in dire need of an answer to Xbox Live, which just hit the 6 million mark for subscribers, so we hope Phil has more than just avatars and prizes to show off when he gets on stage at 10:30 PST.[Via Joystiq]
