 Nokia just took the wraps off their Ovi (which means "the door" in Finnish) Internet services brand. The idea is to pull the Nokia Music Store, N-Gage, Nokia Maps, and all future Nokia services into a single suite of service offerings. Over the next 12 months, Nokia announced that it would "integrate new user interface elements, service suites and web communities" into what they promise will be an "open environment." Expect to hear more from Ovi when it launches in Q4.
