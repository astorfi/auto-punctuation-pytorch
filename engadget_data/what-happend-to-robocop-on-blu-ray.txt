 Blu-ray fans were expecting to have one of the best weeks yet, only to have half of the titles removed. First there was Robocop which seems like it may have been a blessing in disguised according to some pre-released reviews. Officially it seems that this was the first Blu-ray title to get pushed back because MGM is getting help from Fox with distribution instead of Sony. This combined with 3 other titles that were delayed including Black Hawk Down and Sense & Sensibility. The Big Hit is the only delayed title with a new date of Sept 19th 2006. We have no idea what is going on here, but at this rate there is no way Blu-ray will take the content lead from HD DVD. Robocop delayedOther Blu-ray delays
