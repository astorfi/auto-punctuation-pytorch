       Even though Toshiba's SED technology will be a no show at CES this year, Proton let us know that its LED backlit LCDs will be on display. The last time we saw these HDTVs (the 42-inch 1080p P42L1 and 32-inch 720p P32L1) at Computex they were expected to hit this year but now are slated for a second quarter 2007 release. In case you've forgotten during the long wait for this technology to reach reasonable prices, LED backlighting (like SED) promises more accurate color reproduction than current CCFL-based LCDs. We'll have to wait until next year to see which one actually delivers.
