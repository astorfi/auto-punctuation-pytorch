 While Paramount isn't bringing that many titles to the HD DVD party this year, one of its biggest summer movies is making the trip. Mission: Impossible III was announced for the format at yesterday's DVD Forum meeting, with date and other specifics yet undetermined Paramount did state all the extras were filmed in HD -- a welcome change from the 480i SD extras that have largely accompanied releases so far -- and that it will take advantage of HD DVD's picture-in-picture feature to show video commentary from the director as the movie continues to play. Also mentioned was The Look and Sound of Perfect marketing campaign, set to roll out online ads this week, a bus tour leaving Denver in mid-September, and television spots to follow in the fourth quarter. We're still hoping for a day-and-date release with the DVD version but that remains to be seen.
