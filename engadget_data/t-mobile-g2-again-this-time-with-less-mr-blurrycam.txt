Looks like this bad boy slides and tilts, which eliminates the need for a kickstand and is very likely causing you to breathe an audible sigh of relief right about now. Meanwhile, the backside reveals that HTC looks ready to really get into this asymmetrical design concept -- something we've definitely seen on the Schubert / Mozart -- and realistically, it's probably going to polarize some buyers. Check out the gallery for a few more shots!

Update: We hate to be the bearer of bad news, but we've just been told that the G2 doesn't have a tilting screen, despite what you see up there -- it's just the inner workings of the slide being pulled up. Our hearts have been ripped from our chests on this one, rest assured.
