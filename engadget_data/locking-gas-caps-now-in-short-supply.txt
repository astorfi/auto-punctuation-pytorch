The word from Pittsburgh is that auto parts suppliers are rapidly selling out of locking gas caps, which were
originally invented in the 30s because of gas thefts during the Great Depression. Buyers are reporting their gas tanks
have been siphoned, or that they want to head off potential siphoning due to ever-rising gas prices. Some stores are
having difficulty getting more units in stock from manufacturers. If ever there were a time to kick yourself over
having gone with that SUV, this looks like it.
