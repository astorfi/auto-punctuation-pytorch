 Well, it took a while, but Google has finally launched the Nexus 7 in Japan. The tablet made its state-side debut in July, but it took almost three months for it to cross the Pacific and land in the east Asian nation. Pricing is a little higher than what we've seen everywhere else, with the 16GB model selling for Â¥19,800, or about $255. It makes a perfect companion for the recently updated Play Books app that also just made its debut in the Land of the Rising Sun.

 Update: Price updated to reflect current USD conversion.
