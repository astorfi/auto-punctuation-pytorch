That can't be said about Dell's display business however, which has consistently provided sleek monitors offering some of the best bang for the buck in the business. Dell's newest 20-incher is already out in Hong Kong where we expect it will soon begin its journey west. This entry-level monitor speaks the new design language of Dell's XPS and Studio rigs and comes packing HDMI and VGA inputs with specs that include a 1600 x 900 (that's a 16:9 aspect) pixel resolution, 5 millisecond response, 1000:1 contrast and 250 nits of brightness with a 160-degree viewing angle. Not great, but decent specs for the HK$1,098 (tax inclusive) price which we expect to be about $120 - 130 by the time model ST2010 lands Stateside. [Thanks, John]
