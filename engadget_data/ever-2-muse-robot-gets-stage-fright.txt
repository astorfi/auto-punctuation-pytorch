 Ok, listen up folks, we have some very sad news to announce from South Korea: the legendary Ever-2 Muse robot cancelled her appearance at the RoboWorld 2006 in Seoul. All we know is that this singing humanoid suffered some version of electronic stage fright and was unable to perform as planned, leaving legions of shocked and angered Korean fanboys to start chucking kim chee at the stage (ok, we made that last part up). We have no further details at this point, but if you were there or if your Korean skills are better than ours, then please do drop us a line. Until we find out exactly happened, we're going to recommend that the Ever-2 Muse probably get some pointers from that Japanese stagebot we spied a few days ago to avoid similar disasters in the future.
