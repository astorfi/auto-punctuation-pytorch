The idea is to make it easier to see events, pics and posts from your past by placing a, surprise surprise, timeline on the right edge of your profile page that breaks down your content by year and month. It's a much more visual experience than Facebook's previous incarnation, and Timeline Views allow you to filter the content by photos, locations (courtesy of Bing maps integration) and much more. You can also add apps, "likes", and all of your other content in neatly organized panes on your profile page to let you "tell the story of your life" in the way you want to -- including the ability to go back and add stuff to your timeline after the fact, no flux capacitor required. Timeline's going live in beta immediately for some, and a broader roll-out will be happening over the next few weeks. Get ready people, Facebook's future is here.

Update: Facebook's Timeline promo vid is now embedded after the break.
