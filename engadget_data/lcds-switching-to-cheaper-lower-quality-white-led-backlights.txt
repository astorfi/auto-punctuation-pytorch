 In the year 2009....LED-backlit LCDs will probably be increasingly common, and why not? Everyone wants a flat panel with questionably-measured contrast ratios full of so many zeroes they run off the spec sheet. but in order to bring the tech to the masses, Digitimes reports manufacturers may switch from current red/green/blue LEDs to white LEDs.They claim white LEDs meet the mark in terms of power savings, but won't measure up when it comes to accurate color reproduction. Specifically mentioned? Sharp, LG, AUO and "others" (Samsung has already jumped on the bandwagon) so when you meet a guy selling cheap LED HDTVs from the of a van, add one more thing to check while making sure you aren't purchasing an oven door.
