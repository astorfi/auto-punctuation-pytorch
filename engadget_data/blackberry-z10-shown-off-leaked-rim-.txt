 Curious as to what RIM's upcoming L-series BlackBerry smartphone might look like? Well, UnwiredView's obtained what appears to be marketing material for that handset -- allegedly dubbed the Z10 -- showing off its front face in both black and white versions. From the leak we can see a few already confirmed aspects of the new BB 10 platform, such as its seamless app switching, notification peeking and what looks to be a contact profile running on the candy bar-shaped touchscreen device. Apart from those known bits, there's not much else new to glean, but thankfully the lead up to the final reveal is now just a little more than a month away.
