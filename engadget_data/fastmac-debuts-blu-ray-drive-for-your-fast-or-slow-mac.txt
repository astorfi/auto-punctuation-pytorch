All four of you might dig FastMac's new Blu-ray Drive upgrade, which can fit in a wide range of Macs, including the 17-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini and Intel iMac. Apparently no love for the MacBook or 15-inch MBP, but the iBook G4 can handle it -- though it's hard to fathom stuffing one of these drives inside that oh-so-consumery laptop. The drive is rated at 8x DVDÂ±RW and 1x BD-RW. You can write to 50GB dual-layer discs, and boot to the drive with OS X. FastMac calls the drive "Plug & Play," but the "plugging" end of that equation is going to take some adventurous exploits inside your Mac, by you, your hacker nephew or a trained computer repair guy. If you think you can stomach it, the drive is available now.[Via MacMinute]
