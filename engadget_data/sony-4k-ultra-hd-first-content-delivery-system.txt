 If there's $25,000 or so burning a hole in your pocket and room in your living room for Sony's 84-inch XBR-84X900 Ultra HDTV, but you're worried about a lack of 4K res content to play on it, allow us to put your mind at ease. Sony's Ray Hartjen has picked up the blogging pen and revealed each of the supersized sets will ship with "the world's first 4K Ultra HD delivery solution, complete with pre-loaded, native 4K entertainment." There's no specifics on what the pack-in content will be (or what form the "delivery system" will take), but he says it will include full length feature Hollywood productions exclusive to purchasers, probably courtesy of Sony Pictures. We're told to expect more details after Turkey day, so stay tuned.
