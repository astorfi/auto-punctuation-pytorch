Google revealed many things about Android 4.4 KitKat on the software's launch day, but it glossed over one of the sweetest treats for shutterbugs: a much more advanced photo editor. As the company's Nicolas Roard demonstrates, creatives can now apply effects, filters and adjustments at very precise levels, down to specific color channels and regions. Mobile artists can create presets, and every change is non-destructive -- it takes just a a couple of taps to revert to the original image. The new tool is built into KitKat's Gallery app, so just about any Android device that uses the standard photo browsing interface will reap the rewards.
