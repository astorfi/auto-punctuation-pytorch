For the 10-episode run he's playing an assassin in each of these 5- to 7-minute episodes and while Chloe, Morris and the gang aren't anywhere to be found, it's close enough to be the Jack Bauer bump we've been missing all these long months. We're not sure any of these original series will potentially fill holes left if content providers pull their movies and shows from either service, but it can't hurt. The video's embedded above, and available in HD via Hulu Plus, Chapters 4 and 5 are due to arrive next week.
