Like the DN7000, the DN8000 loves on the Intel Core Duo family of processors offering the 2.16GHz T2600 in that 8.2-pound slab. The DN8k maxes out with a 17-inch, 1440 x 900 pixel capable LCD, 2GB RAM, 120GB disk, WiFi, dual-layer DVD burner, slots for ExpressCard/54 and External SATA, four speakers, and suite of interfaces for Firewire, USB, S/PDIF and memory cards. Sound good so far right? But are you sure you want to bet your budget on a laptop sportin' Intel's 945GM integrated graphics with Vista's memory hungry UI on deck? Yeah, thought not. Prices start right around Â¥119,800 (or about $1,035) for a lot less oomph than listed above. [Via Impress]
