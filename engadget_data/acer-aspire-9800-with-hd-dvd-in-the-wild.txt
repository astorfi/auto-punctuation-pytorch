Now right on schedule, the 9800 has appeared at Computex going extra-large with that 20.1-inch, 1680x1050 widescreen display, Intel Core Duo, NVIDIA GeForce Go 7600 graphics, integrated 1.2 megapixel webcam, up to 240GB SATA disk, and plenty of high-end audio capabilities (for a lappy) to make this a true, semi-portable multimedia powerhouse. Still no price or availability but it's good to see her in the fo'realz anyway. Now, if we could just hunt down their rumored Blu-ray laptop we'll be all set.
