The prototype device is said to be coming later this year, and it's running Windows -- Ballmer showed it running the PC Kindle app. It's also multitouch, and can do some gaming -- they showed it playing Frogger. Check one more pic and the teaser vid after the break. And trust us -- we're going to find out everything about this thing before we're done.
