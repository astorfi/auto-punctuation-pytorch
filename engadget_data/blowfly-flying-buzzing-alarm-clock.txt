Using pretty much the same concept as the hanging alarm
clock that we brought you a while back, the "blowfly" concept clock forces users to get out of bed in order to
disable the alarm. Unlike the hanging model though, which raises itself a little higher each time you hit snooze, the
blowfly is actually a mini-copter that flies around the room emitting what is supposedly an annoying, mosquito-like
buzzing. Artist/designer Ena Macana won third place for the project at this year's Taiwan International Design
Competition, although unfortunately there are no indications that it will become commercially available. And remember,
those of you who can't get out of bed no matter what can look into that
inflatable pillow that breaks your spine if you don't
wake upâ€”some people need a little extra motivation.
