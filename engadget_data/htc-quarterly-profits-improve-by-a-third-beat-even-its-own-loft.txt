Reporting a very solid 33 percent improvement in profits year-on-year -- $268 million versus $202 million 12 months ago -- the company points to strong sales (no doubt catalyzed by Android's growing popularity) as the chief culprit for its newly increased tax bill. Guess that shows that having a wide catalog of high-end devices doesn't preclude raking in the cash, provided they're all desirable enough to garner mind and market share.
