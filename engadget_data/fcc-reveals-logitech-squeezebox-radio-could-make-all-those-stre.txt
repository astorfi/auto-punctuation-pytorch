Decently solid reviews, too, for the models we've seen thus-far, and thanks to our old friends at the FCC we know that a new model is coming soon. Dubbed the Squeezebox Radio X-R0001, it's described as "a compact tabletop network music player and internet radio that lets you listen to virtually any internet radio station." How it'll handle the variety of streaming formats and functions remains to be seen, but it'll also go fetch your local music collection over an internal network and play it all through its combination of 3/4-inch tweeters and 3-inch woofer. A 2.4-inch LCD is on the front, 802.11b/g WiFi and wired Ethernet are standard features, and it's all enclosed in a "compact design." That's all we know at this point (assuming you don't care that it has a 11.11dBm rating at 2.412MHz when in 802.11g mode), but hopefully Logi will set this one free from the Faraday cage soon.
