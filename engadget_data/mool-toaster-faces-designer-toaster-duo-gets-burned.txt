Just like its counterparts, the Mool has a complete disregard for safety, particularly from the exploratory fingers of little children, but it also manages a heating-inefficient design, bigger-than-a-toaster footprint, and a so-so color scheme. You're supposed to load up the removable rack with your bread stuffs, but we're not sure if it even pops out automatically, or if you'll need to risk life and limb to remove the rack. Does Atil seriously expect us to commit our imaginary sliced breads to his actual award winning conceptual toaster? Puhlease.[Via SCI FI Tech]
