The new line-up ranges in size from 42- to 65-inches with each packing a 120Hz ASV LCD panel, 3x 1080p HDMI inputs, 1x DVI for that quick all-digital hook-up to your PC, and 2x Firewire for connecting your DV camera and one of Sharp's line-up of hi-def recorders including their new BD-HP1 Blu-ray recorder for on-the-quick dubbing. Just for kicks, Sharp also added their favorite new pet technology, IrSS (AKA, IrSimple) high-speed infrared for throwing up images from like-equipped cellphones and digital cameras. Of course, they also feature dual, integrated analog and digital tuners and 10/100Mbps Ethernet to access Japan's acTVila TV Internet service. The big, bad 65-inch LC-65RX1W (pictured above) mama of the bunch features a 450cd/m2 brightness, 3000:1 contrast ratio, 176-degree angle of visibility, while tipping the scales at 66kg (146-pounds) at just 9.6-cm (3.78-inches) thin. It's available March 10th in Japan for ¥1,000,000 or about $8,361. Expect the rest to hit no later than April with the 57-inch LC-57RX1W demanding ¥900,000 ($7,524), the 52-inch LC-52RX1W ¥650,000 ($5,434), the 46-inch LC-46RX1W ¥550,000 ($4,598), and the 42-inch LC-42RX1W ¥500,000 ($4,180).
