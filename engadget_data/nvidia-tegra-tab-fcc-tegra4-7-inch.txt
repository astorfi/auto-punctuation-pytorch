Thanks to another revealing pass through the FCC, we now know more about NVIDIA's upcoming P1640 mystery tablet, starting with a likely name: the Tegra TAB. An internal photo shows that it'll have a Tegra 4 variant we've not seen before, a mid-range 7-inch, 1,280 x 800 IPS display and a 3200 or 4100mAh battery. An included manual also reveals a stock-looking flavor of Android Jelly Bean, a front HD camera, 5-megapixel rear camera and, interestingly, a stylus -- along with apps for it. There's no other details, and we're still not sure if NVIDIA will be selling the device itself or through OEMs. Either way, it's clearly more than just a developer device like the Tegra 4i Phoenix, so we wouldn't be shocked to see it on the market soon.
