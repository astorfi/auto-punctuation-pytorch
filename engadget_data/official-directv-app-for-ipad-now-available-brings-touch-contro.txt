The features were pretty well detailed on the website preview, just like other tablet remote control apps it can provide remote scheduling for most DVR boxes, you'll need one of the Plus HD DVR models (HR20, HR21, HR22, HR23, HR24 and H21, H23, H24) for remote control functions. Early reviews seem positive except for the lack of video streaming to the tablet itself, check out the screens and other info from iTunes below or just click on through and try it out.

Update: ZatzNotFunny points out a detailed walkthrough of the new app put together by forum posters at DBSTalk, check it out at the link or embedded after the break.
