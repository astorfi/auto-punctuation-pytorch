Pocket-lint personally contacted Orange, Vodafone, Three and O2 (a company which carried the Pre, Pre Plus, Pixi and Pixi Plus) and all had essentially the same thing to say: there are no plans to carry the device at this time. This isn't great news for Palm lovers across the way, and it's certainly not making anyone at the newly merged HP / Palm happy. Of course, none of the statements save O2's are definitive, so we'll keep our eyes peeled for any changes. We can always hope.
