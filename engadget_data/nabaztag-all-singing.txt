 It's been a while since we heard from Nabaztag, the WiFi-enabledbunny wabbit, but according to ShinyShiny it looks like it'll be hopping to and spreading ambient information in the UKsoon enough, and with the ability to sing and talk, no less. Kind of takes the fun out of an glanceable-informationdevice, we know, but you understand as well as we that sometimes perky (or droopy) ears and multicolored lights aren'talways the most effective means at aggregating data. Say it loud n' proud, Nabaztag; sing your life.
