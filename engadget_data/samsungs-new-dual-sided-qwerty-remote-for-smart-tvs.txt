Judging by the ruler in the remarkably unflattering FCC photos, this one appears to be a bit larger and it's not immediately clear what that display on the QWERTY side is for. Obviously, if there's any chance users will be logging into their various Twitter or Comcast/Time Warner accounts on the TV they'll need something better than T9 to do it, but we'll have to wait to get our hands on this one to know if it's an improvement. Check the gallery for a few more pictures, we'd expect some kind of announcement on the RMC-QTD1 before Samsung's 2011 line of TVs hit stores.
