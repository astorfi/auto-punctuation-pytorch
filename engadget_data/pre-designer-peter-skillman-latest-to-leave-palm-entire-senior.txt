TechCrunch reports -- and independent sources confirm with us -- that Peter Skillman, the man with 11 years tenure and the reported designer of the Pre, has left HP / Palm. He joins... sorry, we need to catch our breath here... Michael Abbot, Mike Bell, Lynn Fox, Matias Duarte, Rich Dellinger, and Caitlin Spaan. That's all the Senior VPs (and almost all the VPs) now gone. We hope CEO Jon Rubinstein isn't feeling too lonely with most of his one-time dream team having defected en masse. [Photo Credit]
