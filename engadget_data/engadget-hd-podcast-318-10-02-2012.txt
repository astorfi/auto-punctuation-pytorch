 It was a great week to stop by your local electronics store, as Logitech and Sling both had products pop up on shelves early. Other than taking a peek at the newest Harmony, we're also digging into the future of Verizon's FiOS TV Media Server and the upcoming Redbox Instant service. Netflix, Zeebox, Sky and YouTube all have mobile apps making news, and with word that cable companies might get into cloud gaming all we can think about is the possible return of Sega Channel. We close things out with the weekly listings and a quick peek at some of our favorites from the new shows.
