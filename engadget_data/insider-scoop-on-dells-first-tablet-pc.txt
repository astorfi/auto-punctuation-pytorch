Just got a scoop from one of our reliable sources that Dell is planning to have their first Tablet PC out before the
end of the year (probably October) and that it'll have a be a convertible-style model with a 12.1-inch screen
(basically a laptop with a screen that swivels around and folds down), run on the 2005 version of the Tablet PC
operating system, and possibly weigh under four pounds. We'll get a pic of this as soon as we can.
