This one is decidedly more portable than Archos' recent Android-based devices, and packs a 3.2-inch touchscreen, an 800MHz ARM Cortex A8 processor, 8GB of storage, WiFi, a built-in camera and microphone, and Android 2.1 for an OS (upgradeable to Android 2.2). Not too shabby for $149.99, and J&R will even knock of three bucks off the list price if you order now.

Update: Looks like the listing has now been pulled from J&R's site. We'll keep you posted if we hear anything more.
