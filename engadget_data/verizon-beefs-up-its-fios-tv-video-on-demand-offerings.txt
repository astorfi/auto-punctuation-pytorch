Beyond that, it's also bringing a new helping of other options to its video-on-demand service. Reportedly, FiOS TV subscribers can now fix their eyeballs on VOD (and HD VOD, if it's in your area) content from "CBS, Discovery Channel, Smithsonian Channel, Ovation TV and more." More specifically, some of the newcomers include Big Brother 9, Numb3rs, CSI, CSI:Miami, CSI:New York, Jericho, NCIS and Survivor: Micronesia - Fans vs. Favorites. Granted, folks outside of Richmond and Virginia Beach, VA, Tampa, FL, Fort Wayne, IN, Pittsburgh, PA, Burlington, MA, and Rhode Island won't be seeing any of this in high-def, but Verizon does note that HD VOD "is coming soon to all remaining FiOS TV markets."Read - Verizon plays March Madness on DemandRead - Verizon expands VOD offerings on FiOS TV
