 The Kids Tablet? Okay, Polaroid doesn't get any points for creativity on the naming side of things, but the company clearly did put some thought into creating a low-price slate for tiny hands. This seven-incher features a rugged rubberized design -- in fact the company didn't flinch when we dropped it twice during the video hands-on that you'll find after the break. The buttons are big and easy to press, and tablet looks fairly easy to clean after the inevitable PB&J smears.

 The screen leave a bit to be desired, we'll say that, but that's probably to be expected from a $150 kids tablet. The device runs Android 4.0, featuring a Polaroid skin that looks a bit like Microsoft tiles -- again, probably a good thing for clumsy little fingers. Polaroid's also loaded up some kids software, like Kids Vids, a video app that pulls videos off of YouTube based on the users' age. There some age controls on here as well, though they're hardly the most involved we've seen on a device like this.

 Interested parties with tech loving kids can pick the tablet up now.
