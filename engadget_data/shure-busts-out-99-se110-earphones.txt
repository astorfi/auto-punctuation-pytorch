Of course, you'll have to put up with a few comprises -- namely, one driver instead of the usual two or three -- but you will get Shure's trademark "Balanced MicroSpeaker" technology, as well as an accessory package of sleeves, a cleaning tool, and a carrying case. According to IGN, the jack on the earphones is also small enough to use with an iPhone without an adapter, in case that's a top concern for you. Look for these to be available from all the usual sources on September 17th.
