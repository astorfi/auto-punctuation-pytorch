Now, according to Reuters the troubled company has slipped behind on production, with The Wall Street Journal going as far to say mass production hasn't started at all. The nearest thing to a reason given for the situation is "manufacturing difficulties." If you were worried this might delay the reveal of Apple's next flagship, the WSJ also reminds us that Sharp is still one of three suppliers, though it's unclear just how big a slice of the production-pie Okuda's brigade has been given. At the very least, those on the production line can likely enjoy some much appreciated overtime.
