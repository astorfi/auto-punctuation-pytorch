Nevertheless, we felt it prudent to point out that the cable company is apparently looking to offer up some 6,000 movies per month through its On Demand service, and best of all, over half of those will be available in high-definition. Currently, "just" 1,300 selections are being made available each month, and while a definitive date isn't given, we are told not to expect the increase (at least in full) until sometime "next year." We've got it marked down Comcast -- and we'll be holdin' you to it, capisce? [Warning: PDF read link]
