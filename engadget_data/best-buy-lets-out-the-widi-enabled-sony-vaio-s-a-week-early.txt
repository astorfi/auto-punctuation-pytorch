We received a handful of tips that certain Best Buys were selling their Intel Wireless Display-compatible "Blue Label 2.0" laptops a bit early -- nowhere near us, unfortunately -- and now comes pictorial proof from the forums of Notebook Review. This 13.3-inch Sony Vaio S was allegedly caught wearing a $1,049.99 sticker and housing a 2.26MHz Core i5 with integrated graphics -- no NVIDIA GPU here, and we gotta figure that's hurting the displayed Windows Experience Rating. The official launch of the Best Buy-customized Vaio S is next week, along with a number of other WiDi-enabled laptops.
