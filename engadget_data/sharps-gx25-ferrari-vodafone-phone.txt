We're not trying to whip Ferrari fans up into
a frenzy over gear they won't find or anything, but we just thought you might want to know that Sharp's got a new GX25
Ferrari edition phone available on Vodafone in the UK, should you be headed over to Old Blighty any time soon. It's got
Bluetooth, a VGA camera, 262k QVGA display, and that classic shiny fire-engine red exterior with the horsey emblem. You
know, so you can bust it out fast, make a fast call, put it away right quick. Besides, you know what they said about
Ferraris being so choice, and recommending picking one up if you have the opportunity.
