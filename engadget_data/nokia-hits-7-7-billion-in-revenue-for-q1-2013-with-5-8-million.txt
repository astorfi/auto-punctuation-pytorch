 Nokia may have seen an operating loss in Q1 2013, but the news isn't all bad. The company saw revenue of $7.7 billion and managed to sell 5.6 million Lumias, which equates to a 30 percent increase in handset sales over last quarter. As for earnings, Nokia put a shiny buff on them by trumpeting a net profit of $236 million using the non-IFRS accounting method. By stricter IFRS rules, it actually lost $150 million, but that still compares favorably to the vast billion dollar losses it made in the same quarter of 2012.

 Of the Finnish outfit's handset sales, North America accounted for a mere 400,000 out of the 61.9 million sold compared to the 700,000 it sold last quarter, making it the only region that saw a decline during the period. Other regions, like China, saw a large bump in smartphone revenues, largely due to the popularity of pricey handsets like the Lumia 920. CEO Stephen Elop said the company's bullish on Lumia sales, considering the (rumored) Lumia 928 coming to Verizon, along with the recently launched Lumia 520, 620 and 720. He said that sales of other devices were a dark spot, however -- so the company's likely hoping all the new WP8 devices will offset those lost sales next quarter.
