WSJ is reporting that the Apple smartphone will hit Sprint at the same time as those other two networks, bringing a well-needed boost to the carrier's shares in afternoon trading. We've heard mixed reports about an expected release date, but Wall Street Journal sources "familiar with the matter" are claiming that the phone will ship in mid-October. One source also stated that Sprint will begin carrying the iPhone 4 at the same time -- presumably with a price drop in tow. Adding Sprint's 52 million subscribers to the mix could bring the iPhone within reach of customers currently locked into contracts, family plans or corporate agreements with Sprint, making the move a huge win for both companies.
