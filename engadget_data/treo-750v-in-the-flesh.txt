We're told that Vodafone has an exclusive on the device at least through the holidays, meaning Cingular might not be getting the love until '07 despite the presence of triband UMTS. We also confirmed that the device is UMTS only, not HSDPA, but hey -- when it comes to triband 3G devices, beggars can't be choosers.Update: TreoCentral's been told that the 750 will be software upgradable to HSDPA; also, Vodafone's exclusivity clause applies to Europe only, leaving the door open for 2006 releases in Asia, the US or elsewhere.
