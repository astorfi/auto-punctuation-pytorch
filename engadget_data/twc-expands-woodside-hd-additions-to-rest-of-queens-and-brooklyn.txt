Yep, this now means that you and your Woodside pals can once again be on speaking terms, as you too can finally enjoy the likes of CNN HD, M HD, History Channel HD, A&E HD, Food Network HD, Lifetime Movies HD, HGTV HD, TMC HD, Versus HD and NHL HD. Be sure and drop any extras that may have joined inconspicuously in comments below. [Disclosure: Engadget is part of the Time Warner family][Thanks, Vin P.]
