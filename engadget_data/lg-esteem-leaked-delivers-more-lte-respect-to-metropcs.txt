	The LG Esteem has been spotted hanging out in several official-looking press shots accompanied by several pages of specification juice at LG's partner portal site. Previously seen under the guise Bryce, and seemingly identical to Verizon's LG Revolution, this metroPCS interpretation looks set to arrive very soon. A welcome upgrade to the network's previous LTE offering, the Esteem runs Gingerbread on a 4.3 inch screen and has some respectable mid-range credentials under the hood including a 1GHz Snapdragon processor, 512MB of RAM and 8GB of storage expandable by microSD. There's also a five megapixel snapper on the back, embedded in a stylish metal strip similar to the dual-core T-Mobile G2x. Unlike LG's powerful flagship, though, MetroPCS will reportedly be offering up the Esteem off-contract for $349 -- a reasonable way to increase your LTE-connected self-worth
