Now sporting a more somber look, the homepage is now dominated by a center feed hosting content, which is flanked on its left by a list of channels in a quasi-navigation bar. Besides hosting channels, that navbar also features Google+ and (opt-in) Facebook tabs, allowing you to peruse content friends are sharing and interacting with. Also tweaked are channels, which are now more easily customizable thanks to the addition of snazzy new templates. To our eyes the whole shebang looks like a well-oiled augmented Cosmic Panda coupled with some slick social integration, but don't take our word for it, a video explaining the changes awaits you after the break.
