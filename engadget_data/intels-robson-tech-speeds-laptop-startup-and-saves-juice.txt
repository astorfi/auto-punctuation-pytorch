Intel is showing off some prototype Centrino systems that rock the instant startup due to integrated NAND flash
memory chips. The cache technology, titled Robson, uses a high speed version of the
flash memory that all the kids are
putting in their digital cameras these days, so the tech is proven and the cost shouldn't be astronomical. Intel's
system puts common files like system data and applications onto the flash memory, speeding up their access and reducing
battery consumption. Nobody's signed on yet, Intel is just showing off the capability, but they say it's ready to be
implemented so we're just waiting on some manufacturers to throw it into their systems. And the sooner the better;
we've been waiting around for insta-boot for like 5 million billion years.
