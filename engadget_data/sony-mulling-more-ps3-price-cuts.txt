 According to Senior VP Takao Yuhara at Sony, that pre-launch price cut in Japan might not be the only one the console will be seeing in its early life. "We may look at the price as part of our strategy to expand the market when the timing is right," said Yuhara. Sony wants to break even in its game division by March 2008, and "Such factors, including price cuts to some extent, are factored in," according to Yuhara. Sony is also still holding fast to its target shipment of 6 million PS3s by March 31st 2007, and with the Wii and 360 breathing down its neck, it might very well have to drop prices to compete. Of course, the semi-promise of some sort of price cuts, possibly Japan-only, before March 2008 is isn't really much to go by, but we'll take whatever threads of hope we can get.
