So the rumor is true: the world's first Jolla Sailfish device will be launching this month. In fact, Marc Dillon, the ex-CEO and now Head of Software Development at Jolla, was kind enough to flash the back of the product at the GMIC Beijing conference earlier today -- mainly to emphasize his love for the booming Chinese market. It was very brief -- no more than two seconds -- but the orange device appeared to be no smaller than five inches in screen size. Dillon only added that the official launch is "coming in a couple of weeks," so we'll be keeping an eye out for an invitation in our mailbox.
