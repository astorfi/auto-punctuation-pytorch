       Actually, the headline that would more accurately reflect the situation would read something like "Microsoft talks trash about Sony delay; Nintendo respectfully reinforces its own launch goals," but headlines like those don't sell RSS subscriptions. After hearing about Sony's weak launch quantity and global delays, Microsoft came out woodwork with a bit of backhanded sympathy (laced, of course, with some low blows): "We know how challenging it is to pull off a global launch, so it's not surprising that Sony has backed away from their previously announced launch plan, due to the unproven technology they are trying to pack in to their console." The MS types also made sure everybody knew how much they care for the global gamer: "Europe remains a priority for us. That is why gamers have been able to experience Xbox 360 from day one, and why we're confident we're going to have a great Christmas - regardless of what competitors are or are not in the market." Zing! Nintendo, however, merely reiterated their launch goals: "Wii is on track to ship in Q4, Nintendo plans to ship 6 million systems to retailers around the world between its launch in the fourth quarter of 2006 and the end of its fiscal year on March 31, 2007." Nary a dis for Sony, but we're sure they'll catch the drift all the same.[Thanks, AJ]Read - Microsoft talks trashRead - Nintendo respectfully reinforces
