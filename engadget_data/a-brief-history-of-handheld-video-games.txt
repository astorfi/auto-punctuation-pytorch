       We’re not normally ones for making assumptions, but we’ll go out on a limb and say that most of youreading this have one or more portable gaming systems lying around somewhere. Handheld video gaming has always been afew steps behind its console counterpart, but that’s proven to be a small trade-off for the benefits ofportability and, to some, even part of the appeal.So, while most gamers are now enjoying their PSPs andMicros and DSs, we thought we'd take a little trip back and look at some of the handhelds from whence they came beforethem. Although we have to warn you, reading this feature may cause an uncontrollable urge to jump over to eBay.The Early YearsMattel’s LED-based Handhelds - 1977-78The idea ofhandheld video games with interchangeable cartridges wouldn’t take hold for about another decade, but Mattelmanaged to pry video games away from quarter-swallowing arcades and dim televisions with their successful line ofLED-based, single-game handhelds. Most people today will remember Football, but the company also released thecreatively-titled Basebal and Basketball, as well as the non-sports titles Missle Attack, Armor Battle, and Sub Chase.Mattel also managed to jump on the retro-chic bandwagon, re-releasing Football and Baseball in 2000.Clickon to see the rest!
      

 

Milton BradleyMicrovision - 1979Milton Bradley, a company then better known for Hungry Hungry Hippos than videogames, has the distinction of being the first to introduce a handheld video game console with interchangeablecartridges with its Microvision. The system had only a handful of games and was plagued with problems from the start,including a 16x16 pixel LCD screen that was prone to rotting and cartridges that could be permantly damaged by even arelatively small static charge. Sounds like the makings of a real collector's item, if you ask us.Nintendo’s Game & Watch Series - 1980-91Upping theante from Mattel’s LED handhelds, Nintendo introduced their first Game & Watch handheld in 1980 and would goon to produce dozens more throughout the decade, offering a small glimpse of what was to come from the company. As thename suggests, the handhelds featured a clock and alarm but the real attraction was the games, which included titleslike Donkey Kong, Mario Bros, and Balloon Fight. Gee, this thing looks kind of familiar (but we just can't placeit).Epoch Game Pocket Computer - 1984 It took five years after Milton Bradley’s Microvision before another company would try its hand at aportable gaming system, but unfortunately the second time around proved even less successful than the first.Epoch’s Game Pocket Computer was released only in Japan in 1984 and had just five games. The 75x64 LCD screen wasa big step up from the Microvision but, as you can tell from the number of people who have actually ever heard of thedevice, it never caught on.The NewWaveNintendo Game Boy - 1989 It’s almost impossible to understate the impact of Nintendo’s Game Boy. Theoriginal Game Boy, in its various incarnations, is the most successful video game system ever -- handheld or otherwise.Part of its success is likely due to its reasonable price ($109 US at launch), but most of it is a result of the gamesand, in particular, the drop dead brilliant move of bundling Tetris with the system.The fact that a systemwith a blurry, green screen and fairly lackluster graphics compared to its competitors was as successful as it wasshould forever serve strongly in support of the argument that it’s the games that make the system, not thehardware.Nintendo would make some improvements to the design over the years, releasing the slimmer Game BoyPocket in 1996, which replaced the original’s green screen with a regular grayscale display, and the Game BoyLight, which added a backlit screen but was unfortunately only available in Japan.Atari Lynx / Lynx II - 1989 The first ofmany challengers to the Game Boy was Atari’s Lynx, co-developed with Epyx and released in 1989. The system had farbetter graphics than the Game Boy, in some cases riviling the console systems of the time, but it was big and much moreexpensive than Nintendo‘s affordable unit. Atari redesigned the unit in 1991 but Atari’s marketing effortsproved to be no match for Nintendo’s, who were already well on their way to dominating the field for years tocome.NEC Turbo Express- 1990NEC managed to produce one of the most technically impressive handhelds with its Turbo Express,which was actually a portable version of its console system, the Turbgraphx 16 (a rival to the Sega Genesis and SuperNintendo). The Turbo Express was about the size of a Game Boy but had a sharp active-matrix color display and couldeven be used as a portable TV with an optional tuner. The downside was, of course,the price which, at $299.99US, seemedto aim the device at a niche market that didn’t yet exist -- the (portable) gaming enthusiast.Sega Game Gear  - 1990 Themost successful of the various Game Boy challengers was Sega’s Game Gear which, like the Lynx and Turbo Express,had a color screen. But unlike those systems managed to keep the retail price down to a fairly reasonable $149. TheGame Gear benefited from Sega’s advantage over Atari and NEC (the Genesis was then the leading console system)and a better selection of games, but it was still only a modest success in the face of Nintendo’s increasingdominance of the market.Sega Nomad - 1995 For most of the 1990s, Nintendo had the handheld market effectively all to themselves,with other companies giving up after trying and failing to knock Nintendo down a few pegs. Sega was the first tore-enter the field with the Sega Nomad, a portable version of the Genesis console. It seemed like a good idea -- afterall the Genesis had a huge library of titles just sitting around countless livingrooms -- but poor battery life and asomewhat bulky design helped to do it in. Even an eventual price drop to $79.99 failed to save the Nomad from being putout to pasture.Tiger Electronics game.com - 1997 You can’t fault Tiger Electronics for their ambition. Theirgame.com handheld, as the name suggests, attempted to bring Internet access and PDA functions to a gaming handheld.Unfortunately, it didn’t do any one thing particularly well: its disappointing games were made even worse by theunit’s outdated screen, and its "Internet access" only let you check email and browse the web in text-- nope, no online gameplay here. Still, as with many of these systems, communities of die-hard gamers have foundrefuge on the web with other like-minded individuals, devoted to breathing some new life into their late, lamentedhandhelds.Neo-Geo Pocket / Pocket Color - 1998-99 Mention the name Neo-Geo to any gamer over the age of 25 or so andyou’ll likely get a knowing smile. A lucky few may have owned the pricey home system that made the Super Nintendoand Sega Genesis look like yesterdays news, but most will be familiar with Neo-Geo from their arcade games -- especiallyfighting games like the Samurai Showdown and King of Fighters series. Attempting to build on their reputation, Neo-Geobranched out into the handheld space in 1998 with the Neo-Geo Pocket, but got off to a rocky start, releasing ablack-and-white unit first before correcting things just a year later with the Neo-Geo Pocket Color (or NGPC). Despitesome solid games, the system never got much support from third-party developers and failed to attract enough gamers tolegitimately challenge the still dominant Nintendo. This is the one we probably miss most 'round Engadget HQ, truth betold.Game BoyColor - 1998Nintendo introduced its first major revision to the Game Boy in 1998 with the Game BoyColor, which, not surprisingly, offered a color screen, case, and better graphics capabilities while still beingbackward compatible with the enormous library of Game Boy titles. While the system was successful, it proved to mostlybe a stopgap measure from Nintendo, who had bigger plans in store.BandaiWonderSwan / WonderSwan Color / WonderSwan Crystal - 1999-2000Bandai’s WonderSwan, replaced a year later by the WonderSwan Color, was most notable for having an exclusivelicense to port the original Final Fantasy games to the system. That earned the system a modest success in Japan but itnever made it to North America. Unfortunately for Bandai, Squaresoft (makers of Final Fantasy) eventually made up withNintendo and started releasing games for the GBA, which proved to be bad news for the still-unique WonderSwan.Game Boy Advance / Advance SP / Micro - 2001 / 2003 / 2005Released in 2001, Nintendo’s Game Boy Advancewas by far the biggest thing to shake up the handheld space since the original Game Boy was released over ten yearsearlier. On the technical side, the GBA was the rough equivalent to the Super Nintendo making ports of titles from thatsystem easy, but the GBA also benefited from some wildly original games like Advance Wars. In 2003, Nintendo releasedthe completely redesigned Game Boy Advance SP which, most importantly, added a front-lit screen, attempting rectifyingthe one major problem people had with the original GBA. Recently, Nintendo released yet another GBA varient, the Game Boy Micro, with a small and sleek design aimedin large part at an older, iPod-totting audience. The Now GenerationNokia N-Gage / N-Gage QD - 2003-04Before they introduced the N-Gage,Nokia wasn’t a company that anyone would associate with gaming -- and now, a few years later, they stillhaven’t really managed to get gamers to take notice. The N-Gage (and it’s most recent revision the QD) is afairly capable system but it seems that most people still prefer to keep their phoning and their gaming separate. Nokia,however, is hoping that'll change in the next couple of years, and intends to incorporate N-Gage gaming capabilitiesinto future smartphones -- not just game-phones.Nintendo DS / DSLite - 2004 / 2005Ever since the first concept designs appeared on the web, the Nintendo DS was met with skepticism. To many, the designseemed like a step backward after the elegant GBA SP, and the dual screens and stylus input seemed more like noveltiesthan the revolution in handheld gaming Nintendo was promising. But gamers were slowly won over as more and more greatgames kept coming out for the DS, including what are arguably some of the most innovative titles on any system -- thebuilt-in WiFi doesn’t hurt either, which they've used to finally move on pervasive portable online gameplay. Andof course, in the last few weeks we've seen the subsequent announcement and Japanese launch of the DS Lite, a smaller, thinner, lighter version of the same device.PlayStation Portable - 2004 The most technically advanced handheld system to date, Sony’s PlayStation Portable seems to be holding on to its(comparatively smaller) piece of the market in the face of Nintendo’s array of handhelds, despite its high pricetag and relatively few stand-out games. Sony also keeps pushing the UMD format for movies, although many users haveopted for more practical means ofviewing content on their PSPs. And if you can keep your firmware versions straight, you can even get in on some homebrew action.Gizmondo - 2005Things aren’t looking good for TigerTelematics and their Gizmondo, their jack-of-all-trades(but master of none) handheld. The system is fairly powerful and has some nifty features like GPS and built-incamera, but with no compelling games and a premium price it faced an uphill battle from the start. And don't even get usstarted about the internal (mis)direction of the company; Tiger later tried to entice gamers by offering the system at adiscount if they agreed to watch a few ads with a system called Smart Adds, but that idea seems to have fallen flat withusers. They've since filed for bankrupcy in EuropeThe Grey AreaGamePark GP32/GP2XFor many, the GP2X (and the GP32 before it, and the forthcoming XGP and XGPMini) is the holy grail of handheld gaming. With a memory card and some emulators, you can play just about any gamefrom a number of the systems above, as well as thousands of arcade and console games. That’s enough to make anyold-school gamer giddy with delight, and enough to send companies running to their IP lawyers. If you actually own acopy of the game you’re emulating you may be better off, although even that is up for debate. Of course thathasn’t stopped most people from getting their retro kicks. PDAs EmulatorsPDAs might not be the most natural fit for gaming (outside of point-and-clickfriendly fare) but that hasn’t stopped developers from producing original games for them and, yes, emulators aswell. Sure, it’s no GP2X, but it’s a heck of a lot more discreet, so you can bust out Super Mario Bros 3and pretend you're working while you try to beat it for the umpteenth time. Don't use the warp pipes, dude, beat itlike a real gamer.
