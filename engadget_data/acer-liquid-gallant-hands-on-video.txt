And now, here at IFA 2012, we got a chance to spend some time with the device up close at the company's booth. As single-core handsets go, this one was quite brisk, loaded up with a 1GHz MTK 6575 CPU buffered by 1GB RAM that handled the mostly stock version of Android 4.0.4 with ease. The screen itself was also rather nice, spanning 4.3-inches and delivering a 960 x 540 qHD resolution. Build-wise, this phone is on the bulkier side and definitely gives the impression of having been stacked together in layers. There are some nice flourishes to its design, such as the silvery plastic grill along its back bottom, but that's about as impressive as this one gets.

 As we mentioned earlier, the Liquid Gallant packs slots for two SIMs (which you'll notice in our gallery below), a 5-megapixel rear camera accompanied by single LED flash and micro-USB port. Internally, the phone also sports 4GB of storage, so you'll most likely need to lean upon that microSD slot for expansion. Clearly, this isn't a high-ender, but it doesn't need to be. With a nearly vanilla Android experience, sturdy though unattractive chassis and appreciable resolution, it's a considerable option for globe-trotters with less intense mobile needs. Head on past the break for a video tour.
