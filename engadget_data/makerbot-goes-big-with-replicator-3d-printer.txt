Of course, you still can't, say, print yourself up a car just yet, but the Replicator does, at the very least, take a baby step in that direction. It also offers up the company's Dualstrusion technology, making it possible to print in two colors. The Replicator can take either ABS (the plastic found in Lego) or biodegradable PLA plastic. The Replicator will run $1,999 for the dual extruder or $1,749 for a single.
