The service will allow customers who come late to an already-started program to restart viewing from the beginning of the content. Comcast is in talks with Time Warner Cable (partly owned by Time Warner, parent company of AOL, which owns Engadget) for licensing rights to the name "Start Over." But whatever the name ends up being, Comcast plans to start testing the service by the middle of 2008 and deploying to customers by January 1, 2009.
