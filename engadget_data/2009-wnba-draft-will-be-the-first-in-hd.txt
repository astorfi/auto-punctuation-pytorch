 With the women's NCAA basketball season concluded it's time for the WNBA Draft, and we might have found a reason for you to watch, since this is the first time it will be broadcast on high definition. Covered as usual on ESPN, things get started with the first round on ESPN2 HD at 3 p.m. on Thursday, April 9, followed by the second and third rounds on ESPNU HD and NBA TV. No word on any 720p regular season games, we'll tune in for the Atlanta Dream's #1 pick, but with very little dunking and HD on the schedule we make no promises after that.
