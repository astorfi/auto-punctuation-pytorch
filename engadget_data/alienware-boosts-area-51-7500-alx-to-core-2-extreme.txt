The new Area-51 7500 (pictured) and the higher-end Area-51 ALX have just been bumped to an optional Core 2 Extreme processor, officially bringing your setup to ludicrous speed. Like its predecessor, the 7500 has a standard 1GB of RAM that can be raised to 4GB, and has your choice of an NVIDIA GeForce 7950 or a Dual NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTX. The base config (that's without the quad-core) starts at $2,200 -- but where's the fun in that? Adding a Core 2 Extreme chip will add nearly another grand, while maxing out the whole equipage will put you within striking distance of $10,000 (including a $1,300 Dell 30-inch monitor and some sweet $400 speakers, of course). What about that ALX? It starts at $6,100 (quad-core action included), and naturally, maxes out just under 10K.Read - Area-51 7500Read - Area-51 ALX
