 When Samsung and Sony signed their patent-sharing deal in late 2004, it sealed apartnership that included joint development of LCD displays and participation in the Blu Ray alliance. Now Toshiba andLG have signed a similar deal, agreeing to cross-license patents related to HD DVD technology. While no dollar valuewas attached to the deal, it highlights how much each company is banking on next-gen DVD technology for future growth-- not to mention the continued importance of Korea to Japan's electronics giants, which once thought they coulddominate global markets on their own.
