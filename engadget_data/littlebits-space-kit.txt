Many kids want to become astronauts, but getting them to embrace day-to-day space science is tougher -- it's not as exciting as setting foot on Mars. NASA is all too aware of this challenge, so it has teamed up with LittleBits to create the Space Kit, a build-it-yourself bundle that should make these routine experiments a little more exciting. The pack includes parts and lessons that teach junior Neil Armstrongs and Sally Rides about atmospheric readings, light waves and other aspects of NASA's work without requiring engineering or programming skills. Young ones can even build tiny vehicles of their own, including the International Space Station, a satellite and a planetary rover. The $189 kit won't necessarily lead to a career among the stars, but it could be a good way to spark some curiosity.
