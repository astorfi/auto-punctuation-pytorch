Combine that with the persistent rumors of a BlackJack II in the works, the fact that the popular BlackJack (whose model number is i607, coincidentally) is getting a little long in the tooth, and AT&T devices from Samsung typically end in "7," and, well, you can pretty much figure out the rest. Give us Windows Mobile 6, WiFi, and a slightly better keyboard and you've got a worthy successor, guys.
