We got a few screenshots at Google I/O but now there's pictures and videos popping up all over. One of our tipsters sent a few shots over, while the Channel Android folks on YouTube have posted a video walkthrough (embedded after the break). So far it looks good, with little remaining of the original Google TV UI, now replaced by widgets, box art-style listings of TV content and more. Thinking about dropping a Benjamin on one of these units and upgrading to Honeycomb yourself? Be warned -- it's very raw, so with no Netflix and not much app compatibility to speak of, remaining a voyeur is probably advisable for now.
