  There's plenty to talk about this week, and we kick things off with a lot of internet-related discussion -- Apple turned loose HD video purchases, Amazon has some HD TV show sales, and Netflix opened up its Facebook Connect program. After we ramp this all up to the long-term future of TV, we come back to reality with Windows Home Server's inclusion of Media Center features -- while not to the level of a true headless Media Center PC, this move might foreshadow (maybe not too-distant) future development of just such a kit. Microsoft certainly seems to keep up with support of the platform, and just this week sent out a patch for guide data that went missing after the DTV switchover. We roll right past the large number of Engadget HD readers who are still buying DVDs and into the review of the OPPO BDP-83; it looks like good unit, and certainly seems to have to disc support options covered. Rounding out the show, we talk about an all all-digital HDMI signal path doesn't necessarily guarantee a perfect path, and then wrap up with what gears we see turning behind the recent DirecTV NFL Sunday Ticket news.
