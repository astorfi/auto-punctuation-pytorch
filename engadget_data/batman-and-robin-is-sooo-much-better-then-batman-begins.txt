       HBO HD was running Batmanand Robin and thanks to DIRECTV lackluster HD lineup, so I choose to watch the "classic." About twominutes into it I discovered that, WOW, this is so much better then the"new" batman: BatmanBegins. Well, the acting is not as good. Nor is the story or the villains. The Batmobile has nothing onthe new one and Alfred is good, but not Michael Caine good. But ifyou can get past all those "minor" details, it is better in high definition. The movie is so darkbut yet vibrant. The colors just shoot out of the screen when placed next to the deep backs that is characteristic ofthe Batman theme. Batman Begins is an amazing story and a brilliant movie but Batman and Robin just looks amazing in high definition. Next time it is on HBO HD, your HDTV will look great!
