 So, you like talkin', do you? What's that? Not a fan of contracts? Looks like MetroPCS may just have something right down your alley with the new Unlimited Nationwide plan. Said plan enables subscribers to chat in an unlimited fashion in over 300 cities in the contiguous United States without any contract whatsoever, and best of all, the expanded network will be included at no additional charge in the carrier's current $45 and $50 service plans. For those on cheaper qualified plans, the luxury can be added for $5 per month. Interested? The go-live date is November 10th.[Via phonescoop]
