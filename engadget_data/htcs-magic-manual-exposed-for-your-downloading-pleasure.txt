Both offer nearly 100 sultry pages of assembly and disassembly information, including full photo spreads showing the phones' naughty bits splayed to the winds. For those who read the articles, there are comprehensive descriptions on how to re-flash the pair, which should come in handy if you're never content to leave good enough ROMs alone. The only question now is: where can we get a pair of those dashing pin-striped gloves? [Via ModMyGphone; thanks, Meerhaj]
