 We've seen it noted in a few of thecomments here, some HDTV cable subscribers having to go antenna or not at all if they  want to watch the SuperBowl in high definition while their provider and the owners of local stations squabble. We know a lot of HDTV owners aresports fanatics, and so do advertisers and television companies who are determined to get every dollar they can.This article notes a typical battle currently going on in North Carolina and other areas. We recently postedabout the owner of this affiliate, Sinclair, reaching a dealin Columbus, Ohio for HDTV broadcasts. Unless someone bends unexpectedly it doesn't look like Greensboro residents canexpect the same. Is there anything customers can do when stuck like this? Switching to satellite or usingan antenna isn't always feasible or desirable. I think local sports bars are  at the bottom of a massiveconspiracy, you heard it here first.
