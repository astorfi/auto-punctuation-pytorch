Today, however, a Mate 2-toting source has sent some snaps to our friends at Engadget Chinese, including a few family photos with the original Mate. Barring a few aesthetic changes and a slightly thinner profile, the Mate 2 bears a similar square form factor to its older brother. Aside from learning of its 13-megapixel main camera, the source reiterates specs we've heard already: a 1.6GHz quad-core processor, 16GB of internal storage, 2 gigs of RAM and Android 4.2.2 with a coating of Emotion UI. It is claimed, however, that the next-gen Mate's display has not been upgraded as previously thought, so we're in for the same 6.1-inch 720p panel as before. That could make for an anticlimactic first impression, and if Huawei's going to make its Mate family announcements a CES tradition, then disappointment is just around the corner.
