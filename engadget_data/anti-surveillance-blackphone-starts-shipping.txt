If you missed our coverage during Mobile World Congress, then here's what you need to know about Blackphone: it's a mid-spec Android smartphone that comes pre-subscribed to (and pre-installed with) a bunch of privacy and anti-surveillance services, for a price of $629 off-contract. It's the offspring of a joint venture between Silent Circle and Geeksphone, who together have just announced that the first batch of devices is now shipping to customers who pre-ordered during the initial publicity rush. Everyone else will have the opportunity to place an order once general sales start on July 14th. Check out our hands-on video from MWC below, but bear in mind that the device was only at prototype stage back then, and it wasn't entirely stable.
