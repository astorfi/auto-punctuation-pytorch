The company has just announced a new look for that key component of the social network, one that now sports a side-by-side layout and support for multiple inline images -- not to mention emoticons. It's also promising a number of other improvements that are less immediately evident, including the ability to search by a sender's name or keyword directly from the main messages view, and a number of new keyboard shortcuts.
