We've already established that Amazon's Fire TV is a capable (if imperfect) set-top box, but how hard is it to replace components if they conk out? Not very, if you ask iFixit. The repair outfit has torn down the device and discovered that it's very simply built -- there are very few parts, and a regular screwdriver is enough to take apart the internals. The power supply is separate, too. Amazon's media hub isn't quite a fix-it-yourself paradise, though. It's tricky to remove the outer case, and the single circuit board inside will be expensive to replace. Still, it's good to know that the Fire TV isn't much more difficult to maintain than its big rival.
