You love Cat Schwartzâ€”we love her too, that's why she's the
Engadget spokeswoman, afterall. But she's
got more on her mind than yakking about gadgets, so she did a couple hits for one of our many pet projects, Video
Engadget. DS vs PSP answers the eternal question: exactly
what would happen if the DS met the
PSP somewhere on a playground in LA? We won't tell
you how it ends, but keep an eye out for our forthcoming director's cut (with alternate endings) on extended DVD.
