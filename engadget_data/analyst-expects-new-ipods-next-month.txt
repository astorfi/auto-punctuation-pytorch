According to AppleInsider, UBS's Ben Reitzes recently told his clients that he expects to see some refreshed iPods sometime next month, including higher capacity iPod nanos at "aggressive price points," and a flash-based widescreen video iPod "likely using multi-touch technology" priced under $300. Reasonable bets to be sure, although we'd still recommend taking them with the usual grain of salt pending word from the man himself.
