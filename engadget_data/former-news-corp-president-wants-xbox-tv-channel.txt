Now, rumors indicate an Xbox TV channel might be next in line. Bloomberg writes that former News Corp. president Peter Chernin discussed the possibility of adding regular exclusive programming to the console at an April 12th meeting with Microsoft, and reportedly suggested a $1 to $2 increase in Xbox LIVE monthly fees to cover the additional cost. However, since Microsoft apparently hasn't formally responded to the proposal, this may just be another pipe dream -- from the man who thought we'd pay $30 per movie for on-demand HD, no less. 'Course, with all this talk of Hulu going paid, we suppose just about anything is possible.
