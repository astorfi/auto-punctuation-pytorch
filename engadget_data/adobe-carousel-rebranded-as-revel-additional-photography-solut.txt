 It's just been a few months since it was announced, but Adobe's Carousel photo service / app has now already seen its first big change. The company announced last night that Adobe Carousel is now known as Adobe Revel, a name that it says is designed to better accommodate "additional photography solutions" and other new functionality it has planned for the platform. Alongside the name change comes version 1.1 of the Revel app, which addresses a number of minor issues, and adds photo sharing with Flickr, as well as the ability to automatically import photos from your iPhone or iPad's Camera Roll.
