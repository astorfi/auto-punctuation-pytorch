This handheld conglomerate manages to wear an awful lot of hats, as it features a built-in media player, four-inch 480 x 272 widescreen panel, an image / text viewer, FM radio, WiFi, gaming functions, and Windows CE at the helm. Of course, we'd be sure to give this thing a whirl before confidently snapping up such a chintzy looking piece, but those willing to take the risk can pick one up in China for 1,999CNY ($264).[Via PMPToday]
