       While we were all hoping that DirecTV's latest satellite named DirecTV-10 would go off without a hitch on June 20th and bring all those HD channels they've been promising, but I guess we're not that lucky. It looks like the rocket is ready to go, but the bird was not delivered on time. At this point, they are shooting for July (6th?), but haven't said exactly when yet, we don't know about everyone else, but we will feel much better when this thing is in orbit and beaming HD goodness to everyone.
