       The Internet has been buzzing about the controversial key recently taken down from Digg -- which took a revolt to get it back on. The funny part for Engadget HD readers is that this is old news, we're talking real old, in fact we originally reported on it back in February. Of course the MPAA can't put the genie back in the bottle, and although technically they could revoke the key, we'd just like to see them even try it.
