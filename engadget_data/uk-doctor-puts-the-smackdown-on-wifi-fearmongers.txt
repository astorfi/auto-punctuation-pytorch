 Ok, folks, listen up: this whole WiFi health thing is starting to get a little out of hand. In response to an issue that The Times reported on late last month, where some UK schools were pulling the plug on their local wireless networks due to health concerns, the newspaper has now done a bit more investigating into its health effects, perceived or otherwise. It interviewed various pundits on both sides, but one of the most powerful arguments was made by Dr. Michael Clark, of the UK's Health Protection Agency, who said: "As a comparison, a child on a mobile phone receives up to 50 per cent of guideline levels. So a year sitting in a classroom near a wireless network is roughly equivalent to 20 minutes on a mobile. If WiFi should be taken out of schools, then the mobile phone network should be shut down, too - and FM radio and TV, as the strength of their signals is similar to that from WiFi in classrooms." Further, there are also concerns about electrosensitivity -- people who claim to be physically injured due to electromagnetic waves that propagate from WiFi equipment. As both The Times article, and WiFi expert Glenn Fleishman suggest, one simple way to determine whether or not this is actually true would be to conduct a double-blind test. Honestly, you government experts and anti-WiFi folks, would that be so hard?Read - The TimesRead - Wi-Fi Net News[Via Techdirt]
