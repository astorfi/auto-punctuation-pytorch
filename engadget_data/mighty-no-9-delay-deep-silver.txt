Mighty No. 9, the new, Kickstarted game from Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune, is now due out on September 15 in the US, delayed from a spring 2015 launch window. Inafune's team, Comcept, announced the delay in a Kickstarter update, along with another nugget of news: Deep Silver -- the publisher behind Saints Row, Homefront and Dead Island -- will publish Mighty No. 9. Comcept promises that the delay will allow the team to add Japanese and French voiceovers, extra subtitle languages, and an extra level, boss and playable character.



"Before you despair, please, hear us out first!" Comcept writes. "The reason for the delay, and the reason we are so excited about this new partnership in the first place, is all the cool stuff it will allow us to add to the game." The deal with Deep Silver will not impact any Kickstarter backer rewards, Comcept says. Mighty No. 9 raised $3.8 million of a $900,000 goal on Kickstarter back in October 2013. Early gameplay looks like it will be a true treat for fans of Inafune's past work.
