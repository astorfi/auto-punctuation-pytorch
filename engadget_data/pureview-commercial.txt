Whilst it's clear the company's hired a coterie of models, professional photographers and a world-class lighting rig, it's still a great indication of what the technology can do in the right hands. Head on past the break to see the results for yourself and then catch yourself seriously weighing up buying a Symbian phone for your next handset, just like we are.
