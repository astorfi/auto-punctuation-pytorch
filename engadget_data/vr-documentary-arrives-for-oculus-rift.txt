Want a surreal experience? Try watching a documentary about virtual reality on the device it's meant to cover. As promised, Condition One has released Zero Point, an investigation of the virtues and vices of VR that you can only watch on an Oculus Rift headset. The $15 title ($12 for the first week) won't provide shocking insights to its target audience -- you're clearly interested in VR if you bought a developer kit -- but it does provide a range of panoramic shots that show off the potential for immersive movies. You can always try the free demo, so there's no harm in visiting the source link if you're eager to do more with your Rift than play games and paint in 3D.
