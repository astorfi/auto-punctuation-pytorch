 OUYA likely won't be the only Android-based game console in town this spring. PlayJam is going beyond its smart TV roots to build the GameStick, a TV-based system that fits into a shell not much bigger than a typical flash drive -- it's small enough that the finished version should stow inside its own Bluetooth gamepad and draw power from the HDMI port, like Roku's Streaming Stick. The Jelly Bean system's dual-core Amlogic processor isn't as powerful as the Tegra 3 in the OUYA, but it should also lead to a slightly more tempting $79 price. PlayJam's remaining challenge is the familiar one of reaching a crowdfunding target: the company says it needs $100,000 to go through its last development hurdles and ship the production GameStick in April. If the firm makes its goal, however, the low-cost gaming world will be delightfully crowded this year.

  Portable Games Console To Bring Affordable Gaming Directly To Your TV Screen
  London & San Francisco;January 2nd, 2013; PlayJam,the global platform for casual and social games on Smart TV, launched its Kickstarter campaign today in a bid to bring its dedicated games console - GameStick - to life.
  The team behind GameStick hope to accelerate the race to change the face of big screen gaming with the launch of the most portable, affordable, dedicated TV gaming device on the market priced at just $79.
  GameStick is a small yet powerful, dedicated games console that plugs directly into a TV's HDMI slot and comes with a fully featured Bluetooth controller - ready to go right out of the box. When on the move, the two combine into a single unit, putting big screen gaming right into the pocket. The device will be compatible with other Bluetooth controllers enabling true multi-player functionality.
  "We wanted to create a games console that helped further our overriding mission to bring affordable gaming to the big screen". Says Jasper Smith, CEO PlayJam. "Not only that, we wanted to push the boundaries of what has been achieved up to now bypacking sufficient power into the most portable of devices, enabling users to carry that experience with them wherever they go."
  The 30 day Kickstarter campaign launched today with the team at PlayJam looking to raise a minimum of $100,000 to help make GameStick a reality. Supporters of the project can get involved by pledging as little as $10.
  "We are currently in a closed Beta phase of development with a working prototype that our guys are using to test some great games. Next comes the final design stage and live testing of both the controller and the games," continues Smith. "We are fortunate to have been able to utilize our existing technology to get us to this point and have preferred manufacturers in place and an existing developer network ready to go. However, to get this project over the line and into full production, we need the support of the backers on Kickstarter."
  GameStick will feature a purpose-built game store through which users will be able to browse and download content. The proposition will be powered by PlayJam's existing Games Network for Smart TV which currently supports developers such as Relentless Software, First Star Software, and Disney.
  To date, the team has been focused on bringing GameStick to its pre-production phase by finalising hardware design and integrating the back end technology to power the service. They have worked with a small beta group of developers to announce the following initial line-up.

     Sports Director     Now that the project is public, the team hopes to work with all Android developers looking to get their games onto the big screen. GameStick's Bluetooth controller uses different modes to allow the gamer to access and play 100's of compatible games directly onto their TV.
  "To date, the most accessible route to TV gaming for the consumer has been the traditional games console – this is changing. GameStick gives the thousands of Android developers out there an additional route to bring an affordable big-screen gaming experience direct to their fans. What's more, we wanted to do this via a unique, highly portable device that will enable pure social gaming – by that we mean people sharing great experiences in the same room!" Smith concluded.
