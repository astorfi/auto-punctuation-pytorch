Google Play's magazine subscriptions have always, sadly, existed separate from a publications print offerings. Meaning, even if you already had the paper edition of Beer Advocate delivered to your home, you still had to cough up for the digital version. That's finally changed, however, which should make many magazine hounds quite happy. Now when you select a new periodical, you'll be offered the standard monthly and yearly subscription options, along with the new "free for print subscribers." You'll need to verify your subscription before Google will allow you to download issues, but that's one less barrier to entry for those looking to dip their toes in the digital magazine pool.
