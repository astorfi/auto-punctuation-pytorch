The Ontario Securities Commission sure does, and according to ReportonBusiness, it's seeking a record $100 million Canadian (that's about $79 million US) fine against co-CEOs Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis. If approved, that'll be the largest penalty ever to be paid by individuals to the OSC, with Balsillie expected to pay the bulk of the penalty. As usual, none of the parties involved are commenting on the case, but we reckon this won't be the last we hear about it.[Via Mobile Syrup]
