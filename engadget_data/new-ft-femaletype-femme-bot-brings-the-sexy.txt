That's a good question, and Takahashi-san -- creatorof the wonderful Chroinoand Manoi bots --has an answer with his new femme bot, the FT "FemaleType." Of course, being sexy isn't all about how you lookstanding still, so FT has the strut of a fashion model with the twist of her hips and feminine posture. We'll keep aneye out for video of this strut in action, but we do know that FT is built out of carbon fiber, stands 14-inches tall,weighs a mere 1.8 pounds, and should be in production in a bit more than a year. Rumors of romantic interest betweenManoi and FemaleType could not be confirmed at this time, but apparently Chroino and FT have a "history."[Via Robots Dreams]
