As far as we can tell (thanks, Mr. Blurrycam), we'd wager this is a purely non-working mockup, since that "touchscreen" looks a bit too much like "glued-on paper" to us, but we're really short on info otherwise. What is encouraging here is that apparently someone is taking this dual screen idea seriously, and it's hard to deny that such an improbable form factor could really end up being the shot-in-the-arm this project needs.
