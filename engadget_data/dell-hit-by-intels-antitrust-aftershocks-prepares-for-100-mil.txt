 Hounded by international antitrust allegations, Intel fired an initial $1.25 billion salvo's worth of settlement last year, but now Chipzilla's biggest distributor of silicon is feeling the heat as well. Dell publicly announced it has set aside a $100 million reserve fund to head off investigations at the pass with a potential settlement of its own. While the company doesn't admit wrongdoing, it recognizes "alleged violations of negligence-based fraud provisions," also known as accepting Intel's controversial chip rebates without reporting them to the government. Dell's actually been under SEC investigation since 2005 for accounting-related transgressions and the company now hopes to tie up all loose ends at once -- here's hoping we see cheaper Core i7-infused laptops whether or not execs pull it off.
