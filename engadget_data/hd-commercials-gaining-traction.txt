According to a study conducted on Discovery HD Theater, it was found that "the increase in brand recall by HD viewers was triple that of standard-definition viewers, and intent-to-purchase was 55-percent higher when ads were seen in HD." Furthermore, viewers claimed that spots in high-def were "very enjoyable." The research hints that HD commercials may finally be recognized as "premium content" worth premium prices, but it was noted that as these kinds of ads become "more normal, they won't have as big a lift."[Image courtesy of HiddenWires]
