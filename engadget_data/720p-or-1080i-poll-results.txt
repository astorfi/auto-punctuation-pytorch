       Well, it wasn't a convincing victory, but a good half of you prefer 1080i resolution over 720p. Over 10% of you just don't care: you like HDTV any which way you can see it! I'm thinking we should run this poll on a semi-regular basis, you know, say every 3 or 4 months? The reason behind that is because we're seeing more networks go high-def in both resolutions and we'll also have more set choices in both 720p and 1080i. I think more people will have an affinity towards one or the other over time. Of course, next time we may have to add 1080p to the mix as well!
