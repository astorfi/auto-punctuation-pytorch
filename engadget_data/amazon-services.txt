Looks as if the list of things that Amazon doesn't sell just got that little bit shorter after the company started connecting people with local contractors. Customers in a handful of trial cities, including NYC and Seattle, can now use an Angie's List-style site to get tradespeople to visit your home for services. For instance, search for a TV wall bracket on the site and you'll be able to find a professional TV mounter to come and drill the holes so you don't have to. Right now, it's only a limited trial, but imagine if Amazon eventually bundled this sort of thing into Prime? We'd never have to shell out big bucks for an emergency plumber ever again.
