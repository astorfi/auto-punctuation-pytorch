You know those cute Amiibo NFC-enabled toys/collectibles/game accessories that Nintendo debuted this year? They aren't going anywhere for a while. Well, some of them won't, at least -- and so far, that includes Mario and Link, according to Wired. The outfit says that it intends to have certain characters always available, but wouldn't spill any other details regarding which of the mini-statues would make that cut. We imagine it's pretty likely that those pictured above will likely survive time and again. However, a company rep did explain why Marth, Wii Fit Trainer and Villager have been so scarce: Nintendo deliberately didn't produce many to start and they've since been discontinued.


"We will aim for certain Amiibo to always be available. These will be for our most popular characters like Mario and Link. Due to shelf space constraints, other figures likely will not return to the market once they have sold through their initial shipment."


Naturally, that's pushed at least some of the trio's values higher at places like eBay and Amazon. Smash fan-favorite Marth can set you back as much as $90, while Wii Fit Trainer is only going for a few bucks over the $12.99 standard retail price. 
And guess what else is in short supply? The $20 adapter that's necessary to play Smash Bros. with Gamecube controllers. That, friends, is selling for nearly $100. If it wasn't clear enough by now, this is your cue to start buying every Nintendo accessory as it's released.
