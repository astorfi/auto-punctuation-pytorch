 This September, Sony disrupted the point-and-shoot market with the announcement of a full-frame compact model -- the $2,800 Cyber-shot RX1. On the same day, the company shared news of its first full-frame HD video camera, the NEX-VG900, representing Sony's third imaging product line to pack the 35mm chip. Now, it looks like the Japanese electronics giant is fast approaching the industry's final frontier, with rumored plans to launch a full-frame mirrorless model in late 2013 or early 2014. Sony Alpha Rumors has reportedly confirmed the news with multiple sources, adding that the TBD model has reached the "final stage of development," and that a 24-megapixel and 30+ MP prototype are currently undergoing testing.

 The camera is expected to be slightly larger than the NEX-7, and should include a native E-mount, with A-mount lens compatibility (for full-frame shooting) to be offered as well. We've reached out to Sony for confirmation, but, considering that the rumored product is a year or so out, we don't expect a reply. Still, based on the company's recent announcements, a full-frame mirrorless ILC doesn't seem so far-fetched, and we can't think of a better manufacturer to take on such a project than Sony.
