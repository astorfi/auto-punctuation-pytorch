The striking white version of Sprint's most gargantuan (by diagonal screen size, anyway) smartphone has started to splash down into Best Buy stores across the nation a full five days early. If you'll recall, the white EVO 4G wasn't supposed to land in the hands of those who pre-ordered until July 11th, but we've received two independent confirmations that they are indeed arriving early in select locales. Stay close to your current phone -- you may be getting a pick-up call in the not-too-distant future.

Update: A tipster has just sent in a gallery's worth of unboxing shots -- looks like these are indeed being handed out early! Huzzah!
