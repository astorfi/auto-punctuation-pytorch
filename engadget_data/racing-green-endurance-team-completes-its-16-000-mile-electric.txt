Well, they made it. 26,000km later (that's 16,155 miles) the team has reached Ushuaia, Argentina, at the southern tip of South America and a long, long way from Anchorage. Traveling an average of 300km (186 miles) per day the team conquered desert, jungle, and torrential rain storms, conditions the purely electric and decidedly track-focused machine certainly wasn't meant for, but proving that an EV can be driven way beyond its maximum range -- if you don't mind taking nearly six months to do it.

[Thanks, Amanda]
