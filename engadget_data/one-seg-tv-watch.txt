In addition to picking up One-Seg terrestrial digital broadcasts, the TV Watch (available in three stylish colors) also doubles as a completely impractical cellphone once you pop in a Willcom W-SIM card. And, yes, the watch is as big as it looks, with its 2.4-inch screen pushing the dimensions to a beefy 2.3 x 3.5 x 0.88-inches, weighing in at just over four ounces. No word if/when these'll be available simply for purchase, or how much they'll set you back -- not that it'd be of much use to anyone outside of Japan, unless you've got a thing for oversized watches (which we obviously do).[Via Engadget Japanese]
