Since the previous models were only available in black (the absorption of all colors) and white (the reflection of all colors), these are technically the first Eees to feature color -- fancy blush pink, sky blue, and lush green. In stock and ready for delivery by that chubby man who's fond of children.[Via EeeUser, Thanks Neil]Read -- BlueRead -- GreenRead -- Pink
