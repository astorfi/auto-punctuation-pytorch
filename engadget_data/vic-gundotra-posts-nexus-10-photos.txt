So when photos from Senior Vice President of Engineering, Vic Gundotra, show up on his Google + with "Nexus 10" in the details, we pay attention. The pictures show some idyllic scenes from the beach, but what we're all interested in is the EXIF data. So, 2,046 by 1,536 you say? That's 3-megapixel by our calculations, which may not be the true original resolution of the image of course. With a big Google event just around the corner, though, we imagine we won't have to wait long to find out more.
