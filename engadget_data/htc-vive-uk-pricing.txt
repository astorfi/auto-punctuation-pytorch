At last, we have a UK price for the HTC Vive. We always knew that the VR headset would cost a little more than the Oculus Rift, given the difference in the pair's hardware. The bundled wand controllers and the external sensors for room mapping and location-tracking...it had to add up. But how much? Â£689.



If you do decide to pull the trigger, HTC says Google's Tilt Brush will also be included in the pre-order bundle. However, that'll only be available for a limited time. We hope you've been saving, because you'll be able to order from 3pm tomorrow, ahead of its release on April 5th.
