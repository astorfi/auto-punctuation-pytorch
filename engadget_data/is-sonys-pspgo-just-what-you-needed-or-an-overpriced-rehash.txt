We're guessing a similar word of mouth pace will operate in the inverse to communicate to top Sony brass that most folks think $250 for years-old gaming handheld hardware is a little steep these days. Of course, sequestered in our Engadget HQ and flush with cash from a hefty hit and run settlement a couple years back, we're more curious as to what you think about the price and feature set here. Don't be shy, just let it all out.%Poll-30708%
