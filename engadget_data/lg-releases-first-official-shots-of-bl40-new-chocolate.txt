The company has just released the first fully-revealed press photos of the phone that it's calling the "New Chocolate," an homage to one of the phones that brought it to the dominant industry position it enjoys today. So, is the BL40 going to help it continue that dominance? At a glance here, yeah, we'd say there's a pretty good chance.
