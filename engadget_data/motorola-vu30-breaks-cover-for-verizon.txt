It's not a groundbreaking design we're looking at here by any stretch of the imagination, but if Moto's looking at cremating and spreading the ashes of the RAZR look and feel once and for all, we think that's a pretty wise move on the long road to profitability. Not much else is known about the VU30 at the moment, so we'll keep a close eye on the situation.
