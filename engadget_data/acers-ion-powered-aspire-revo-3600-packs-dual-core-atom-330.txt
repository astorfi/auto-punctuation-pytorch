Design wise, everything is pretty much the same as on the original AspireRevo, with the major differences coming on the inside. Rather than packing a paltry 1.6GHz Atom 230, Acer has outfitted this bugger with a dual-core Atom 330, NVIDIA's Ion graphics technology, 4GB of DDR2 RAM, an HDMI socket and VESA mount compatibility. There's no word on an expected price, release date or OS, but we're hoping to get our mitts on the unit itself as well as those missing details when Berlin opens its doors to tech lovers across the globe here in just a few hours.
