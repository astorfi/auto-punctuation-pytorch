It's been a little over two weeks since Google unveiled Ice Cream Sandwich along with its first ambassador, the Galaxy Nexus. Since then, a few manufacturers have shared their intent to bring Android 4.0 to specific devices. HTC was initially rather vague about its upgrade plans -- no doubt faced with the daunting task of keeping Sense relevant in light of ICS' vast design improvements -- but tonight the Taiwanese giant issued an official statement on Facebook outlining specifics on its Ice Cream Sandwich upgrades. Basically, it looks like most (if not all) of HTC's high-end phones since the introduction of the Sensation will be getting a taste of Google's latest tasty treat early next year, including the recently announced Rezound. Here's the full statement:


		HTC knows how excited our fans are to get their hands on Google's latest version of Android, Ice Cream Sandwich, so we're thrilled today to announce the first wave of HTC phones that will receive upgrades: We can confirm the brand new HTC Vivid is upgradeable to Ice Cream Sandwich. In addition, Ice Cream Sandwich is coming in early 2012 to a variety of devices including the HTC Sensation, HTC Sensation XL and HTC Sensation XE, as well as the HTC Rezound, HTC EVO 3D, HTC EVO Design 4G and HTC Amaze 4G through close integration with our carrier partners. We're continuing to assess our product portfolio, so stay tuned for more updates on device upgrades, timing and other details about HTC and Ice Cream Sandwich.
