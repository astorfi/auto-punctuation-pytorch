Firefox OS won't be confined to small devices for much longer. Panasonic has announced a partnership with Mozilla that will see it launch Firefox OS-powered smart TVs and other "smart screens." The deal potentially opens up the frequently proprietary world of TV software -- since the program guide and other interface elements will be web pages, they won't be limited to any one company's hardware. It should also be easier to write remote control apps, personalize the interface and integrate TVs with home automation systems. Panasonic isn't going into more detail about the hardware at this stage, but it tells us that the first Firefox OS TVs should arrive in the "latter part" of this year.
