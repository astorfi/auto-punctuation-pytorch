At the high end,the 910 comes with maps of Europe, the US and Canada preinstalled, no doubt for those drives from Alaska to Russiaacross the Behring Strait. It also includes text-to-speech functions and a built-in MP3 player. All three new modelscome with a 4-inch widescreen touchscreen display, a dock for quick connections to a computer and an optional trafficinfo receiver. All models will be available in April; pricing has yet to be announced. Oh, and Steve, it'll work withyour iPod.[Via PocketInfo.nl]
