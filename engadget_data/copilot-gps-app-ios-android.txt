  ALK (that's the company behind CoPilot Live) is no stranger to GPS apps, but it's starting afresh this week with a new application offering more features for free. CoPilot GPS, which will be available on iOS and Android, goes the way of Nokia Maps in that it stores all those millions of points of interests offline, so you don't need an Internet connection to calculate directions. Download the free version and you'll also get some requisite social networking integration, walking and driving directions, the ability to choose from up to three routes and built-in Bing and Wikipedia search functionality. The app also matches Google Maps with voice-guided, turn-by-turn navigation and 3D maps, but you'll have to shell out $19.99 as a one-time in-app payment for the privilege. Real-time traffic updates are also an option, but that'll cost you an additional $9.99 for a 12-month subscription. According to ALK, the app will be available for iOS and Android in early to mid March, but in the meantime we've got a handful of screens below to give you a taste of what to expect.
