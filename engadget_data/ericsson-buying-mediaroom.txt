 It's not been a great few years for Ericsson, but the company is looking to cheer itself up by bidding for one of Microsoft's cast-offs. According to Bloomberg's usual cabal of persons familiar with the matter, the beleaguered networking giant is gunning for Redmond's MediaRoom IPTV Unit. As Microsoft's home entertainment ambitions now center around the Xbox, MediaRoom, which powers AT&T's U-Verse, is deemed surplus to requirements. Spokespeople for both companies declined to comment, but we're left wondering whatever happened to Microsoft's grand plans for Project Orapa (sic).
