 We've always been totally enamored of the idea of white space wireless transmissions -- using gaps in the broadcast spectrum reserved for TV to transmit broadband-speed data -- but the sad reality is that despite backing from heavy hitters like Google and Microsoft, the idea's never really gotten off the ground. Fierce opposition from NAB and non-working devices aside, however, the White Spaces Coalition just isn't ready to give up: it's just launched the more consumer-focused Wireless Innovation Alliance, which, as far as we can tell, is basically the same pitch with a much snazzier website. While we'd love to see a groundswell of consumer support help get this tech off the ground, we'd say that best marketing would be for a working device to make an appearance, no?
