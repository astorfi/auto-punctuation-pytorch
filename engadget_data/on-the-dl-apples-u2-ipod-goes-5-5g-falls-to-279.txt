Apple has finally got around to bringing the long-standing "special edition" 'Pod to 5.5G specs, as it now sports the "brighter display," extended battery life, and a new model number (MA664LL/A) to boot. Aside from getting the 5.5G goodies (and a coupon for an "exclusive" half hour U2 video download), the real news is the price drop; while the engraved signatures of Bono and friends (and that blaze red click wheel) still demand a premium, the coinage required to pick up a 30GB U2 iPod sank from $329 to $279 -- a whole $50 -- to fall more in line with its standard $249 sibling. For a second there, we just figured the U2-branded 'Pod was stuck in a moment it couldn't get out of.[Via iLounge]
