 Kodak has been offloading many of its signature businesses, and we're seeing a another symbolic changing of the guard today: after deciding to quit digital cameras last year, the company is licensing rights to make Kodak-branded cameras to JK Imaging, a subsidiary of global supplier JA Capital Holdings. No, we're not expecting those names to be immediately recognizable, although the Kodak-badged cameras, pocket camcorders and projectors that should result from the deal will be familiar enough. While it's unfortunate that any future Kodak cameras won't come straight from the original source, we won't judge just yet -- after all, similar deals have led to  surprising new directions for some of Kodak's competitors.

JK Imaging plans to launch its first products in the second quarter of 2013.
  "Kodak remains a strong and trustworthy brand in the consumer space and this agreement reinforces how valuable our brand is," said Laura Quatela, President of Kodak and Personalized Imaging.

  JK Imaging's CEO, Joe Atick, is chairman of JA Capital Holdings, a global supplier specializing in consumer imaging and electronics products. Atick said, "Our decision to license the globally-recognized Kodak brand from Eastman Kodak Company was a natural fit.
