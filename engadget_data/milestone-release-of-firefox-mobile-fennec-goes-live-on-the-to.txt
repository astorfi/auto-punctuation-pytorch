The mobile version of Firefox is still very early on in its development process, but an official pre-beta release is now ready for download -- so if you can put down IE Mobile for just a couple second, have a go at it. Odds are you won't be using it for your day-in and day-out browsing just yet, but it's nice to see what's coming down the pike.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
