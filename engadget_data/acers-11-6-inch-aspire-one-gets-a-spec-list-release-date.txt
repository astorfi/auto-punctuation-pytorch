Now officially dubbed the Aspire One 751, the netbook packs an Atom Z520 processor (as opposed to the Z530 that was initially rumored), along with up to 2GB of RAM, built-in Bluetooth, your choice of three or six-cell batteries, optional 3G, and a 1366x768 resolution on that 11.6-inch display -- not to mention your choice of XP or Vista. Still no official word on a release 'round here, unfortunately, but it looks like it'll be hitting at least some parts of Europe later this month for just over $500.[Via Electronista]
