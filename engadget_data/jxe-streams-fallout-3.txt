When the Fallout 4 trailer dropped on the world last week, irradiating ravenous explorers anxious to return to the series' wastes with fresh hope, it drove something home: Fallout 3 was awesome. Has it really been seven years since Bethesda reimagined the post-apocalyptic satire as a modern, first-person adventure? Has it been so long since Liam Neeson raised us in a post-nuclear war underground vault? Most importantly: does it still hold up? In order to answer that final question, we're streaming Fallout 3 today at 3:30PM ET/12:30PM PT.



Tune into this post or Engadget.com/gaming to watch the whole shebang. Speaking of things that go bang, if you watch over at Twitch.tv/Joystiq you can help us decide in the chat whether or not to blow up the town of Megaton in the game!

[We're streaming a retail copy of Fallout 3 on Xbox 360 at 720p through an Elgato HD via OBS.]
