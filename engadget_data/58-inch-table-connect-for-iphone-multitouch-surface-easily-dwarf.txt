Put simply, this 58-inch multitouch surface accepts iPhone 4 connections via a 30-pin Dock Connector, and with a bit of magic, the table becomes your iPhone. The crew is currently wrapping up an alpha software release, and while a jailbroken iPhone is obviously necessary to get things going, the end result is bound to be impressive. Or at least hilarious. Here's hoping these eventually go on sale, but for now, feel free to hit the source link for one more shot and a slew of diagrams.

Update: That's right, what you see here is nothing more than a table. A regular, no-frills table. More than a year after we first reported on this big old fake, LOA design took to the stage at TED to show off how they duped the internet. If you care to see how they did it, feel free to hit up the video after the break.
