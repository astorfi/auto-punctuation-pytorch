In the hopes of eliminating blind-spots, Nissan already includes rear-view cameras on nearly every model sold and a
few (in Japan) also have side mounted cams. Now they are testing a system which incorporates these and front-mounted
cameras to project a bird's-eye-view of your auto and its surroundings right onto your dashboard display. Unless you
live in Fort Lauderdale, this system will simplify
big-city parking that suburban SUV slab and help prevent turning your young 'uns new
tricycle into mash.
