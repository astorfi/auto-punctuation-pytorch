The venerable brand from even before our audio-only days has churned out this new model for its 40th anniversary, and based on what we see, Infinity is not suffering from being "over the hill." The stops have been pulled out for the Prelude Forty, which sports exotic ceramic-metal composite construction across all the drivers, including the array of flat panel units on the front baffle. Coming in at heavy $6,000 each, you get your choice of black, cherry or rosewood finishes; but letting your dog in on audio fun with those 40kHz tweeters is priceless.
