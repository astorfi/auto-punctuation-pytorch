Like LG's Hom-Bot, first seen at CES in January, Samsung's latest Tango cleaner (model VC-RL87W) features an integrated video camera that lets PC, smartphone, and tablet owners treat the vacuum as a remote controlled surveillance camera when not sweeping the floors. The relatively quiet vac operates at 48dB and features a microphone and external lighting. Why? Why not, we say, assuming you can get past the KRW799,000 (about $711) price tag.
