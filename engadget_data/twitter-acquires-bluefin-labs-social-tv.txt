Costolo and Co. have just revealed their acquisition of Bluefin Labs, a firm that serves up stats to the likes of TV Networks and advertisers regarding talk about TV on social networks. Twitter says the acquisition will build onto its deal with Nielsen to develop social TV ratings, and that it will also help them create "innovative new ad products." Sure, Twitter hopes the purchase will make it some additional scratch through more ad opportunities, but it also plans to whip up experiences for users that combine its social network with watching TV. If you don't already chat about television shows on Twitter, expect the folks in San Francisco to encourage you to do so shortly.
