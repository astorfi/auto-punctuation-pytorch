Remember last year when TiVo really made it well known how they
were collecting aggregate usage statistics, and that Janet Jackson's "costume malfunction" was the most
instant-replayed moment in TiVo history? Well, this year's TiVo
Super Bowl stats are out, and you'll be
interested to know that the three most watched and replayed moments were the GoDaddy.com commercial (no surprise there,
you pervs), MVP-voting instructions, and that interception in the 4th quarter. The low point (pre-game excepted) seemed
to be after Paul McCartney finished Hey Jude (seriously, nothing can top Hey Jude, so we understand why everyone moved
on).
