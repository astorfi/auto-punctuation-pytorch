But, also for the equally soccer-related FIFA 15 bundle just announced. The bundle comes to Europe in September (25th). Who will be in your ultimate team? Peter Schmeichel -- legendary goal keeper -- on stage threw England a bone choosing Bobby Moore (from the 1966 winning squad). Still, you've got a few weeks to think who you might choose. Get at it.
