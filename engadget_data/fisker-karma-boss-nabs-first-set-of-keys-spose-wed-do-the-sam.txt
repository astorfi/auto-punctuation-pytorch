Nope, they'll be whisked straight into the silky pockets of Ray Lane, chairman of the board of directors at Fisker Automotive. Unless it's an entirely empty publicity stunt and he has to hand the keys right back, lucky Lane will be driving home this afternoon in a luxury EV with a 300-mile range and 125MPH top speed. The rest of us, however, will have to wait til October -- and cough up $95,900.
