The KIRF in question is the Xiaomi M1, a smartphone designed specifically for the MIUI custom Gingerbread ROM. It's sporting a 1.2GHz dual-core Qualcomm CPU, along with a four-inch, 854 x 480 Super LCD capacitive touchscreen display, and the usual assortment of Bluetooth, GPS, and WiFi. Users will find quadband GSM among the mix, but 3G support remains a mystery -- likewise for the RAM, internal storage, and battery capacity. Pricing is an unknown quantity too, although earlier reports suggest we'll see something in the range of RMB 1,600 (approximately $250). This potential KIRF'ers paradise is expected to ship between mid-August and early September in a variety of colors, which will be eclipsed only by the sweet smell of its unboxing.

Update: As it turns out, the M1 looks nothing like the render we'd seen. Hence, our dreams of this epic KIRF have been dashed, and the purported "real" image of this curious project is now 'splayed for all to see. Didn't get a chance to see the original render? Just follow the break, where you're able to dream of what could have been.
