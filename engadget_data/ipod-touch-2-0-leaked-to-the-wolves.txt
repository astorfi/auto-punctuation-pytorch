The 2.0 firmware is reportedly leaked (and thus cash-free) to those of you daring enough to try. We've been contacted by a dozen netizens who claim to confirm the authenticity. However, at least one tipster reports their iPod touch getting "bricked doing it from pc but mac restore worked fine." What's more, we can't find the file in Apple's XML. Still, most say it "works like a dream," installing goodies from the App Store without problems. While the original download source is now 404, we're sure you can figure out other ways of locating "iPod1,1_2.0_5A345_Restore.ipsw." Ready, go. One more pic after the break.Update: 2.0 for iPod touch now officially released. You can purchase now for $9.95... er, when the link starts working. [warning: iTunes link]Update 2: iPhone 2.0 now official as well. Looks like it's the same 5A347 build we all grabbed yesterday with a filename of iPhone1,1_2.0_5A347_Restore.ipsw -- the 1,1 looks new, though, so perhaps this version is a bit less cranky. Stay tuned.Update 3: And, it's gone again. Now iTunes is telling us that our 1.1.4 version is "the current version." Fun!Update 4: Well what do you know. 2.0 for iPhone is back up via iTunes. Is this a rollercoaster or what?Update 5: Looks like the activation servers are on the fritz, so if you updated your iPhone you can't activate it with 2.0 just yet, leaving you with a locked iPhone. Even more fun!Update 6: At least for us, activation is back up and running after iTunes sat in limbo for a good 30 minutes. So be patient, people. Looks like iTunes activation is working but is taking quite some time.[Thanks, Gerald D., Victoria R., and Sangadang]
