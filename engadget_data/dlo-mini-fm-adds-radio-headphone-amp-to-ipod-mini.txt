Since Apple steadfastly refuses to add an FM tuner to the iPod, it's fallen to third-party vendors to add them as
aftermarket accessories. And fortunately for iPod-toting radio lovers, vendors continue to make them better and more
versatile. As reported by iLounge, DLO's mini fm, due out later this year for under $50, snaps onto the top of an iPod
mini (including, we assume, the new flash minis due to be
announced next week), and draws its power from the mini's battery (no comment). It also includes a headphone amplifier,
which could be handy if you've ignored all the warnings and continue to listen to your iPod
on the subway.
