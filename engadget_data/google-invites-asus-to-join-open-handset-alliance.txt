 We're not sure if its recent spate of handset announcements had anything to do with it or not, but it looks like Google has now asked ASUS to join the Open Handset Alliance, an invitation that we're assuming ASUS expected to accept (or else we probably wouldn't be hearing about it). Apparently, Google is interested in working with ASUS due to its "brand recognition worldwide," although neither party seems to be making any sort of official comments just yet. Knowing ASUS, however, we're sure it'll find some way to work its Eee brand into the picture before all is said and done. Eee Phone, anyone?[Via VentureBeat, thanks Michael Y]
