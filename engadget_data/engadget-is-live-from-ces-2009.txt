It goes without saying that this is one of the most exciting events of the year for us, as CES presents an almost unyielding vista of new gadgetry to play with. We'll be covering all the news you could possibly hope for (and then some), including press conferences, keynote addresses, and lots and lots (and lots!) of hands-on encounters with every piece of new tech we can find. You can be sure we'll be updating the site minute-to-minute as the news flows in.You can view the news in the regular format that you're used to here on the front page, or you can head over to ces.engadget.com, where the stories are presented in shortened versions so you can see more of what's breaking. We've also reorganized the sidebar to the right to keep you informed on all the biggest stories, and there's a ticker on top of it that'll let you see what event is up next.So sit back, relax, and get ready for the craziest few days in consumer electronics you'll ever see. Don't say we didn't warn you!
