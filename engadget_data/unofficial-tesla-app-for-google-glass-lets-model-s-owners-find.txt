We may still be looking for excuses to wear Google Glass in the office, but the headset's peripheral display is becoming more and more appealing in the garage: someone just made a Tesla Model S Glass app. The simply named GlassTesla is an unofficial suite of headgear accessible controls for the electric sedan, allowing users to start and stop charging, check battery levels, remotely lock doors and monitor and adjust the vehicle's temperature controls. More features are on the way too -- Sahas Katta, the app's creator, told Engadget that he's working on voice control ("ok glass, unlock my car"), charge completion notification and real-time vehicle tracking. Not bad, if you happen to own both a Tesla Model S and Google Glass. All three of you can find the app at the source link below.
