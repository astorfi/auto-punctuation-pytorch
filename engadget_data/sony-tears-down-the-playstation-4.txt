Sony may not ship the PlayStation 4 to North American stores for days, but we already know what it looks like on the inside thanks to one of Sony's occasional in-house teardowns. In photos and a video for Wired, engineering lead Yashuhiro Ootori dissects a retail console down to its motherboard; he offers glimpses of the custom AMD processor, its companion chip (for standby mode) and a stealthy WiFi antenna. There are good looks at the cooling and storage systems, too. We suspect that there will be more thorough inspections once the PS4 is available -- this is partly a sales pitch, after all. Still, the early primer should be valuable for curious gamers.
