Now, according to Blooomberg, AT&T is proactively talking to a number of smaller rivals about selling some of its assets (namely, "spectrum and subscribers") in an effort to save the deal. While talks are described as "preliminary," AT&T has reportedly already reached out to MetroPCS, Leap Wireless, Dish Network, CenturyLink and even Sprint, although Bloomberg notes that any such sell-off may still not be enough to please the DOJ. As you might expect, all of those companies are remaining mum on the matter.
