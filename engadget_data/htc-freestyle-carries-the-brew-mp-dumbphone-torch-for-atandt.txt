It has a 3.2-inch capitative touchscreen, with a "Sense experience" UI that obviously riffs on HTC's Android efforts, but instead runs on top of Qualcomm's Brew MP platform. AT&T is classifying it as a "QMP" for "Quick Messaging Phone." The Freestyle will be out next month, and while there's no word on price, expect cheap.
