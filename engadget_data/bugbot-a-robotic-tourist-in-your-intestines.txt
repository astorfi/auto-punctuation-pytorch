There are already wireless pill cameras that can send
back images of your innards whilst on holiday there, and separately developed
pills containing robots that aim to take up hiking in
your gizzard. Now scientists at Carnegie Mellon University are working on a robotic camera that combines those two
tastes that taste great together. It'll still be another couple of years in development, but the prototype is an 800nm
six-legged robot capable of inchworm-like intestinal locomotion (Kylie Minogue would be proud), small enough to be
attached to the pill camera already available. Doctors
would be able to then control the movements of the camera once ingested, enabling a much finer degree of photographic
control inside the patient. Very cool, though we don't need to get all Innerspace, ourselves â€” we'd be happy to settle
for something we could drop behind the couch that could tell us where our
Treo stylus has rolled off to.
