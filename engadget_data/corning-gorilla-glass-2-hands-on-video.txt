We got the chance to test out the latest Gorilla Glass 2 during a demonstration at Pepcom this evening, and found out that the company's fresh glass is about 20 percent stronger than its predecessor. In fact, it didn't even crack under 120 pounds of pressure, which is like, a third of what we bench. Do yourself a solid and check out the gallery below, followed by the olympic video, after the break.
