As you can see above, that'll get you a 60GB hard drive, a wired headset, and a gold Xbox Live membership good for three months. Not exactly everyone, but it'll no doubt be an attractive option to those that bought a Core or Arcade and suddenly found themselves having second thoughts about going sans hard drive.[Via Slash Gear]
