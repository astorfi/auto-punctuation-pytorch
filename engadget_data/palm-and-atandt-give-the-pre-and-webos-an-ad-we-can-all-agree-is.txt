Hey, hey, look at this! A short, sweet Palm Pre Plus ad that shows off the phone's innovative UI, its ability to multitask, and its 3D gaming -- you know, all the great stuff it can do. This is just what pretty much everyone who's ever had the misfortune of seeing the creepy Palm lady or the Verizon "Mom" ads has been desperately seeking. Sure, it's taken a over a year for a half-decent ad, and sure, we've only seen this one on the web thus far, but we're hoping to see this one make it to real, live TV, too -- because even if it's a little boring and the music kinda stinks, it's better than the other options.
