It won't downgrade your baseband, meaning so far you can't re-unlock an iPhone that's been 1.1.1-ified, but it's still 1.0.2 in all its third-party application glory.

There's a video tutorial after the break.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]Read - iPhone Dev Wiki instructionsRead - Hackint0sh thread where the magic happened
