 While we wait for the commercialization of those crazy-flat, high-contrast OLED televisions from Sony, Sharp and now Hitachi are trying to tempt us with super-thin LCDs of their own. Either way, we're good. Hitachi's 19-mm (0.74-inch) thin 32-inch LCD television was just announced but won't be revealed until CEATEC Japan 2007 gets underway. Not bad... not a scant 3-mm OLED mind you, but not bad. CEATEC kicks off on Tuesday so be sure to check back then for pictures and specs.
