Apple isn't colluding with the NSA to hand over user data and CEO Tim Cook wants you to know that. In fact, Cook feels so strongly about this issue of security that he's gone on record saying the government would need "to cart [Apple's employees] out in a box" to get access to its servers. That choice soundbite comes from a sitdown interview, airing tonight on ABC, during which Cook elaborates on what he sees as public misperception stemming from the recent NSA scandal. To counter that, Cook said he's been "pushing very, very hard" for more transparency into Apple's internal practices, a move he hopes would help to set the record straight with the general public.


Cook is also expected to touch upon other topics outside of the NSA breach, like the company's heavily-anticipated plunge into wearables, and the measures Apple takes to maintain secrecy surrounding its product roadmap. You can watch the teaser clip from the full interview with Cook just after break.
