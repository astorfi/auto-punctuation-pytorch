Regardless of your mixed emotions regarding the impending iCloud service, that's just a third (based on rough calculations) of what Steve Jobs will talk about on Monday, when WWDC 2011 kicks off in San Francisco. iOS 5 and OS X Lion will also be major topics of conversation, and while we've no evidence that new hardware will be kicking around backstage, we've got history at our backs giving us a sliver of hope. Naturally, we'll be there kicking out the facts as they happen, and you're encouraged to join us at this very link.
