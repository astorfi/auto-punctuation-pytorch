Then check this out, the official Lego Play and Build Remote for Nintendo Wii. Of course, only bits of the remote are suitable for Lego brick you silly silly man, otherwise it wouldn't be compatible with standard chargers and attachments like the battery cover and Wii MotionPlus. Still, if you can imagine playing Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga using nothing but The Force and this controller then you're already half way home to living the dream -- a journey you can complete on October 16th for $39.99.
