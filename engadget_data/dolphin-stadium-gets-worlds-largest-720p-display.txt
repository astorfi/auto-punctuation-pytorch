But in the case of the newly unveiled display at Miami's DolphinStadium, we may just have to hand it to them: the 720p display is a whopping 137 feet wide by 50 feet high, makingits diagonal dimensions 1,750 inches. So, when stadium officials boast that it's the world's largest HD display, wereally don't think we can argue with them (though we do take issue with their removal of the "s" -- butthat's another story). Sort of makes those 103-incherswe were just drooling over seem kind of tiny. Then again, we're not quite sure where we could put a 1,750-incher if weactually had a chance to get one for ourselves, so a 103 will do us just fine, thanks.
