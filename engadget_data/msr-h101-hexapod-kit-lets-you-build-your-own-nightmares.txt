In addition to being excessively creepy (just check out the video after the break), the MSR-101 Hexapod also looks to be relatively simple to get going straight out of the box, with it boasting a built-in HexEngine with plenty of pre-loaded settings, and built-in PS2 controller suppport, which'll let you parade your creation about without having to mess around with it too much beforehand. Of course, there's also plenty of room for more experienced robot builders to get their hands dirty, and Micromagic is more than happy to sell you a whole slew of optional add-ons for the kit. Those just looking to get started, however, can simply grab the base kit in their choice of black, red, or silver for an entirely reasonable â‚¬105, or roughly $168 -- just don't blame us if you never get a good night's sleep again.[Thanks, David]Update: It turns out that you do need slightly more than the base kit to get the bot up and walking -- namely, some extra servos and electronics detailed at the read link below -- so don't be too hasty with that order.
