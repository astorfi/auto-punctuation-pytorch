 It seems that Microsoft's new $179 price tag for its Xbox 360 HD DVD player just wasn't low enough for Best Buy, as the retailer is now offering the drive for the low, low price of $149.99. Of course, it's currently sold out, and it's not clear if this is a permanent price, a pricing mistake, or a one time sale (although it's not advertised as such). As far as we can tell, Best Buy appears to be the only retailer to offer the further discounted price, though we'll certainly keep an eye out to see if others follow suit.[Thanks, Alex]Update: Fun's over -- the price is now back to $179 on Best Buy's website. In related news, however, Joystiq has turned up some evidence of a new 360 bundle apparently set to be released on August 12th for $399, which seems likely to include Top Spin 2 as a pack-in.
