As with other TSA-friendly bags, this one packs separate, easily-accessible compartments for your laptop and accessories, and it'll accommodate laptops up to 15.4-inch in size. At just $60 it's also a good deal cheaper than something like the $220 Tom Bihn laptop bag or Skooba's long-promised Checkthrough bag which, coincidentally, is now finally shipping as well and will set you back $140.[Via Engadget Spanish]Read - Belkin FlyThru laptop caseRead - Skooba Checkthrough
