Six months on there can be no doubt, with the tablet selling 4.5 million units in its first quarter of availability according to CNBC. The truly magical iPhone? That managed a (relatively) paltry one million units in the same timeframe after launch, while the now ubiquitous DVD player pushed just 350,000 in its three four months of availability. You know what that means: it's time for analysts to start breaking out the hyperboles -- again. Colin McGranahan from Bernstein Research says "the iPad is a runaway success of unprecedented proportion," meanwhile Pete Najarian from TradeMonster.com calls it a "total media device" and concludes "there's not much a PC can do that you can't do on an iPad." That last bit is certainly debatable, and you know exactly where you can debate it. Just keep it respectful, yeah?
