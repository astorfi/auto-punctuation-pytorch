There are about 30 HD channels listed total although so far users report only being able to see a few of them. A wide rollout of the Motorola boxes should follow soon as well as the rest of the channels, however viewers will still be limited to viewing one HD channel at a time, per household. AT&T still anticipates offering a second HD stream over its FTTN service with future upgrades. They didn't make the October 25th release date anticipated but it's here and so far, users report excellent picture quality. Hopefully AT&T works out a second stream without going all HDLite on us.
