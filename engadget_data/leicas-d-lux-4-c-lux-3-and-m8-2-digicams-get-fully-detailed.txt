First up is the C-LUX 3, a pocket-friendly shooter that packs a 10-megapixel sensor, 25 to 125-millimeter 5x optical zoom lens, all-metal chassis, optical image stabilization, face detection and a 2.5-inch LCD monitor. Movin' on up, we've got the 10.1-megapixel D-LUX 4, which adds in the ability to extend its zoom range of 24 to 60-millimeters via lens adapters, and a choice of either an additional flash or a 24-millimeter optical viewfinder. Last up is the highly anticipated â‚¬4,400 ($6,236) M8.2, which keeps the 10.3-megapixel sensor but adds in a metal blade focal plane shutter, scratch-resistant sapphire crystal coverglass for the LCD, a new "snapshot mode," redesigned bright frame lines in viewfinder and a Quick Override setting. Pricing for the earlier two is still undisclosed, though they should be available in shops this October / November, respectively.Read - C-LUX 3Read - D-LUX 4Read - M8.2
