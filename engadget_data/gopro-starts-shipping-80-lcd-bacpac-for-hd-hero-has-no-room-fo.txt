Contour is working on a viewfinder app for iOS and Android devices that will wirelessly stream video, but that's not out yet. GoPro's LCD BacPac, on the other hand, is shipping today. We spent a little quality time with one at CES, a tiny screen that clips on the back of a 1080p HD Hero and lets you see what's being filmed and also play back what you've captured earlier. As you can see it adds about a quarter-inch of depth onto the camera but comes with a replacement back door to retain compatibility with all mounts. It's shipping now for $80, making it a somewhat expensive accessory for a $300 camera.

"At the core, we've kept the HD HERO camera as small and light as possible, cutting out everything that isn't required for capturing incredible HD content. Our wide angle lens allows for the omission of an LCD screen for most uses, but of course there are times when an LCD screen comes in handy.

This is the first of many expansion BacPacs to come, and one more step towards establishing the HD HERO as one of the most versatile cameras in the world."Included with the new LCD BacPac are four new housing backdoors that can be attached to both the existing HD HERO waterproof housing as well as the HD Wrist housing which enables the HD HERO to be worn on the wrist.
