 Both sides have announced, built, and even begun selling their devices-- if you don't think the next gen optical war between HD DVD and Blu-ray for the high definition living room hasn'talready begun, well, you're probably not a regular here. But just in case there was any hope that these twofactions would cometogether and truce before too late turned into too too late, well, sorry, consider those hopes dashed;according to Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga (pictured right heading to work) regarding unifying with HD DVD, "We arenot talking and we will not talk," and that "the market will decide the winner." Just like that. You hearthat Toshiba? Bring it on, they say. Man, we can't wait to start reporting all the flaming-bag-on-doorstep incidentsthat are so going to occur between Blu-ray and HD DVD executives.
