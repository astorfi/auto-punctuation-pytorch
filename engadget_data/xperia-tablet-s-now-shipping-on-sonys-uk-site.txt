Available now on the Japanese electronics giant's UK site (sorry, statesiders), the newly outed Tablet S is ready to ship in three configurations: 16GB / 32GB WiFi-only models that'll set you back £329 and £379 (about $523 and $602), respectively and a lone 16GB 3G variant that goes for £429 (about $682). For the money, you're getting a quad-core Tegra 3 slate clocked at 1.3GHz, a 1280 x 800 WXGA display, Ice Cream Sandwich and the company's signature hardware styling. Of course, if you're outside of the Euro zone and can't wait for pre-orders to be fulfilled, there's no harm in making this your next import. Hit up the source below to check out the goods for yourself.
