Not a direct, brutal strike by any means, but it seems like there may have been a bit of an exchange before this sucker's announcement. Anyway, yeah, Samsung's i780 is all official now -- which we now know has absolutely no relation to the BlackJack2 for AT&T -- and while it may not be taking earning any points for sheer beauty, it makes up for the indiscretion with sheer braun. You get Windows Mobile 6 Professional (yes, Professional, not Standard), assisted GPS, a 2.6 inch 320 x 320 display, 256MB of ROM and 128MB of RAM, WiFi, and that crazy optical touchpad that lets you navigate via mouse pointer. Sadly, the triband GSM and single-band 3G are going to keep this one well off US shores, but then again, keep in mind that the i600 spawned the i607 BlackJack back in the day -- so stay positive, folks.[Via Pocket PC Thoughts]
