So should Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain's threats stress you out, know that a safe(r) state of being is just a chicken hat away.

Phantom Pain director Hideo Kojima took to a holiday livestream to introduce the headgear seen above, which Kotaku explains will be offered to players that are repeatedly caught or killed. Once equipped, the chicken hat will make enemies notice Snake a bit more slowly (and make story moments more ridiculous, as it will be perched atop Snake's head during cutscenes).

We don't have an idea of when exactly we'll be able to sneak through The Phantom Pain in style, but at least we have an idea of what to expect based on an extensive chunk of gameplay Kojima demonstrated last year.
