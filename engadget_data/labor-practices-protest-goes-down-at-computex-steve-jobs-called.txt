A good two dozen protesters were out in force today, with loads of police and TV cameras giving the world a look at how these folks feel about Apple CEO Steve Jobs and Wintek's CEO in particular. As for Jobs, he was being labeled an "OEM profit bloodsucker" and "the man behind irresponsible contractors," while a slew of others were deemed "production line killers, number one union butchers, representatives of mass layoffs and kings of chemical killing." We also spotted instances of "tired to death" and "suicide overtime work," neither of which are particularly rosy. Hit the gallery below for more of the mayhem.
