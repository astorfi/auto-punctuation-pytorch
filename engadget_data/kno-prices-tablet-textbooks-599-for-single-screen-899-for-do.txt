The company says its flagship tablet textbook is still on track for release by the end of this year -- with limited available, at least -- tagged at $899 for the original double-screen model and $599 for the single-screener. Speaking to All Things D, CEO Osman Rashid estimates first-run production "in the thousands" and also claims ten as-of-now unnamed universities will be the first targets for the device. Less than eight weeks to go -- just worry about getting through fall semester finals for now.
