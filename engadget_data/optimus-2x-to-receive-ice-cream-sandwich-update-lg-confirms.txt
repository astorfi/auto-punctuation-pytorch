LG has just confirmed via Facebook that it the latest Android OS is indeed coming to the 2X and other "high-end smartphones," effectively debunking rumors to the contrary. Unfortunately, however, the manufacturer isn't quite ready to offer a release date, but promises that "detailed information" is on the way. As always, we'll keep you abreast of the latest.
