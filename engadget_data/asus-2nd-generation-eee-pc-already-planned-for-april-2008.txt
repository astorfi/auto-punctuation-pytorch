 It's all a bit silly at this point, but ASUS says that they'll be introducing their 2nd generation Eee PC in April 2008. Right, even though their first generation Eee PC has yet to launch. The new Eee PCc (hey, why not?) will sport Intel's Merom-class processor and other improvements that would allow it to lower power consumption from 11W to 7W while potentially allowing Asus to eliminate the fan entirely. Silent-running with longer battery in a $200ish ultra-portable? Yeah, you've got our attention.
