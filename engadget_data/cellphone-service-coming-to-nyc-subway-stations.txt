Of all the places we'd like better cellphone service,
the New York subway system ranks pretty high on the list. It's not that we want to hold conversations down in that
endless maze of tunnels; somehow, we don't think we'd be able to hear much over the endless din of inscrutable service
announcements, Central American musicians and random insane screamers. But the idea of being able to send text messages
or catch up on news during those interminable waits is very appealing â€” especially if when our train is delayed
and we need to fill in our peeps. So, it's good to know New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority is requesting
proposals from cellphone providers for exclusive rights to wire the city's stations and platforms (no service is
planned in the tunnels or trains themselves). Verizon, Cingular, Sprint and T-Mobile are all considering bidding on the
contract which could be worth as much as $100 million over 10 years. The winning bidder would have to open their subway
net to other providers, but could charge roaming fees. We've gotten used to not paying those, but we just might be
willing to hand over a few cents per connection just to be able to check our mail while we're down in the tube station
at midnight.
