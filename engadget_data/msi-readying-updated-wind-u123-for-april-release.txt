While much will apparently remain unchanged form the U120, the U123 does get a bit of a boost from Intel's new Atom N280 processor, which has already found its way into ASUS' Eee PC 1000HE, and from a maximum 2GB of RAM, as opposed to 1GB on the U120. You'll also be able to get it in your choice of four colors, and with a six or nine cell battery if you choose. What's more, MSI's director of US sales reportedly confirmed that the company has both 11.6-inch and 12-inch netbooks "in development," and that it "can bring that out of the gate," although he unfortunately didn't go any farther than that somewhat cryptic statement."
