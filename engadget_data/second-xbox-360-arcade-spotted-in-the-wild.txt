New details include a Harry Potter / Lego Star Wars back, along with details on included games -- we can make out Uno, Pac-Man, Luxor 2, and two other indistinguishable logos. The closeness of the two spottings indicates that this early leak is the fault of whoever put a pallet on a truck without marking it with the correct ship date. In that case, don't expect an early announcement from Microsoft.[Thanks, Emanuel E.]
