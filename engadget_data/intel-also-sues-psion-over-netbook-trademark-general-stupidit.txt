Important stuff seeing as how Intel is credited with (re)introducing the term in its modern meaning back in March 08. Granted, it took awhile for the name to catch on (we asked you to name the emerging laptop category in May) but ultimately stuck with the deluge of Atom-based ultra-portables launched at the Computex show in June of 2008. Unsurprisingly, Intel's position essentially mirrors that of Dell although it was Intel that actually filed its lawsuit first: 1) the public already uses the term in a generic manner, and (2) Psion's Netbook has been out of production since 2003 with no intent of being reintroduced into the market. Stupid is as stupid does, right Psion?[Via Electronista] Read -- Intel sues Psion Read -- Intel's "Thoughts on Netbooks" (March 03, 2008)
