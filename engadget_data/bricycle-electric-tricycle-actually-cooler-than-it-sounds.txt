Designed to transport one person as efficiently as possible, the Bricyle (developed by someone named Brian -- clever) isn't completed yet, but it's got a 48-volt electric-assist motor for when you get tired of pedaling through the 21 bicycle gears, and disc brakes for quick stops. Sure, but can you get it in a color besides electric cucumber?
