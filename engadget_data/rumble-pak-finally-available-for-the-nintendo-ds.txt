 Even though it's been almost a full year since we first learned of its existence, we're sure gamers will stillwelcome the Nintendo DS Rumble Pakwith open arms, because as well all know, gamin' just ain't gamin' unless the controller is buzzing and vibrating inyour hands. Compatible with such games as Metroid Prime Hunters and Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time, the Rumble Pakfits neatly into the DS' Gameboy Advance cartridge slot, and can be yours for the low low price of only $10 direct fromNintendo. Or, if you're in the mood to help out the Japanese Chinese economy a bit, and don't mind 150%markups, Lik-Sang is offering the same product for $25.[Via DS Fanboy]
