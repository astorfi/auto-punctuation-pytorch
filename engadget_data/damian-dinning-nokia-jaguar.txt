 The sudden departure of Nokia imaging head Damian Dinning caught many by surprise earlier today, but now he's announced where his next post will be: Jaguar Land Rover. In a statement posted at PureView Club, he explained that other than photography, cars are another lifelong passion and at Jaguar he'll be "driving future innovations in the exciting new field of Connected Car." His family also seems to have played a significant role, since while Nokia is concentrating many of its "strategic roles" in Finland, he desired to remain in the UK. He also sought to calm the nerves of fans of Nokia's camera tech, noting there was a team behind the division's success, not just one person.
