That's a question that the engineers at V-Moda have found themselves centered on the past few months, and now they've got a solution: the Crossfade LP Customs. They're half gimmick, half hilarious, and 100 percent awesome. $199.99 nets you a customized set of cans, with seven plate colors to choose from and the option to add up to 11 characters of text. You know -- plenty of room for "BEATZ BY ME." Get at 'em in the source link below, but be prepared to wait two to three weeks for delivery. What, you expecting VIP treatment or something?
