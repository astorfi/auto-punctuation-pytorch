 We saw the productivity-increasing feature make its way to Sprint's Galaxy Note II not too long ago, and it looks like it will soon show up on T-Mobile's model as well. According to a support document on the Magenta carrier's website, Samsung's Multi-Window trait is due to hit the 5.5-inch, S-Pen-toting device on December 19th, via an upcoming software update. The aforementioned T-Mobile page doesn't list any other major changes (save for some fixes to issues with Exchange and Gmail), but the addition of the Multi-Window feature alone could certainly make it worthwhile for owners of most everyone's favorite phablet.
