When we first saw the BW1 golf cart hovercraft, it's fair to say we were excited. But now -- if you've got burdensome disposable income -- you can buy one for yourself. If you're willing to drop the requisite $58,000, you can cruise the fairway (not to mention the rough and water obstacles) in a BW1 of your very own. It comes complete with a 65-hp twin-cylinder Hirth engine and a streamlined, sound minimizing fan that promises enough power to reach 45 mph and ferry two golfers plus caddies between holes. So, it may not be for those still improving their technique, but for the swinger that's got everything, it's the perfect ride for your trip to the floating golf course.
