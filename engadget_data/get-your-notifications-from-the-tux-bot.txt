The $99 wireless version of everyone's favorite mascot will alert you to nearly anything you want via an adorable combination of wing-flapping, dancing, spinning, and light-flashing, and the open-source codebase means that there's already quite a library of plugins besides the usual email and RSS monitors. Tux snags info from his included (ridiculous) USB fish transmitter, but he can also function as a VOIP phone, wireless speaker, and alarm clock -- and motion sensors mean you're also getting a guard penguin in the deal.
