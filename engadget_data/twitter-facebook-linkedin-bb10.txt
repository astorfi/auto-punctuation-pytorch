 The four biggest smartphone applications in social -- Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Foursquare -- are headed to BlackBerry's latest software platform, BlackBerry 10, via BlackBerry World. Not exactly a surprise considering that somewhere in the ballpark of 70,000 apps are planned for BB 10 at launch, eh? The first three were demonstrated on-stage during today's BB 10 launch event, and were all shown as integrated with BB Hub (as partially revealed in a recent leak).
 We're also seeing Angry Birds Star Wars featured on BBW, but we expect to hear a lot more about applications any minute now.
