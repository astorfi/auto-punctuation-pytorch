The tablet is powered by a 1.66GHz Intel Atom Z530 processor, 2GB of RAM, and packs a 32GB SSD that boots Windows 7 Home Premium, though MSI has created a Wind Touch UI layer. While they were showing early prototypes, it will have two USB ports, an HDMI and a webcam when all is finalized. According to an MSI product manager on hand, the WindPad 100 will hit the market later this year for around $499. We just caught a few minutes with the tablet so hit the break for some early impressions and a short hands-on clip. 





The 10-inch tablet is made entirely of plastic -- it does feel quite cheap, but on the other hand it's incredibly light (it's only 1.7 pounds). The prototype they had out didn't have any of the final ports, but eventually it will have an HDMI jack that should be able to output 720p video to an HDTV. Our biggest concern about the tablet comes with the speed. We noticed it taking a few seconds for applications to launch, and the Wind Touch UI was incredibly sluggish. Speaking of the interface, it's just a basic skin on top of Windows and should provide easy access to applications. The 1024x600-resolution capacitive display did seem responsive, though we would have rather it had a higher resolution.
