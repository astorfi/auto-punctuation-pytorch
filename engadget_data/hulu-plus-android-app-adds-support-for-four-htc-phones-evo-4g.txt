Four HTC phones are on the list -- the Evo 4G, Thunderbolt, myTouch 4G and G2 -- bringing the total to ten models supported, featuring a mix of first and second gen Snapdragon chips clocked at varying speeds. Given shared architecture with some phones already on the list it's not clear why these had to wait, but Senior Product Manager Lonn Lee is quick to point out that the streaming video site isn't done yet. Even as it's on the auction block, there's at least some chance to pick up disgruntled Netflix subscribers and adding a few underserved handsets is as good a way as any to reach out.
