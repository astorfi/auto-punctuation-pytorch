Google's all-encompassing Photo Spheres are no longer limited to Android users and those comfy with photo stitching software -- the internet giant has just released a Photo Sphere Camera app for the iPhone-toting crowd. As before, it lets you create 360-degree panoramas just by spinning around in place. You can both share the resulting masterworks with others (including the Google Maps community) and check out others' spheres in the Views hub. It's overkill if you're perfectly content with alternative panoramic apps or plain old landscape shots, but it's hard to object to having one more way to liven up your vacation photos. Swing by the App Store to check out Photo Sphere for yourself.
