But, swimming freestyle is a little difficult when you're lugging around pounds of photographic equipment. Enter the Chobi Cam WP: a device that is about the same size as cigarette lighter and, when enclosed in its GoPro-style case, is waterproof to 20 meters. It can record VGA footage to microSD, take JPEG photos, and even capture mono audio -- which we figure will sound something like "gurgle gurgle gurgle." It's available today for 12,800 yen -- about $140, which is a bit dear if you ask us, so don't let it get washed away.
