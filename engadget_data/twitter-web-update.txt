Where one of Twitter's app designs goes, the rest will follow -- hot on the heels of its latest Android and iOS releases, the social network is rolling out a new web interface with a matching look.

Not everyone is seeing the new look at this stage, but we'd expect it to reach many of Twitter's web users in the near future.
