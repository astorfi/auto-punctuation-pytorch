start cramping the style of niche players like Alienware and Voodoo. You'd think that the market would be sorta
reaching the saturation point — there's only so many people in the world willing to shell out four grand for a laptop
just playing Half Life on it — but Falcon Systems thinks there's room for at least one more, and has just came out with
a laptop version of their FragBox gaming desktop called the FragBook. They are doing a few things to differentiate
themselves from the Alienwares of the world, and are offering the FragBook in any color you want — they'll custom paint
your laptop with any automotive finish you'd like (including adding any sort of artwork or logo you'd like onto it) —
and are throwing in a padded aluminum briefcase far carrying your laptop to LAN parties for free with every purchase.
Anyway, they're offering the FragBook in two versions, the FragBook TL, which has a 15-inch LCD screen and the FragBook
DR which features a 17-inch widescreen LCD.
