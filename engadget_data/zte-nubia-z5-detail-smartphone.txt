 Here's a closer look at the Chinese phone-maker's incoming premium smartphone, the ZTE Nubia Z5. While we're already expecting quad-core internals, a 13-megapixel camera and a 5-inch screen, it's nice to finally get a look at that Italian design broadly outlined by ZTE at the device's unveiling in October, even if they are a touch familiar. The company aims to have the device out in Asia next month, when we should hopefully have a full spec sheet and more details on what sort of software is hiding beneath that glossy white shell.
