As AllThingsD's John Paczkowski reports, Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek is now saying that Palm's still as yet unconfirmed launch on AT&T has been pushed back from its rumored April debut to June or July. What's more, Misek says that the delay isn't one of the usual variety, with AT&T reportedly citing a "long list of technical issues with the Pre and Pixi," and even going so far as to decrease its initial order size and "sharply reduce" its marketing budget for the launch. Of course, we are still taking about a rumored delay to an unconfirmed launch, but we should be hearing directly from Palm soon enough -- it's scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings after Thursday's closing bell.
