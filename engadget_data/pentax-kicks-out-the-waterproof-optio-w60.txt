The 10 megapixel shooter packs a 2.5-inch LCD, 5x optical zoom that doesn't ever extend out from the main camera body, 720p movie mode, ISO 6400 sensitivity and face, smile, and blink detection. Oh, and it works in depths up to 13 feet in temperatures of just 14 degrees Fahrenheit, and is JIS Class 5 certified against dust and sand. You know, just in case. Should be out in July for $329 in both blue and silver.
