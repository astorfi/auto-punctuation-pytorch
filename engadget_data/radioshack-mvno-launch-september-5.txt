 
 Evidence of a RadioShack-branded wireless carrier popped up just a few days ago, and now we have word from another tipster that reveals when it may launch. As seen above, the screen reveals a planned launch date of September 5th (a suddenly crowded day on the mobile calendar with the Nokia / Microsoft and Motorola / Verizon events, among others) to debut the Cricket Wireless-powered service, dubbed RadioShack No Contract Wireless. It has, as you may assume from the name, no contracts and claims an exclusive over other Cricket services by sliding an 8GB SD card in along with all Muve Music phones. If the information in the image holds true, we should have all of the details confirmed just three Wednesdays from now.  [Thanks, anonymous]
