A lot more live shots of the new N71, N80, and N92
additions to the Nokia N-Series over at PhoneScoop. And while you're enjoying your pr0n, consider this: as Phone Scoop
points out, two of the new 802.11g flauntin' 3G cellphones, the media-savvy N80 and
DVB-H enabled N92, also feature Universal Plug and Play
(UPnP) and streaming technology standardized by the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) â€” which is really sweet and
about damn time. See, UPnP works on any device with an IP address allowing it to automagically discover, interact, and
control other UPnP devices in, say, the digital living room. So imagine coming home and using your
10GB Samsung cellphone or
Apple iPhone to stream all your
videos, photos, and music over WiFi to your monster 13.1
channel sound system and 80-inch plasma. Now you
understand our buzz and frustration since there are so few
UPnP devices on the market today. Let's hope
2006 changes that. More pics after the break.


[Thanks, Eric]
