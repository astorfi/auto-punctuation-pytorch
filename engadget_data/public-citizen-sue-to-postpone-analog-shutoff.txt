 With only a few years and a few weeks to go till the analog shutoff the non-profit group Public Citizen is trying to strike down the law that set the date. While their motives are not known, they claim the law is unconstitutional because the same exact law didn't pass both the House and the Senate, but instead it was modified between the two. The sooner they shut off the analog the sooner the FCC can divy up all those frequencies, the government can get paid and hopefully we can see some new cool technologies as a result.
