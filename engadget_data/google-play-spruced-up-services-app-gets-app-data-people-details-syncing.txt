On the eve of Google I/O, Page and Co. have seen fit to polish the Google Play app with a fresh release. Version 4.1.6 of the mobile OS market brings colorful section buttons and improved spacing for "open" and "install" on application pages, along with a new layout for the wishlist feature that displays apps in rows of three. As for Google Play Services, it's received new syncing options for "App Data" and "People Details." Presumably they could relate to contacts, Google+ or even Mountain View's incoming gaming service, but something tells us we'll find out exactly what they do tomorrow. If your handset hasn't received the updated storefront just yet, follow the adjacent source link to install it by hand.
