For those who've stuck with the big names (you know, Corel / CyberLink), you may be considering making the switch -- after all, at least ArcSoft's TotalMedia Theatre still includes support for HD DVD (unlike some others). Reviewers over at Missing Remote were generally thrilled with the software's performance, noting that Vista Media Center integration was top notch and even the customer support was on par. All in all, it doesn't sound as if you could really go wrong with slapping this into your next HTPC, but check out the read link just to make sure.
