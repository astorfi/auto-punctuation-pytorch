The new VP series includes the 32-inch VP322 ($689), 42-inch VP422 ($999) / VP423 ($999), 50-inch VP503 ($1,399) / VP504F ($1,699) and the flagship 60-inch VP605F ($2,899). The latter two are Vizio's pride and joy of this bunch, as they both sport Silicon Optix HQV processing, 1080p resolution, an integrated ATSC / Clear-QAM tuner, 30,000:1 contrast ratio and four HDMI 1.3 inputs. The firm is also throwing out a pair of new "all-in-one" solutions (the VP500 / VP501) which include 50-inch sets along with 5.1 surround sound systems. For more details on the whole lot, be sure and give the read link some attention.
