The 4-inch sphere consists of eleven speakers, each covered with a "Weibull curve" diaphragm that expands and contracts (or vibrates), supposedly delivering a non-directional, natural sound field. According to Impress, JVC seems to be looking at a commercial launch sometime in the first half of 2007, though they don't appear to have given any indication of price. It's also not clear if it'll double as a Jedi training device or not -- we'll keep you informed on this latter bit, at the very least.Read - ImpressRead - JVC[Via Akihabara News]
