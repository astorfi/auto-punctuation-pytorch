According to the New York Times, Disney Interactive Media and YouTube have struck a deal that will bring original, kid-friendly content to a new co-branded online channel. Under the agreement, slated to be announced later today, the two parties will devote a combined $10 million to $15 million to video production, in the hopes of helping each other patch up some of their respective holes. From Disney's perspective, the deal could help attract more viewers, while funneling more users to its soon-to-be revamped website, which has seen a marked traffic decline in recent months. YouTube, meanwhile, could use the deal to help boost its reputation among parents, many of whom may have reservations about letting their youngsters loose on a site rife with unwholesome content. It may also signal a move toward those regularly scheduled channels we've been hearing so much about. We're still awaiting official confirmation on this, but we'll update this post as soon as we get it.
