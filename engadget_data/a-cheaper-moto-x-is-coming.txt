Thanks to a number of significant leaks, the Moto X was pretty much a known quantity even before it was officially unveiled; the major exception being the handset's pricing, which we now know is $199 on a two-year contract. Given its mid-range components, many had hoped the phone would sell for less, which was fueled in part by analysts targeting a price of $300 outright. Fortunately, if you're feeling miffed, there's good reason to turn your frown upside down. According to Motorola's CEO, Dennis Woodside, the company is keenly aware of the need for lower cost smartphones, especially within prepaid and emerging markets. In an interview with CNET, Woodside revealed that a less expensive handset is in the works, and curiously enough, it'll also carry the Moto X branding.


In Woodside's words, "We want everyone to have access to affordable smartphones." Further, "Moto X is the brand that we are most focused on... and there is more to come. You will see additional products within months." Whether the company can provide a low-cost option that's as compelling as the Lumia 620 or Nexus 4 remains to be seen, but you can rest easy in knowing that a cheaper Moto X is in the pipeline.
