For those unable to resist the urge to find out what life's like with an 18-inch entertainment notebook gracing their lap (and likely the lap of the guy one cube over), you can order this sucker up right now. Yep, the HDX 18t Premium series gets going at $1,549.99, but it won't take too many configuration tweaks to push that figure well over the $2k mark. Have fun![Via Laptoping]
