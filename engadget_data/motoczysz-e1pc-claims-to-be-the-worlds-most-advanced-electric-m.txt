As Popular Science discovered in an exclusive look at the bike, there seems to be little doubt about that fact -- for starters, the bike packs ten times the battery capacity of a Toyota Prius and two and half times the torque of a Ducati 119 motorcycle and, well, look at it. Other standout features include ten 19.5 pound lithium polymer batteries that don't have wires so they can be swapped out easily, an oil-cooled electric motor that's been "developed from the ground up to win races," and a top speed (so far) of 140 MPH -- nearly 40 MPH better than its nearest competitor. Most impressively, however, is the simple fact that the E1pc is indeed built for racing -- it'll take on the Isle of Man TT tomorrow, which is described as the "toughest motorcycle race in the world." Dare we say it might now also be the most electric?
