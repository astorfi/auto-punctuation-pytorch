 Black Friday's coming and you know what that means: time to move some units. For two days only starting November 23rd, Sony's knocking an additional $50 off existing PlayStation console bundles. Consumers with the wherewithal to withstand the shopping frenzy can snare the Ultimate PS3 Value Bundle (i.e. 250GB console, Uncharted Dual Pack, inFamous Collection and PS Plus trial) or one of three WiFi-only PS Vita deals (Assassin's Creed III: Liberation, Lego Batman 2 or Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified) at select retailers for $199. Of course, if M for Mature's not your bag, there's always the family-friendlier Wii U to consider.
