 Yes, we've been here before, but with Miramax back on its feet and under a new distribution deal with Lionsgate we're pretty sure these new October 4 release dates for Quentin Tarantino classics Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown on Blu-ray will stick. Reportedly, Jackie Brown will be a Walmart exclusive but other than that no details are known just yet. We'll keep our eyes out for official information, but for now you can check out the trailers again after the break.
