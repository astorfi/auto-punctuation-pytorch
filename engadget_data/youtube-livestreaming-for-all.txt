What's that, your YouTube channel has fewer than 100 subscribers, but you feel it's a travesty that you can't share your video opus as it happens? Well, start popping bottles: Google has begun rolling out live streaming capabilities to all of its verified users that are in good standing (hopefully that includes you!). Since releasing the feature more widely less than a year ago, the video giant has now given the option to all, putting even the lowliest accounts on equal footing with the site's heavy hitters. Don't start planning a live broadcast of your next quilting bee just yet, though: While the update starts today, YouTube said it'll be a few weeks before everyone gets access.
