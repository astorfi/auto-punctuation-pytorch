From the looks of things the keyboard is stationary, but with the relative height-to-width ratio (and last night's "Mini-Pre" rumor) we're thinking the keyboard and screen might be shrunk down slightly -- which, were we to conjecture further, could mean a webOS Centro. Or perhaps Palm's gone large and produced something entirely more delicious.
