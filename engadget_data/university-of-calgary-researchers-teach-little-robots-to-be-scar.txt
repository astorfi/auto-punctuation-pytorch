That's the idea (sort of) behind some research taking place at the University of Calgary, which relies on an OCZ Neural Impulse Actuator to monitor the stress levels of a real, live, human being. That stress level is then communicated to a poor, defenseless Roomba, which was taught get out of the way and look busy whenever the wearer got angry. It's a long way from the three laws and saving the human race as a whole and all that, but this could play a major part in preserving future human/robot relations -- at least in the living room.
