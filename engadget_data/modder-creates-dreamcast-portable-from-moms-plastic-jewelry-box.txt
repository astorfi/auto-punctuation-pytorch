This latest one certainly isn't the most elegant mod in the world -- in fact, it's a boxy Frankenstein that looks pretty uncomfortable and crampy after a long game session. That said, the clean, straight lines and generous 5-inch screen are an impressive step up from some rough versions we've seen elsewhere. Taking an entire Dreamcast's guts, adding an LCD screen, forging a portable power supply, and fitting it all in one portable box is no easy task -- so we salute you, modders. And we confess, we totally dig the brass hinges. Video after the break.
