The laptop features SLI NVIDIA graphics, Core 2 Duo processors, a Blu-ray optical drive, dual HDD up to 200GB per and up to 2GB of dual-channel DDR2 667MHz RAM. That 17-inch monitor features an eyesight bustin' 1920 x 1200 resolution, and should look nice with Vista, which will come pre-installed on the laptop. Alienware even tossed in a TV tuner and a full-size numeric keypad. No word on price or availability, but January 30th (Vista's out) seems a decent guess, and "a whole wad of cash" seems quite likely as well.
