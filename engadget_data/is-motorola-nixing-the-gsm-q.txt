So is it possible the GSM Q is actually being killed?Well, we spoke with Moto who let us know they absolutely consider the Q to be their new flagship device, and thatthey're proceeding with all possible haste to get it to market -- which means Verizon getting a permanent worldwideexclusive on the Q seems nigh impossible; we've also received at least one other confirmation that what Mobinauteprinted was erroneous. And if you take into account that we have on authority that the Q is actually skipping right upto UMTS/HSDPA, the GSM/EDGE Q's supposed cancellation may just be a case of some detail lost in translation to theresult of some severe speculation about a device not even officially announced anyway.[Thanks to everyonewho sent this in]
