Since there's no other information we'll lapse into wild rumor mode and say that it could be anything from a free with subscription flash-based model in a new form factor, to a simple tweak on the current model that dumps the DRM, adds support for useful WiFi, podcasts, and more codecs, and drops the price (we wish.) Let's just hope it's not anything as trivial as a new color: we'll see on Monday.[Via Cliczune]
