 We're not quitesure what you can use them for at this point (other than, maybe, as coasters for when you serve the good stuff), butTDK has begun shipping blank single-layer Blu-ray discs with a 25GB capacity. The discs are available in BD-R(recordable) and BD-RE (rewritable) formats, for $19.99 and $24.99, respectively. That's per disc. Yes, we were doingthe math in our heads as well: That's about 79 cents per GB for the BD-R, which does come out to a bit more than theroughly 10 cents (or less) per GB of budget DVD-Rs. But those prices are sure to come down by the time TDK beginsoffering these in 50-disc spindles later this year. (By then, TDK will also have dual-layer 50GB discs available, for$47.99 and $59.99.)Â  And maybe by then you'll actually be able to use these in some kind of drive.
