This bad boy connect your laptop to your HDTV via WiFi, streaming video and audio with to your heart's content. Apparently, you need a Core i3 or i5 laptop, and the adapter box will set you back $100. The first WiDi devices will go on sale at Best Buy starting January 17th. Full PC spec requirements listed after the break.
