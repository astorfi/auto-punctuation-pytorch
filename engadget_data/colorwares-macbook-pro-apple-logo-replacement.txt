Limited to a run of just a few units, Colorware's custom machined lid still lights up as your classic Mac might, but provides sweet freedom from the oppression of that white upside-down fruit. They've got ten or fewer laptops on hand built to order for a client at a price unbeknownst to us, so if you're looking to snag one you'd really better be prepared to pull some serious strings (and have the bankbook to prove your love).P.S. -Next stop: the real-deal Ceci n'est pas un MacBook Pro?
