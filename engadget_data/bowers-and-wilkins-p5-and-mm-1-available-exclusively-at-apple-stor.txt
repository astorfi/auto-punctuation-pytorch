On the off chance that you haven't gone and bought some Bose QuietComforts or Computer MusicMonitors in the meantime, both of the B&W products are finally available this week exclusively at Apple stores. We can't tell you what to do with your money -- though hopefully you've put some aside for your taxes -- but if you are in the market for top of the line noise-canceling isolating headphones the $299.95 P5s could be what you've been dreaming of. We were kindly lent a pair of the iPhone-compatible P5s and haven't taken the things off since we ripped open the box; made of New Zealand sheep leather and memory foam the ear pads could be the most comfortable things we've ever put on, not to mention the passive-noise isolating wipes out just the right amount of NYC Subway noise. Seriously, we're actually looking forward to taking a long airplane ride just to fall asleep with the glorious feeling leather on our ears. The $499.95 MM-1 hi-fi desktop speakers seems like a tougher sell to us, but if you are looking for a set with 1-inch Nautilus aluminum tweeters that sound incredibly full they are worth a try, or at least running out to an Apple store to test drive. Both will be available exclusively from Apple for the next month with B&W planning to open up distribution to other retailers shortly after. Sorry, we still have those P5s on, did you say something?
