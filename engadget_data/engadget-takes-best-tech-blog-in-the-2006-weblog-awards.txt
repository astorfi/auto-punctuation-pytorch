 
We got word tonight that the Weblog Awards posted their results for the 2006 vote, and it looks like Engadget is going home with the title for the third year in a row! Seriously, thanks a lot for the support everybody -- not only in this, but in keeping the Engadget community thriving and vibrant all year long. As in the last two years your humble tech news site went up against some extremely stiff competition, which is why we're all the more flattered you voted for us. So no need to send us a holiday card or a bottle of bubbly, we'll stuff this in our stocking and thank baby Jeebus that we actually have the privilege to do what we do for a living.
