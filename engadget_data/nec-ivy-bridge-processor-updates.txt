However, only two machines have been gifted Intel's third-generation processors. The ValueStar L desktop series arrives with a Core i7-3770S at 3.1GHz, accompanied by a 2TB HDD and a 23-inch display. The LaVie L series packs a Core i7-3770S clocked at 2.3GHz, alongside a 15.6-inch screen, 1TB hard-disk, USB 3.0 port and digital TV tuner -- well, it is Japan. NEC expects both models (alongside the renewed LaVie S, E, M and ValueStar W and N series) to hit Japanese stores later this month.
