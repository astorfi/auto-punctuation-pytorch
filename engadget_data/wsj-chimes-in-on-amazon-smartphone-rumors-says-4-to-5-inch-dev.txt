According to the always informative unnamed sources, testing of a phone is underway, and mass production could start late this year or early next year. There's still no revelations on what the software might be like or how the device could be sold, but the report does expand on Bloomberg's initial revelations from last week by narrowing the possible size down to between 4- and 5-inches. Of course, if the rumors are correct then we'll probably see a new Kindle Fire hit the streets first anyway, if it has any updated software to bring along then maybe we'll have a better idea of what an Amazon phone could look like.
