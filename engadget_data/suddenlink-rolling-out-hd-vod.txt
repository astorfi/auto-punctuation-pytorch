 Down in Lubbock, Texas -- which just so happened to get gifted with AT&T's U-verse a few days ago -- Suddenlink is attempting to stay competitive by rolling out HD VOD to its customers. It's unclear whether or not the rollout will affect more markets than this, but at least for those in the Lone Star state, you can expect lots of free SD material and "44 new high-definition [VOD] channels." As for costs, look to cough up between $0.99 and $3.99 for an SD film, while Hollywood titles in high-def will run $2.99 to $5.99. We appreciate this and all, but how's about some fresh HD channels while you're at it, Suddenlink?
