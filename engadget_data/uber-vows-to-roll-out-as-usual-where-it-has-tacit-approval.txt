 If you hadn't gathered, Uber's app-based taxi service isn't always welcome wherever it goes. The company is tired of that fighting just to maintain its business, so it's defining its expansion policies through a new white paper. Deployments will occur in regions where Uber sees "tacit approval" from regulators -- in other words, areas where there hasn't been direct legal action against competing services for at least 30 days. Just in case authorities change their minds, the company plans to go "above and beyond" commercial licensing requirements, including a $2 million insurance policy on trips and more stringent background tests. While Uber would much rather have explicit permission to operate as it sees fit, the strategy could have the firm venturing into territories where competitors with unlicensed drivers have (seemingly) free rein.
