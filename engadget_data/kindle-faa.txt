You just know Amazon's been waiting forever for this cheeky product discount. But heck, if it means not having to buy a $20 Dan Brown book before rushing to catch a flight, we'll take it. In celebration of the FAA easing its personal electronic device restrictions (not to mention Delta and JetBlue), the mega-retailer's offering a nice little discount on a trio of Kindles. Enter "ThnksFAA" during checkout and you'll get a discount on the Kindle Fire HD, HDX seven-inch and the entry-level Kindle e-reader -- sorry, no Paperwhite or Fire HDX 8.9 today, kids. Still, $59 for low-end Kindle seems like a perfectly reasonable way to celebrate the recent FAA decision.
