We did a nice heavy skimming of the material for you, and spec-wise, it's basically just the expected bump up to Montevina: an unspecified ULV Core 2 Duo on an 800MHz bus with integrated Intel GMA X4500 graphics, up to 5GB of DDR3 RAM and the same 12.1-inch multitouch-capable capacitive touchscreen as in the original. (Hellooo Windows 7!) Still no solid word on availability or pricing yet -- hopefully we'll hear more soon.[Thanks, Johnny]
