Acer's senior VP Scott Lin recently confirmed that a new 10-inch Iconia A3 tablet will arrive this summer and was quick to include it in some very ambitious sales plans. The device (not pictured) has yet to be priced or specced (or even seen), but nonetheless, Lin hopes it'll make up some of the 10 million slates the outfit aims to sell in 2013. He also announced a refresh for the $150 Iconia B1 this summer with a dual-core CPU, updated design and 1GB of RAM, and said that 1.5 million units of that model have shipped so far this year. The company would like to move another 1.5 million by year's end along with 5 million of the recently announced 8-inch Iconia A1 tabs and 2 million Iconia A3s to make up the balance. Considering that competitor ASUS sold 3 million tablets in Q1 and has the hit Nexus 7 to peddle, it seems a lofty goal for Acer -- especially since it only reluctantly leaped into tablets not so long ago.


Update: We've also received word that Mr. Lin confirmed that there is an 8-inch Windows 8 tablet in the works (the W3, perhaps?) and suggested it should be available by June.
