We were in the house for Sharp's unveiling of its quad-pixel technology (now called Quattron) and weren't sure we got the difference, so there's no doubt they needed an extra something to show viewers why they should care (embedded after the break in case you didn't spot it during the NCAA Tournament) since your display just isn't ready for constant loops of sunflowers, saxophones and repeat playback of Oh Yeah via the USB media port.
