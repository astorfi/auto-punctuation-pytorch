This one almost slipped by: the Logitech ViewPort AV 100 brings
Bluetooth capability to your video conferences, with a VGA quality webcam and a built-in Bluetooth headset and
microphone. It can send images up to 30 frames per second, does face tracking using digital pan and zoom, a USB 2.0
interface, and works on any Windows 2000 or XP PC.
