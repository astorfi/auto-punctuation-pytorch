Wouldn't you have enjoyed your PlayStation 2 games much more if you'd just left them sealed on the shelf? That's the eye-watering achievement collector Ahans76 has achieved, spending the last decade stuffing first edition (only with the Sony hologram attached) titles into a bookcase and steadfastly refusing to open them. In an interview with PlayStation Collecting (hit the source link below) he reveals much about the collection but doesn't mention if he ever opened his PlayStation 3. That would certainly be one way of keeping your credit card secure.
