It probably doesn't come as a surprise that the Nikon D80 DSLR is essentially everything we hoped for, and the bottom line seems to be that this digicam borrows a myriad of features from the wallet-abusing D200, but won't force you to refinance your home (well, hopefully not) in order to own one. For the Nikon faithful, this one's a no-brainer, but for those without any particular allegiance, it probably wouldn't hurt to give Sony's Alpha A100 a once over, considering its noteworthy bonuses -- such as the Super SteadyShot and anti-dust features that you won't find on the D80 -- before pulling the trigger. Nevertheless, reviewers are (practically) unanimous in giving their recommendations to this camera, especially at the sub-$1,000 (sans lens kit) price, but comb these reviews with your own discerning eyes before jumping on (or off) the D80 bandwagon yourself.
