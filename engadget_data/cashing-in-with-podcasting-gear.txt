Podcasting is now officially the new blogging which is officially the new black, so it's no shock that someone is
already cashing in with a line of "podcasting gear". PodcastGear.com is basically selling the same pro audio recording
gear, mics, and mixing software you could get before, just bundled together. The Pro Interview Package will only set
you back $1,695, too.
