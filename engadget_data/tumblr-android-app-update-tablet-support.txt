 Tumblr users have been managing their online repositories via mobile apps for a while now, but that software has been tailored specifically for smartphones thus far. The latest version of the blogging service's Android app has changed that, however, finally adding support for tablets, as well as a new "following screen" and tweaked design. Unfortunately for iPad users, you're still stuck in iPhone / iPod view, as Tumblr hasn't gotten 'round to releasing a slate-supporting update for iOS yet. It's strange that such optimization was omitted from the recently launched native app, but for now, both platforms have exclusives to boast about -- tablet support for Android, and Tumblr's Photoset app for iOS.
