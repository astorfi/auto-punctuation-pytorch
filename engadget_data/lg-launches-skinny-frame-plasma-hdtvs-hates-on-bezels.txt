The company is introducing a pair of the sets in its home market of Korea dubbed "Skinny Frame," a reference to the 25mm thin border around the panels -- which honestly isn't mind-blowingly thin, but nobody likes beefy bezels, right? The sets are available in 50- and 60-inch sizes, both offering 600Hz refresh rates, automatic contrast adjustment based on lighting conditions, and the ability to play photos and videos from a connected USB drive. Not bad, but at 1,700,000 and 3,800,000 won ($1,150 $1,500 and $3,325) they're not cheap, either.
