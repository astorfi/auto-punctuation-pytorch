The British have had access to Google Play Movies for months, but they've been denied TV shows -- an unusual omission given the country's rich broadcasting history. All is now right with the world, however, as Google now offers TV episodes through the UK's Google Play Store. The early catalog focuses on shows from big local networks, such as the BBC and Channel 5, as well as imports from the colonials (read: Americans). Brits keen on streaming Sherlock just have to visit Google Play to start watching.
