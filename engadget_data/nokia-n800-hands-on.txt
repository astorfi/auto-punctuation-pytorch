But if you have room in your heart for just a little bit more Nokia N800 love, we've spotted this thing live and in person at Digital Experience, and all the pics are after the break for your perusal. Or you could just head over to CompUSA, but it's your call.
      

 

We're not sure how Mr. SquarePants found his way onto the back of this thing, but he sure does seem to liven up the place.
