Well, it just so happens that a new batch of eighteen pictures have surfaced, and the two phones are actually one -- this is the Samsung Forte for MetroPCS, which is presently running a recent build of Android 2.2.1. While we still don't know if it's got the 1GHz processor and 5 megapixel camera that lovingly accompanied the original rumor, it appears to have Samsung's custom TouchWiz UI on board, lending extra credence to the possibility that the handset might receive Galaxy S branding when it materializes in stores. We've got just one last note here, and that's this whole reveal feels rather... planted to us. Watch the video after the break to see what we mean, and find plenty more pictures at the link below.
