Disney Infinity 3.0 is the latest edition of Disney's Skylanders-style video game series, and it's scheduled to hit stores in the fall, complete with figurines from the Star Wars universe. That's a relief, since we were worried there wouldn't be enough Star Wars stuff to go around this year. There will be three Star Wars Play Sets for Disney Infinity 3.0: Twilight of the Republic (featuring Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Darth Maul figurines), Rise Against the Empire (with Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and Darth Vader) and a third based on December's film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. That play set will launch in the winter, probably alongside the movie.



Also in store for Disney Infinity 3.0 is a new Marvel Play Set including, in part, Hulkbuster Iron Man and Ultron. Plus, there are new Tron and Pixar figurines on the way. Accessories from previous versions of Disney Infinity will be compatible with the new game, Disney says. The Disney Infinity 3.0 Starter Pack, including Ahsoka Tano and Anakin Skywalker figures, costs $65, with pre-orders live now. If that sounds pricey, just think of it as "the price to see a movie with four-ish friends" or "the price to see a movie alone and with lots of popcorn."
