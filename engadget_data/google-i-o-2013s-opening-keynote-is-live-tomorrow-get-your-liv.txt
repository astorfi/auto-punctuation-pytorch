Who can forget last year's Google I/O opening keynote? With skydivers and a plethora of extreme antics all culminating in the on-stage unveiling of Google Glass, it will go down in history as one of the most exciting product unveilings of all time. Can Google top that this year? It's certainly going to try, and rather than hosting multiple keynotes on multiple days big G is doing it all in one shot. One three hour shot. Set your alarms and make sure you find a comfortable chair then join us at the URL below for the 9:00am PT (12:00pm ET) liveblog tomorrow, May 15th.
