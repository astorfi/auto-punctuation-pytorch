Developed in partnership with Japan's NHK, the prototype is merely a proof of concept for the broadcaster's planned 2020 launch of Super Hi Vision TV. In person, the flat screen is truly awe-inspiring, offering such richness of detail that even up-close we weren't able to discern any pixels, while colors appeared balanced and natural. Overall, the image quality -- 16 times that of regular full HD -- nearly apes the real-world images it replicates. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait sometime before this tech trickles down to the mass market level. In the meantime, content yourself with a brief video demo after the break.
