If you were placing bets on when the first app using the iPhone 5S' M7 motion co-processor would arrive, it's time to cash in. Strava Run, the fitness application that lets you score your suffering (no, really), was recently updated to include auto-pause that relies on Apple's new silicon, allowing a time-out on your activity when it senses you aren't moving. The application also uses less juice now, which should make your iPhone a little more prepared for a marathon. You, on the other hand, may need to recharge somewhere during those 26.2 miles.
