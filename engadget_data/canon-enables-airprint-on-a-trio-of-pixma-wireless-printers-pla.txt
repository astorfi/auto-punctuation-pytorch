Well, feel free to do a little dance (just not this one), because Canon's added AirPrint support for the lucky three aforementioned. Simply (we hope) update your printer to the latest firmware, and boom, you'll be printing over iOS 4.2 and beyond. Better yet, it's also stated that the "majority" of forthcoming PIXMAs will follow in a similar AirPrint-enabled fashion. Need more info? Full PR is just past the break.
