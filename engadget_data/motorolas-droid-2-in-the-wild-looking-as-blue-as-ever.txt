It's not officially supposed to hit retail until tomorrow, but that obviously hasn't stopped a delivery truck from unloading a few at a nondescript Sam's Club. We're still waiting to hear back on whether or not they're actually being allowed out of the store today, but hey, tomorrow ain't too far away. 

P.S. - Nice Sony Ericsson mat.
