Parents who want to use
GPS to track their teenage kids' driving habits
now have another option from Atlanta-based Discrete Wireless, which primarily makes similar tracking systems for
trucking fleets. Like most other tracking systems, Discrete's Marcus lets parents retrieve data via a web site, email,
or cellphone, and can provide alerts based on pre-defined parameters like speed-limit infractions or visits to
off-limits locales. We can sympathize with parents who are jittery about what their kids are doing in the car, but we
also suspect that this will end up being a golden opportunity for teenage hackers who will figure out how to send false
data to the system, or at the very least, get it to "malfunction" whenever they're breaking the rules.
