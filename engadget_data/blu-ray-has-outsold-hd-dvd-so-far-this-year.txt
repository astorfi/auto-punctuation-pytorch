Blu-ray has outsold HD DVD this year 2-to-1. We aren't going to sugar coat these numbers even though some might call it fanboy-ism but others will quietly state from the corner of the room, "Numbers don't lie." Home Media Research reports that Blu-ray has currently sold 1.6 million discs this year while HD DVD has only moved 795,000. The research firm also estimates 3.7 million high definition disc have been sold since launch and 2.2 went to the Blu-ray camp with the remaining 1.5 belonging to HD DVD. Only time will tell if these initial numbers mean anything but it seems Blu-ray is winning the battle for '07.
