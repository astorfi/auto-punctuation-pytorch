UK carriers are always looking for new incentives that might persuade people to switch allegiances, and Vodafone is no exception. The carrier is enhancing its 4G contracts today by adding Sky's Now TV streaming service to its existing trio of limited-time perks. New subscribers taking out a Vodafone Red 4G plan, as well as anyone buying a £30 or £40 Red 4G Freedom TopUp, can choose Now TV's Entertainment Pass as their preferred perk. To sweeten the deal, Vodafone is also throwing in a 3-month Movies Pass for free.



Sky has been getting cosy with Vodafone for a while now; it already offers Sky Sports Mobile TV as one of its optional 4G extras and less than a week ago, Sky kicked off a trial offering some of its own customers Vodafone's services. Reading between the lines, it's possible Sky is gearing up to enter the fray as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), using Vodafone's infrastructure as its backbone. With more Sky services popping up in Vodafone's mobile offerings, the two companies have never felt closer.
