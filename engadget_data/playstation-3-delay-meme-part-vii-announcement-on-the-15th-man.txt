 Seems like the PlayStation 3 meme hasfurther, um, credible developments in the Blu-ray thorn in Sony's side. According to GamesIndustry, apparently Koeihead Kiyoshi Komatsu told Japanese press of a yet-unannounced Sony press event in Tokyo on the 15th of this month, andconfirmed "some details about the PlayStation 3 mightbe announced there." (Which, of course, GI followed up with some independent sources corroborating the story.) Andif we're to further believe a Chinese technology site by the name of Mydrivers, the PS3 won't begin manufacture untilJune of this year, as apparently an unnamed COMPEQ (a Taiwanese firm who did circuit boards for the PSP) employeeleaked that month as the date PS3 parts begin fab. So, who're you gonna believe (if anyone)?
