Just a little over a week after Samsung introduced the 7-inch Galaxy Tab 3 to the world, and it's already made its way to the FCC for approval. There's not much to say here that we don't know about, but as expected, this particular model is WiFi-only, with no LTE or voice-enabled bands mentioned in the documentation. As a reminder, the Tab 3 has relatively modest specs with a WSVGA (1,024 x 600) TFT screen, a dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 8GB or 16GB of storage (expandable up to 64GB), a 4,000 mAh battery, a rear 3-megapixel camera and a front 1.3-megapixel one. It's set to ship with Android 4.1 some time this month, with a 3G version following in June. Though we're not sure of its exact drop date, we hope it's after a certain tech conference next week for the sake of our sanity.
