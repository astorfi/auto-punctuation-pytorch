 Not enough variety in your Zune HD color palette? How about a friendly dab of magenta and purple to mix up the proceedings? Microsoft's Zune Store is now showing some grayed out selectors for purple and magenta color options for the player, which will apparently be available on December 1st -- just in time for something or other. No word on whether these will be available for both 16GB and 32GB versions, but pink already representing on the 32 gigger, we'd really hope Microsoft would spread the love down to the cash strapped.

[Thanks, Jerel]
