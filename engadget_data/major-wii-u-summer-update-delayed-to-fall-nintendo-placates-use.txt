Looking forward to that second Wii U speed update? Take a seat, son: Nintendo says it won't be here until fall. According to a statement given to The Verge, Nintendo has pushed it back to the end of the year, promising delivery sometime "between the end of September and beginning of October." Instead, Wii U owners are being offered a smaller patch, bringing the console's system menu to version 3.1 while providing minor stability fixes and tweaking the machine's standby download function. Good things, of course, but a small comfort to gamers who have been eagerly awaiting the performance update Nintendo president Satoru Iwata promised back in January. Then again, Nintendo fans are getting used to waiting.
