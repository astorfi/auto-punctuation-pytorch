We've seen Blu-ray decks, a BD-infused soundbar, LCD-equipped refrigerators and even a few HDTVs, but Sammy's clearly hoping you pay the most attention to its new line of LED-backlit LCDs. The 6000, 7000 and 8000 Series sets all ditch traditional CCFLs in favor of the newer, brighter and more energy-efficient LED backlighting. Of note, the 8000 Series is the only one a 240Hz refresh rate; the other lines get stuck with the perfectly acceptable 120Hz Auto Motion Plus. Furthermore, the 7000 / 8000 crew will come ready for the Yahoo!-driven Internet@TV online content service, while the 6000 family will allow access to Sammy's own InfoLink RSS service. More meaningful specs (screen size, brightness, contrast ratio, price, favorite color / date spot, etc.) are sorely missing, but you can peak the linked PDF if you don't believe us.
