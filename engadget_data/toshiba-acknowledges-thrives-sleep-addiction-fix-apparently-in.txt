Before embarking on a mythical tale, whereupon you eventually find its more charming compatriot, know help from Toshiba is forthcoming: "We're aware of the issue and are working on a fix." No further details on when it'll land, or what exactly it'll fix, but if you're anything like us, you're just happy it won't end up where another Tosh tablet did -- in eternal slumber.
