DirecTV 11 -- not to be confused with D10 that's already operational -- was scheduled to launch this year, but due to a delay at the launch company, it has been delayed till Q1 2008. We're not sure how much this will affect their plans for 150 HD channels, but if D10 is any indication, it will take just over two months after the launch to become operational.
