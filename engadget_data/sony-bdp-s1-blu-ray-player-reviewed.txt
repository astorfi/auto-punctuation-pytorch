HDGuru has put up a review of the unit after testing it out on a Panasonic TH-50PX600 plasma. One major complaint are the loading times, with it taking well over a minute from power on to actually playing a movie, as well as some lag on commands via the remote. Still, that $999.95 does buy the first player capable of 1080p/24 output and didn't display the annoying visual problems encountered by the earlier Samsung BD-P1000. The pack-in copy of The Fifth Element still looks as bad as ever but other Blu-ray releases show the potential of the format. Just like the PS3, it's BYOC for HDMI and component connections, that a high definition player doesn't include a way for it to connect to an HDTV is still just silly. CD playback is also not a part of the package, but future firmware updates will add Blu-ray Java and BD-R/BD-RE compatibility. Without features like HDMI 1.3 and BD-Live support, it's tough to see this as a good buy right now but we'll see if the picture quality is worth it to some.[Via HDBlog.net]
