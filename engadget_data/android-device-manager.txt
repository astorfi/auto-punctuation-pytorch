That new Android Device Manager feature Google announced last week? It's live now, according to numerous tipsters (and several of our own Android-sporting editors). For the time being, the functionality seems to only be present on handsets, arriving via an over the air update. The new feature lets you ring your phone at maximum volume even when silenced, locate the device on a Google Map and wipe it clean, should the other two options not pan out.
