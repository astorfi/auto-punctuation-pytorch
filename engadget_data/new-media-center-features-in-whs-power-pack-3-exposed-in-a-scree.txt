Our friend Adam from the Digital Media Zone takes us through the TV show archiving and converting feature as well as the new remote console that lets you check to see if your backups are running from the comfort of the couch. Although we're not super excited by any of these particular features, we are encouraged to see more evidence that our vision of the future of Windows Media Center might be in line with Microsoft's.
