In an attempt to save face, the lads at Neofonie posted a video showing what appears to be a real-live working WePad in action. Unfortunately, touch is not yet enabled so the navigation is accomplished with a USB mouse assist. Having been burned once, we're not sure what we can believe about this â‚¬450 Atom N450-powered slate. See the video after the break.

Update: Video was removed.

[Thanks, Mauro]
