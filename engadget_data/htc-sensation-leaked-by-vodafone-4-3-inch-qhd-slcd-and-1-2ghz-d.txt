So here's the scoop: 4.3-inch qHD (540 x 960 pixel) SLCD display, 1.2 megapixel front-facing camera augmented by an 8 megapixel shooter with dual-LED flash around back, a 1.2GHz (dual-core) processor, and 4GB of internal flash memory with an extra 8GB supplied on memory card. Stick around, we'll have hands-on with the latest Android Sensation from the HTC launch event later in the day.

Update: Vodafone removed the pages but we've got a screenshot after the break. Better yet, we've also got a trio of videos uncovered by our friends over at Mobile Bulgaria showing updated elements of the Sense UI.
