We'd mentioned this once before, but Digital
Photography Review is saying that Pretec's 12GB CompactFlash is supposed to retail for nearly $15,000 when it comes out
later this year rather than the $9,999 we had heard it was going to cost. At least in Japan it's supposed to retail for
that much. So basically you can choose between buying a little piece of plastic with some memory on it that you're
probably going to lose anyway, or a brand new 2004 Honda Civic, which actually costs a little less.
