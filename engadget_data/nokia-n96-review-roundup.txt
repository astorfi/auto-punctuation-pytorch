From the get-go, we knew the N96 was more evolutionary and less revolutionary; after all, the two handsets even look alike. The general consensus this time around is about what we expected: the N96 is a fine phone, and a worthy successor, but probably not worth the high price it's currently demanding. Oh sure, the call quality was stupendous, battery life was satisfactory and the multimedia playback was superb, but some critics were a bit displeased with the fit and finish given the premium price tag. All in all, don't go into the links below expecting any huge surprises -- the N96 is a nicely revamped, high-priced N95, and if that's what you're looking for, there doesn't seem to be any underlying issues that should hold you back from indulging.Read - PhoneArena ("Nokia seems to have taken more of a lateral step than pushing forward with innovation.")Read - MobileArsenal ("...doesn't have anything we didn't see before...")Read - LordPercy ("...an improved, quality phone...")Read - Mobile88 (4 out of 5 stars)
