The latest 10-inch LED backlit Eee PC with new chicklet keyboard ships with 802.11b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0, and a 160GB hard disk with an additional 10GB of Eee Online storage. The inclusion of Intel's 1.66GHz Atom N280 processor and ASUS' own Super Hybrid Engine battery conservation tech makes this the most powerful and longest lasting Eee PC ever. Members of the Eee PC Facebook group receive a $25 discount off the $399 pre-order price. Sweet... but you might find yourselves wishing you'd waited for a touchscreen model whenever Windows 7 rolls around. [Via SlashGear]
