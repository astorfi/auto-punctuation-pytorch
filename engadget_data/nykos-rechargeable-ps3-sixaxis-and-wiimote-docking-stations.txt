Nyko has stepped up to deliver solutions for both of the latest consoles. First up is the Charge Base for PlayStation 3. Because the SIXAXIS controllers already come with built-in lithium-ion batteries, this puppy just charges and stores. You'll be able to charge and store up to four controllers by jacking the thing into an ordinary wall outlet. The Charge Station for Wii not only stores and charges two Wiimotes but includes two rechargeable NiMH batteries with rubberized battery covers (to help keep you from throwing it into your plasma we presume). We haven't got prices for either of these offerings but consider the Wii's propensity for gobbling batteries when weighing that product.Update: Joystiq's got prices for the units -- $29.99 for the Wii's Charge Station (with two batteries mind you!) and $39.99 for the PS3's Charge Base (sans batteries). Seems like Nyko's pricing these products to their respective audiences, dunnit?[Via Joystiq]
