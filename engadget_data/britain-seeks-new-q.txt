All right, y'all, Engadget has found a use for your third nipple that doesn't involve web porn. Britain has been
advertising for a new "CEO of Government Communications Centre" â€” i.e., high-tech spymaster lab boss known as James
Bond's "Q." The real-life version in residence in Her Majesty's Government does R & D work in "communications
systems and equipment." If you've god mad skillz in radio frequency engineering, acoustics, signal processing and
software engineering, you could be a candidate for the new Q. You might be in for a bit of a letdown, however, because
as it turns out, the foremost duty of the new Q is, sadly, to be a boring bureaucrat. Or at least, to maintain the
appearance of one whilst you secretly harbor that uber-cool spymaster persona seething just underneath your business
casual.
