 Details are totally sketchy, but it looks like there's about to be another Red HD camera to lust after: a posting from CEO Jim Jannard on the Red user forums confirms that Red will be launching a "pocket professional" camera named "Scarlet" sometime this year, with prototypes to be shown off at NAB in April. Jannard says the camera won't be a competitor or replacement for the Red One, but that's all we've got for now -- but you know we'll be all over this thing as info comes in.[Thanks, MonsterDog]
