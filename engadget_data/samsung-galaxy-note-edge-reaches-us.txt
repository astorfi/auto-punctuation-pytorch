If you've been jonesing to get Samsung's one-of-a-kind Galaxy Note Edge in the US, you now have a date to mark on your calendar. The bent-screen Android smartphone will be available in the US starting November 14th, with the five biggest carriers (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon and US Cellular) all on tap either on the 14th or in the weeks afterward. You'll be paying an extravagant sum for that eye-catching display, however. Sprint is offering the Edge on a $35 per month payment plan ($840 total), while AT&T will sell it for $400 on contract, or an eye-watering $950 up front -- you'd better really, really like curved screens. Other carriers haven't divulged pricing just yet, but it's safe to say that they'll charge similar amounts. Who knew that the Galaxy Note 4 would seem like a bargain?
