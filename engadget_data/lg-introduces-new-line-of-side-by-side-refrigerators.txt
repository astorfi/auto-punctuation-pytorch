LG's introduced a new line of gadget-heavy refrigerators with a slick side-by-side design.  Cleverly called the
LG Side-by-Side Refrigerator, the fridges can keep food cold even when the door is opened frequently and come loaded
with a digital LCD display, digital cooling system, and a BioShield Anti-Bacteria Gasket (some reason this last one
makes us actually not want to eat food stored in this refrigerator).  Not to mention a pizza nook. 
Mmm, pizza nook.  They're now available in a variety of models ranging in price from $1,249 to $2,199.
