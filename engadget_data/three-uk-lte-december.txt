Since today's the day that Vodafone and O2 launch their 4G networks, Three has piped up to remind you that its own LTE rollout isn't too far behind. Customers in London, Birmingham and Manchester will be getting an early Christmas present when the service goes live at some point in December. As promised back in February, existing customers with LTE-ready devices won't pay extra, nor will they lose their unlimited data allowance. The network is promising to be in 50 cities by the end of 2014 and cover 98 percent of the population by the end of 2015. After all, Dave Dyson's a mobile executive who likes to take things slow.

From December this year, Three will start to switch on its 4G service for all customers, who have a 4G ready device. The switch on will accelerate in January, which means that over 1.5 million Three customers will benefit from 4G services.

All Three customers with a 4G ready device will be able to benefit from 4G at no extra cost with a simple software upgrade, so no need to go into a store. Three is making the transition to 4G easy, there are no new contracts to sign, no need to change tariffs or swap SIMs. Three will also continue to offer All You Can Eat data, as part of its voice plans.

Three's 4G population coverage will reach 98% by the end of 2015 and be available in 50 cities in the UK by the end of 2014. Three already has the fastest 3G network in the UK and 4G will simply make it an even better network experience for customers, at no extra cost.
