Out of seemingly nowhere, Motorola has just made the decision to shun Google's location services in favor of those from Skyhook, proudly becoming the "first Android device maker to abandon Google for its location services." According to the release -- which feels atypically jovial to us -- the device maker will marry Skyhook's GPS, WiFi and cellular location in the "vast majority" of its phone models, and since Skyhook will be baked into the OS, every single app can reap the benefits. Reportedly, developers are pretty stoked about the news, and it's pretty clear that Motorola is equally confident that Skyhook's location solution is the best on the market. Not like Google really needs any more frenemies right now, but hey -- you won't find us kvetching about anyone keeping the Big Shot on its toes.
