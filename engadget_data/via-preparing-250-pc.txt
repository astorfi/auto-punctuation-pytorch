It may not be the next Negroponte $100 PC or
AMD PIC, but Via Technologies is getting ready to unveil
a reference design for a $250 PC that would be available to PC manufacturers around the world, aimed especially at
those in more impoverished nations. While that price does include a monitor, don't plan on hauling it over to your next
LAN party as it'll apparently run on an older Via 1GHz processor, and comes "loaded" with 128MB of RAM. They're even
considering selling a PC that uses a TV for a monitor, something that's been tried in the past with, how shall we say,
mixed results. Look for the reference design to be on display at the Computex trade show in Taipei next monthâ€”we'll
keep you posted.
