Yeah, it may just be a tweaked SCH-B250, but this pup representstheir inaugural push into what is expected to be abooming handheld digital TV market in Europe. This tri-band GSM / GPRS / EDGE handset throws down a swivelling,2.2-inch 240x330 262K color LCD display and features a 2 megapixel shooter, Bluetooth, and MPEG-4 video and MP3/AACaudio player. And not only can you view that sweet, sweet digital teevee son, but you can also look up programs on anincluded EPG and then record to the 128MB of internal memory or microSD expansion for later playback via that TV-outjack. Expect the SGH-P900 to start shipping Q2 nought-six just in time for the World Cup of what therest-of-the-world-calls “football.”[Via Akihabara News]
