 
Well, well, what have we here? Yet another entrant into the decidedly oversaturated netbook market, that's what. While waltzing through OCZ Technology's CeBIT booth today, we happened upon the company's very first netbook: Neutrino. After chuckling for a few at the empty Beck's bottle beside it (hey, we're in Germany!), we scoped out the specs (and chatted with an on-hand rep) and found that it will be shipping Stateside within nine or so weeks in two variations. The first is a "DIY" model, which will be "priced competitively" compared to similar sized netbooks and enable buyers to select their own RAM, HDD, etc; the alternative is an OCZ'd-out edition, which will cater to high-end users who won't mind the undisclosed price premium. The 10.1-inch machine will come loaded with a 1.6GHz Intel Atom CPU, a 945GSE chipset, up to 2GB of RAM, an optional 250GB OCZ SSD, 1,024 x 600 resolution LCD, VGA output, Ethernet, twin USB 2.0 ports, a 4-cell (2,200mAh) battery, WiFi and a 1.3 megapixel webcam. It'll weigh in at 2.86 pounds and come with Ubuntu or WinXP, and while we weren't thrilled with the trackpad performance, the keyboard was one of the nicest we've touched on a netbook, even nicer than the well spaced one on ASUS' Eee PC 1000HE.
