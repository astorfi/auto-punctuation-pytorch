Apparently, the firm's high performance AV series will include HDMI, component, SCART, optical / coaxial digital audio and stereo audio flavors, and they will all be marketed as perfect complements to BRAVIA TVs, VAIO PCs, PS3s and Sony Blu-ray players. These cables are purportedly a notch above the midrange lineup introduced earlier this year, and they all boast 24k gold plated connectors and are manufactured from 99.996-percent oxygen free copper (OFC). No prices are mentioned, but you can supposedly find the whole lot now in one, three and five meter lengths over in Europe.[Via Cybertheater]
