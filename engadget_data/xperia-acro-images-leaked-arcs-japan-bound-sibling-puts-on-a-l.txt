Yes, dear readers, we present you with a multi-angle look at the Acro, and if it appears decidedly similar to the Arc, you're close to understanding Sony's intent. As expected, this Japanese Xperia has bulked up after tossing on NFC, IrDA and DTV features. If this weren't enough, SE's show-off gets another bonus over its svelte sibling and is expected to ship with Android 2.3.3, (you know, for all that NFC-writing you were planning).
