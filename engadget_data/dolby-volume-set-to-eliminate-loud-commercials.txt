Those mad scientists at Dolby Labs think they have a solution for senior citizens everywhere. Dolby Volume sets to eliminate your grandfather's cursing when the loud and obnoxious car salesman commercial hits by utilizing two patented processes. The Volume Leveler equalizes the high and low volumes, and then, the Volume Modeler dynamically adjust the bass and treble as the volume increases/decreases. Best of all, this system can be incorporated into any TV or A/V. No word on when you will see the Dolby Volume logo on your equipment just yet, but hopefully soon as it isn't just old folks complaining -- we have too.
