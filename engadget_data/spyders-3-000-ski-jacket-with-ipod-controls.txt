For three large you could probably fashion a coat entirely out of
iPod shuffles, but Spyder is selling a new $3,000 ski
jacket with integrated iPod controls on the sleeve (they do throw in an
iPod photo). The jacket, which makes Burton's iPod jacket
seem cheap, uses Eleksen's smart fabric technology (they also make
fabric keyboards for smartphones and PDAs) and will be
available in limited numbers this September.
