 
If you'll recall, some months ago we held a little competition for readers to submit artwork destined for laser-etching on the backsides of Amazon's Kindle. After everyone voted on the top five out of the mountain of selections, we took the gaggle of readers down to our friends at Adafruit Industries (headed up by the lovely and delightful Limor Fried and Phil Torrone) for some time under the laser. While we were there getting our etch on with their massive laser, we convinced Limor and Phil to show off some of the other crazy kit they've got in the labs -- and we've captured it all on film... er, video. Take a look at our excursion into the world of dynamic DIY'ing -- we think you'll like what you see. Check it out after the break!
