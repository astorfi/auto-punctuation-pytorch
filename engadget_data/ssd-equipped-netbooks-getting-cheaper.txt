With Intel just recently slashing the MSRP on its 80GB SSD, not to mention to scads of others ratcheting things down as well, it's not shocking to hear that SSD-equipped netbooks are becoming all the more affordable. DigiTimes has it that demand for SSD-based 8.9-inch netbooks in particular are clogging up sales channels, which is forcing companies to move them (at least in Taiwan) for lower-than-advertised amounts. Of course, we're still betting it takes a month or so before these elusive price drops make their way to America, but keep a close eye out for sudden discounts if you're in the market.[Via GadgetMix]
