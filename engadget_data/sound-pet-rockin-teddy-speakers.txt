 
Along with our passing interest in Hello Kitty, we also have a bit of a thing for teddy bears around here (any shrinks care to speculate?), sowhen we spotted these headphones that let your teddy listen to tunes while you're at work, we jumped right on it. Nah,this product is actually just another stuffed bear embedded with an amp and speakers that shakes its furry booty whenyou switch on the tunes. Targeted towards the younger set, the not-all-that-happy-looking Sound Pet seems to sport astandard 1/8-inch stereo plug for streaming music from any number of devices, and will be getting its freak on in Japannext month.
