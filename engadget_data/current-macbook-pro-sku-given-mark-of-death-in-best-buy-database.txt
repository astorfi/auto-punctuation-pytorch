What that means is no new orders can be made for that unit, at least for that particular store. Sign of impending MBP refresh? Intel certainly had us riled up last month with that Core i5-infused flier, but we won't get fooled again. Don't hold your breath for this one, but if more telltale signs start popping up, we'll be sure let ya know.

Update: Giving credit where due; the image originates from the MacRumors forums.

Update II: Another tipster familiar with Best Buy's systems wrote in and noted that "Deleted only means that the that particular store is having it pulled from their planogramed assortment." Sorry to burst your bubble.
