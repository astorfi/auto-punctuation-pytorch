This note on the home page points out the "more than 1,000 additional movies and TV shows" with faves like Sesame Street and Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles among them. The terms are still the same, it's a pack-in for paid Prime subscribers and Amazon points out there's already over 300 ways to watch on HDTVs, Blu-ray players or set-top boxes, so update your charts and see if this plus free shipping makes for a good Netflix alternative.
