All joshing aside, LG.Philips will soon sport a little less Philips and a lot more LG as the South Korean flat-panel maker renames itself to LG Display Co Ltd. Granted, the alteration still has to be approved at its annual shareholder meeting on February 29th, but considering that Philips cut its stake in the venture to 19.9-percent recently, we reckon it'll pass with flying colors.
