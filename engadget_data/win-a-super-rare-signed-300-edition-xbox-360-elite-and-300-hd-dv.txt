 
We've given away any number of Xbox 360s on Engadget in the past, but never one with the level of awesome turned up to 11 (or, in this case, 300). Today we're giving away one of just 20 super rare Xbox 360 Elite consoles printed with blood designs from 300 -- but rarer still since it's friggin' signed by Frank Miller. The details of what the winner takes:

300-Edition Xbox 360 Elite (120GB drive, wireless controller, etc.)
Console is signed by 300 creator and comic legend Frank Miller, as well as Zack Snyder, director of the eponymous film
300 combo DVD / HD DVD (which is, incidentally, out today) to go right along with it.

Look, we'll admit it, we really don't want to give this thing away -- so make sure you follow the contest guidelines, ok?The rules (yeah, there are always rules):

Leave a comment below -- tell us your fave scene from the movie. (It's ok if you haven't seen it, but where the hell have you been?)
You may only enter this specific giveaway once. If you enter this giveaway more than once you'll be automatically disqualified, etc. (Yes, we have robots that thoroughly check to ensure fairness.) In other words, be careful when commenting and if you submit more than once, only activate one comment, ok?
If you enter more than once, only activate one comment -- otherwise we'll send Leonidas after you.
Contest is open to anyone worldwide!
Entries can be submitted until 11:59pm EDT on Sunday, August 12th.
