In reality, however, the service proved a bit of a letdown according to the AP, but of course, we'd bet opinions would vary widely depending on one's fanhood. Users can flip (though not instantaneously) between a trio of angles, and while the content was laggy at times, it seemed at least decently reliable overall. The biggest dig on the service was its less-than-enthralling nature; put simply, you aren't guaranteed to see the "most exciting" shots, so fixing your eyes on the online extras may actually be less entertaining than the high-definition feed lighting up your set. Nevertheless, we're glad to see bonuses such as this being offered up, but we'd highly recommend checking out the read link before you switch services just for Game Extra.
