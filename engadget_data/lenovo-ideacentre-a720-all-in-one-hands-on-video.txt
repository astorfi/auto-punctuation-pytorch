The 27-inch, 10-point multitouch display is a little bit wider than a finger and connects via a moveable armature to the base where the various ports are -- including HDMI in and out. The surface's response was still a little flaky, but with half a year ahead of them we hope Lenovo will nail it. Feel free to watch us play Pong with elastic bands and poke at bugs.
