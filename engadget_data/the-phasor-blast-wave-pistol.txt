If mace isn't quite doing the job for you anymore, you might want to look into
the Phasor Blast Wave Pistol, an "experimental" device which is intended to scare away animals, but its "high pressure
complex sonic shock waves", which create discomfort, disorientation, and nausea, can also be used on people. In
fact, the misnamed "Information Unlimited" carries a whole range of sonic devices, including the Phasor Pain Field
Blaster; the Phasor Pain Field Generator (for crowd control); and the Ultrasonic Blaster (for blowing holes in
metal — or cleaning jewelry).
