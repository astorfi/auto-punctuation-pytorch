Plenty of Engadget editors are on hand, along with our friends from Joystiq and TUAW, so be sure to swing on by if you're in the neighborhood. We're walking around with the latest gadgets, and may even have some for you to take home. Can't make it to the party? We have our cameras and laptops in tow, and we'll be adding photos and text throughout the night. Jump past the break to join in on the fun!
