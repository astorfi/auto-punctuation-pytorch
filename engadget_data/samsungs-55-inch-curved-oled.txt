Well, it looks like LG won't be the only option available this month for those in the market for a 55-inch curved OLED TV. According to CNET, Samsung's similar TV set, already on sale in Korea, is headed to "select dealers" in the US as early as this week. At least one of those, NY-based Value Electronics, says that its shipment is already on the way, and that it will run the same $14,999 that LG's TV demands at Best Buy. To be clear, that is $15k per TV. One TV. Fifteen thousand dollars. Slightly curved.
