According to the Wall Street Journal's sources, the new in-cell technology integrates the touch sensor into the screen, shedding around half a millimeter and due to the reduced space between screen and user, could well improve image quality. Although a mere 0.5 mm reduction may not mean much for the phone's frame, it could help offset any weight added by a larger screen. The Wall Street Journal also reports that the still-LCD screens will be made by joint venture Japan Display, LG Display and Sharp. Manufacturers are apparently battling to maintain high-yield rates on the new screen technology, which until now has been limited to bigger displays. Hit up the source for the full report.
