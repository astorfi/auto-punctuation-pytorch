Microsoft must have been dreaming if they thought they could hold a
launch party for the
Xbox 360 last night and somehow stop us from getting our
hands on photos of every last piece of hardware that was there. We already scored a live shot of the console, along
with its controller, now courtesy of another attendee we now know what the Xbox 360's DVD player/Media Center remote
control is going to look like.
