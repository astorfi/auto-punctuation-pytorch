Basically, Steve doesn't like Flash Lite -- the pared-down version Adobe has designed for small screens and lightweight processors -- and the full-fledged version has too much bloat for the iPhone's resources. As he puts it, "there's this missing product in the middle." Personally, we'd like to be the judge of that, but we know how Apple operates; with any luck, the SDK will give devs enough power so we'll eventually end up with a Flash player (and a Flash Lite player, for that matter) anyhow.[Via mocoNews]
