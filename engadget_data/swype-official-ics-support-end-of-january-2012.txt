Although we're sure some of you have cut corners and gone the unofficial route, you'll be happy to know that the third-party keyboard firm's tweeted that official Ice Cream Sandwich support is coming soon -- like, "end-of-month" soon. Swype didn't include an exact date within its 140 character-limited box, so all you proud Galaxy Nexus owners will have to make due with what you've got, or wait a few more weeks to get a legitimate copy.
