Now we hear that Qualcomm will have its 1.3GHz QSD8650A chipset on the market for sampling before the end of 2009 -- that means new smartphone and smartbooks (get used to it netbook fans) in 2010 running 30% faster while using 30% less power (and just 10 milliwatts in standby) thanks to the use of reduced 45-nm manufacturing processes. The new chipset supports multi-mode UMTS and CDMA 3G connectivity in the same 15 x 15-mm package as well as featuring enhanced 2D acceleration and 3D graphics core, integrated GPS, high-def video recording and playback, Bluetooth 2.1, WiFi, and support for WXGA (1280x800 pixels) displays pumping out your choice of MediaFLO, DVBH, or ISDB-T digital mobile television. The new chipset makes for a snug fit right in between the existing 1GHz QSD8x50 chipset and Qualcomm's dual-CPU 45-nm QSD8672 chipset running up to 1.5 GHz. After seeing the TG01 in action, you'd better believe that we'll be hunting down all the Snapdragon devices we can find at Computex this week.
