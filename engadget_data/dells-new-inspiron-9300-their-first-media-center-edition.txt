The trail Toshibas' Qosmio series of Windows XP
Media Center Edition laptops paved is becoming
increasinlgy traversed—the latest to
follow in their path is Dell's Inspiron 9300, the followup to last Christmas's
Inspiron 9200, and their first Media Center Edition
enabled laptop to date. The multimedia-centric portable will feature a 17-inch XGA+ or UXGA TrueLife (1152 x 864 and
1600 x 1200, respectively) display, 533MHZ dual-channel DDR2 SDRAM, your choice of an ATI Mobility Radeon X300 or 256MB
Nvidia GeForce Go 6800, MediaDirect (their name for their pre-boot DVD/media playback option), DVI-out (still rare on
PC laptops these days), S-video, 1394, and six USB 2.0 connections. Oh, and in case you were wondering about its
integrated tuner, don't worry, they didn't include one. That's right, you have to tune via USB (not to worry, they'll
sell you one for a mere $200). See, selling a Media Center PC—a laptop no less—with no tuner makes you remember that
it's Dell we're talking about here.
