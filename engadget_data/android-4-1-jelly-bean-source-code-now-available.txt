Currently, binaries are available for the Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus, with Nexus S and Motorola Xoom versions promised soon. As usual, this gets the countdown started for more manufacturers to work on builds for their devices and means third party coders like CyanogenMod can dive in as well. One other thing we should be used to by now is a warning that it still may take some time for things to go live as the code is replicated. Hit the source link for all of the information on the latest build or hit the AOSP site for more information what exactly this is and how to get it.
