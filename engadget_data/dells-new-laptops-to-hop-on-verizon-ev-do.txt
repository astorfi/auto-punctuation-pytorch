It's not all too often Dell gets to turn up the old buzz machine, but apparently they're expected to make an
announcement with Verizon Wireless that new Dell Latitudes will feature the option of getting integrated EV-DO service.
Not a huge surprise (especially after the Vaio
T350), but hopefully this will be a mini-PCI solution, and not something built-in like the Sony. And yes, either
way we'll be hearing a whole lot about this in the coming year, especially as
Cingular and
Sprint roll out their high speed data
services.
