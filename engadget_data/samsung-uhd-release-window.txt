If you dug the 105-inch curved Ultra HD TV and bendable 85-inch UHD screen (above) Samsung debuted this week, we have good news. They'll both hit retail sometime in the second half of this year, according to the tech giant. If you were expecting pricing info, well, you're going to have to wait a little longer because we don't have that just yet. However, it's going to be at least six months before these sets hit stores, so we suggest you start saving your pennies right about now -- unlike other options, we have a hunch that these beauties won't be cheap.
