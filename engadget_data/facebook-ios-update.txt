 Facebook's got a fresh update for its main iOS app, and version 5.4 has some pleasant additions coming your way. The social network is throwing in the ability to send voice messages (which has been available on Android for a little over a week, and on iOS through Messenger) and share video recordings directly through the app, and it's also enhanced functionality in the Nearby tab as well. We're still all waiting impatiently for Graph Search on the mobile front, but we can at least enjoy some new ways of showing the world what we're up to. Head to the source to download the update.
