To accompany today's news that Xbox One will soon be backwards compatible with Xbox 360 games, Ubisoft just announced that Rainbow Six: Vegas and Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 will be free for anyone that buys the latest game in the franchise, Rainbow Six: Siege. Although no one has explained exactly how this'll work, all Xbox 360 games will need to be downloaded (rather than played by disc), so you'd assume Seige will arrive with download codes for both titles. Ubi is the second developer to announce such a deal today, as Bethesda is giving away Fallout 3 with Xbox One copies of Fallout 4. Hopefully this becomes a trend of sorts -- it'd make a nice change from having to buy all those "definitive" editions, wouldn't it?
