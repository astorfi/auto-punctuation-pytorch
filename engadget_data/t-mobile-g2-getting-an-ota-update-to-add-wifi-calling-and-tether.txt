What's not to love? Well, so far our G2 hasn't been offered the update, which is, like, totally unfair. Also, if you've been messing around with a "soft root" on your G2, you'll probably want to hold off for now. Still, if this is legit and meant for the masses it's a pretty major score for current and prospective G2 owners: WiFi calling is basically a beautiful dream short of a desirable handset, and of course tethering is becoming a requirement in this Android-age.
