The new laptop will be purportedly named Eee PC 900, and should be the same size as the original, just with more screen to squint at. Other rumored additions include 1GB of RAM standard and SSD capacities up to 12GB. The base price will be 399 â‚¬, but hopefully that doesn't mean $600-ish in the US -- that conversion rate is certainly getting painful. While we can't vouch for the source of this rumor, Blogeee.net is claiming this is official word straight from Asus, so take that for what you will.[Via Eee Site]
