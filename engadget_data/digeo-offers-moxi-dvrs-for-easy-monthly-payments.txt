 Just in case Moxi's irrefutable mathematics weren't enough to sway you away from a TiVo, there's a new way to pick up on of its HD DVRs - via payment plan. Not to say they've gone all Rent-a-center on us, since both options for breaking down the $799 upfront cost (4 monthly payments of $199.75 or 20 monthly payments of $39.95) are both interest free, but with many buyers looking sideways at big ticket items these days, it could be enough to get customers off of the fence. Our initial impressions of he new hardware are here, and Dave Zatz mentions legal issues will restrict availability of the new pricing initially, but in lieu of actually costing less than a TiVo, is this enough to make you think again?
