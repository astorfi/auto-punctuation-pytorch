Now India's Ministry of Home Affairs wants to block the launch of the company's new push email service until a monitoring system can be put in place. According to The Economic Times, the Department of Telecommunications is being asked to hold back the service until the intelligence community has a way to spy on messages being sent. RIM recently fought a similar battle with the Indian government, as well as those in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Looks like the two companies share more in common than just their slip from the top of the smartphone heap.
