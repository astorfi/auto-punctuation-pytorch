Unlike the rumored Sensation Special Edition 2, the Runnymede 2 shares greater similarity with the Titan -- the 4.7-inch beast with a single-core 1.5GHz CPU and 9.9mm profile -- that was announced earlier today. Diverging from the Titan, however, the Runnymede 2 will be an Android handset with 768MB of RAM and an option for 32GB of built-in storage (along with the base level 16GB). Beats headphones are also rumored to be bundled with this bad boy, and HTC seems to take its imaging prowess very seriously with an 8 megapixel sensor and f2.2 lens that smacks heavily of the MyTouch 4G Slide. Of course, this all sounds very tempting, but it leaves us wondering what the hell happened to the Runnymede 1. Perhaps Mr. Chou decided this one was good enough to skip a generation?
