       In all the fuss about the possibility of Universal going format neutral, commenter h0mi made a great point; Where are those Fox Blu-ray titles again? So we headed over to Hi-Def Digest to take a look at what titles Fox has in store for us and what do you know, they didn't have any, thats right, not one title with a release date. What is even more interesting is that the last title from Fox (Other than Night at the Museum and Eragon) was released on February 13th, which happens to be about the same time as the AACS hardware key was discovered. Conspiracy theories aside, we want to know what happened to all those great titles we were promised during CES when Fox was touting how great Blu-ray sales were going to be this year.
