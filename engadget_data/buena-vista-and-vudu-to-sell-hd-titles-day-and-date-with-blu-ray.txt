Buena Vista has shown over the past year or so that it is willing to try new things and today that means you'll be able to buy HD and HDX titles via Vudu. This is the first major studio to make this type of commitment to digital purchases via Vudu and although we're not the biggest fans of the model due to limited viewing windows etc, we have to admit that having access to 60 HDX quality movies like No Country for Old Men is intriguing. No mention of animated features in the release though, which is a concern, but even so, we like knowing that there are higher quality digital downloads than Apple available for sale.
