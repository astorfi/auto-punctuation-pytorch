Visually and functionally, it looks like the same savory slate we saw tested in April, except with the all-important 1700MHz frequency commonly used by T-Mobile for HSPA cellular data. There's still no word on pricing or availability, but Sprint's EVO View 4G variant is pegged for June 24th, and rumor has it that T-Mobile could release the Flyer on the sixth of next month.
