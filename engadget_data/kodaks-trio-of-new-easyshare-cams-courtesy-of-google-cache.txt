The Z812 IS (pictured, top-left) is an 8.2 megapixel cam with 12x Schneider-Kreuznach Variogon zoom lens which doubles-up as a chubby 720p / 30fps video recorder. It's also said to feature a 0.23-second click-to-capture capability while packing optical image stabilization to help manage the shake and noise from that biggie zoom and reported ISO 3200 sensitivity. The V1253 (pictured, bottom) and V1233 then, are both 12 megapixel shooters that offer the same 720p video recording as the super zoom. The V1253 packs a 3.1-inch LCD to the 2.5-incher found on the V1233. Both lack any kind of optical image stabilization, however. Now come on Kodak, make 'em official with dates and pricing.[Via LetsGoDigital] Read -- Z812 (via Google cache) Read -- V1233 (via Google cache)Read -- V1253 (via Google cache)
