  We deal with enough fruitiness all day, so it's refreshing -- pardon the pun -- to see that Sony's ST25i Kumquat is leaving its citrusy roots behind for some good ole-fashioned corporate branding. A document found on the website of Indonesia's FCC equivalent lists the handset as the Xperia U ST25i, which lines up nicely with Sony's existing LT26i Xperia S nomenclature. Of course this also makes us wonder if Sony's planning to follow in Samsung's Galaxy-branded footsteps by creating an orchard of Xperia models. We'll just have to wait and see, right?
