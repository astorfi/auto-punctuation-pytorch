You know Halo: The Master Chief Collection's multiplayer has been, well, problematic since launch despite numerous patches. We know it and Microsoft does, too. That's why it's making it up to everyone who's played it with freebies. Those include a remastered Halo 3: ODST campaign, an overhauled "Relic" multiplayer map from Halo 2 and a free month of Xbox Live Gold. The former two won't be available for some time yet, but 343 Industries head Bonnie Ross notes on Xbox Wire that they'll be available gratis for anyone who's played between MCC's November launch and today. What's more, you'll also get an exclusive in-game nameplate and avatar for your troubles. And before you ask about ODST's killer wave-based multiplayer mode, "Firefight" making a return, the official FAQ is out to crush more than a few dreams (ours included) -- the outfit says it doesn't have any plans to include it for now.




If you're curious about exactly when the free stuff starts flowing, here you go: The month of Gold will make its way to gamers "as early as" mid-January of next year. For ODST and the re-imagined version of "Relic," you're going to have to be a bit more patient because neither of those are scheduled for release until sometime next spring. Given the timing, we're going to imagine that ODST will be more along the lines of what we saw with Halo 3 and Halo 4 rather than a full-on remake akin to the anniversary treatment that Halo 2 saw in this package. Nonetheless, we've reached out to Microsoft / 343 for confirmation, and will let you know if we get a response.
