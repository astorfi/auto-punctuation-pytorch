 Opera has been in the mobile web browser game for some time now, but it looks like it's set to soon shake things up considerably. As detailed in an internal video obtained by Pocket-lint, the company has been working on an all-new mobile browser dubbed "Ice," which ditches the company's own Presto engine in favor of WebKit (bringing it in line with the likes of Safari and Chrome). What's more, Ice looks to fully embrace a touch interface optimized for smartphones and tablets, with gestures replacing buttons and icons on a central home screen replacing tabs. You can apparently look for it to land on both Android and iOS sometime in February, with a new desktop version of Opera set to follow in March (details on it are comparatively light). Head on past the break for some highlights from the video.
