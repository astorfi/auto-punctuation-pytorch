 Outside of Sprint's Galaxy S III variant, no other carrier-branded models have been made to officially support Google Wallet. That's all set to change today with a maintenance update rolling out to owners of the US Cellular unit. Details of this maintenance release, uncovered by Android Police, outline a host of incoming bug fixes bundled in with Amazon's app suite and Mountain View's aforementioned mobile payment app. The leaked screenshot also indicates that other NFC-equipped devices on the operator's lineup could be joining the fray soon, though nothing's specified. You can go ahead and try to pull the OTA now, but for those of you with ants in your pants, a manual solution is available at the Samsung source link below.
