Sure, he'll humor you, go ahead and caption -- capshun, if you will -- him until you're blue in the face. He'll have the last LOL. Oh yes, he will. Josh F.: "The perpetual cat-hair, spot-cleaning cycle ultimately spelled doom for this unlucky Roomba, much like tic-tac-toe did in WOPR in 1983."Paul: "Must do no harm, must do no harm... wait, does that only apply to humans?"Chris: "HOVERCAT IZ ON UR CARPIT / STEALIN UR DIRTZ" or "iRobot's demonstration of Roomba's new 'fight or flight' algorithm is an unqualified failure."Laura: "What part of this is the food?"Thomas: "Take your complaints up with the staff, Rrrroomba. There's one holding the camera now."[Via bookofjoe]
