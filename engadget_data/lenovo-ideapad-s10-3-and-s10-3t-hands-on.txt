The 10-inch S10-3 throws away the design of the S10 and S10-2 for a thinner body and a decorated lid, and we've got to say the 2.4 pound netbook felt quite light and sturdy in our hand. Under the lid we're loving the same chiclet style keyboard that we saw on the Skylight, though the touchpad with integrated mouse buttons is a bit small for our tastes. For $399 ($379 on Amazon) the S10-3 seems like it could be quite a worthy 10-inch netbook competitor, though we will have to see what its Intel Atom N470 and three-cell battery (there's an optional six-cell) provide in terms of battery life.

The $499 S10-3t tablet version is going to take a bit more of a sell though. The convertible netbook (fine, netvertible) is thicker and heavier than the S10-3 largely due to its hinge and thicker touchscreen. But regardless of the somewhat awkward design (especially with a protruding six-cell battery strapped to its back), the capacitive touchscreen was quite responsive to our touches and gestures, and we're pretty impressed with Lenovo's Natural Touch interface that its got running on top of Windows 7 Home Premium. We also like that you can choose to flip the screen around and that the orientation will adjust automatically thanks to the accelerometer. But don't take our word for it, hit the break for a look at the finger-friendliness in in action.
