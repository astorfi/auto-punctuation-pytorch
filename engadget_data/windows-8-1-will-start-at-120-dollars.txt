If you already have Windows 8 installed on your PC, Windows 8.1 will be a free upgrade in the Windows Store. (But if you own a Windows 8 PC, you probably already knew that.) Now, Microsoft has revealed pricing for people who plan on installing Windows 8.1 on a system that currently runs some older version of Windows (i.e., Win 7). If you're just now making the switch (was it the return of the Start button that sold you?) you can expect to pay $120 for Windows 8.1 and $200 for Windows 8.1 Pro. Yep, the same prices you'd currently pay for a copy of Windows 8.


Interestingly, too, Microsoft will be selling so-called full-version software, which means you don't already need to have Windows running on your machine to complete the installation. All told, you'll be able to either download the software from Windows.com, or buy an old-fashioned box set in a retail store, if that's your thing. Whatever your preference, you'll have to wait until October 17th, just like the cool kids who'll be getting it for free.
