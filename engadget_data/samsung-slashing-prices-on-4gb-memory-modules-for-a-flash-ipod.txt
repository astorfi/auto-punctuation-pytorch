In what is one of the more encouraging signs sign yet that Apple is planning a flash-based version of the iPod mini,
Tom's Hardware reports that Samsung, which already supplies the flash memory modules used in the
iPod shuffle, has offered to
cut the price of its 4GB flash memory module by roughly 50% in order to make it competitive with the 4GB Microdrives
that Apple currently uses in the
4GB iPod mini. That'd
severely undercut every other supplier's pricing and make it possible for Apple to offer a smaller, lighter 4GB iPod
mini without a mini hard drive. That also means an iPod mini with no moving parts that could be damaged during
exercise.
