So far the release includes a version optimized for the iPad, but no native Honeycomb app just yet. Other restrictions include requiring Adobe AIR on Android (just like ESPN's app) and geographic restrictions on some of the content. Still, the apps are free so to our friends across the pond, we can't share our barbecues and fireworks today, but there are Market and iTunes links below so you can catch up on some Coronation Street.
