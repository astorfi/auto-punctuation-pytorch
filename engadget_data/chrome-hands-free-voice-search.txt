If you've wanted hands-free Google voice search (Ã  la Android's Now Launcher) on the desktop, you've so far had to install a Chrome extension. No more -- the company has released a Chrome beta that builds the feature into the browser. Any time you visit the Google homepage or open a new tab, you can say "OK Google" to ask a question or perform a command, such as scheduling a reminder. Testers running Chrome in US English should see the feature go live sometime within the next few days, and a matching Chrome OS update is coming soon. Don't worry if you'd rather not be an early adopter. Google typically releases finished versions of the software several weeks after the beta, so touchless voice search should be available to every Chrome user before long.
