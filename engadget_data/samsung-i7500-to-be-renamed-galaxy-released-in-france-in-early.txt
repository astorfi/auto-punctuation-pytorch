The French company will rebadge the device, calling it the Galaxy, which is certainly sexier than the numeric moniker. The quad-band GSM, tri-band 7.2Mbps HSDPA (900/1700/2100MHz) handset has a 3.2-inch, 320 x 480 pixel AMOLED touchscreen, WiFi, GPS, a 5 megapixel camera, 8GB of storage with MicroSD expansion for up to 32GB more. We're still expecting this bad boy -- which recently passed through the old FCC -- to make a possible T-Mobile debut this fall. [Via Talk Android]
