Nokia has announced on Twitter today that the 4-inch tilting QWERTY handset -- a phone Espoo has labeled the true successor to the storied Communicator series -- will start shipping out on the 10th of next month, though exact availability dates and times will undoubtedly vary a bit from market to market. The company has been quick to note that today's wild Symbian Foundation news has no effect on the existing range of Symbian^3 devices being launched as we close out the year, so the question is: who's buying?

Update: Nokia just clarified that it meant December 2010, not the 10th of December in its tweet.
