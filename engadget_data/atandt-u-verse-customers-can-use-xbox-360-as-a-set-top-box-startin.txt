As you can see from the internal memo above, a so-called Wired Release will roll out to AT&T U-Verse customers next Sunday, and it'll bring the long awaited feature with it (though you'll have to wait until November 7th for that particular aspect). This means AT&T U-verse customer's Xbox 360 will have a Dashboard app, and when launched, it'll let it function exactly like any other U-verse set-top. The only major catch is that it can't be the only set-top -- you'll need at least one DVR at another TV in the house to enjoy one of the four HD streams that could be funneled into your home. But hey, at least it's on the way, right? 

Update: A second anonymous tipster has chimed in with some interesting slides -- looks like your Xbox will need a hard drive!
