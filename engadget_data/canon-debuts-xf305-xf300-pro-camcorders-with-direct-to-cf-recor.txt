Then you might want to consider Canon's new XF305 and XF300 models, which both come in under $8,000 and not only offer the usual native 1080p recording, but support for recording directly to CompactFlash cards as well. Both cameras also use the same MPEG-2 4:2:2 50Mbps codec and DIGIC DV III image processor, and pack the same 4-inch LCD, 0.52-inch electronic viewfinder, built-in stereo microphone and dual XLR audio inputs, while the XF305 adds support for multi-camera or 3D setups as well. Hit up the gallery below for a closer look, and look for both cameras to be available in later June.
