The thin and light device measures just 13.6mm and weighs in at 1.15kg making it easily openable with just one finger. Of course, since the Z360's 13.3-inch 1080p IPS panel doesn't support touch input, there's an array of dedicated "Metro" hot keys along the left edge of the keyboard. Inside, you're getting a fourth-generation Intel Core i5 processor (alternate Core i3 and i7 configurations are also possible) which allows for the device to cold boot in just eight seconds. On the Z360's bottom right, you'll find two slots for microSD slightly hidden, as well as HDMI and wired ethernet ports around the device. LG hasn't made its pricing or release details known at this time, so stay tuned for those additional details.
