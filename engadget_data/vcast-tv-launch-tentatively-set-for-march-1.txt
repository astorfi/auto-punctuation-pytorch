According to a super-secret screenshot we've been leaked from deep within Big Red's hallowed halls, the Limited, Basic, and Select flavors of its VCAST TV service seem to be tentatively set for March 1. Our tipster points out that the chosen date gives them wiggle room to slip a week or two and still stay well within their Q1 launch target, so let's not clear our calendars on March 1 to run down to the corporate store just yet -- but the news is encouraging, is it not?[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
