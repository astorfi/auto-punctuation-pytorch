Turns out that the grainy image was real, as Bill Gates recently demonstrated a UMPC device from Medion at his CES keynote in order to tout a new version of Microsoft's Origami Experience user interface. In a move sure to please readers interested in the impressive specs list of the MD RIM 1000 -- 6.5-inch touchscreen, 802.11b/g WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0, onboard GPS, DVB-T tuner and webcam -- Medion's first UMPC is to be made available on Jan 30, which happens to be the same date that Microsoft plans to release this other piece of software you may or may not have heard about.
