Hot on the heels of all the Google I/O announcements today, the good people at Plex have let us know that a new version of its app is on the way for the newly launched Android TV. Plex for Android TV isn't a rehash of the Google TV app, but a whole new creature built for the new system. Coupled with Android TV's lovely new UI and features like voice control, Plex says users will have access to all-new ways to enjoy their media. We have to admit we're seriously excited to get our hands on yet another way to get Plex into our lives. None of this is available just yet, of course, so while we wait, have a peek at some screens of what the new system will look like.
