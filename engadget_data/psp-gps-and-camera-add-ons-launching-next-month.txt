 Although as yet there's no confirmation from Sony, it's looking increasingly likely that the official launch of the GPS and camera peripherals for the PSP will take place at the Tokyo Games Show on September 22. If the rumors are correct, then TGS will play host to information about the specs, pricing, and availability for the two mystical peripherals. Now we have something more than just the possibility of pretty, but pointless, leaked shots to look forward to, and it's about time: we first heard rumors about an official Sony-branded PSP GPS device way back at E3 '04.
