Apparently YouTube's first, tentative step into on-demand rentals (some sort of Sundance Film Festival cross-promotion early this year) went well enough, and the company's started offering an extended range of movie and TV episodes for your viewing pleasure. Depending on the flick, anywhere between $.99 and $3.99 will get you 48 hours access, paid through Google Check-Out. Not too many Hollywood blockbusters are on tap, but if you're in the mood for a documentary, indie, or foreign film, hit up the source link to see for yourself. Personally, we're holding out until Die Hard With A Vengeance becomes available.
