'Course, we'd already heard a few reports from early adopters that they had received shipment notifications, but now we can all rest assured they weren't just dreaming. Brace yourselves, MBA pre-orderers, your wee machine should be on its way soon, but it seems as though folks placing their orders as late as today will still face a "2 to 3 week" lead time.
