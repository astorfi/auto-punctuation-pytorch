We'll be coming to you live from the company's keynote at Nokia World in London, where we're expecting not one, but multiple Windows Phones to make an on-stage debut. The show kicks off at 9AM local time, and we've included a handy list of round-the-world start times below. Bookmark this page right here and find out as it happens.
