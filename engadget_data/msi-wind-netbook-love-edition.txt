 Just let that name sink in a little. Seriously, we couldn't make this stuff up. Our main point of contention is the emphasis on netbook love, or is this merely a love edition of the Wind netbook? Questions that need answers, MSI. From what we can tell, the only netbook loving that's happening here is MSI has slapped on a few hearts in various colors, and will be making charity contributions to Taiwan, China, Poland, Ukraine, Turkey, Russia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Korea and India to help kids there learn how to use computers. Oh, and you want to know what this charity is called? "Love with the Wind." We're dead serious. Would we lie to you on matters of such gravity? Well, probably. No word on exactly when, where, or how much these new laptops are going for.[Via Pocketables Forum]
