We guess all Japanese women really wanted in their
salary men was a place to rest their heads. Replace that and you get the natural result: Boyfriend Arm
Pillow, the plushie cross sectional chest, 90 degree outstretched arm and puffy-white sausage fingers. Looks like
it comes encased in an office-casual classy button down so naps at work are not out of the question, and the
arm contains an alarm which vibrates you awake (avoid salacious use). Only available in Japan for now, but the
manufacturer Kameo is looking to expand to other countries.
