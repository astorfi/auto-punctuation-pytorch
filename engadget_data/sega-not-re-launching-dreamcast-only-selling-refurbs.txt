As with most things that sound too good to be true, the rumored
re-release of Sega's Dreamcast console has turned out to
be just that: a rumor. Due to some shoddy translating of the Japanese Sega Direct site, an offer of refurbished
Dreamcasts was misinterpreted by someone to mean that the system was about to get a fresh production run. Sorry for
getting the hopes up of all you people looking to snatch up outdated hardware, but you can still take Sega up on their
one-unit-per-person deal on these used machines while supplies last.
