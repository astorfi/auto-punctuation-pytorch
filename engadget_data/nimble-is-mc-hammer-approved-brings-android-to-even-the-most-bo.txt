Not only that, but you might've built Touch Revolution's NIMBLe, which is a billed as a Home Touch Phone, but runs the Android OS and holds a full 7-inch touchscreen. The most basic functionality is that of a speakerphone, but obviously Android -- along with the built-in WiFi, Bluetooth and Ethernet connectivity -- opens this up to so much more functionality. Touch Revolution is actually dabbling in all sorts of hardware and software configurations, building a "Touch Device Development Platform" for farming out to companies for all sorts of purposes. Current builds include 600MHz StrongARM or greater processors, 128MB of RAM, 512MB of flash memory, SD card slots, 4.3-inch, 7-inch or 10-inch LCDs, 2 megapixel cameras and up to 800 x 480 resolutions. The unit we played with seemed responsive and only a little bit pointless, and we look forward to seeing this sort of thing hit the market -- we know MC Hammer would agree. Action video is after the break.
