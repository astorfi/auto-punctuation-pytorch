There are a lot of quality sound isolating headphones on the market, but something tells us you probably won't want
to be laying down the family fortune in order to get a pair. Thankfully we have
Shure's E4c line to keep us jacked in. Not only do
both they feature a complete ear fit-kit (including foam add-ins and small, medium, and large plugs), but these high
end isolators have a two year warranty â€” so even though they'll set you back a good $300, they'll probably be around a
lot longer than most of the devices they'll get used on. And if you're looking to go a little lower on the price scale,
we certainly don't know any gadget fans who'd snuff at last year's model, the now-$180 E3c line.
