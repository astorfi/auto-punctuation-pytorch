Whether you've got 33s or 45s, SeaGrand's forthcoming GENESOUND should make ripping vinyl to MP3 a lesson in simplicity, and if you're stuck back in the days of compact disc, it'll burn to CD for you as well. The mini-system includes a pair of stereo speakers, brushed aluminum face, a hint of vintage styling, headphone out, CD / LP playback, and there's even USB / SD ports to carry your freshly ripped tunes on flash media. As expected, there's no word on how much this useful invention will run you, but folks in Japan can start ripping through that vinyl collection (and reminiscing about the days of DRM-free music) later this month.
