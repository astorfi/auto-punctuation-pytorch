Not only is the laptop supposed to support dual touchscreens and consume a mere 1 watt of power, but Mary Lou is also promising better readability, multitouch, and potentially even pen usage and haptic feedback. Interestingly, the projected price for the laptop is $75, which is exactly the pricepoint PixelQi claimed to be working on when it split from the foundation. She remains coy on which OS the new laptop will favor, merely stating: "The display can use whatever software OLPC chooses." As for partners outside of OLPC, Mary Lou won't name names, but she says PixelQi is "working with large, tier-one laptop, cell phones, and e-book makers." Forget 2010, give us a full color e-book tablet by the end of the year and we'll forget all this XO nonsense entirely.
