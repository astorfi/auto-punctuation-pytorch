 Whether the two simply call the whole thing off or become a single unified company, Vodafone and Verizon could be "resolving" their relationship very soon according to Bloomberg. The oft-cited "people familiar with the situation" say that Verizon is considering ending its joint venture with Vodafone by purchasing back the 45 percent stake the European carrier currently holds in its American cousin. Another possible, though less likely, outcome is that Vodafone and Verizon could merge to form a single entity. Though, sources claim that previous talks towards that goal have hit roadblocks over leadership and headquarters location. The move would give Verizon slightly more power and freedom in the wireless market while allowing Vodafone to shed some its overseas weight. Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao has made it obvious that he's eager to sell off its non-controlling stakes in other operators. At the moment it doesn't appear that formal negotiations have begun, but the two companies have apparently had high-level talks about their various options over the last few months. Obviously we'll be keeping an eye out for more information and you can hit up the source link for a few more details.
