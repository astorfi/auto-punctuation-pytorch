As shown in the pic, LG has refashioned its billboards (which it already occupied for 20 years before the new neighbor moved in below last year) to mock Samsung's "4" themed advertising, touting that the Optimus G is "here 4 you now", among other messages. They'd probably have a better chance of grabbing our attention if the upgraded Optimus G Pro were here 4 us instead, but that's not an option yet. Still, we have to appreciate a prank pulled off well enough that it even scores some screen time in a Samsung promo video (at :49 and 2:04) embedded after the break.
