As seen in the scan, Mr. Doherty claims that "BD+, unlike AACS, which suffered a partial hack last year, won't likely be breached for ten years." As if that weren't comical enough, he also added that "if it were, the damage would affect one film and one player," essentially nullifying his prior claim of invincibility. Of course, he did mention that BD+ offered up "four times the safeguards on top of AACS against piracy," so we'll give the oh-so-inundated hackers about four times longer than usual to prove this guy wrong.[Via Slashdot]
