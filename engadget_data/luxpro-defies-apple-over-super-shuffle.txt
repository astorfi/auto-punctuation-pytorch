You knew it was going to happen: Stevie J. unleashed the lawyers on LuxPro, makes of that eerily suspicious-looking
Super Shuffle flash MP3 player that turned up last week.
Apple was actually able to convince them to remove all of the Super Shuffles in question from their booth at
CeBIT—but then they put 'em back out the next day so that the weekend crowd (they must have figured that Apple's
legal team doesn't work weekends) could peep them. Apple says they're "weighing their legal options." By now you
probably know what that means.
