Fitbit updated its iOS app today, bringing, perhaps most significantly, the ability to track "basic" activity on an iPhone 5s, without the company's proprietary wearable. Using Apple's motion-sensing M7 chip, the app'll track your steps, distance and the number of calories you've burned. You can also utilize features like food and weight tracking, fitness goals and add friends on the app by downloading it in the source link below and tapping on the "No Fitbit Yet? iPhone 5s tracks the basics" text. So you can start those New Year's resolutions now -- and, the company no doubt hopes, get in on the FitBit experience before picking up the wearable.
