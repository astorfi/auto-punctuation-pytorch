 After we thought Qualcomm and Broadcom had at least kissed and made up a little, Broadcom dropped a bit of a bombshell this week: the wireless chipset company asked the International Trade Commission (ITC) to ban the import of Qualcomm-containing mobile phones to the U.S. The handsets in question feature certain Qualcomm processors involved in the long-running patent infringement lawsuit between the two wireless companies. Broadcom told the ITC that Qualcomm would be "rewarded for patent infringement" activities if all Qualcomm chip-containing handsets were not banned from being imported into the U.S. In other news, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel and Alltel said they would immediately switch to GSM and give away free Nokia N73 handsets to all customers. Just kidding -- we can have fun too, you see?[Thanks, Wil]
