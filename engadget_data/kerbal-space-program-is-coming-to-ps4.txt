Imaginative rocket designers have good news out of E3 tonight, as the Kerbal Space Program team revealed that its quirky construction and space flight simulation is coming to the PlayStation 4. There's no release date yet, just the announcement, but it's yet another notable score on Sony's list of indie developer wins. Considering it took a couple of years for the original to go from Steam Early Access star to official release we wouldn't hold our breath, but hopefully the team has enough resources to make a quick transition to the console.
