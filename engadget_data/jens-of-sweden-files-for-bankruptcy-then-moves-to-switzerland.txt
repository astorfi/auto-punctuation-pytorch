Our favorite copyright maverick Jens Nylander told
reporters today that his MP3 player company
Jens of Sweden is bankrupt. Besides
fierce competition and an 8% (!) miscalculation on import duties, the company's decline was at least partly due to some
quality issues with their South Korean manufactured mp130 player. Jens remains steadfast, heartily proclaiming "It
doesn't matter how many times I go bankrupt. I'll still continue to sell digital products." Uh hmm. Jens of Sweden's
operations have already been taken over by a Swiss financed company called JOS. Err, anyone want to buy a digital
player from Jens of Switzerland?
