 As our own Matt Burns speculated, Panasonic's new line of Viera plasma televisions has been officially announced as coming to the United States. This is complete with the HDAVI (EZ-Sync) HDMI control functionality and 10,000:1 contrast ratio, but its hard to claim "most advanced" with a resolution of only 1366x768. Remember kids, scaling makes baby Jesus cry.The TH-58PX600U and TH-58PX60U come in with MSRPs of $5,999 and $5,499 respectively, with the cheaper model losing the electronic programming guide, PC input (RGB VGA) and four speaker ViVA HD3d sound. Built in NTSC/ATSC/QAM tuners, CableCARD and SD memory card slots are standard on both.Availability is listed only as Summer 2006. All very nice but really, we know you have 1080p plasmas and Blu-ray players coming, why the 720pish tease?
