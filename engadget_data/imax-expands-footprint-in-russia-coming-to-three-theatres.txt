Announced this week, IMAX Corporation has inked deals to get its digital projection systems into three separate venues in Russia -- one each in the cities of Sochi, Nizinhy Novogorod and Novosibirsk. Respectively, the agreements are with Luxor Cinemax, Electronika and Art Science Cinema Distribution. As it stands, IMAX theaters already operate in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kazan, but plans are to have a total of ten open in the country by 2011.[Via AboutProjectors, image courtesy of Pathe-IMAX]
