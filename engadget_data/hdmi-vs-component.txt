 In the mad rush for the latest and greatest, it's easy to categorize older technologies as inferior just because they're older. We've covered the topic of HDMI vs. component before, and there's definitely a lot of FUD behind the widespread belief that the newer HDMI standard is always "better." The bottom line is this, the gear on either side of the cable often has a far larger effect on final image quality than the cable itself. With well designed equipment, that old-school component connection may perform just as well as the HDMI one. Factor in HDMI's shorter reach, higher priced switching equipment, and mechanical stability issues, and you may end up with an inferior overall solution. Trust your own eyes and ears more than any marketing speak, as some of the push behind HDMI has nothing to do with image quality.
