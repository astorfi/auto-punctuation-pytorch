Looks like a ton of British newspapers were a bit duped by yesterday's story about iPod muggings and Apple's
nonchalant response that their customers wouldÂ "rather be robbed" than use headphones that weren't cool. Our pal
Adam, who works as a reporter in Britain, writes in:



I thought you should know the British iPod theft story is a total hoax, albeit one that landed on the front page
 of 3 newspapers!! I called Apple and the police station mentioned in the article, and they said the quotes attributed
 to them were completely fabricated. A local press agency quoted a guy who freelances for Apple (that was the 'rather
 be robbed' line) and some random police officer. There was nothing official from either.
