Best Buy, which originally sold the Scribe digital pen as an additional accessory, is now including it with the tablet, free of charge. A quick look at the retailer's online store shows the pair sitting side-by-side in perfect harmony, bundled in the same package for $499. This may not seal the deal for your indecisive mind, but at least now you'll be able to draw moustaches on your ex's Facebook pics without your wallet giving you dirty looks.

Update: Looks like Best Buy's pulled the combo. Guess we're right back where we started, eh?
