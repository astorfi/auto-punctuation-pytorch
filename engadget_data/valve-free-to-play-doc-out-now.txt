If you didn't make it to Free to Play's San Francisco premiere last night, Valve (yes, that Valve) has you covered. The Dota 2 tournament doc is now available on iTunes, Steam and YouTube for the very reasonable price of zero dollars. The Valve-produced documentary clocks in at a little over an hour, and, as SlashGear has noticed, the gaming giant has also released a few outtakes and behind the scenes clips as well. We've embedded everything after the break should you want to give it a peek for yourself. If you're in the dark about exactly why the game's so popular, maybe watching players from all over the world duke it out for a million-dollar top prize will clear a few things up.
