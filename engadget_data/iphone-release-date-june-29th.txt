       Take this one with a grain of salt, but we have it from a source that works in television who tells us that Apple's next round of iPhone commercials (three different spots) have been submitted for airtime, and at least one prominently features the magic number: release date on June 29th. (For the record, we've already heard rumors about it being on the 11th, 15th, 20th, and just about every other date in June.) That's all well and good, but there are some bits that make this especially sticky. Namely, these commercials are supposed to begin running next week -- that's before WWDC, when we were all hoping Steve would announce the iPhone date; however, the iPhone commercial(s) which actually feature the date might air after June 11th, so maybe that part is still alright. Also, the date of June 29th -- while still technically "late June" -- lands on Friday, and Apple is known for launching most of its products on Tuesdays. So hey, if it turns out to be June 29th, great -- but if not, don't say we didn't warn ya.Update: Looks like we're looking at a confirmation on the iPhone launch date!
