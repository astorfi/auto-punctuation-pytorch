From what we gleaned, we can expect it to havebuilt-in 802.11b/g for sending pics back to the mothership (sorry, looks like yet another software-driven solution, noFlickr support just yet), a 6 megapixel CCD, 3x opticalzoom, 3-inch 230,000 pixel display, 22MB of internal memory, and an SD slot. We're gonna guess it'll be announcedsometime soon (CES certainly isn't out of the cards).
      

 


Curvy.
