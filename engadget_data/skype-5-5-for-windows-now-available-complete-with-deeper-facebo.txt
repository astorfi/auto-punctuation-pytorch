According to Skype, that version includes a number of additional updates based on user feedback, but the standout feature remains the deep Facebook integration, which will let you call and IM your friends, update your status, and engage in other Facebook-related activities. Skype is also promising "enhanced video call reliability," and it's made yet more design changes that promise to "improve your overall Skype experience." You can judge that yourself by downloading the application at the link below.
