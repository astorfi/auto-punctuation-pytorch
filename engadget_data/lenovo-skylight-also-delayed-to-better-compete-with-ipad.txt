 This isn't the first time we've heard talk of competitors delaying products to see what the boys from Cupertino are up to. Last time, it was HP making some last minute pricing and feature adjustments to its Slate. Now we've got DigiTimes' sources claiming that Lenovo is holding up its Linux-based Skylight smartbook -- pushed from April to July -- for very similar reasons. Specifically, "control is not able to act as smoothly as the iPad." Guess even a 1GHz Snapdragon can't fix a poorly implemented UI.
