According to topproduct.nl, the laptop features a 15-inch display, 1600 MHz Intel Core i7 processor-720QM CPU (6MB cache), 320GB HDD, 4GB RAM, ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4830 graphics, a Night Vision Webcam with IR LEDs for fans of the "Paris Hilton" school of videography, a 6-cell battery, Windows 7 Home Premium, and more. Get a closer look after the break.
