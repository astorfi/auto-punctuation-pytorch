The N700 is the first bullet train revamp since 1999's Type 700, and uses a new form of Automatic Train Control (or ATC) to govern the train's speed and stability during curves in the track. Additionally, the N700 boasts a 30% increase in acceleration, which reduces the amount of time it takes to reach its maximum speed. Truth be told, it all seems like a lot of money and trouble for an extra 5 minutes -- if these cats really wanted to step up their game, they should speak with the French.
