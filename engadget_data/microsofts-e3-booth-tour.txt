We heard from a little birdie the figure on this thing was well into seven digits, and it's really no wonder. Similar to last year's, the giant two story building they installed on their huge spread of land in the south hall was nothing less than enormous, and that's to say nothing of the mammoth area they had for demo pods, their trailer theater, and the mini-booth dedicated to their newly rebranded Games for Windows initiative. Make no mistake about it, Microsoft showed at E3 and they weren't kidding around.
