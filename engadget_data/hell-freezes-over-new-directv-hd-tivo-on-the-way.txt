TiVo and DirecTV announced today that sometime during the second half of 2009, a new HD DirecTV TiVo will be available and will include "the latest TiVo and DirecTV features and services" -- there is however no word if this will include favorites such as TiVoToGo or Multi-Room viewing. Like the previous TiVo models made specifically to work with DirecTV, it will be sold and marketed through DirecTV -- at a yet to be announced price -- and as we've seen in other recent TiVo deals, DirecTV will continue to market and support its own DVR as a "primary offering" which is just fine with us, just so long as we have a choice in the matter, we're cool.[Thanks, Brad]
