Only to have our hopes and dreams smashed when we discover that it didn't work over 3G on T-Mobile. Well, it seems the carrier has quietly flipped a switch, and now all you Nexus owners can GChat face-to-face over HSPA+. Surely this an historic day, one that will go down in the annals of mobile history -- or, you know, at least one that deserves an exasperated "finally!" Check out the video proof after the break.
