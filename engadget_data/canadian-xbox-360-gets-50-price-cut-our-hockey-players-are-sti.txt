 While all those juicy Canadian money jokes are sadly behind us, the dropping US dollar does have one nice side effect, at least for those pesky squatters north of the border. That's right, Canadians are finally getting an Xbox 360 pricing scheme on par with us Americans, with the 360 Pro dropping from $399 to $349, the Elite dropping from $499 to $449, and the Arcade slouching from $299 down to $279. If it weren't for the fact that this price drop is long overdue and the exchange rate still has 'em forking over $5 extra, we'd almost be jealous of those hosers up north.[Via Xbox 360 Fanboy]
