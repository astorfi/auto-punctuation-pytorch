 Hungry for the fruits of Twitter's latest acquisition? According to AllThingsD, you won't have to wait long. The usual unnamed sources have told the outlet that Twitter's new music app is due out this Friday, April 12th. True to We Are Hunted's roots, it's said the app will focus on music discovery, suggesting tunes and artists based on various factors, including who you follow on a certain social network. Soundcloud, iTunes and Vevo will apparently do the heavy lifting when it comes to music and video playback, though -- the app won't be a digital music store. Twitter itself is mum on details at this point, but we'll let you know if a little bird tells us anything.

 Update: Twitter has now made a home for the new service, although we've not been able to sign in just yet. We're guessing that 'go live' switch will be flipped later today.

 Update 2: In the applications section of your Twitter account, should you choose to allow #music access, you'll notice a blurb describing the application as, "Trending Music Web by [blank]" and a note detailing it as, "the web version of the trending music app." Well, look at that!
