What other motivation could have prompted the Tweet above from Qualcomm's German Twitter account? Stay tuned, we expect to learn a lot more about this not so mysterious handset during HTC's press event later today. Until then why not peek the video after the break for a little brush-up on Snapdragon's dual-core capabilities.
