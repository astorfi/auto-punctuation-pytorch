Denmark's AIAIAI has developed a reputation for targeting its headphones at specific listeners. This time, it's aiming at someone we know all too well: the urban dweller who goes through replacement headphones like so much meat through a grinder. The Capital over-ears' bolstered fiberglass shell is designed to be rain- and snow-resistant, not to mention take the casual knocks that might beat up other headphone pairs. The foldable set likewise gives us every excuse to keep it on our heads, both through a light and reputedly comfortable brace as well as an in-line mic and remote to take that iPhone call through the Capital's 40mm drivers. At $125, the pair isn't the lowest-cost entry into the headphone world, but if it spares us from having to dive for cover when the weather turns foul, it could well be a bargain. You can get a sense of AIAIAI's impetus for yourself in a video after the break.
