Or at least that's what Samsung is hoping for with its latest model, the E428. This newcomer brings an elegant white case with lace-like designs on the front cover, sports a camera (we've got conflicting info on whether it's a 0.3 or a 3.0 megapixel version), and shines with a 65,000-color OLED 1.8-inch screen that supports 128 x 160, GPRS and IrDA. That's the good news; the bad news is we're not sure what upstanding, self-respecting woman would want to have a phone without Bluetooth, but perhaps there's something about royalty that we don't understand. If our information is right, the Samsung E428 should hit the streets of Taiwan sometime this month, for an unknown number of Taiwan bucks.Read - SlashphoneRead - Hand Cell Phone
