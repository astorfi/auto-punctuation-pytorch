They also tell us that it's "time to share," and apparently intend that sharing to go on between young, attractive Urban Outfitters models (according to the images on the notice). Okay. So what is this? Pink? Courier (gasp!)? Windows Phone 7 Series Phone Series 7? Only Microsoft knows for sure. We're searching for more info, so stay tuned! One more pic after the break.

Update: Windows expert Paul Thurrott says definitively that this will not be a Courier event, rather it will be entirely focused on Pink phones, as does CNET's Ina Fried, who adds that they'll be released on Verizon as rumored. We can't say we're surprised, but we're seriously hoping Microsoft makes that tablet a reality.
