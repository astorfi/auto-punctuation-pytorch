Fueling our previous info on the matter, we've now gotten ahold of an image purporting to be the logo that Sprint and Google will be using to represent their new WiMAX-equipped collaboration. That can be found after the break, but what you're really eager to learn more about is that image of a Motorola Xoom with a Now Network logo on it, right? Well, it comes from the same source, whose record of revealing Sprint pre-release hardware (and not getting fired) is quite exemplary, so we're willing to credit it as the real deal. We've no launch dates or pricing details to share as yet, but it's not unreasonable to expect Sprint will be disclosing all that juicy info during its extra-long CTIA presser. And if not, we'll keep tracking down these leaks and get it to you anyway!
