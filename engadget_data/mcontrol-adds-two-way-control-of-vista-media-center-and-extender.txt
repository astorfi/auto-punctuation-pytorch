If your imagination hasn't already starting running wild think about this; someone rings your doorbell, Battlestar Galactica pauses and a message box pops up on your HDTV, so you click the remote and now your viewing your front door camera. Until recently you had to be Bill Gates to have this kind'a stuff at your house, but thanks to companies like mControl, it's a reality even if you're on a budget. Another picture after the jump.
