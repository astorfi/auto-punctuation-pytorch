Quietly announced alongside two other vanilla lenses and its EOS 7D, the 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM lens is the first from the outfit to feature Hybrid IS. As you well know by now, said tech compensates for both angle and shift camera shake up to four shutter speed steps, and it's fully compatible with all EOS cameras. As you can likely tell from the title, this one's ideal for closeups and portrait-length telephoto shots, but you'll be paying through the nose in order to get it in your arsenal. In other words, you'll be parting with $1,049 come late September. Gotta pay for delectation, bub.[Via HotHardware]
