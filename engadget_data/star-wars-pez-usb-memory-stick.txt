They've already squeezed USB memory into pen,
watches and
fake sushi, but now with a little tooling you can get
your memory kicks in a Stormtrooper or Darth Vader Pez dispenser. A modder has figured out that the PNY
AttacheÂ and Lexar Sport JumpDrive, along with a little Dremeling and painting, fits perfectly inside a Pez head.
We assume other Pez dispensers will work too, so don't be surprised when you see a Garfield or Mickey Mouse USB Pez
drive soon.
