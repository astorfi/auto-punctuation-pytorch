 Rumors of a new smart watch are following more than just one particular tech company, and like Apple there have been suggestions Samsung is working on such a product. Bloomberg reports mobile executive VP Lee Young Hee said during an interview that "We are preparing products for the future, and the watch is definitely one of them." As to when, he only states it's "important to be the first one to commercialize it so consumers can use one meaningfully" -- something Samsung should know, since it's built many watch / phone combos over the years. " There's also no word on what a Samsung watch would be like (that's the S9110 touchscreen watchphone from 2009 pictured above) so until hardware is actually unveiled, we'll just have to use our imagination.
