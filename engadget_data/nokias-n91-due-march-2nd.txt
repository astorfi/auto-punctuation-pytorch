The word is --according to "insider sources," of course -- that they're busting out the phone on March 2nd in Taipei,Taiwan. There is also word that Nokia will be teaming up with Bose to augment Nokia's Bluetooth audio accessories we'vebeen seeing around, in the form of a 20 percent off coupon for a few Bose products. That's all we have to go on so far,but if all this is to be believed, at least we won't have long to find out.[Thanks, Subhush]
