Head-mounted display, movement sensors.... done. Sony Computer Entertainment's Shuhei Yoshida says that the company's been working on its Project Morpheus VR hardware for over three years and it's fair to say it's come a long way: the early model above features three Move controller modules, attached in what could be described as the Mickey Mouse formation. It's somehow cute, but also hilarious.The luminous pearl-finish headset revealed on stage is apparently still nowhere near complete, although SCE appear to have taken on board some of the design cues of Sony's existing head-mounted display series. There's more pictures after the break, with Yoshida himself channelling some Star Gladiator vibes with two different prototypes.
