The world's first GSM + WiMAX handset has been acquired by an evidently affluent individual who reportedly threw down around $1,300 in greenbacks in exchange for this gem. Those familiar with the HTC Touch HD won't find too many dissimilarities, but we'll stop bothering you with these "words" and allow you to give the images some careful attention.[Via wmpoweruser, thanks Daniel]
