If so, you should really take a look at the MX-6000, a swank new touchscreen two-way remote that it's introducing at CEDIA. Designed for use in controlling one's home theater and home at large, the device puts the menu navigation on its own 4.3-inch (480 x 272 resolution) display rather than cluttering up your TV. You'll also find twin RF transmitters: 802.11b/g WiFi for network control, plus narrow-band RF for traditional control. Oh, and if you're looking to turn your iPod into your own personal AV service, the optional PSX-1 ($349) is just the ticket. Too bad the remote itself will set you back $1,499 when it ships this month.
