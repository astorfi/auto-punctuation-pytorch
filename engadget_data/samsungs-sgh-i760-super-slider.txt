This unannounced SGH-i760 takes an SGH-i600 engine, halves the shell to create a QWERTY slider, and then drops in a 240x320 touchscreen for getting your PocketPC on. The result: a UMTS/HSDPA and tri-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE powerhouse sporting a 520MHz Intel processor, 802.11b/g WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0, microSD expansion, and a front-facing video cam with another 2 megapixel shooter 'round back all bundled up and spat out in a 115~154 × 57 × 19-mm / 119-gram slab of super slider action. No word on pricing or release yet, just more pics after the break.[Via MoDaCo]
