Sources intimate with the matter are reporting that Skype's planning on deploying Facebook Connect in the next version of its software -- meaning you won't need a Skype ID to get your internet telephony on -- while also enabling SMS messaging and voice or video calls to your Facebook contacts. You have to admit, whether you love or loathe either platform, this is an extremely sensible move for both companies to make: Facebook stretches its tentacles out even further, while Skype develops a significant presence on the world's biggest and baddest social network. We're sure there's a good side to this for the user as well.
