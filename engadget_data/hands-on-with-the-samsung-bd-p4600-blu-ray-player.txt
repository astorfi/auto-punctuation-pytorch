There is no doubt the new Samsung BD-P4600 fits in that category. For one it is one of the only Blu-ray players with a slot loaded drive, but on top of that it is wall mountable and is one of the first Blu-ray players to have an optional WiFi USB dongle -- see it attached to the top left of the player? Of course while these things make it unique they don't necessarily make it a good Blu-ray player, that will take a little more time to figure out.
