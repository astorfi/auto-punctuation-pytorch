No word on price yet, or whether this will be available at launch -- we'd say "eat your heart out, netbooks" but we won't, because they shouldn't. In even better news, however, the device will also work with standard Bluetooth keyboards like Apple's own wireless QWERTY slabs. Additionally, Apple will be selling a "camera connection kit" to allow you to plug your camera in over USB or use an SD card to import pictures. Finally, there's an Apple-built case for the device that protects the screen, but also doubles as a stand in two different orientations.

Not enough for you? We've got hands-on right here.
