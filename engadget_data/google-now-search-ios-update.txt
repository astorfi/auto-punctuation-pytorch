Google Now's been bringing all kinds of handy new features to Android in recent months, and now its time for iDevice users to get a slew of new functions too. With today's update to the Google Search app, the iOS version has gained notifications, reminders and several new types of cards. Plus, iPhone users can now simply say "OK, Google" to their handsets to start a Now-powered search. Among the new cards are those showing your event tickets, flight updates, car rental reservations and public transit info. Along with those very useful additions, the app's also received a revised, simplified homepage, some UI tweaks and one touch sign-in should you already be using other Google apps on your device. Sound good? You know what to do, hit the source and grab the update.
