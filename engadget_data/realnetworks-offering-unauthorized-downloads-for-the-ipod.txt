Obviously itching for a fight with Apple, RealNetworks is introducing some software that'll let you play downloads
bought from their online music store on an iPod (as well as plenty of other MP3 players, too). Apple doesn't see much
point to opening up the iPod to anyone else (which you gotta admit is just teensiest bit frustrating) and will probably
counter by changing the firmware on the iPod so that this won't work for very long (just like how they keep "upgrading"
iTunes so that it won't play files that have had the DRM removed). This means iPod owners who buy stuff from the
RealNetworks store could find themselves with a collection of music they can't play on their device, something which
you'd think would keep most iPod owners from buying from them, especially since the downloads cost exactly the same
price (99 cents) as they do at the iTunes Music Store.


 Opening up a little bit might not be all that bad for Apple, though, since this would make it easier for someone who
had say, a Rio Karma, to switch to an iPod because they wouldn't have to worry about whether or not they'd be able to
play their collection of digital downloads on it (though honestly all this format incompatibility nonsense reminds us
of why most people just download unrestricted MP3s off of Kazaa). Besides, if Apple is really serious about the iTunes
Music Store merely being a loss-leader to sell iPods, then should they really mind if RealNetworks or anyone else takes
the loss? If the iPod is really so great they shouldn't have to lock in their customers with a restricted file format
to keep them from switching to another digital audio player â€” they shouldn't want to switch in the first place.
