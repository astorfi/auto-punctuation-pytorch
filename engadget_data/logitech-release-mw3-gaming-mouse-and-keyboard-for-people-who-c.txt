Both are slathered in MW3 logos (so you don't forget what you've consigned yourself to for the next year) and come with some essential FPS features. The keyboard has "night-vision green" LED backlit keys, six programmable "G" keys to record macros and a game/desktop mode switch for those rare moments when you're really not meant to be MacTavish. Meanwhile, the mouse has on-the-fly adjustable DPI, up to five different player profiles, a color display and 28g (one ounce) of extra weight to adjust the mouse balance against your hand. They're both available from the Logitech website and will set you back $80 each.
