We got our first clear look at LG's curved G Flex smartphone in press shots just a few days ago, and now the device itself has popped up. The Verge points out tech journalist Frederico Ini of Telefe Noticias, a news program based in Argentina, has apparently obtained a prototype and brought it in to the studio for some hands-on pics and video. Curved from the bottom to the top (like the Galaxy Nexus) instead of side to side like Samsung's Galaxy Round, it also features rear mounted buttons just like LG's current flagship the G2. We've heard that the G Flex will feature a 6-inch OLED display when it's announced next month, although other details remain unknown.
