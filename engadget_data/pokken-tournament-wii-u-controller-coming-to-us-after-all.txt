When the Pokken Tournament Wii U controller from Hori surfaced earlier this month our excitement was quickly subdued when Japan seemed like the only place you'd be able to buy it when in launched in March. Well it's time to get excited again because it's going to available to a much wider audience at launch.



The Pok√©mon-infused fighting game controller popped up on Amazon for $24.99 with a launch date of March 18. First noticed on the online retailer by Destructoid, the controller is designed to mimic the arcade version of Pokken Tournament with the "ZL" and "ZR" buttons placed on its face instead of on the back like traditional Wii U controllers.
