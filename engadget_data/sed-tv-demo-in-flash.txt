We saw the Canon demo live, as well as Toshiba's, and were completelyblown away; we can't promise you'll feel the same as there's no way to truly capture the color, contrast, brightness,detail and fluidity of the real thing. This is probably the next best thing to being in the Canon SED booth and if youget the chance to see the demo in person, this will give you something to compare.View (Flashvideo) via HDtv Help
