That notable feature will let you keep your eyes on the road while the device calls out street names and directions. Otherwise, the device appears to be pretty much identical to others in the series, boasting a 3.5-inch touchscreen, pre-loaded maps of the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico, six million points of interest, and an SD card slot for expansion, among other standard fare. Look for this one to land sometime this month with an MSRP of $499.99.
