Three free months of Netflix with the purchase of Google's $35 Chromecast dongle sure sounded too good to be true. Turns out it was -- or at least too good to last longer than a day. Google's pulling the plug on the promotion, telling The Los Angeles Times that it couldn't keep things going, "due to overwhelming demand." So good on those folks who got in early, and while the streaming plug-in still has a pretty sweet price point, it's not quite the $11 post-subscription deal it was yesterday.
