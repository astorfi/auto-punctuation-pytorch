Following months of pressure from those damn hippies environmental activists, Apple is instituting
a free iPod recycling program. Plus, it comes with an extra marketing ploy bonus discount â€” if you
bring your old iPod to any of Apple's retail stores, you'll get a 10 percent discount on a new iPod purchased that day.
All the received iPods will be processed domestically, so don't worry, kids, all of those toxic metals will stay safely
on our shores instead of being shipped off to pollute the developing world.
