Internal company documentation clearly states that the aforementioned update won't be going down today, and there's no clear indication of when it will. To quote: 


"The OTA software update for the Droid by Motorola is TBD. A new date will be communicated as soon as possible. 

The 3/18 OTA software update will not happen as planned. A new date will be communicated as soon as possible." 

 We knew things were just too quiet after the noon hour, and now we know why. An impromptu support group meeting has been scheduled for 1:30PM ET, though we're hearing the location is still being decided...
