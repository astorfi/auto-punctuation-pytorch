After launching in June on the Mac with the promise of a Linux distro (and Windows, too) not far behind, this open-source media streaming application has finally gone live on Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04. The creators reckoned that by covering Gutsy Gibbon and Hardy Heron users, most everyone interested would be covered, and we have to say we agree with that assessment. It should be noted that said software still has potential kinks, and there are currently a number of alpha testers toying with it in order to send in feedback and get things ironed out. More intriguing here, however, is the possibility for this version to slide into set-top-boxes or standalone players that are built on Linux-based platforms, but for now, why not hit the read link and give it a go on your very own machine. Let us know how it turns out, alright?
