When we first got a desktop 3D printer at Engadget headquarters, we made a Weighted Companion Cube. And then a Mario figure. What can we say? We like to start small. Ivan Sentch, a programmer living in Auckland, is a bit more ambitious with his projects -- he sat down and started printing a replica of a 1961 series II Aston Martin DB4 on his second-generation Solidoodle, piece by piece. Sentch has been working on the project off-and-on since Christmas of last year, and is now finished with around 72 percent of the body. Once finished, he'll make a fiberglass mold of the print. Check Sentch's blog in the source link below for some insight into the process.
