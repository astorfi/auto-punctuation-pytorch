The Nokia C6-01 features an 8 megapixel camera and a 3.2-inch AMOLED screen with all-new ClearBlack Display (CBD) technology from the Finnish company -- touted to deliver better outdoor visibility. The 3.5-inch (also AMOLED) C7 gets more memory than its family mate and a stainless steel body, which Anssi Vanjoki thinks makes it the sleekest device in the world, "no doubt about it." Both handsets can record pixel-heavy 720p video and both will ship some time later this year, with estimated pre-tax prices of €260 ($334) and €335 ($430), respectively. Full PR after the break.
