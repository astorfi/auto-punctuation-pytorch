Sure enough, DISH has inked a deal with the "star" of FrankTV to headline its latest multimedia marketing campaign. More specifically, Mr. Caliendo will be pushing the provider's newest HD channels, "DVR leadership" and the aforementioned HD only package as well. Of course, such a gig shouldn't be hard to pull off for this fellow -- after all, he's "been a DISH Network customer for years." Or is that just part of the act, too?Read - DISH Network Features Comedian Frank Caliendo in Ad CampaignRead - Video of Frank's DISH Network adsRead - Outtakes of Frank's DISH Network ads
