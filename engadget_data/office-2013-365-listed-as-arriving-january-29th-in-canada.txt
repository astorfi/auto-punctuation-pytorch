 What is it with Canadian stores potentially spoiling launch plans? Fresh from revealing a white PS3 bundle on late notice, Best Buy Canada and its Future Shop sibling are both listing multiple entries for Microsoft's Office 2013 and Office 365 in downloadable and retail forms. We'll refrain from comments on pricing given possible cross-border markups, but all of the entries are shown arriving January 29th. Microsoft hasn't confirmed anything beyond its established first-quarter target, so take the date with the requisite grains of salt; any truth to the schedule, though, will leave just a short wait for productivity mavens.
