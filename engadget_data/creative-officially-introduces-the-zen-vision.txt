Is it us or is Creative really hitting all the right notes with the new
Creative Zen Vision?
It's been a while since we've been this annoyingly giddy about a new gadget, and while we're going have to reserve
final judgment until it actually comes out (we wouldn't put it past Creative to completely bungle the UI), the official
confirmation that it will indeed retail for $400 has us perilously close to pulling the pre-order trigger. The rest of
the press release mainly confirms stuff that we already know - like that it can handle playback of playback of MPEG2,
MPEG4, DivX, XviD, WMV, and MJPEG video files, and has a 3.7-inch, 640 x 480 pixel, 262,144 color LCD screen, a 30GB
hard drive, a CompactFlash card slot, a built-in FM tuner, support for TiVoToGo, and compatibility with PlaysForSure
and all of the "To Go" online music subscription services â€” but, man, is that some sweet action. Still no official
release date, we'll keep you posted on that.
