 
 With this year's National Football League season almost ready to kick off (not taking pre-season games into consideration, of course), DirecTV's properly preparing itself on all entertainment cylinders. The satellite provider announced earlier today that the well-known Sunday Ticket package will be returning to the PlayStation 3 on September 4th via a PS Store update, allowing current subscribers to stream full-HD games directly to Sony's renowned console. As for those without any current attachments to DirecTV, however, there is an option out there -- one which costs a familiar $300 per NFL season. We've still got a few days until the madness gets started, which should be plenty of time to get approval from your better half to snag the action-packed ticket.
