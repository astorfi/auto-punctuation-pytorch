According to at least one report, Bill Mitchell,Corporate Vice President of the Mobile Platform Division, showed a slide that outlined specs for the new PC category,including that it be wearable, always on, no larger than 10-inches, connected through 3G networks, pen-based, and havea suggested retail price of $500 or less. Sounds like something of a cross between Windows Mobile smartphones andtablet PCs (sort of like the Ruby concept PC, pictured) -- or arehash of the long-forgotten Windows CE-based "Jupiter" laptop platform, which didn't exactly take the worldby storm. One notable spec that could differentiate this one: Microsoft is apparently insisting that this run the fullversion of Windows. If the company really succeeds in that endeavor, this could be a hit; if not, we'll get one to keepin the basement, next to our Clio.
