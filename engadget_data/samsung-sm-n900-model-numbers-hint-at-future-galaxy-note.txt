Samsung is reportedly working on its third Galaxy Note smartphone in as many years, but there's been little in the way of official details. Thanks to some digging round the web, though, a few model numbers have come to light. Samsung's own user agent profiles mention two new Note family members, the SM-N900A and SM-N900T, both of which carry 1080p screens. Some extra sleuthing at an Indian importer has also revealed references to a root SM-N900 device as well as P, S, V and R4 variants. Unfortunately, there isn't much more to know -- while the naming schemes likely reflect different carriers and regions, there's no tangible clues as to where each model belongs. If some of these numbers resurface in the near future, however, we won't be surprised.
