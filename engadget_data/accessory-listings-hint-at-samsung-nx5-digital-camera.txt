While everything is still far from official, at least one online retailer is now listing a number of accessories that are apparently compatible with both the NX10 and a hereto unheard of NX5 camera, which would presumably be a less expansive, possibly more compact version of the NX10 (pictured above). That's backed up somewhat by a rumor that K-rumors has heard, which suggested that the NX5 would lack a built-in EVF and run between $499 and $599 depending on your choice of lens.
