The big deal is that shows recorded on your box at home can be streamed to your phone from any WiFi hotspot, a nice little bonus for U-verse subscribers who haven't ponied up for something like a Slingbox. We don't have a launch date yet, but what we saw demoed today certainly looked like it was just about ready to go -- and fortunately, they'll be bringing the app to a number of platforms, not just the iPhone alone. Follow the break for a few more shots of AT&T's David Christopher demoing the goodies on the overhead.
