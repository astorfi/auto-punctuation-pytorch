Starting March 5th in Japan, the new colors matched with a 2200mAh battery will set you back a tax-inclusive price of ¥19,800 (about $223). Otherwise, you can drop ¥24,800 (about $279) for the 4GB Memory Stick PRO Duo (Mark2), PSP pouch, wrist strap and cloth bundle. Now go ahead, revel in your paganism before ritualistically prostrating yourselves at the feet of the Lord Knight of consumer electronics. Mmm, feels good doesn't it?[Via Akihabara News]
