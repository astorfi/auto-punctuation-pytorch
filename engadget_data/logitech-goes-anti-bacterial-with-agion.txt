 Not only are specialized products with anti-microbial stuff on 'em coming out left and right, but some gadgets will protect you even when you didn't know about it. For example, you know that Logitech Cordless Desktop MX 3200 Laser keyboard and mouse combo that you just dropped $100 on? Well, we just found out today that it packs AgION's silver-based anti-microbial protection as a hidden feature -- so if you already have one you just scored yourself some awesome protection against germs, microorganisms and also discoloration to boot. Now of course, you could just wash your hands every time you start or stop using your keyboard and mouse, but we all know that geeks are pretty lazy -- so the obvious solution is to just buy one of these keyboards and mice. So, we're totally ditching our bacteria-infested keyboards for this one right this very second, because that whole hand-washing thing is so 20th century.
