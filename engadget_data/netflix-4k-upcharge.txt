Similar to the upcharge to get Blu-rays in the mail over DVDs, Netflix is implementing a higher price for 4K streaming too. New subscribers and folks who already weren't using their UHD screen to watch House of Cards in 4K will have to jump into the $11.99 per-month family plan, according to HD Guru. Following its tradition of rewarding loyal customers though, if you were using 4K streaming prior to early October, you're grandfathered in at $7.99 a month. As Variety tells it, that lower subscription rate will continue indefinitely, and that the price change actually took effect on August 12th. So what will the very specific crowd that this affects get to watch? Well, aside from mainstays like the full run of Breaking Bad, there are a few new additions too including Ghostbusters and its sequel, the nature doc Moving Art, NBC's Blacklist and, uhh, The Smurfs 2 -- you know, for the kids.
