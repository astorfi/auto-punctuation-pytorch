TWCable TV 2.0 is scheduled to arrive on June 28th with new features including a seven day program guide, and the ability to use it as a remote control or to schedule the DVR remotely. Around that same time, its cable headends around the country will deliver the "Florence" update that brings its OpenCable Digital Navigator software to version 4.5 on certain Cisco, Motorola and Samsung set-top boxes. That should bring them up to speed with other platforms it uses, adding the ability to delete recordings in a multiroom setup, a transparent GUI, enhanced Start Over and Look Back features, settings to control aspect ratio, output resolution, pictures size and more. This may yet be the year we get to ditch the cable box, but while we still live with them you can see the full list of upgrades and which boxes will get them in the gallery and after the break.
