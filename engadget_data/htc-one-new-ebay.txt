Given the vast number of leaks about HTC's all new One, its upcoming flagship launching March 25th, it's almost surprising that it was this long before we saw a retail unit sold on eBay. But hey, it's finally happened, although we must say we're a bit puzzled as to why the sale only netted $500. Naturally, the final retail price will be a bit higher than that. Regardless of price, the fact that it comes in its packaging is more important because it has most of the specs listed on it.



We can't take this as official confirmation of the phone's specs -- it's all mere speculation until the One launches on the 25th, so it could still easily change between now and then. However, the box tells us we can expect a 2.3GHz Snapdragon 801 chipset, a 5-inch 1080p display, microSD slot for expandable memory and 32GB internal storage, a 5MP front-facing camera, UltraPixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, a Nano-SIM slot and 2GB of RAM. Curiously, the eBay listing has been taken down already, but it appears that the damage is already done and the phone is likely already on its way to the lucky winner.
