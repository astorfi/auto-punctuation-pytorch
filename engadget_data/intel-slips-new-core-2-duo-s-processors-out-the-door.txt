The new 45nm processors boast same 1,066MHz system bus and 6MB of Level 2 cache as the newer Core 2 Duos, and will apparently be available in 1.6GHz and 1.86GHz versions to start with (dubbed the SL9300 and SL9400, respectively). That, of course, hasn't stopped folks from speculating that Apple will once again go its own way and push well past the 2.0GHz mark for its seemingly imminent MacBook Air revision, but we'd recommend waiting for some official word out of Cupertino before getting too excited about that tantalizing possibility.
