 Technology companies went wild bidding on generic top-level domains (gTLDs) once the opportunity presented itself. That seemingly impulsive behavior hasn't sat well with the Government Advisory Committee, which just posted a list of its member countries' initial 250 objections over the internet gold rush. While the list is broad, Amazon and Google (under a Charleston Road Registry proxy) have received a disproportionate amount of the flak: Australia, for example, isn't happy that far-reaching terms like .book and .search might be owned by individual companies. The resistance automatically puts the perceived offenders' backs to the wall -- they have to either make a good case as to why they need a disputed gTLD or risk losing both the domain as well as 20 percent of the refunded claiming fee. ICANN remains optimistic that the first gTLDs will still go into use by May, but it's entirely possible that the final list will be much thinner than what we saw in June.
