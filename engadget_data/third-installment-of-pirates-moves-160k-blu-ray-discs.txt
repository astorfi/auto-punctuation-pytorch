 The Nielsen VideoScan numbers don't come out 'till tomorrow, but Video Business is reporting that the latest installment of the Pirates franchise has sold 160k copies in its first week. This puts it right behind 300 as the number one selling HD title -- Paramount claimed to have sold 190k copies of Transformers, but this was debunked by industry analysts. This will no doubt ensure a great week for the blu camp, but time will tell if it has the legs of Transformers or 300. While this is certainly good for blu, we can't wait till next week to see how the latest Harry Potter title does since it's available for both formats.[Via FormatWarCentral]
