We've no idea who Sakakibara Kikai are, apart from having a vague
inkling that they may have the odd screw loose here and there, but they've come up with a two-legged,
person-carryingÂ robot vehicle that looks like it'd be ready to audition for a live-action Gundam film at the drop
of a hat. Admittedly the Land Walker doesn't so much walk as shimmy its 3.4-metre-tall bulk around the place (looks
like there are wheels under those feet), and it tops out at a less-than-threatening 1.5 km/h, but it does have the
looks, and even a pair of guns (which fire squishy balls, unfortunately). They also have some
video of it, well, sliding around.
