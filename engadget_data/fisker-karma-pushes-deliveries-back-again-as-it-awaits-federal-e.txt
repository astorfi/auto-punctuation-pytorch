This time, though, the delay is largely out of the company's hands, as it's simply waiting for final federal certification on emissions regulations before it delivers the first test vehicles to dealers. According to the company, the first of those are now expected to be delivered by the end of September, although at least some dealers apparently won't be fulfilling orders until the first week of November.
