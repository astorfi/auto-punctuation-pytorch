OK, who are we trying tokid: we did the same thing and in my case, I actually muted the audio. There were no indications that ABC's 720p feedlooked better than the 1080i feeds provided by CBS and NBC. No big surprise there since having a progressive scan feedtypically only assists with smoothness of motion. On the plus side, the 31% result of folks actually watching on asingle channel didn't beat the latest result of the Presidental approval rating. It was close, though.
