You won't find much here that you don't already know about the 4.3-inch Thunderbolt, but you do get to hear from a bunch of HTC's bright lights, including Sense UI designer Drew Bamford, on the motivations behind the company's designs. And hey, there's no harm in seeing that marquee device in the flesh again, is there?
