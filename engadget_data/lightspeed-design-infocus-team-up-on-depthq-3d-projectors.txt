 Although high-end projection makers have been figuring out this whole 3D beaming thing for awhile now, Lightspeed Design and InFocus are looking to bring the technology to a wider audience with the introduction of its DepthQ stereoscopic 3D projectors. Available in XGA and WXGA flavors, these PJs promise "rock-solid, 120Hz stereo 3D at 1,280 x 720 or 1,024 x 768 resolution" and feature Texas Instruments' DLP / BrilliantColor technologies, a 2,000:1 contrast ratio and a total weight of just 6.9-pounds. Best of all, these undercut most other single-lens 3D projectors by coming in somewhere under $6,000 apiece, though exact numbers have yet to be disclosed.[Via AboutProjectors]
