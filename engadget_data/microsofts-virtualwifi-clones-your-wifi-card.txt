Just to remind all the haters that Google Labs isn't the only research game in town,
Microsoft Research has just
busted out VirtualWiFi: a bit of software that makes your computer believe a single
WiFi card is multiple configurable cards, allowing
connections with multiple networks. There are all sorts of applications for this — beyond tricking people into thinking
that you have more WiFi cards than them — such as connecting to multiple ad-hoc networks, or getting your internet from
a for-pay WiFi subscription and then sharing it over ad-hoc (Engadget does not endorse any such usage of VirtualWiFi
and predicts that your laptop will turn into a heap of ash if such usage is attempted). Sounds like fun, no?
