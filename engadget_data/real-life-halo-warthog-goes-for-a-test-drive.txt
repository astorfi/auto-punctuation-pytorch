Because seriously, this is one helluva ride. And seriously, we're like totally jealous. Based on a Nissan Patrol 4x4 truck platform and built for Peter Jackson's abandoned Halo film, this is not a prop -- rather, its a fully working beast. The six-cylinder, diesel, automatic bad boy sports full four-wheel drive, a custom chassis, and for the lucky driver they do have a set or two of United Nations Space Command Marine armor available. This vehicle is currently billeted in New Zealand, so if you're in the area stop in and ask for a ride. What could it hurt? And tell 'em Engadget sent you. More pics after the break.
