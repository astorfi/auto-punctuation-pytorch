Our source had the opportunity to play with the RAZR M for a solid amount of time, and told us that the Snapdragon S4 processor is "fantastic" and the lithium polymer battery resulted in a full day of heavy usage. We've got a few more images of the unannounced device below (it appears the top back panel experienced a run-in with a hard surface before the images were taken), and we also have a video showing off the boot-up process and settings menu after the break.
