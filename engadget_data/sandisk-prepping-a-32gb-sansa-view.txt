Of course, there's no indication when this bad boy might come out, but those of you who had just gotten comfortable waiting for the right View probably don't mind waiting a little longer.[Via DAPreview, thanks Vizion]Update: Looks like it could be false alarm. Pretty much every player on SanDisk's site is showing sizes up to 32GB, even the device we know damn well don't havethat much storage, like the mysterious new 8, 16, and 32GB TakeTV, e200 series, etc. Thanks, Clay!
