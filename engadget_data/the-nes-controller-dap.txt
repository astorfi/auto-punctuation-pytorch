You know, people will turn an NES
controller into just about anything, and lord knows we love 'em for it. This dude apparently got bored one Saturday
and figured what else does one do on such a day but turn a cheap USB stick MP3 player into an NES DAP? Indeed. Witness
the fruit of Martin's efforts, fully controllable by the NES controller's buttons and chargeable via USB, and then go
figure out how to make yourselves more useful on boring Saturdays, will ya?
