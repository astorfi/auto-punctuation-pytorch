 The humble yellow cab hasn't changed a whole lot over the years, but now that new, greener methods for powering cars are starting to verge on mainstream acceptance, prototypes for reforming the city vehicles are starting to appear. At the New York International Automobile Show next month, the Taxi 07 project will be exhibiting a group of these prototypes which include Hybrid Technologies's lithium-ion battery powered taxi, a taxi based around the Kia Rondo crossover vehicle design, and "The Standard Taxi" which can accommodate wheelchairs, motorized scooters, and baby strollers. Alongside these designs will be the "World's Fastest Taxi", a hydrogen powered car that can produce 1,000 horsepower and hit 200MPH, and a "high rider" Crown Victoria cab with raised ground clearance and large wheels. All these and more will be showing at the exhibition, where our green colleagues over at Autoblog Green will be there to document all the yellow action.
