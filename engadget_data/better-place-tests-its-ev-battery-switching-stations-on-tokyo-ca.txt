In Tokyo, cabs account for only two percent of the traffic, yet they produce twenty-percent of its CO2 emissions -- a fact that further drives home the point that greening our public transportation is an important first step in cleaning up the environment. The study comes hot on the heels of other deals in the works for Israel, Europe, and the San Francisco. Albert Hockenberry would be impressed.
