Granted, it's not a 3D printer in every home, but it's surely a step in the right direction. MakerBot announced today that its Replicator 2 will be joining Amazon's new 3D Printer Store, a central location on the site for devices, accessories, books and the like. The store features a number of other devices from the competition, though MakerBot seems to be far and away the biggest name involved at the moment. Surely the days of printing up those Amazon orders can't be too far off, right?
