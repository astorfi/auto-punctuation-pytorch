Claude Veraart, a Belgian scientist working on a pan-European effort to develop artificial retinas, says that a
prototype has been implanted into two patients. The device works by relaying signals from an eyeglass-mounted digital
camera to the optic nerve. According to reports, 15 teams of researchers are working on related projects throughout
Europe, and the European Commission expects a commercial version to be available by 2008 or 2010. Veraart puts the
price of the device at around â‚¬20,000.
