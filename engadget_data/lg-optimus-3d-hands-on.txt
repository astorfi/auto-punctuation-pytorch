The 4.3-inch glasses-free 3D display's effect in games, film, and even the UI is pretty convincing using the set's applied parallax barrier technology, which is otherwise unnoticeable while the effect is off. Best bit? You can film your own 3D videos using the dual cameras on the back then watch them on your 3D set via HDMI. The Optimus is by no means a tiny set, though, still pretty comfy when held. Material choices are top notch -- as we'd expect hope for in a high end device -- and as you'll see in the vid, it is plenty fast with no lag getting in the way of the little demo we had. So why not take a few minutes to admire the pics and videos (which unfortunately will be very flat for your eyes) won't you?
