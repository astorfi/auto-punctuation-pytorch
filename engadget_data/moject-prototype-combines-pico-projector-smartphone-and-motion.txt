One area where it hasn't quite taken over in full force is the mobile sector, but Dave & Adie are angling to change that. Their Moject (short for Motion Projection) project has led to a prototype device that straps onto an iPhone, providing a pico projector for the phone and using the handset's internal sensors to recognize movements. A demo title has also been crafted to demonstrate how it all works, and while the iPhone is obviously just the beginning of where this could go, you owe it to yourself to give the video (hosted just after the break) a look. And the jams aren't too harsh on the ears, either.
