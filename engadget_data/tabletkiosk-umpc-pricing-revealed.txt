 Ok, here we go folks, a UMPC with anannounced price, ready to order. First from the gates is the TabletKiosk V-700 or rather,"eo" UMPC v7110. Now, forget what you heard about these pups dropping for around $500 to help position thembetween the handheld and laptop market, mkay? This UMPC sportin' a VIA C7 NaNo 1.0GHz processor, XP Tablet PC edition,30GB disk, 7-inch 800 x 480 TFT touch LCD, 802.11b/g, Bluetooth, and 256MB RAM will hit the last week of April for, getthis, $900 freakin' dollars! Now consider for comparison, that you can get a Dell XPSM140 laptop which also won't fit in your pocket but has twice the screen size, double the processing power, doublethe RAM, and double the disk for $50 bucks less and we just gotta wonder... why TabletKiosk, why? Sure, prices will godown with time, but that's not exactly the most auspicious start.[Via GottaBeMobile]
