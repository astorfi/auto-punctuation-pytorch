Three University of New South Wales students
have developed the Rockpool, a waterless dishwasher, and it's such a success that it will be Australia's entry in the
Electrolux Design Laboratory competition to be held in New York.  The dishwasher uses "supercritical carbon
dioxide" to create a fluid that acts as a powerful grease-cutter and solvent without the use of any water.  The
technology isn't brand-new—it's been used in industrial cleaning applications for years—but this is the first time the
technology has been used for consumer purposes.  Hopefully, this means installations won't be dependent on nearby
plumbing. But, carbon dioxide? Will using carbon dioxide leave dishes smelling lemony fresh or more like that
bad-breath smell that fizzes up from soda?
