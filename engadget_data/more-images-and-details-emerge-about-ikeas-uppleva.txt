As far as specs, it seems that the sets will be available in 24, 36, 40 and 46 inches and all are LED backlit. They'll also all sport WiFi and "smart TV" features including the Opera browser -- except for the 24-incher, which must accept its role as the runt of the litter. The TVs will also come attached to three different TV bench designs in six different finishes. While we weren't able to score our own units yet, M3 did and you can check out their hands-on out at the source link.
