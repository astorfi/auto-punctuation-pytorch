 Despite the fact that LCDs are really taking off in the HDTV marketplace, PDPs set a new unit sales record for Q3, according to DisplaySearch. Despite Q1-Q2 numbers being below the previous year's numbers, plasmas showed a rebound in Q3. Credit goes to lower prices and availability of the fact-tag-friendly 1080p panels. The pinch from LCDs is being felt though: the 50-inch and above regime accounts for almost a third of sales and half of the revenue in the PDP market. And despite the rise in unit sales, on-year revenues for PDPs were down 31%, so you know competition is fierce out there. These PDP numbers are a case of rising HDTV sales across the competing technologies, which is good for us consumers!
