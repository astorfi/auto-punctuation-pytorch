 20, now that's a sizable figure. Mediacom is fixing to switch off its analog service and move to all-digital in the Cadiz, Kentucky region, and with that will come quite a few new high-def channels. The carrier is already warning folks that they'll need an internal ATSC tuner or digital set-top-box to receive programming after November 19th, and on that same day, the new high-definition stations will hit the EPG as well. No word on what exactly those channels will be, but surely you'll find one or two out of 20 you can enjoy.
