Apparently, GameStop / EB Games locations have already received displays and instructions (posted after the jump) to lower the Core's price down a few notches starting on April 3rd, which means that you should put your PSP shopping trip on hiatus until tomorrow rolls around. Of course, this leveling out of pricing doesn't come to anyone's surprise, but if you've managed to both hold off on a PSP until now and still have an urge to pick one up outside of the used market, Wednesday's your day.
