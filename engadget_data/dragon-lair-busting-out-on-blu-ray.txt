 Remember Dragon Lair? (if not, it was transferred to HD via the PC last year) The 2-D interactive adventure that shipped with the Pioneer LD-V1000 laser disc player is coming to a whole new generation of dragon slayers via Blu-ray. The title should eventually become the showcase for Blu-ray's interactivity - that is if the title is ported well. We don't have an official release date just yet, nor a a price for that matter, but Dirk the Daring should hit shelves sometime this summer.
