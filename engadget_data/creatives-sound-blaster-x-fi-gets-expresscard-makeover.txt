Sure, you could've been enjoying the X-Fi niceties on your lappie for some time now via the external USB module, but the forthcoming iteration tidies up the breakout-box mess by cramming the bulk of the magic right inside your laptop's casing. The Xtreme Audio Notebook card touts an optical out / headphone jack, optical in / microphone port (seen after the jump), and a connector to sync up the presumably included external module, which will likely add even more connectivity options for use in park. Sadly, there's no word yet on when this device will hit store shelves, nor how much it'll cost you when it finally does, but if you've managed to hold off on buying one of the less glamorous external options in hopes of this one becoming a reality, you're probably sold regardless.[Via DailyTech]
