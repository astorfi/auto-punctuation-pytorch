Now, after the company announced a free module to fix this, Land of Droid has managed to snap the first pictures of the Transformer Prime GPS Extension kit, adding that it looks likely to get an official reveal sometime today. This not-particularly-subtle add-on apparently improves GPS performance noticeably and attaches to the base of the tablet, meaning that you won't be able to juggle both keyboard typing and location functions. The source below packs several more blurry shots of the dongle on its own -- if you're into that sort of thing.
