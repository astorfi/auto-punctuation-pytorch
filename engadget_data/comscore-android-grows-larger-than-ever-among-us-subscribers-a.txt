Google conquered most users' territory with Android climbing just over five percent (now totaling 36.4 percent) and still claiming first for mobile software platforms. Apple's iOS destroyer took second place (at 26 percent) partially due to RIM's S.S. BlackBerry OS sinking about five percent (now 25.7 percent) to claim third, while Microsoft and HP / Palm rounded out the bunch struggling to stay in the fight with even lower single-digit scores. In the OEM region Samsung claimed first yet again (although slightly dropping to 24.5 percent), with LG and Motorola landing in second and third respectively, each keeping its place from the prior quarter. In the last two slots, Apple again bested RIM whose devices barely dropped half of a percent, but enough to let the slight growth of iDevices snatch up 4th.
