A smashed toy isn't entirely unprecedented, and some
even pay for the honor, but we think this one ups all of
that â€” smashmyipod.com raised $400 to purchase a brand new
iPod with video (hey Apple, when do we get to call it the
video iPod, already?) and smash it to smithereens while actually inside the Apple store. They've filmed the
event, and we're totally looking forward to seeing the look on some of those Apple Store employees' faces as it went
down. Anyone else got odds that the video will be scored to the soundtrack from the opening sequence of
2001?
