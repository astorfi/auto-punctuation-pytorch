 While there's certainly no shortage of handsfree liaisons made for your whip, we're not going to complain with a bit more competition, and BlueTraks is trying to make a name for itself by hitting us up with the nicely-spec'd BT-211 series. The 5.45- x 2.9- x 2-inch design most definitely avoids any hints of a curve, but the 4.3-inch WQVGA touchscreen display, miniSD card slot, and iPod connectivity help to alleviate the questionable styling. Aside from touting Bluetooth, voice recognition, and a front-mounted USB 2.0 port, this nifty conglomerate also boasts a few inputs / outputs (pictured after the jump) not typically found on a run-of-the-mill handsfree kit. On the unit's rear you'll find ports for your iPod (along with a tailored control interface), any other DAP, a hardwired hookup to your factory amplifiers / speakers, audio in, and in a forthcoming rendition, satellite radio and even a navigation interface for those thinking about installing this in their dash. Sadly, we've no hard dates regarding availability, nor any indication of a price range, but we definitely dig where this handsfree car kit is going.[Via NaviGadget]
