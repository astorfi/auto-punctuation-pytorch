Then again, you'll likely find ViewSonic's 5-pound PJ513DB marginally cheaper on the street, and of course, it's quite obvious the outfit was aiming this one at those deep-pocketed boardroom bigwigs and district superintendents. Nevertheless, this DLP PJ promises to toss up a visible image even in well-lit rooms, and you'll find composite / S-Video / component inputs 'round back to go along with the VGA in / out ports and the audio input. Knock off another Benjamin or up that resolution a hair, and maybe then we'll talk.[Via Electronista]
