 Take the following information with the usual grain ofsalt; when it comes to speculation about Apple's intentions, nothing is ever certain until the esteemed Mr. Jobs is onstage, product in hand, delivering the pitch. This time around, we have word from AppleInsider that American TechnologyResearch analysts are reporting that their most recent "checks" indicate impending capacity doubling for theiPod nano line-- to 4GB and 8GB -- as well as the addition of"basic video capabilities," in models to be released during the "September quarter."Â  If true,none of these developments would be all that shocking, as the current nanos already have sharp little color screens, andstorage boosts are just a natural part of any digital audio player's lifecycle. ATR's Shaw Wu also seeminglycontradicted earlier AppleInsider info when he cited an anticipated June/July release window for the as-yet-unannounced 13.3-inch Intel-powered Macbooklaptop, which AI had previously suggested would be available sometime before June.
