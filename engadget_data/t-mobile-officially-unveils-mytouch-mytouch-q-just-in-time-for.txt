The 4G-capable myTouch and myTouch Q are everything the leaks indicated, with the former sporting a 3.8-inch touch screen and the latter coming home with a 3.5-inch screen (no word on the display tech used in either one) and landscape sliding QWERTY keyboard. Both run Android 2.3 out of the box on a 1GHz Qualcomm CPU and 5MP / 720p cameras, with the myTouch throwing in a front facing shooter for your video conferencing enjoyment.
