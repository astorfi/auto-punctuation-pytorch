 If you didn't get the hint from the constant appearances during the BlackBerry 10 video promos, BlackBerry loves Alicia Keys. And it looks like she might like it back. Filled with analogies of new lovers and "exclusively dating" a mobile platform, Alicia Keys is now BlackBerry's Global Creative Director. We're not sure what her work remit will be (although there was a mention of app development) but we presume Will.I.Am is somewhere, crying in a pool of money.

 Other famous fans that BlackBerry mentioned on stage include Neil Gaiman and Robert Rodriguez -- creative types are looking forward to their new free BlackBerry phone.
