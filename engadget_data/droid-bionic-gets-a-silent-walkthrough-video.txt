It's four minutes and change of scrolling through the Verizon phone's fancy animations, with a speed test thrown in for good measure. Overall, there's nothing too earthshaking, but it's one of the most in-depth walkthroughs we've seen of the anticipated and long-delayed device in its current form, adding to that start up video we spotted the other day -- and unlike those Verizon ads, it actually has a phone in it.
