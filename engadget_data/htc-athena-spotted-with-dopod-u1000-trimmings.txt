Dopod is getting in on the action, with its subtly branded U1000, which carries an alarming NT 39,990 pricetag -- about $1,215, compared to T-Mobile's 500 euro price, roughly $646 -- and of course all the standard Athena specs like the 5-inch VGA screen, 3.5G, 3 megapixel camera, 8GB drive and 624MHz Xscale processor. Oh, and just in case you're keeping track, the 5.5 / 4.5 hours of GSM / UMTS talk time quoted here is a bit more conservative than the initial 6 hours we were hearing from HTC. Peep a couple more angles after the break.
