The Burst is AT&T's answer to the Breakout in terms of pricing, but the laundry lists of the two phones actually have a few gaping differences: the former employs the use of a 1.2GHz dual-core CPU, 4-inch Super AMOLED 800 x 480 display, 5MP camera with LED flash and 720p HD vid capture, 2MP front-facing cam, 16GB of internal storage space and microSD slot with a capacity of up to 32GB and a 1,650mAh battery. The Gingerbread-running Burst will be available in either black or red on January 22nd and can be yours for $50 with a two-year commitment. Considering Pantech's other offering for the same price, we can't say it will be a terribly difficult decision if you're looking for a budget phone on the lineup. We'll have our hands-on soon, so stay tuned.
