There aren't many details so far, other than the 5 megapixel camera around back and the spooky fact that the phone is temporarily going by the "Mystic" moniker. While that legendary keyboard looks delicious as ever, we can't say we're digging much of the rest of this handset's looks -- or lack of expanded functionality implied in the form factor -- but we'll reserve judgement for when we know more and get a chance to play with this in person.
