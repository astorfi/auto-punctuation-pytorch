Though it's a landscape slider, it doesn't slide to reveal what you'd normally expect -- a keyboard, that is. Instead, you get a speaker, an unusual (though not unprecedented) concept that should make this a decent media device... and the kickstand around back should help with that, too. We'd argue that this is the prettiest WinPho 7-powered device we've seen so far -- not surprising, considering HTC's reputation -- though we're sure plenty of folks would prefer the QWERTY.
