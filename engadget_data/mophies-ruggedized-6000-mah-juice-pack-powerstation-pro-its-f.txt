The company has just introduced its new Pro variant, packing a massive 6,000mAh of total juice. Like its older brethren, it'll charge mostly any device over USB (even supplying pass-through power when you need to plug it in), and switches between 500 mAh, 1A and 2.1A to preserve its total capacity. The real kicker, however, is its "impact-restistant" casing, made of steel, aluminum and rubber, along with its "water-tight" USB ports. Notably, the Pro is also IP65-certified -- effectively ensuring a venerable level of protection from liquid, shock and dust. No word on pricing or availability just yet, but we're sure many a journeying LTE user will want one to store in their backpack ASAP.
