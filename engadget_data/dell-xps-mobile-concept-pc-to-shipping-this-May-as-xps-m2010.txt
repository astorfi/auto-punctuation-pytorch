Well, a tipster who claims to "work with Dell" just sent us specs fora new Dell XPS M2010 which look damn close to what we saw on the floor back in January -- hell, it even matches-up withthe "M2010" we saw in the properties dialog. Ok, we have no way of authenticating whether or not our tipsterreally is what s/he claims but we've been expecting some 20-inch widescreen beasts to hit soon and with Dellpromising "more to come," well, they've done strangerthings right? Now according to our source, this 18-pound media hog lays a massive 2.9 x 18.5 x 15.0-inch footprintto encase that 20.1-inch WSXGA (1680 Ã— 1050) display. It throws 24-bit audio out its 8 x 4-ohm speakers plus 1 x12-ohm subwoofer with internal amp and of course goes (unspecified) Intel Core Duo (the CES prototype ran a 2.1GHz IntelT2600) and packs in ATI's new, high-performance Radeon Mobility X1800 graphics processor to pump those high-def capablepixels out component, DVI (with HDCP), or TV-out ports. Rounding out the list is support for up to 4GB of DDR2 SDRAM, adetachable Bluetooth keyboard, Bluetooth mouse, multi-format memory card reader, ExpressCard slot, and a 1.3 megapixelLogitech cam built-in to the top of the display capable of 640x480 video capture at 30 fps with a 58 degrees field ofview. What, no WiFi? The specs list a date of "May 2006" which may or may not be the ship date -- no pricingyet, but it ain't gonna be cheap. Oh Dell, why do you tease us so?[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
