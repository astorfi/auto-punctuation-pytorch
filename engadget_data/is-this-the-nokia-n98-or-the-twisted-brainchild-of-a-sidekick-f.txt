First is the simple fact that it's a render at all, and we all know how extraordinarily talented the world's artistically-inclined phone fanboys and girls are. Second, we're hearing that this is known as the N98, which runs counter to other rumors (and retail evidence in the X3 and X6) that Nokia is moving to a one-letter, one-digit naming convention across its smartphone range. Third, this looks like a straight-up cross between a Sidekick 2008 and a Sidekick LX 2009 (save the tilt-up display, of course). All that said, we can't help but feel that a device exactly like this makes sense for Nokia's high-end, multimedia-savvy Symbian range -- a proper successor to the N97 that might clear up some complaints like the off-center spacebar.

Anyhow, rumor has it the so-called N98 features a 4-inch touchscreen (likely capacitive, considering the precedent set by the X6) with 32GB of internal storage and a launch date in time for holiday 2010 at around â‚¬450 ($617) -- and we're even seeing an HDMI logo silkscreened on the side, too. This actually mixes pretty closely with another recent rumor that says we can expect an N8 model this Summer with a 3.5-inch capacitive display, 12 megapixel sensor, and Symbian^3, so an alternate possibility is that we're actually looking at that N8 here. Either way, if any of it is real, it could see a debut anywhere between MWC next week and Nokia World later in the year -- but admittedly, our fake-o-meter's reading pretty high on this one until we see an announcement. Nokia fans: is this what you're looking for in a next-gen device?
