If you spend much time on Google+ for Android, then we hope you follow the app's Tech Lead, Virgil Dobjanschi. He's just shared that version 4.1 will be available on the Play Store today, and brings -- he claims -- five big hitting updates with it. First on the list, account and page switching gets even easier, much like it did in Android's Gmail app. There's also full support for Google Apps for Business, which brings public sharing when enabled. For regular users, the ability to access files from Google Drive, and additional location controls will be welcome additions, with the last update being a bit of house keeping -- Messenger is out, Hangouts remain. Beyond the "big five," there's a tease of other updates for you to "discover." Or you could just read the "What's new" tab when it rolls out starting today.
