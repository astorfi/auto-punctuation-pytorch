Guess what? Those rumors about Nintendo opening up a flagship store in Manhattan—rumors that were based almost
entirely on a single job listing somebody dug up—turned
out to be true. They've confirmed plans to follow the lead of Apple and Sony (and
hopefully not Gateway) and open the very first Nintendo
World Store in Rockefeller Center sometime this spring, just a few blocks away from the SonyStyle flagship store at
Madison and 55th (which means that Sony fanboys and Nintendo fanboys might be forced to interact with each other in the
real world rather than in their preferred field of battle,
Internet message boards).
