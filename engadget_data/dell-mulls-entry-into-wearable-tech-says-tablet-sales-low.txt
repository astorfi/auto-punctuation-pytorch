Wearable technology is all the rage these days, and Dell isn't immune to the peer pressure: its global VP of personal computing, Sam Burd, tells the Guardian that his company is "exploring ideas" in the field. While it's not clear just how serious plans would be at this stage, Burd notes that the idea of a Dell smartwatch is alluring. He can't champion his firm's tablet sales, however. Dell has reportedly sold just "hundreds of thousands" of Windows 8 and RT slates like the Latitude 10 and XPS 10. The executive predicts a sales boost as corporate customers adapt to Windows' new interface, but he's cautious -- he believes that the young platform has to grow before clients (and rivals) take notice.
