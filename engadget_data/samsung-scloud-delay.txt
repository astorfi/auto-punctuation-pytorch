After the setback, Samsung's Media Solution Center had to enlist KT, operators of public cloud services in Korea and Amazon to help move things forward. An unnamed "cloud industry" source who spoke to the daily pointed out that one of the burdens of releasing so many (oh so many) devices is that the company has to work a lot harder to ensure all of them are compatible with any unified cloud service -- but them's the breaks, eh?
