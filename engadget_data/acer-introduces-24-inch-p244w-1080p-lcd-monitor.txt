Never mind the fact that Gateway slung out a 24-incher with a 1,920 x 1,200 resolution way back in 2006 -- we'll let it think it's special for awhile, anyway. Onto more specs, you'll find a 20,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio, touch-sensitive on-screen display and a 2-millisecond gray-to-gray response time. Regrettably, the outfit didn't bother handing down a release date or price, but it's not like those tidbits are really critical in the grand scheme of things, right?[Via Computer Monger]
