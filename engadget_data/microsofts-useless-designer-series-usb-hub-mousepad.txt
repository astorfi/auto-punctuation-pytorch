 Besides the fact that mousepads are technically made obsolete by the existence of optical and laser mice, this is one particularly backwards example of a mousepad. The Microsoft Designer Series 4 Port USB Hub Mousepad is just that: a mousepad with 4 USB ports. About the only thing that it brings to your desk is a bunch of cable clutter, as the Hub itself is only USB 1.1 compatible, and as the image above shows, there's a fair degree of curling at the edge due to its roll-up packaging, and curling has to be the biggest no-no when it comes to mousepads. Move along, nothing to see here.
