 The mysterious Facebook event is quickly approaching, and as luck would have it, @evleaks is hooking us up with an image of the device that we'll be introduced to on Thursday, known as the HTC first. If this is indeed accurate, the press render you see above is what was previously known as the HTC Myst (as well as the Opera and Buffy, if you go back in time far enough). We still don't have any confirmation on specs, but there are whispers that it will feature a program called Facebook Home, which will serve as the phone's home screen and launcher. While we can't glean much from the image itself, it at least seems as though the first will offer the same three-button capacitive key layout as most Android devices -- this is important to note, as HTC's last attempt at a Facebook-integrated smartphone featured a unique button specifically for the social media service.

 In terms of actual specs, Android Police leaked quite a few: it's a midrange phone with dual-core Snapdragon S4 Plus MSM8960 processor, 1GB RAM, 5MP rear camera, 1.6MP front-facing cam, Sense 4.5 on top of Android 4.1.2 and a 4.3-inch 720p display. We'll have a lot more info coming your way on Thursday morning, but this is a good taste to get you going in the meantime -- if you have a love for smartphones with deep Facebook integration, at least.

 Update: If the black casing of the purported HTC First left you feeling a bit... uninspired, then fret not, because @evleaks has just released additional glimpses of the device in question -- this time in red, white and blue. Hop the break for a peek of the patriotic colors. [via 9to5Google]
