That includes a Verizon logo on both the front and back of the Spyder for the first time (though that's not exactly unexpected), and the Xoom 2 (the 8.2-inch version in this case) is said to be in "better shape" than the earlier prototypes, which had apparently been suffering from some rather serious bugs. As you can see above, the Spyder also has what appears to be a slightly more tactile back, which could well be the Kevlar coating that's been rumored for the phone. Interestingly, our tipster also says that the processor in this particular Spyder is clocked at 1.5GHz, although the final version will apparently indeed be 1.2GHz, as the earlier leaks have suggested. Check out the gallery below for a closer look at both devices.
