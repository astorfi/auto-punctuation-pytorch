       Parrot -- well known for its array of wireless devices -- is announcing a Bluetooth Photo Viewer for CES. The frame, which can be dressed up to hide that tech-look synonymous with these kinds of gadgets, features a 7-inch screen with 720 x 480 pixel resolution, and 128 MB of internal memory (capable of holding up to 500 pics). Also of note is the bump to Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR (BIP, OPP, and FTP profiles) from the Bluetooth 1.2 used in the previous 3-inch version, which is a more than welcome improvement considering the competition.
