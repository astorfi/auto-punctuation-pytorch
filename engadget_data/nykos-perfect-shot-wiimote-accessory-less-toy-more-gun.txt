Rather, this Wiimote attachment resembles an actual pistol in most every way -- save for the plastic shell, vivid accents and its inability to fire actual bullets -- and it even features a pass-through port for the nunchuck / classic controller. Regrettably, it seems that this one won't be shipping in time for the holidays (unless Amazon's fibbing), but don't let that slow you down from paying your $12.99 and counting down the days till it hits your doorstep.[Via NintendoWiiFanboy]
