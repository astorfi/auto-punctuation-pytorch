After the all-HD channel -- which is home to Three Sheets, I Bet You, and a slew of other original programs -- was removed from select Cox and Comcast lineups, curious minds began to dig a little deeper. Turns out, parent company iN DEMAND is now rumored to be ceasing operation of the channel altogether, though we've no evidence to go on outside of a few unexplained disappearances. Anyone else see MOJO HD just fall off of their EPG? Let us know in comments below.[Thanks, Jonny]Read - MOJO falls off of CoxRead - MOJO vanishes from Comcast
