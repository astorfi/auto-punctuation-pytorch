Yeah, we're finally at that point in the year when we can start discussing CES 2006, and according to Philips — who
is apparently supplying chipsets for Sling
Media — we can expect the next Slingbox at
CES 2006 in January. The release is a little vague about what's going down specifically, but it looks like we can
expect a device at least capable of  480p/576p component video capture and 1080i/720p downscaling (i.e. reverse
HDTV). Guess we'll have to wait n' see (or poke n' prod the peeps at Sling to give us the scoop).
