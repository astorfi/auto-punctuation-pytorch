 The days of the new Sony Mobile are now long past. Two years in, and the company appears to have hit a stride with its smartphone portfolio, churning out new Xperias on a consistent basis. And today is no different with the unveiling of the Xperia L, a mid- to low-end effort that places a heavy emphasis on the camera experience. Carrying on the Arc's legacy, this 4.3-inch handset packs an FWVGA display, dual-core 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4, 1,700mAh battery, 8GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD), NFC and an 8-megapixel rear shooter with Exmor RS sensor into a conspicuously curved body rounded off with that signature Xperia power key.

 Though it lacks the greater resolution and screen size of its 720p sibling the SP, this more budget-friendly device does enjoy an exclusive perk: HDR stills and video. A feature Sony's included to make the L an attractive point-and-shoot option for budget-minded consumers concerned with style points and not LTE or raw performance. Unsurprisingly, it comes pre-loaded with a trio of Sony's own media apps -- Walkman, Movies and Album -- a precedent it set at IFA last year.





 
 Sadly, Sony's "transparent element" (that see-through, illuminated bar which hides the antenna) won't be making a comeback on the L -- that's solely for the SP. But users will enjoy notifications via an LED strip near its base, just without the color customization options of its sibling. Still, even without that design gimmick, the L comes across as a refreshingly well-crafted device, especially given its market positioning. Weighing 137 grams and measuring in at 9.7mm thick, it's pleasing to hold and well-suited to the palm. Certainly that screen size, a sweet spot for most users, combined with arch of its build reinforces that ergonomic ease. It also helps that Sony's chosen three flashy finishes for it: white, black and (a satiny) red.

 Performance was right on par with what you'd expect from an S4, handling Android Jelly Bean (4.1) capably and devoid of any apparent navigation or UI hiccups. That's not to say you'll see applications launch with an exceptional briskness -- there is a noticeable delay -- but we can't fault the modest L for it. It's not aspiring to be best-in-class, just a great lowlight shooter for those with social media heavy leanings.

 Sony's yet to confirm pricing for the Xperia L, but given its mild specs and market perch, don't expect it to break your wallet. The L is a smartphone compromise Sony's well-suited to deliver: sleek styling with the best of its imaging and all on a budget. Look for it to hit Q2 of this year.
