If you've already picked up an
iPod nano and want to be able to share your tunes, fret not.
The first of what's bound to be a major onslaught of speaker systems designed for the nano has arrived, in the form of
PodGear's $45 PocketParty for the nano. Don't expect this little guy to shake any walls, though. With its 1 watt,
AA-powered speaker system, this is definitely more of a toy to let you listen to podcasts in your living room
than to DJ with at your kegger.
