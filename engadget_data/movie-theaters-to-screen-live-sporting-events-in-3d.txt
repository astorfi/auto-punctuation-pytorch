 How aremovie theaters going to bring back people like me and Davis Freeberg even after we'vegot high definition DVD's in our own homes? By showing live sporting events in 3D. The same technology used for Chicken Little 3D could soon be used tobring away games to the home crowd. They could also broadcast other live events like concerts, and hope to start doingthis in 2007.I didn't go see Chicken Little 3D in theaters, so I don't know how impressive the effect was,did any of you and do you think this will be enough to trump the lure of HDTV?
