Expected in November 2008, the XT2 will ship with Intel's latest Montevina, er "Centrino 2" architecture in your choice of ULV or LV CPUs, new UMA graphics supporting Vista Aero, and possibly the option of an ultra-thin, optical drive integrated directly into the laptop instead of the optional Media Base. Dell also plans to replace one of the three USB ports with eSATA, a definite trend for Dell laptops in 2008. Otherwise, it brings the same 12.1-inch, 1280 x 800 pixel display found on the original XT -- which is fine by us.
