Write speeds are at 45 minutes to fill a single 25GB BD-R discat the 2X max burring speed, and while you could get that much data onto multiple single-layer DVD R discs with an 18xburner, it gives 10X double-layer DVD R burning a run for its money. The actual throughput for the burner clocks in at67mbps, compared to the theoretical maximum of 72mbps for 2X BD-R. It actually took a bit longer to copy the data backoff the disc. While the BDR-101A can manage a bit of DVD burning, at less than optimum speeds, there's no room left fora third laser for CD reading or writing. PC World also found the software package a bit thin, as this product isdefinitely targeted at professionals who have their own authoring solutions. Luckily, third party support isn't farbehind, and an upgrade should be available to purchasers of the BDR-101A in order to author you own discs. The burnerwill also play Blu-ray movies, whenever they arrive onshelves, but it won't support the forthcoming managedcontent spec.
