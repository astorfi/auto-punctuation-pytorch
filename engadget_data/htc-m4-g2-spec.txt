 Now that we know the M7 is alive and well, we can look at the other goodies that HTC is going to bring us this year. According to the pretty reliable @evleaks, two more Android phones will be launched at some point after the M7's pre-MWC debut: a fairly powerful M4 and a low-end G2 (not to be confused with the T-Mobile G2). The former's highlights are its 4.3-inch 720p display (same as the 8X's), a 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon chip, a whopping 13-megapixel F2.0 camera (apparently the same as the M7's) and optional LTE. On the other hand, the G2 will pack a more modest 3.5-inch 480 x 320 screen, a 1GHz processor and a 5-megapixel camera, so it's very much just a slight upgrade from the Desire C which also runs Ice Cream Sandwich -- unlike the beefier M4 with Jelly Bean. The same leakster reckons we won't be seeing these two devices at MWC, but we'll keep an eye out just in case.
