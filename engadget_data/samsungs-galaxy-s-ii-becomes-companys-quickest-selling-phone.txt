Now, it looks as if the superphone's proper successor may put that latter statistic to shame. The outfit just announced that it took but 55 days to move three million Galaxy S II handsets, which works out to one phone every 1.5 seconds. It's Sammy's briskest-selling smartphone ever, and we're guessing that it'll keep up the pace once that AT&T variant lands on US soil. Which is coming soon, right Samsung?
