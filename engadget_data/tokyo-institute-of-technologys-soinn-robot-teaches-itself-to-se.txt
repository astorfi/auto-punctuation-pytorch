As evidenced by this bot developed by the Hasegawa Group at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, however, there's also a growing number capable of teaching themselves some new tricks, and they're getting smarter every day. This particular one employs what's called a self-organizing incremental neural network (or SOINN), which lets it build up a base of knowledge that it can apply to new tasks and make educated guesses about how to proceed with them -- in this case, pouring a glass of water and then dropping an ice cube in it (or what's supposed to be water and an ice cube, at least). Head on past the break for a video.
