These are the new MacBook Pros. Both the 13- and 15-inch versions have been refreshed, and now the Retina display-sporting, Haswell-powered laptops are being shown off right after the Apple "lot to cover" event. While the duo retains the same overall look and feel of the previous generation, there are still a few notable changes worth taking a look at. Externally, the 13-inch model, which will start at $1,299, is thinner and lighter (0.71 inches thick and 3.46 lb heavy), while internally it offers the Haswell chipset, Iris graphics and -- hopefully -- better battery life as a result. You'll also get Thunderbolt 2 ports, faster SSD storage and 802.11ac WiFi. The starting price will get you 4GB RAM, a 2.4GHz dual-core Core i5 and 128GB SSD, but you can go up from there if you need more storage and power. The 15-inch version starts at $1,999 for 8GB RAM, 2GHz quad-core Core i7 and 256GB SSD storage. We'll have a full review of the next-gen MacBook Pro shortly, but we encourage you to check out our photo gallery below in the meantime.
