Honestly, it'd be pretty easy to miss even if you were holding it -- the video calling TV attachment probably weighs less than its baked good doppelganger. The idea is to stick this sliver of glossy black plastic on top of your TV and make video VoIP calls using its integrated HD webcam and 802.11n radio. Your counterpart is then displayed, super-sized, on your big screen. Around the back of the device are the three ports: HDMI in, HDMI out and power. You simply plug the Biscotti in between your settop and TV, then navigate the menus with the included remote. The demo stream set up at the CES Unveiled event had a slightly yellow hue to it, but we're willing to chalk that up to the poor lighting on the show floor. The best news, though? In addition to making calls through the proprietary Biscotti service you can get your video chat on using the increasingly ubiquitous Google Talk. Check out the gallery below and a quick video walk through after the break.
