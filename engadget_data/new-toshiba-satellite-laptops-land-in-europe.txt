First, the A500: this guy sports a 16-inch, 16:9 format display (1366 x 768), a TV-tuner for both analog and digital DVB-T programming, Harman Kardon speakers and HDMI ports with REGZA LINK technology. Under the hood, this guy packs an Intel Core 2 Duo, 8GB memory, an ATI Mobility Radeon HD GPU (up to 1GB DDR3 VRAM), and either a 500GB HDD or 64GB SSD. For those of you on the ultra-portable tip, the U500 is a 13.3-inch (16:10 format, 1280 x 800) ultraportable that weighs in at just under 4.5 pounds. With an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 8 GB memory, a hard disk capacity of up to 500GB, and an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4570 GPU, this bad boy is available in Brown Luxe, with either chrome or silver accents. Claimed battery life is over 3.5 hours. Both lappies feature a DVD Super Multi drive, wide format HD webcam, multi-touch trackpad, and the usual host of connectivity options (WLAN, Bluetooth 2.1, 5-in-1 media card slot). Both will be available in Europe sometime this July for â‚¬699 (approx. $975).Read - Toshiba Satellite U500 with ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4570Read - Toshiba Satellite A500 by 16 inches
