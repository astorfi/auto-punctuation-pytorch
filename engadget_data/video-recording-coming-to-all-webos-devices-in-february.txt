High on the list of conspicuously-missing features for the Pre and Pixi has been video recording -- but happily, Palm's looking to close that gap shortly. Both devices will get hooked up next month with the goods, including integrating editing (that admittedly looks a bit like the iPhone's setup) and uploading to YouTube, Facebook, email, and MMS. We're not sure what actual webOS version this'll be launching in, but hey, who cares? Important thing is that it's hitting very, very soon.

Update: So it turns out it'll be part of webOS 1.4, which also includes beta support for Flash 10 on the Pre (sorry, Pixi owners). We know which one we're more excited about!
