 Despite having moved into the number five slot on IDC's list of the top handset makers world wide -- beating out RIM and just behind Apple -- HTC has actually seen its share prices drop 19-percent since June 7th. The stock did rebound slightly following news that the company's sales for June were a staggering 87.8-percent higher than the same time last year. Surprisingly, that's actually a drop from May's figures which were 116-percent higher than the same month in 2010. Even though the company continues to break its own sales and profit records, some analysts don't think the company is out of the woods just yet -- a rather confusing outlook to us but, then again, we're not financial analysts.
