 Comcast's Q1 earnings report was fairly devoid of surprises, with a net income of $732 million compared with $837 million in the same quarter last year. It should be noted, however, that Q1 2007 included a $300 million one-time gain "from the dissolution of a cable partnership with Time Warner Cable in which Comcast received cable systems in Houston." The only interesting tidbits were the sectors in which the carrier lost and gained subscribers: 57,000 basic cable customers jumped ship, while 492,000 new high-speed internet and 639,000 digital voice customers signed on. It was also noted that 494,000 individuals picked up its digital cable service (compared with last year's 658,000), but it failed to say how many were paying out for HD. If we had to guess, we'd say satellite / fiber are beginning to eat away at the coax-laden mothership.[Via CNN Money]
