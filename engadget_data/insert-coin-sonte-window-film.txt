In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line.

Smartphone control of your home is nothing new thanks to the likes of Nest and many, many others -- but automated window coverings have always been a spendy proposition. Now, Sonte is bringing its smartphone-controlled tech onto Kickstarter, giving backers a shot at the high-tech digital shades we saw at CES 2013. It works by going from transparent to opaque in a split second when current is applied, giving you privacy and light control -- or a makeshift projector screen -- at the flip of a switch or via an iOS or Android app. After measuring your windows, you'll be able to purchase the size you need and apply it yourself like a regular window film as shown in the video after the break. Ten square feet or so of the material will run around $184 for a non-WiFi, switch activated piece, while a smartphone-activated strip of the same size will cost $234. So, if you've been looking for electric shades, and are up to the installation challenge, hit the source to pledge.




Previous project update: Lofting telescopes into space requires lofty goals, but ARKYD is orbiting close to its $1 million dollar target, having netted $690,000 with 27 days left on Kickstarter.
