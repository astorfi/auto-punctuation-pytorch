Thanks to a few sharp eyes and a pre-order page at Amazon, we now know that this puppy will be launching for a respectable $399.95. Granted, this is twice as much as some of the aged units we've seen recently, but the inclusion of BD-Live support could be a strong selling point for some. Yeah, we hear you -- the PS3 is still the better bargain, but at least the days of $699 - $999 starting points seem to be coming to an end.[Via Big Picture Big Sound]
