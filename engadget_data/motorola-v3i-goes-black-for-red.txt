The RED V3i eschews the red casing of its V3m cousin in favor of a more understated black, which, let's face it, is only marginally more understated than the phone's original dark gray. Specs appear to be unchanged, too, save for the whole bit about saving the world through charitable donation. Brits can look into rocking their little piece of Bono now through Carphone Warehouse, which is offering the RED V3i free with a contract through O2.[Thanks, Jewburg]
