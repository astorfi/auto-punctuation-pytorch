We've been hearing wide-scale reports since yesterday from AT&T stores across the country that locations have been unable to keep the device in stock, with some selling out in a matter of minutes after launch all video game console-style. For folks within driving distance of an Apple store, that hasn't been a problem so far because Apple's own retail locations seem to have been supplied with many, many units -- and that, friends, is what's starting to change. According to Apple's iPhone locator, there are still plenty of locations with stock -- but unlike last night, it's not difficult at this point to find stores that have sold out as well. Think there's any chance Apple's gonna let the pipe run dry?
