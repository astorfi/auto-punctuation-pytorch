HD Beat has put together an HD TV
buyer's guide for the gamer who's looking to make the step up to the so-called "high-def era."


Some of their points might surprise you. For instance, "you don't need an HDTV to use the 360. In fact, your TV
might be good enough for you; those gamers that have a 27-inch or smaller set will find that HDTV is not that much
better in those sizes," they write.


Required reading for the would-be cutting edge gamer, though we hope that HD Beat follows up soon with another
feature on projectors as a cost-effective means of buying into HD gaming.
