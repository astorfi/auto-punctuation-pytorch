We'll be frank -- we didn't have too much hope that the supposedly leaked ThinkPad we spotted over the weekend was a legitimate product, but now that the evidence is mounting, we're finding it difficult to contain our excitement. Two new spy shots of the purported ThinkPad x200e (or ThinkPad x100e) have emerged over in China, and we're being told that Lenovo's not going out of its way to deny their genuineness. Are we really looking at a ThinkPad netbook? And will the Earth really continue to spin if Lenovo deviates from the tried-and-true ThinkPad design that has held things in balance for so long? Color us disquieted.
