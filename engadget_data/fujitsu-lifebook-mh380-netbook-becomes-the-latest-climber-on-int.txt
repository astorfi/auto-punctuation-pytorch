There was a nettop last month, Lenovo's latest IdeaPad last week, and now, thanks again to the FCC, we know there's a new netbook coming from Fujitsu packing the 1.6GHz Atom N450 processor. The LifeBook MH380 sports a 10.1-inch LCD with a resolution of 1366 x 768, 802.11b/g/n wireless, and, well, that's all our government-funded spies have revealed so far. We're guessing CES will be a time of great knowing.
