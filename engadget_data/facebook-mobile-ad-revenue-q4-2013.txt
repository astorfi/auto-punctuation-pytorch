As expected after the Q3 numbers, mobile advertising now accounts for 53% of Facebook's revenue, thanks in large part to News Feed ads and auto-play videos. In total, the outfit earned $2.59 billion in revenue during Q4 of 2013. The company's 556 million daily active users on mobile for the month of December (a 49 percent increase year-over-year) and 945 million mobile monthly active users (up 39 percent year-over-year) easily explains the bump from those accessing the social network on the go. Those numbers are also sure to rise as Facebook preps its targeted ad network to outfit apps other than its own, a rumored Flipboard competitor and the suite of standalone applications already tipped for 2014 release. Nearly a billion monthly mobile users should begin to ease concerns after the company faltered following its IPO, too.


The big news from Facebook's Q3 earnings call came from CFO David Ebersman's comment that the social network had seen daily use "among younger teens" decline. This time around we expected an update on those usage stats, but Ebersman stated that there was "no news to report" on the subject.
