Well thankfully Barron's Online has swooped in the fill the void(you'll have to trust us- B.O. is subscription-only), quoting two Morgan Stanley analysts who claim that Steve andFriends are hard at work on "an iPod with phone functions," which is naturally being referred to as the iPhone. Morgan's Johnny Chan, based out of Hong Kong, speculates thatApple may subcontract Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Hon Hai Precision for a role in the phone's production, whileanother analyst proposes that Taiwan Green PointÂ  Enterprises may also get in on action. Obviously the detailshere are super-thin (as in, we just gave you all the details), but there's been so much buzz about this fabled device,that Apple's gotta be planning on putting a cell radio in something, even if it's just an iSight. [Note: Theabove pic is one of the many past "iPhone" concept designs, and is only being used because we don't have anice photo of the Morgan Stanley folks.]
