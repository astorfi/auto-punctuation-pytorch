Well, would you look at that. It seems the recent rumblings and trademark paperwork for the reportedly low-cost Moto G had some merit. The unannounced device popped up in the navigation of Motorola's site despite leading to a dead link (moto-g.com) but has since been removed. Details are quite sparse for the time being, but we've reached out to the smartphone maker for comment on the apparent snafu and will update this post the moment we hear back.
