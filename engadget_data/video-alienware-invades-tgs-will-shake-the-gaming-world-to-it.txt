The Round Rock mothership reveals that the big unveil will occur at the Tokyo Game Show, presumably Thursday when the event officially begins. A launch so big that it will "shake the gaming world to its foundation," according to its Facebook page. Well, in that case anything less than a mutated lizard, gigantified by a diet of radiation and city buses will be a disappointment. It is Tokyo after all. Latest video tease after the break.
