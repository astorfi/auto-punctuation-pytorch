The Consumer Electronics Association has just blasted out a new press release, presumably with a face red with embarrassment, to correct its erroneous note that Nintendo will be an exhibitor at the 2011 tech showcase. As it turns out, Satoru Iwata's crew have booked some meeting rooms during the show -- to discuss what, we don't know -- which somewhere along the line was misinterpreted to mean that the company will be exhibiting its wares. It won't. We'll be there anyway, this just means we'll have to be a little craftier about extracting our information.
