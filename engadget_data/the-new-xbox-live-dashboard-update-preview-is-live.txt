We just got the update and are exploring right now, so stay tuned. If you're one of the select few, let us know in comments!Some notable bits thus far:

Netflix now has way, way more options. You can actually browse content via the app, which is great. As a commenter points out, HD content is now denoted with a tag.
There isn't any avatar prop content available just yet -- hopefully we'll get to pick out an awesome gun to carry around soon though.
No Games on Demand content from the current gen console is available, but apparently the games will start rolling out in early August (sigh).
As we noted in previous posts, the preview doesn't boast any of the Last.fm, Facebook, or Twitter additions yet.
We know they're still working the kinks out, but there seems to be noticeable slowdown when shifting between pages, something we've never noticed before in the NXE.
