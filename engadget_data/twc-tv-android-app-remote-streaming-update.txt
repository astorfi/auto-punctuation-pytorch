Just weeks after TWC TV was overhauled for iOS products, the carrier has announced that a "serious" update will hit the Android version of TWC TV as soon as next Tuesday. The refresh will add access to over 4,000 On Demand shows and movies, as well as live TV streaming and On Demand support for older Android devices still stuck on v2.2+. Moreover, some of that content will also be available while you're away from home, "mirroring the experience" already available for iOS products. Moral of the story? Keep an eye on the Play Store as May 14th rolls around.
