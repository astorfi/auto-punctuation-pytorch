 Looking for yet another way to share photos on Facebook? Then you now have a new option to consider courtesy of the company itself, which has today rolled out its new Facebook Camera app for the iPhone and iPod touch. It promises to let you share and view photos faster than within the main Facebook app (not to mention give you higher-res photos), and you'll also get a variety of Instagram-style filters (15 in all) as well as some basic editing tools -- features that were apparently developed independently by Facebook itself and not borrowed from Instagram, which it hasn't yet completed its acquisition of. As with Facebook's other apps, it's completely free, and you can grab it right now at the App Store link below.
