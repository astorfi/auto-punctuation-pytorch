So what could the little guys be doing there, after all, there isn't a Ringtones tab in any of the iPhone how-to guides unlike the slide presented at WWDC? Don't know, but let's hope they'll sit next little MP3/AAC ringtones we create ourselves for free and not just the ones we download from the iTunes store for a fee, eh?
