Although the device itself looks basically the same as in those previously-leaked shots we saw back in October, there are some surprises in store: it's way thinner, the back is apparently made of metal and there are stereo speakers at the bottom. We'll admit to missing the polarizing ultra-80s look of the original, but this thing looks pretty sweet -- too bad it's still going to set you back $359 when it arrives on February 24. We'll find out what's what for sure on Monday -- in the meantime check couple more shots after the break and way more at the read link.[Thanks, Alex]
