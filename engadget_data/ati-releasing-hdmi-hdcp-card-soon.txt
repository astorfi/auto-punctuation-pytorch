There's mainly justthis leaked pic to go on so far, but the purported card has no DVI connection, just HDMI, and also has a S/PDIFpass-through jack to add the audio to your HDMI signal. No word on when this card will be announced, but let's justhope they'll be giving them away with breakfast cereals or they're going to a have a few disgruntled customers on theirhands.
