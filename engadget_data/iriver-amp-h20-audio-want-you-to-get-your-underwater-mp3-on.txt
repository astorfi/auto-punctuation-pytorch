We can just see the poolside Jenna Jameson ad for the iRiver's new MP3 waterproof accessory, though we're thinking
she'll probably just stick to promoting iRiver's personal
video player (unless maybe she's got a band brewing to add to the list of her weird crossover successâ€”or getting
paid a lot extra). But cashing in on what they imagine must be a huge market for extreme water sports tech gear, iRiver
decided to team up with H20 Audio to launch the H20 Audio SV i700, a waterproof housing which works only with their
iRiver iFP-700 Flash MP3 player and keeps it safe from water danger.
