 
Pretty self-explanatory really: the T-Mobile G2 is now available to buy for a measly 50 greenbacks from its carrier's online store. It's a web-only deal, but it's sweetened by free overnight delivery for anyone ordering before the 20th of December. So, $50 and two years of your wireless freedom in exchange for a phone capable of exploiting T-Mobile's HSPA+ network and offering an almost stock Android experience? Decisions, decisions.
