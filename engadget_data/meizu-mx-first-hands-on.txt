As expected, the customized Android 2.3.5 (dubbed Flyme OS) is pretty slick on that 1.4GHz dual-core Samsung Exynos 4210 and 1GB of RAM, but we keep an eye on the consistency of its performance. Compared to the smaller M9, we're hugely impressed by this successor's solid build quality -- the white crystal casing on the back gives out a premium feel and look, though only time will tell how scratch-resistant it is. Likewise, we also dig the booklet or CD album-like packaging -- you can see it all in our hands-on gallery below.

	There's much to be loved about the four-inch 960 x 640 ASV LCD -- the slight decrease in pixel density really isn't as noticeable as expected, still giving a sharp image in addition to a slightly wider viewing angle plus color gamut. Alas, many of our camera stills so far seem to be infected by a green hue, though our sample 1080p video clip's in good shape. Here's hoping that Meizu will still be able to tweak that eight megapixel camera before the official launch. Until then, check out our hands-on video after the break (where you can see Meizu's pretty rad "patented situation-aware bottom light keys" in action), and stay tuned for our upcoming review.
