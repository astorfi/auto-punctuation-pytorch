Apparently, the device you see above (labeled Colorado 300) relies primarily on the circular scroll wheel for navigating menus, and if we had to guess, it'll likely be marketed towards marine / outdoors customers. Aside from that, all we're told is that it should land sometime this Spring for around $500, but we're not holding our collective breath just yet.[Via GPS Tracklog, thanks Rich]
