Well, stepaside, oh masterful 24 displayVirginia Tech workstation, you're old news with your 31,457,280 pixel array of twenty four 1280 x 1024 displays. No,the new crown goes to a man known only to us as Crazy Jon (trust us, that's no misnomer). Dude cobbled six NVIDIAGeForce 7900 GTX 512MB video cards and three 1,000-watt power supplies to take on a wall o' what appears to be Dell30-inch 3007WFPs. Twelve, to be exact. By our math that's49,152,000 pixels -- and about $26,400 just for the displays alone. Oh, and did we mention that Crazy Jon already hadfive Apple 30-inchers on his desk? We love you, Jon. Seriously though, can we come over sometime?[Via Make]
