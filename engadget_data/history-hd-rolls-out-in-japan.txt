 It's been awhile since History HD landed an international distribution deal, so it's quite refreshing to see the channel finding its way to yet another huge market: Japan. Beginning October 1st, History HD will begin broadcasting "HD content languaged in Japanese with a mix of local programming, plus series and specials from the History catalog, such as Cities of the Underworld, The Universe, Ancient Discoveries and Ice Road Truckers." There's no specific mention of what carriers will be hosting the station, but here's to hoping it's headed to yours, and soon.
