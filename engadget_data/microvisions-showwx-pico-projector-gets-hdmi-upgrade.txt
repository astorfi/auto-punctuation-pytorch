It's still bringing the brightness with 15 laser lumens, a 5,000:1 native contrast ratio, and 2-hour battery life. As before, it supports all your iDevices, and, now, any HDMI-equipped machine, including the BlackBerry PlayBook, pictured above -- not all devices will support full video mirroring, however. Unfortunately, for HD purists, it's still pushing an 848 x 480 native resolution, but if 1080p's not topping your priority list, you can pre-order one now for $370.
