Of course, this is just a screenshot that likely indicates a release later this week (with retail outlets receiving units on November 2nd), so we can't say with an absolute certainty -- though this date would coincide perfectly with the beginning of the National Texting Championship. No word yet on its pricing, and its unique form factor and functionality keeps us from taking any wild guesses. Hopefully we'll know in less than 48 hours.
