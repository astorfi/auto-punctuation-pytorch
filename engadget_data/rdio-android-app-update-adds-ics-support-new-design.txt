   Tune streaming service Rdio has just given its Android application a major makeover. Not only will the app experience the Ice Cream Sandwich treatment for the first time (happy, GNex owners?), but it's also gotten a new look that's easier on the eyes. Furthermore, Rdio added the ability to view user profiles, and also enhanced the app's search capabilities. Amongst the rest of the improvements -- some of which are being ported from the desktop client -- are traits like top charts, recommendations and new releases. You can grab the free update now if you're a current subscriber, otherwise you'll have to jump on board before you can take the app for a spin.
