Deemed the "little sister" of the Peggy LED display kit, this gaming handheld from Evil Mad Science is only as fun as you make it; in other words, it provides all the incentive you need to sharpen those programming skills in order to craft engrossing pixel-based titles. The portable unit packs a fully addressable 8 x 8 RGB LED matrix display, a lo-fi audio transducer and plenty of buttons for controlling the action. The unit comes pre-loaded with a single game (isn't that sweet?), but from there, it's up to you to put those soldering / coding skills to good use. Claim yours now for $65 to $95 -- just be ready to deal with loads of frustration on your way to homegrown handheld nirvana.[Via Engadget German]
