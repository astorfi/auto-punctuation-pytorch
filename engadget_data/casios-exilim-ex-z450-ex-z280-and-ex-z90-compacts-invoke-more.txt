Their spec sheets are almost identical: both come with 4x optical zoom, 12 megapixel sensor, 720p / 24 fps video, and Exilim Engine 4.0 -- hell, even the max ISO setting is identical at 3200, and you can upgrade that 'for free' since nobody expects your highest settings to be usable anyway. What's new? An autofocus for the ages, apparently, as the sole difference is a new Intelligent AF feature that automatically adjusts focus and exposure for photographic subjects, human or otherwise. The Z90 shrinks those innards into a more portable package, but drops to 3x zoom in the process. The two cameras are expected in early October for $199 and $149, respectively. They'll be joined by the unpriced Z280 shooter that misses out on the auto-detect magic, but gains a wide-angle 26mm lens. Full frontal shots of each camera after the break.
