If someone hasn't come a knocking on your door yet, promising to fix whatever ails you, they surely soon will. So, it's nice to see a representative going door-to-door without an ulterior motive... well, without a political one, anyway. Meet Andy, the full-scale Android mascot who can be found wandering the streets of Sydney in an attempt by Vodafone to get people more familiar with the little OS that could (and is). We're thinking he's more likely to scare small children than create converts out of competing smartphone users, but maybe our pollsters are reading this one wrong.
