So why not do it in style? Logitech has just announced the official racing wheel for Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, the Driving Force GT. The $150 wheel, which is PS2 and PS3 compatible, includes force feedback, along with a 24-position adjustment dial for screwing with things like brake bias in real time. We don't know what brake bias is, but we know we'd be suckers not to be tweaking it in real time by the time April rolls around. Unfortunately, this wheel isn't due until May.
