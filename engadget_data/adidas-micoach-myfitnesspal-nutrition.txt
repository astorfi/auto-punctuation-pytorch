Balls, shoes, watches... Adidas miCoach line of smart things has been expanding to track your activity, no matter what you're into. Until recently, the fitness platform was a closed one, meaning all that precious data was siloed from non-Adidas software. Now, the company has partnered with MyFitnessPal so that your digital coach can know what you're eating in addition to how hard you have (or haven't) been working out. Users can choose to automatically sync their data with MyFitnessPal, which, according to Adidas, will let folks "gain new insights that will enable them to balance nutrition and exercise." Exactly what insights it'll provide remain unsaid, but at the very least you'll be able to compare your caloric intake and expenditures in one place -- self-imposed guilt trips have never been easier.
