Now officially equipped with 16GB flash memory (instead of that 8GB microdrive), the new Advantage features TouchFLO, Opera Mobile 9, and Google Maps, as well as all the rest of the features you've come to know and love: GPS (with TomTom Navigator 6), 5-inch VGA display, 624MHz processor, ATI video acceleration (ahem), 256MB ROM / 128MB RAM, tri-band HSDPA, quad-band GSM / GPRS / EDGE, magnetic QWERTY keyboard, WiFi, Bluetooth, and a "future version of Windows Mobile," which we're taking to mean Windows Mobile 6.1. It'll be out in Europe in March, no price or specific date give, though -- and yes, US users are out of luck (for now).
