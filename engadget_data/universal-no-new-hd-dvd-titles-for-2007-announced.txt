       While members of the Blu-ray camp can't stop making announcements, the sole exclusive provider of HD DVD titles; Universal has confirmed they have no new major titles announcements for 2007. They do go on to indicate that they will continue to release new HD DVD titles throughout the year. We will wait to see how this effects the number of titles battle we have been keeping track of, but there are rumors that Universal's HD DVD support may be swaying. While this may be bad news for Toshiba, what is good news is that during Warner's press conference both HBO and New Line revealed their plans to release Total Hi Def discs, which means there will be more titles for both formats, including the Lord of The Rings.
