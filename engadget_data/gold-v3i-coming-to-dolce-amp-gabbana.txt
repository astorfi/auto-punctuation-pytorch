Now that the RAZR has become the new StarTAC,
fashionistas need a new way to make their uber-slim cellphone draw wows, so Dolce has teamed up with Moto to offer just
the product. A few lucky people (1000, to be exact) will soon be able to pick up a special edition gold V3i from
D&G boutiques worldwide, which is now a necessary component in completing the full
magenta-silver-
black-blue-gold RAZR rainbow. No word yet on the cost, but if you're even considering buying such an unnecessary
piece of showiness, it's doubtful that price is of much concern.
