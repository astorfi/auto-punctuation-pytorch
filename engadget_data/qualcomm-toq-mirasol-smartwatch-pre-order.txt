Qualcomm's Toq smarter-than-most watch is expected to debut the first week of December, and you can set one aside for yourself starting today. The company has announced that it's now taking pre-orders for the newfangled Toq smartwatch, which, unlike many competing wearables, bases its display features on Mirasol technology. Those looking to order need to be prepared to shell out a good amount of cash -- because, as you may have heard, you'll have to pay a cool $350 to own one of these.
