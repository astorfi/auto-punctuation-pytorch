 Intel's not the only chap on the block loosing long range connectivity options on the world at CTIA, as Samsung is apparently aiming for the consumer market with its forthcoming Ubicell base station. While details are scarce at the moment, we do know that this "micromini BTS" will provide CDMA 1x services in the home by "enlarging the coverage area to shadow areas by connecting with DSL / cable modems." Essentially, this unit will help folks who live on the fringe of service areas to ditch their landline and finally enjoy the full benefits of their cellphone service. And while we're not entirely inclined to believe it, Samsung also states that its new creation will actually provide voice quality that's superior to VoIP. Nevertheless, we're still not sure when the Ubicell is expected to land, but those yearning to cut the cord on their landline can start sharpening the scissors.[Via BoyGeniusReport]
