You know all that OneDrive storage Microsoft's been giving away lately? Turns out there could be a new way to put it to use soon: music storage. A tipster to Windows Central points out that going to this link will automatically create a folder for your tunes in Redmond's cloud ecosystem, and when the feature officially hits it'll apparently bring an additional 20GB of free storage with it too. A few graphics indicate that there'll be a web version, as well. We've embedded one from Windows Central after the break. Oh, the service supposedly won't cost anything (much like Google's music locker) and your music will be accessible across a range of devices including Windows 8.1 computers, phones and tablets; browsers and, of course, Xboxes. Not that the Xbox One actually needs any extra media options mind you, but more are always welcome.
