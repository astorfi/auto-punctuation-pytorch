 Even though there's an ongoing kerfuffle between social giants Instagram and Twitter, the microblogging service is putting that aside and focusing its own efforts on improving the experience for some of its (many) users. With that in mind, Twitter announced earlier today that it has expanded its trending topics feature, also known as Trends, to an additional 100 cities around the world, including big-name places like Frankfurt in Germany and Guadalajara down in Mexico. Of course, this means more people can now easily glance at some of the most talked about things around the Blue Bird social network -- still, don't expect Justin Bieber's name to pop up every single day on the list, as Twitter was pretty clear on how it feels about that.
