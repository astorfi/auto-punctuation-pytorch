Straight from Sony's booth at CES, we've been able to see how the Blu-ray camp plans to counter HDi. One of the key new features displayed, was the ability to include a "portable copy" of a movie on the Blu-ray disc, for transfer to a PSP. Also shown was the ability to download trailers, chat live during a movie and create custom trailers. Sounds pretty familiar to us, but take a look and see what 2008 holds for blue.
