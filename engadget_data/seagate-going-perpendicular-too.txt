To be honest, we would have been surprised if they hadn't been trying to pour a little R&D sugar on
this lately, but Seagate has announced that they, too, are going perpendicular, and that along with archrivals Hitachi
and Toshiba they'll be one of of the first manufacturers to bring hard drives that use perpendicular recording to
market. They wouldn't reveal anything else that we want to hear, like an exact date that they'd begin shipping their
new perpendicular drives to customers or what capacities or sizes they'd come in, but like Hitachi and Toshiba, they're
promising to dramatically boost the storage capacity of their drives by writing data vertically instead of
horizontally.
