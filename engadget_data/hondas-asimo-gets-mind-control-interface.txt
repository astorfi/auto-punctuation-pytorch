 Robots are one step closer to taking over the world today with news that researchers have developed an interface for Honda's Asimo robot that allows individuals to control it simply by thinking. The system, developed by Honda and ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories, uses an MRI machine to measure a person's brain signals, which are then relayed to Asimo. In a demonstration, a person in the MRI machine made a fist, then made a V-sign, which Asimo imitated a few seconds later. The same system could potentially be used to control a keyboard or phone, researchers say, or even help people with spinal cord injuries move their limbs. From there, we assume, it's only a matter of time before the bots learn to reverse the process, initiating a mind control link over their would-be masters.[Via Robot Gossip]
