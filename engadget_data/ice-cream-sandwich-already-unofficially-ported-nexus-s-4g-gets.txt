Android Central forum user Breezy is working on delivering a taste of Ice Cream Sandwich to the Nexus S 4G. It's already pretty clear that particular handset will be getting the upgrade at some point, but we know how impatient you can be. Breezy hasn't released his ROM just yet, because there's still some bugs to work out -- like the non-functioning WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular data and the wonky touchscreen. So, while you wait for him to get the kinks ironed out, enjoy the additional photo after the break, which sports the same alternate orange theme.
