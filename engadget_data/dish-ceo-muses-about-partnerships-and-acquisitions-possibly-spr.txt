 We've already heard that Dish Network was in the mix for a possible Hulu acquisition (which still isn't off the table), but it looks like the company could also setting its sights even higher. Speaking with Bloomberg, Dish CEO Joseph Clayton talked a bit about the possibility of getting involved with a wireless carrier, noting that it will "look at partnerships, acquisitions, all of the above." When asked if that could include an acquisition or partnership with Sprint or Clearwire, Clayton reportedly said, "could be," and added a "stay tuned" when asked more generally about the possibility of a Dish wireless network (which could benefit from some of the company's existing spectrum holdings). Head on past the break for a video of the interview.
