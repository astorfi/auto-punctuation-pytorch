As expected, albeit a little late, the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus for T-Mob can now be updated to Android 4.0 via the download in the source link. Moreover, the Springboard slate will get an Ice Cream Sandwich update of its own via an over-the-air push that starts tomorrow. Looking for more intel on either? Give those links below a tap.
