None of them are bigger than the Hulu Desktop app, a "lean back" interface (what, they heard ten-foot was already taken?) that unleashes Hulu's Flash video from the browser and also supports Mac & Microsoft compatible six button remotes -- which makes their unwillingness/inability to continue boxee access or offer an official Media Center plugin even more confusing. Even those without HTPC's to try that out on, there is a Video Panel Designer offering customized embeddable widgets for website owners, a Recommendations section based on what you've already watched and a new Time-Based Browsing option to order programs by when they originally aired. Give them a try and let us know if this makes you forget about all the other ways that were already available (boxee, PlayOn, Secondrun.tv, Understudy, ReQuest, XBMC & others) to get Hulu on your HDTV.
