Seidenberg reiterated that he'd love to take Vodafone's 45 percent off its hands, but admits that the prospects are unlikely in the short term; he goes on to say, though, that he's convinced they'll be willing to dump it once the wireless industry cools off. The next target of his ire is archrival Sprint, which he says will "self-destruct" by failing to meet capacity demand following the launch of the blowout $50 unlimited deal on its iDEN-based Boost subsidiary -- fightin' words from a guy whose ad campaign has revolved around a smug dork in a jumpsuit touting network reliability for half a decade. Finally -- and this is kind of juicy -- Ivan talks up the iPhone, saying that Apple had never seriously considered a CDMA version, but that he thinks the company will be much more receptive to talks once Big Red moves to LTE and everyone gets on the same page technologically. Of course, if AT&T has anything to say about it, it won't happen -- but it'll be a fun drama to watch unfold.[Via Phone Scoop, image via I Can Has Cheezburger?]
