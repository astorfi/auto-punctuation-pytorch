The latest is the above snap, raising hopes that its Series 5 Hybrid PC will be formally announced a teutonic trade show IFA this week. The 11-inch Transformer-esque device features a tablet that's magnetically-attached to a keyboard dock, running "full" Windows 8 on Intel's Clover Trail x86 architecture. In addition to Redmond's newest OS, it'll use native versions of the S-Pen apps we've used on the Galaxy Note 10.1, although it's probably too much to hope that it'll be able to make calls like its cousin.
