Viacom quickly sued Cablevision after the Optimum for iPad (now on iPhone and iPod Touch) app launched and allowed cable customers to stream the entire channel lineup on their tablets, but now they've resolved that and "an unrelated business matter". Viacom's case against Time Warner's similar offering is on hold while they also try to work out a deal, but Cablevision's stance from the start is that its approach fell within the existing agreements and they appear to have gotten their way. Just like most other channel carriage disputes, it was likely a deal on the supposedly unrelated issue that got things moving, but as long as we can keep watching Teen Mom in the kitchen, bathroom or out on the patio it doesn't really matter. Check the official statement from both companies after the break.
