It looks the same.


That's the impression you'd probably get looking at the HTC One M9 for the first time. I felt that way too, at first. Thing is, HTC knows it's got a good thing going with its high-end One design and just didn't feel like a full-on revolution was necessary in 2015... maybe to the consternation of some of its activist fans. So what's new, if not the M9's aesthetic? Quite a bit, really, and not all of it great.

Let's start with the stuff we liked. Build quality is, as usual, just impeccable. The M9 is a hair narrower, shorter and fatter than the model that came before it, and all that, combined with a pair of wider left and right edges make the phone feel more substantial, more slab-like in your hand. This time around, the company went with a dual anodization process, which imparts different finishes (and colors!) to its 2015 flagship, and my two days of testing were spent with a half-silver, half-rose gold M9. It very quickly wound up being my favorite because, well, it's a little batty. The chassis is topped off with a brushed aluminum hairline finish that HTC says is "jewelry grade." I'm really not sure about that, but the M9's chassis is mostly fantastic. The whole shebang is exceptionally snappy, with none of the occasional slowdown that sprung up in LG's G Flex2, despite both devices sharing a Snapdragon 810. The 3GB of RAM helped keep things smooth as I bounded through apps and flicked down webpages, too, and all told, it's a better example of the sort of performance we can expect out of Qualcomm's new silicon.
