 
 Just an FYI, the folks over at Facebook have shoved another update to their app for Android out the door today. While version 1.9.7 won't add any new apps to your launcher, it does require some new permissions (phone status), require Android 2.2 and up, and offers some changes for the messaging and integrated camera experience. The camera app supports front-mounted shooter, while messaging improves switching between conversations, including friends of friends, sharing bigger photos and seeing who is available. There's also various bug fixes, faster app login and navigation plus an unspecified security improvement, so even if your social media experience doesn't include duckfaced self-pics and staying up on the latest gossip, it may be worth grabbing sooner rather than later.
