So it looks like TiVo's ads inserted when you
fast-forward are officially launched, and they're apparently smaller and less intrusive than they were in beta
testing. That's definitely a step in the right direction but jeez, isn't there a point when the lightbulb goes on and
advertisers realize we're fast-forwarding the ads becauseâ€¦ we don't want to look at ads?
