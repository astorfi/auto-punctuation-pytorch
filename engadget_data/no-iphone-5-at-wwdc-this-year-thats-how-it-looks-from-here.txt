Namely, unlike the events in 2008 through 2010, you won't see the announcement of a new iPhone (or iPad... or anything else hardware related). We're hearing the same kind of chatter from sources that solid writers like Jim Dalrymple of The Loop and All Thing D's John Paczkowski have been reporting today -- that this WWDC is going to be all about the future of iOS and OS X.

Of course if that pans out, all eyes are going to be on the company's Fall event, which seems like an increasingly likely place to launch a new phone -- especially considering the fact that the iPod's place in Apple's lineup has become diminished thanks to the success of its mobile devices. The timing also sets Apple up nicely for a brisk season of holiday phone purchases. As for the iPad, Daring Fireball's John Gruber speculated that we might see some kind of new model at this year's Fall event, and while that seems highly unlikely to us given the recent launch of the iPad 2, a new tablet would make a perfect companion to that new phone. What September holds is pure speculation right now, but for the time being, it looks like you can just get comfortable with your iPhone 4.
