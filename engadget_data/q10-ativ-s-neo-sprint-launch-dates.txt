Sprint users awaiting BlackBerry's Q10 and its promised "summer" launch, wait no more -- the Q10 will start shipping pre-orders beginning August 30th, with "all other channels" following on September 13th. At least that's according to an internal release date list provided to Engadget by an anonymous tipster, which also gives Samsung's ATIV S Neo an August 16th launch date on Sprint. Of course, these dates are tentative as always, and could shift before the official announcement. In the meantime, we've reached out to Sprint for an official word and will update this post should we hear back.

Update: Sprint tells us ... not too much. The company's official statement is: "We have not announced availability for either device, and we do not comment on rumors or speculation on product availability dates. We have said BlackBerry Q10 will be available in late summer, and Samsung ATIV S Neo will be available this summer. Exact availability dates for both smartphones will be shared closer to their availability dates."
