Nokia already has one (likely Lumia 928-related) surprise scheduled for next week on the 14th, but it's doubling up by teasing more news Thursday in India. Scheduled for noon in New Delhi (2:30AM ET), all we have to go on are hints about "color", the yellow picture above and word that it's an "exciting global event." Executive VP of sales and marketing Chris Weber tweeted we should expect "Colorful Nokia news and so much more," but didn't reveal anything else. You have a little over 24 hours to wildly (or not so wildly, the location and timing suggests the Lumia brand won't be involved) speculate, let us know what you're thinking it could be in the comments below.
