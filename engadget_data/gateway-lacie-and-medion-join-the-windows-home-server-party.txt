  In addition to touting Vista sales, Mr. Gates also provided an update on their Windows Home Server (WHS) platform during his WinHEC 2007 keynote. While he didn't offer any updates to the ambiguous "later this year" release date, he did mention that Gateway, LaCie and Medion will join HP to delivery their own hardware products based on WHS. Specifically, the DLNA-compliant Medion Home Server will offer up to 2TB of storage and should ship before the year is up. Oh, and in case you're responsible for the corporate IT budget and staff allocation, you'll be interested to know that Gates and co. are on track with Windows Server 2008 -- formerly known as Windows Server "Longhorn" -- release for the second half of 2007.
