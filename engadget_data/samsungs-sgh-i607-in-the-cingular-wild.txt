No front-facing camera like we we've seen elsewhere but that Cingular branding is unmistakable. Just to run it down again for ya, this WinMo Smartphone is expected to bring quad-band GSM / GPRS / EDGE / HSDPA data, Bluetooth, MicroSD expansion, and a side mounted scroll-wheel said to be "on-par, or better than those on RIM devices." We'll see soon enough if the Q3 launch date is accurate. Another picture 'round back after the break.[Thanks, Notorious J]
