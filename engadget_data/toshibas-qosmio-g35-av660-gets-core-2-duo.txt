Still, between the easy upgrade path and the marginal performance increase and power savings, that doesn't mean we're not stoked to report the Qosmio series now features the G35-AV660, the first laptop we've seen with an HD DVD drive paired up with a Core 2 Duo T7200 (perhaps they mean T2700?) processor. Which is good, too, because you're going to need all the horsepower you can get when you're pumping 1080p content on that 17-inch 1920 x 1200 Ultimate TruBrite display; otherwise you can expect a 256MB GeForce Go 7600 graphics adapter, 240GB SATA RAID, 802.11a/b/g, Bluetooth 2.0+ EDR, gigabit Ethernet, finger print reader, four USB 2.0 ports, ExpressCard, PC card, 1394, S-Video in and out, 5-in-1 media adapter, and best of all, a tiny, completely affordable $3500 price tag. Yes, we're being sarcastic, but for the same price you've got your Blu-ray equivalent, so take your pick. More pics after the break.[Thanks, El_Matarife]
