According to Bloomberg, Sammy is set to announce a new line of HDTVs that will offer integrated Google TV functionality, as was earlier rumored, and while we don't have any more details than that, the use of Intel (presumably Atom) processors is noted -- though that's hardly a shocker. The report indicates that the announcement will be made in January, which just so happens to be when a little electronics show will be taking place in Las Vegas. Coincidence? You make the call.

Update: Samsung wrote in with an official statement on the subject:

The status of Samsung's relationship with Google TV as it is currently under consideration, but no decision has been reached.
Make of that what you will!
