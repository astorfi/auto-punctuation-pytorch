 
 That stunning and gigantic Bravia that Sony unveiled at IFA, well, we finally have pricing and availability for this potential TV king. The 84-inch Bravia XBR-84X900 (aka the KD-84X9005) will go up for pre-order tomorrow, September 6th, for the jaw-dropping price of $25,000 (let us know when you've stopped hyperventilating). The edge-lit panel wont' be delivering full HD passive 3D entertainment to living rooms until later this fall, however. While orders can be placed less than 24 hours from now, shipments will have to wait until some undetermined day in November. Well, at least that should give you a few months head start on paying this monstrosity off... before the repo men eventually show up to take it off your hands.
