Okay, there are officially too many SPOT watches now, who would have thunk? Can you tell that this is Gates' pet
project? Word is that Bill wants to see this tech succeed in a big way. Anyhow, SpotStop drops the docs on the new
Fossil and Abacus models, which are going to go for $200.


Rubber and leather bands, out of the box content, slimmer design, inductive chargingâ€”seems like Fossil took notes
and responded to all the feedback from the early adopters. So hold off on that Swatch
we showed you until you see these. Expect these to come
out next week, and expect even more at CES.
