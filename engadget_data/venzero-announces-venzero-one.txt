 
Remember that mysterious Venzero audio player thatMusicMarker service was getting integrated into? Well, they announced what it is today: the Venzero ONE. Turns outit'll be a 3.8 x 2.3 x 0.55-inch 8GB audio player with an FM tuner, 2-inch QVGA display, FM radio, mic recording (forMusicMarker, of course), OGG and PlaysForSure support, video playback, a 90dB SNR, and even a lightweight RSS reader.It's also got a built-in full size USB On-The-Go port and retractable USB connector (what they're calling Shareport),so you can dock your Venzero with another -- or any other mass-storage compliant device, for that matter -- and movearound data, apparently also including DRMed music (assuming, of course, your Venzero ONE is authorized with aPlaysForSure service). Should be available mid-June thisyear for $289.
