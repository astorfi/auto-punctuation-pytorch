When sci fi narratives explore artificial intelligence approaching a human level of sentience, they tend to focus on the negative (Skynet, anyone?). Not so with Spike Jonze's new movie Her, a melancholy examination of what it means to be human in an increasingly inhuman world. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix as a social recluse who finds a friend in his smartphone's Siri-inspired assistant, Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). The relationship blossoms in a way that manages to be both heartfelt and deeply unsettling, and Jonze's take on a sort of technological animism feels pretty culturally resonant. Her is set for a November release, and you can watch the trailer after the break.
