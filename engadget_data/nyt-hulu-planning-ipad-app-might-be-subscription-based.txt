That either makes a lot of sense (if you're a TV network exec looking to keep the Aston padding on your paycheck) or absolutely none at all (if you're everyone else), but it certainly seems like it's happening -- especially since Hulu CEO Jason Kilar told the Times that he's "open to subscriptions as a complement to the ad-supported model." That's as close to a confirmation as we've ever heard, but we've got a feeling Apple's putting the full-court press on Hulu and other networks like CBS -- we'd expect to see this go from rumor to reality relatively soon.
