What's being changed? Well, apparently it won't have the 802.11g of the hw6700 (instead it'll use 802.11b), butit should keep that GPS, have 128MB flash memory, 64MB RAM, get bumped to a 416MHz Xscale CPU, and finally pick upWindows Mobile 5.0 AKU 2.0 (the version upgraded for push email support). Will and when will it happen? We've no idea,but we're hoping so, and soon, respectively.
