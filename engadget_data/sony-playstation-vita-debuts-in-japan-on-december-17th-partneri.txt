  Show full PR text  DOCOMO to Introduce Two Prepaid Data Billing Plans  TOKYO, JAPAN, September 14, 2011 --- NTT DOCOMO, INC. today announced it will introduce two prepaid billing plans, "Prepaid Data Plan 20h" and "Prepaid Data Plan 100h," for 3G data communication in Japan this coming December. The plans will first be implemented for Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.'s next generation portable entertainment system, "PlayStation®Vita (3G/Wi-Fi model)," which will be launched in Japan, on December 17.  Prepaid Data Plan 20h will cost 980 yen (incl. tax) for 20 hours of access to the DOCOMO 3G network (max. 128 Kbps downlink / 64 Kbps uplink) over a 30-day period.  Prepaid Data Plan 100h will cost 4,980 yen (incl. tax) for 103 hours of network access (max. 128 Kbps downlink / 64 Kbps uplink) over a 180-day period, which includes three hours of access at max. speeds of 14 Mbps downlink and 5.7 Mbps uplink in FOMA™ HIGH-SPEED areas of the DOCOMO 3G network.  To begin using either plan, or to resume using prepaid billing after allowing either plan to expire, a fee of 2,100 yen will be charged for issuing a new DOCOMO UIM card. In the case of PlayStation®Vita (3G/Wi-Fi model), however, this fee will be waived for first-time users and a DOCOMO UIM card will be preinstalled in the system, as a special campaign from Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.  Renewal must be carried out within 44 days (30 days of service use, plus 14 additional days) for Prepaid Data Plan 20h, or 194 days (180 days of service use, plus 14 additional days) for Prepaid Data Plan 100h. If the user's plan is not renewed within this period and is allowed to expire, resumption of prepaid service at a later date will require the issuance of a new UIM card for a fee of 2,100 yen.  DOCOMO will launch a special website where users can subscribe to, renew or change their plans, as well as check their remaining access time and days.
