Getting us started is the €90 ($142) 5000 (ships in Q2), which checks in with a QVGA display, FM tuner, MP3 ringtone support, Bluetooth, GPRS connectivity and a 1.3-megapixel camera -- the firm's first at the aforesaid price point. Next up is the Q3-bound 2680 slide (pictured), which boasts a camera, FM radio and a manageable €75 ($119) price tag. Moving on, there's the 7070 Prism, which rocks those same geometric patterns we've grown to love (or hate) on the 7500, a voice recorder and a €50 ($79) sticker. Lastly, the 1680 classic (ships in Q2) arrives as the company's most "affordable cameraphone to date" at just €50 ($79). Go on, check out the whole gang in the gallery below!
