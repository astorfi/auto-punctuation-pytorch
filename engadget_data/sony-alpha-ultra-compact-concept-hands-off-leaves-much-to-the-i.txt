Furthermore, all the Sony reps we managed to corner wouldn't answer our questions. Will the lenses be interchangeable with Sony's current Alpha DSLR line, or any of the MFT lenses? What's been cut from traditional Four Thirds models to accommodate for the drop in size? Radio silence, save for a repeat of this morning's information and a finger point to the adjacent "
Exmor APS HD CMOS" sign -- which, as we know from this morning, is larger than a Four Thirds sensor, but we're not sure how much. Still, enjoy the pics we managed to take from behind the glass -- and also be sure to enjoy the shots of this morning's other Sony announcements, the
Super Telephoto Lens (500mm F4 G) and the prototype Distagon T 24mm F2 ZA SSM.
