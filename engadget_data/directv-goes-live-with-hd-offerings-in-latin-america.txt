As of this week, DirecTV is now taking orders for HD service in Latin America, and reportedly, those that sign up can receive an HD DVR capable of storing 400 hours of SD or 100 hours of high-def footage. Initially, there will only be four high-definition channels available (HBO HD, Movie City HD, Fox HD and DirecTV HD), but we suppose you've got to start somewhere. Has anyone down that way signed up? How's the image / audio quality?[Thanks, Eduardo]Read - DirecTV launching in Latin AmericaRead - DirecTV's official HD site (Peru)
