As the news from WWDC continues to flow, Apple has just announced a new AirPort Extreme base station. It's 4 inches wide and 6.5-inches tall with support for simultaneous dual-band 802.11 ac and has a "beamforming" antenna configuration to enhance performance. Also announced is the AirPort Time Capsule, which has similar specs as the Extreme but has a built-in hard drive in either 2TB or 3TB configurations. Should go nice with those new MacBook Airs right?
