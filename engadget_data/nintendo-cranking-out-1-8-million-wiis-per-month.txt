 It's not like you really needed another PSA to reinforce just how difficult getting your hands around a Wii this holiday season will be, but a recent interview with Nintendo of America's marketing chief George Harrison did make mention of that fact. More specifically, he stated that it was "still expecting some shortages in December," but noted that the Big N wouldn't be "pulling back on its marketing." Potentially more interesting is Mr. Harrison's assertion that the firm is currently producing some 1.8 million Wiis per month, and it's having to make decisions of where to send shipments to "nearly every week." 'Course, the chat couldn't end without some reference to the rivals, and the exec concluded by proclaiming that Nintendo "doesn't focus a lot on the competition," as "its performance seems to be independent of those two."[Via 1UP]
