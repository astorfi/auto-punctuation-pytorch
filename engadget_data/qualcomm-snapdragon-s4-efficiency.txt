It delivers fantastic performance and good battery life, but an unsung hero that allows for both characteristics is its excellent efficiency. Based on a new 28nm fabrication process, not only is the Snapdragon S4 faster than most mobile processors, but it also runs a lot cooler. Naturally, one way to prove this is with thermal imagery. We've always suspected there's something in the water near San Diego, however, and the following video damn near proves it. While we'd hate to give away the surprise, just know that Qualcomm engineers have officially thrown down the gauntlet... even if it happens to be rather high in saturated fat.
