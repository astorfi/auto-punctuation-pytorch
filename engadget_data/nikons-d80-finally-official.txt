So, what've we got? The D80 features a 10.2 megapixel (uh huh) DX format CCD, Nikon F lens mount, 3D Color Matrix Metering II, 11 area autofocus, 0.18 second bootup, 80ms shot response, and... apparently an SD slot? (from the release: "Images are processed instantly and recorded quickly to the inserted SD memory card." (This is the first time we've seen an SD slot appear in a high end DSLR in, well, a while.) Then there's also the 3fps rapid fire shots, and 2.5-inch LCD; elsewise, besides the bundled 18-135mm lens the body comes with, Nikon is releasing a AF-S VR Zoom-Nikkor 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6G IF-ED lens (and we thought Samsung had rough product names) for the D80, with a 4.3x zoom and Vibration Reduction II OIS. The lens is going to be available worldwide in October (if you have to ask how much, it's probably not for you), but the camera's due September, and will set you back $999 body alone, or $1299 for the body with that 18-135mm lens.[Thanks, Blake & Trevor]
