 Samsung has tentatively been on the hook for $1.05 billion in penalties after allegedly infringing on Apple's patents, but that figure is about to change -- for better or for worse. Judge Koh has ordered a reevaluation of $450.5 million of the damages in a second trial, arguing that the jury set one damage figure per product where there were six infringement claims that had to be taken into account for each device. She also believes that Apple may be entitled to damages for sales not included in the original case. There's a chance Samsung can lower the amount it ultimately has to pay, but the extra factors and devices could easily worsen its situation. Koh hasn't set a trial date, either, but we'd like it to come soon: Apple versus Samsung is quickly becoming the battle that never ends.
