We've ragged on Best Buy before for how annoyingly
frustrating it can be to shop there (we're at the point where we'll only shop there if it's a dire gadget-related
emergency), but they've managed to piss off someone a lot more powerful than us this time. The Ohio state attorney
general is suing the chain, charging them with "a pattern of unfair and deceptive acts and practices", and alleging
that they've been repackaging used electronics as new (which might explain why that external hard drive we bought there
a few years back had so much porn on itâ€”not that we bothered returning it) and failing to honor rebates, refunds, and
exchanges.
