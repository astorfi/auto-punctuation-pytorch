As you can see in the shot above of the desktop dock Motorola's slab appears to have a chrome ring running around the outside, while the dock itself has a 3.5mm audio out, HDMI output and USB ports. There's no price or release date listed for either accessory but if you've been lusting over the beast and its rumored specs we're figuring some quiet time with these shots is just what the doctor ordered -- check after the break for a shot of the car dock and the back of the desktop docking station.
