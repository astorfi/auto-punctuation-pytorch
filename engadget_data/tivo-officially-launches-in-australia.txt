As we'd already heard, the box will be available exclusively through Harvey Norman stores for three months starting on July 29th, after which the AUD$699 device will find its way into other retail outlets. On the plus side, the HD DVR will have all of the standard features as seen on the US model (Season Pass, Wish List, etc.) and there will be no monthly fee. On the downside, most of the networking extras we're accustomed to in America -- TiVoToGo, music playback, photo viewing, etc. -- won't be immediately available. The unit itself is based on the TiVo HD, as it features a 160GB hard drive, dual tuners, an eSATA port and support for SD / HD broadcasts. Hit the read link for all the gory details, okay mate?
