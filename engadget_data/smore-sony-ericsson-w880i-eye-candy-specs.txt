While there's still no telling when exactly the W880i "Ai" is gonna go official, we've seen it from pretty much every conceivable angle now, and Russian site MobileLife has published some possible specs brought over from Esato. We could be looking at tri-band GSM plus UMTS (presumably on the 2100MHz band only), a QVGA display, 2 megapixel camera, and Memory Stick Micro slot -- all of which are believable enough, though we think it's genuinely inexcusable at this point for a halo model from any major manufacturer like this to come equipped without quadband GSM, if not tri-band UMTS. That's alright, folks, we don't want your love anyway... we're not sold on the Ai's styling quite yet. Maybe the next batch of spy shots'll clear it up for us?[Thanks, Jabar]
