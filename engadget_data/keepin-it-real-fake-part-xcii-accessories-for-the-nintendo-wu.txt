 
Apparently targeted at game shoppers with bad eyesight, these accessories for the "Wu" game console reader Jordan Perr spotted in New York's Chinatown seem like less of a product and more like the Chinese KIRF masters are playing a devious inside joke on us. Choices include what appears to be a knockoff of Brando's Wii Sports Pack, a "PEGA" version of PEGO's Airplane Controller Stand and a "Wu Combat Pack" with sword and shield. No word on whether Wu accessories are compatible with the Vii, but for a staggering $30 we expect nothing less. Peep a few more shots after the break.
