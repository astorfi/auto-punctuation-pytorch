 According to an NPD report, Best Buy is the dominant retailer of Blu-ray and HD DVD media. How dominant? So dominant that for once, NPD is not releasing any numbers and is leaving us to guess what "a wide margin" over second and third place retailers Amazon and Wal-Mart means. Rounding out the top five were Circuit City and Target. A Best Buy spokesman chalked the top honors up to an "audience that loves movies, where they are not casual fans," adding that they "... tend to understand high-def more than the average consumer," which sounds like some people we know. Ahem. That's fine -- we're comfortable being in the 10% minority, right?
