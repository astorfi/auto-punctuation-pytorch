 We all know how great HD is, if we didn't love it then we wouldn't be here at HDBeat. HD is taking the world by storm and starting to hit critical mass. It's no wonder that some marketing departments have tried to latch on to take advantage, but HD radio? What could possibly be considered HD about radio? HD or High Definition as defined by answers.com is "The clarity of detail in an optically produced image, such as a photograph, effected by a combination of resolution and contrast." or "The degree of clarity with which a televised image or broadcast signal is received." As you can see this has nothing to do with sound, the worst part is that sound has it's own high quality designation; Hi-Fi, but unfortunately for us and the iBiquity's marketing department that term is so 1970. Regardless of the correct terminology HD Radio is here to stay and the worst part is the sound quality isn't even close to be as good as the audio from HDTV. It is better than AM or FM, but does it deserve to be tagged HD? So if you have something to market in the consumer electronics world don't forget to either put a 'i' in front of it(iRadio?) or call it HD or it won't succeed.
