Well, hot on the heels of the R600 (the company's first foray into navigation) comes the R300 and R700, two new GPS / PMPs that do just about what you'd expect, and maybe a little bit more. The R300 has a 3.5-inch touchscreen, a 400MHz Samsung CPU, 128MB of RAM, FM tuner, Bluetooth 2.0, can playback MP3, WMA, AAC audio and MPEG-4, H.263 video, and sports a microSD slot. The R700 has a larger, 4.3-inch touchscreen, and an integrated RDS-TMC traffic receiver, though otherwise the specs are pretty much the same as the R300. No word on price, but the units are expected to arrive sometime in November, at least in Europe.[Via Unwired View]
