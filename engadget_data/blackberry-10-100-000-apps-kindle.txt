 While it's still got some distance to make up, BlackBerry has swiftly reached a milestone of sorts -- its first 100,000 apps. According to the announcement, BB10 has notched up over 30,000 new games and apps over the last seven weeks, all before it's even entered the USA. Notable new additions include the Kindle reader, available today, which Amazon confirmed back in January. There's also apps from The Wall Street Journal and OpenTable, with the promise of eBay, CNN, Rdio, Skype, Viber and more arriving "in the coming weeks."

   "It now appears that the already impressive levels of developer support for the BlackBerry 10 platform are accelerating into the launch window for the BlackBerry Z10. The prospect of a very robust app catalog can only bolster momentum for the product and the platform itself," said John Jackson, Research Vice President, Mobile & Connected Platforms at IDC. "The ability to attract and sustain developer support is like lifeblood for any mobile platform, and it's not something that simply happens. This progress is a testament to BlackBerry's early and innovative engagement with developers worldwide and the innovative architecture of the platform itself."

   BlackBerry 10 applications take connecting to the next level with the ability to leverage social, gamification, and integration frameworks that other platforms are not able to offer. Customers can easily share applications with those in their social networks including BBM™ (BlackBerry® Messenger), Facebook, and Twitter. Applications can incorporate gaming features such as leader boards, badges, rewards and more using the Scoreloop tools, and BlackBerry 10 applications can tie to core OS integration points to allow developers to create compelling experiences to keep people moving and flow with BlackBerry 10 experience features.

   In addition to apps and games, BlackBerry World for BlackBerry 10 offers access to one of the most robust catalogs of music and video content for mobile users*, with partnerships across all major movie studios, all major music labels and television networks.

   The BlackBerry Z10 (all touch) is the first smartphone powered by BlackBerry 10, the re-designed, re-engineered, and re-invented BlackBerry platform. The BlackBerry Z10 will be available in the U.S. from March 22.
