The new chip is due to be announced tomorrow at SIGGRAPH 2009, and like the rest of the FirePro line, it'll offer 1GB of DDR5 frame buffer memory, 30-bit DisplayPort and dual-link DVI output, and tons of CAD application certifications. We're looking for hard specs and prices now, we'll let you know as soon as we get 'em.
