NTT DoCoMo knows how to keep hardcore fans happy, releasing a limited run of 15,000 LG Optimus Vu with the phablet carrying custom wallpaper and illustrations from the creators of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Beneath the surface, it's the same phone we've seen before -- albeit with support for mobile TV standard Nottv. If you're now throwing your yen at the screen, we'd suggest going to your nearest store on August 30th, because online sales are limited to 750 on that day and a further 750 on September 1st.
