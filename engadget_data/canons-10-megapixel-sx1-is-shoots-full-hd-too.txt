The camera carries over the looks of the SX10 IS while opting for a 10 megapixel 1/2.3-inch CMOS sensor capable of shooting 4fps full resolution JPEG stills or Full HD, H.264 video at 30fps for up to 30 minutes at a time (SD for up to an hour). It packs a DIGIC 4 image processor, optical image stabilization, and same 20x wide-angle zoom like the SX10 but opts for HDMI output and a slightly larger, 2.8-inch LCD around back. Priced at Â£520 which will translate to a lot less than the US equivalent $927 should this camera ever ship Stateside. [Thanks, Meema S.]
