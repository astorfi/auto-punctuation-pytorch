 Talk of Samsung building a Tizen phone for non-developers has existed almost since the platform got started, but the company was silent on any definitive plans throughout 2012. It's speaking up this year: Samsung has confirmed to Bloomberg BusinessWeek that there's multiple "competitive" Tizen devices in the pipeline for 2013. While the firm unsurprisingly won't say what's involved, it's willing to say that the lineup will grow "depending on market conditions" -- in other words, it's watching early sales like a hawk. Does this mean a Galaxy S III with Tizen? A refined version of the developer device we saw last spring? At this stage, it might not matter when just having a major smartphone maker onboard is big news for a fledgling platform.
