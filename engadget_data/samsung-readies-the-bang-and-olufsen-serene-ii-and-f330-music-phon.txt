Well, the phone-elves have been busy tinkering in their workshop night after night, and we've managed to get a look at a real / fake picture of their otherwise-named SGH-F310 (pictured left). Rumor has it that the phone will arrive as a UMTS / EDGE / HSDPA (1.8 Mbps) device, with a 240 x 240 touchscreen, 4GB of memory, and all kinds of media playback support. Additionally, Samsung appears to be readying the F330 music phone for widespread dispersion, which will be rocking EDGE / HSDPA (3.6 Mbps), Bluetooth and USB connectivity, a 240 x 320 display, 2 megapixel camera, and a microSD slot. Of course, this is all rampant speculation at this point, but don't say we didn't warn you.Read -- Samsung F310/B&O Serenata music phoneRead -- Samsung F330 music phone
