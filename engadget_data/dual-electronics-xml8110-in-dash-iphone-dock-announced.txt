 
It always seemed to us that plugging in your iPod with a cable (or worse yet, an FM tuner or cassette adapter) was an inelegant solution to listening to your Namesakes Series MP3 audiobooks on the road (the shorter works of Washington Irving as read by Dr. J, for example). Lucky for us, the motor heads from Dual Electronics have devised the XML8110. This 200 watt AM/FM docking station sits in your dash under the guise of a mild-mannered car stereo, featuring a solid state "mechless" design, optional steering control input, remote control, Bluetooth for hands-free operation with caller ID, and more. Coming soon for a reported $99, with an iPhone app in the works. Now all you need is some wheels! get a closer look after the break.
