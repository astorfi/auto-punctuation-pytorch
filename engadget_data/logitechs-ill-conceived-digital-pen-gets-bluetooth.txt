So when Logitech didn't revolutionize the world of writing the first nor the
second time around, they must have thought "hey, third
time's a charm — let's add Bluetooth!" The io2 still works as ever — capturing and digitizing writings and sketches
made on special paper — but now it connects wirelessly to your smartphone, PDA, or Blackberry. Gone is the USB cradle,
but still remains the fact that pen input to a handheld device is cumbersome no matter which way you slice it. Perhaps
no one has clued them in on the existence of
Bluetooth keyboards?
