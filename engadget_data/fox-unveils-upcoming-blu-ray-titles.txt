       Fox Home Entertainment is releasing four Blu-ray titles just in time to fill the high-def lovers stockings. The Sentinel, Entrapment, Rising Sun, From Hell and the '04 remake of Flight of Phoenix will be coming out on 1080p-enabled Blu-ray discs on December 5th. There isn't many technical deets available but we do know that these discs are going to feature the high-bit rate audio codex DTS-HD Master Audio. Pricing hasn't been release just yet but can we assume that they will hit the shelves at the semi-standard $29.99 MSRP.
