Halo: The Master Chief Collection is more than just a collection of the green supersoldier's greatest hits -- it's also an early access pass to the next game in the franchise, Halo 5: Guardians. How early? Well, the game isn't expected until fall 2015, so pretty freakin' early is the answer. Right now -- today -- you can get into Halo 5's multiplayer beta months ahead of the game's completion. In that spirit, we're streaming a few hours of the game in action while taking questions live! Join us at 1PM ET today for Halo 5: Guardians, multiplayer, in beta.


Update: We're done for now, but the archived video is available just below the break!



[For the record, I'm playing the Halo 5: Guardians beta on an Xbox One, using a download code provided by Microsoft. I'm streaming the game over wired internet using an Elgato Game Capture HD device and Open Broadcaster Software. All that to say, "This game will likely look prettier and run more smoothly on your home equipment. Streaming conditions vary!"]
