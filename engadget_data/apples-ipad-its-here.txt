We just put down plastic for one and had it activated at the Apple Store, so stand by for pictures and videos from that unparalleled experience. The "activation" process is just plugging it into a computer with iTunes for the first time, so that you can walk out of the store with the device turned on. After the unit is up and running you can dive into the App Store, where you're prompted for a free download of iBooks. It's all smooth sailing from there.

Update: We added a gallery of shots entering The Cube, and after the break there's a video of us unboxing and activating the iPad.
