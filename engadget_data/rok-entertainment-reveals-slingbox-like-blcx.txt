 Hot on the heels of the SlingPlayer Mobile releaseis word from the UK that mobile content provider ROK Entertainment is planning to release a SlingBox-like device to coincide with the broadcast of the World Cup.Mobile Marketing Magazine is reporting that ROK, who currently offer a variety of streamed programming for Symbianphones, decided to manufacture the so-called "BLCX" box after learning that soccer's biggest event wouldn'tbe available live online. Keeping in mind that folks might only want a product like this for the Cup, ROK will beoffering the BLCX as a rental for £12 a month in addition to the outright purchase option of £250. Alsounusual is the fact that this service claims to work on connections as slow as GPRS -- sounds kind of dubious to us(although ROK TV currently boasts 2.5G support -- any anecdotal evidence, Brits?), but all will be made clear on thepromised rollout date of June 1st.[Via TechDigest]
