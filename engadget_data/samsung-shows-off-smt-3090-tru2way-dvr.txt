The dual-tuner HD DVR comes with a 160GB HDD, DOCSIS 2.0 modem for interactive communication to the headend and Multistream CableCARD. Samsung didn't leave Panasonic alone, as it's also demoing a tru2way LCD TV, See'n'Search web-enabled tru2way box and a tru2way STB that communicates with the headend to deliver targeted ads based on viewing patterns. No word on how long before any of this equipment is expected to hit the street, check after the break (or our gallery) for more pics
