Originally announced with nary a visual clue to its appearance, the Megacity has now been fleshed out in the above futuristic sketch, which gives us an inkling of the car's design direction. Don't expect it to have too much bearing on the final product, though -- we do anticipate the real deal to have, y'know, tyres. BMW is also putting together an all-new chassis specifically for this battery-powered city transporter, and has already begun crash-testing the carbon fiber-equipped shells. In spite of its compact dimensions, the Megacity is being described as a "premium sustainability" vehicle, meaning its 2013 launch will be relevant to a somewhat select group of people.
