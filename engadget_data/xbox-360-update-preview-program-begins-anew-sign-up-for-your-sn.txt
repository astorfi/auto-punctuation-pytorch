If you're already aware of that fact, then you may also know that a select group of lucky US gamers typically get to test out the latest revision months ahead of their peers, and today Microsoft's holding sign-ups for a new version that will include "an updated Xbox 360 disc format," whatever that might mean. You'll also get a free copy of Halo: Reach if your name is picked -- which, according to Major Nelson, is much more likely if you're paying for an Xbox LIVE Gold account -- so you'll probably want to dive through ancient email post-haste to find your Windows LIVE ID, head over to our more coverage link and give it a go. Let us know what those new discs are all about if you get in, eh?
