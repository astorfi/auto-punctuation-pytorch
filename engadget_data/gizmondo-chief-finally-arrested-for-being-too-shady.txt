Specifically,former Tiger Telematics Europe executive and drunk driving enthusiast Stefan Eriksson was arrested at his Bel-Airresidence on Saturday, booked on suspicion of grand theft, and is currently enjoying decidedly less-luxurioussurroundings, as the Sheriff's Department is wisely holding the slippery Swede without bail. It's not immediately clearwhether the theft charge is related to Eriksson's destruction of that milliondollar Ferrari Enzo in February (pictured in cake, above), but since we'd already heard that a Scottish bank may bethe rightful owners of the mangled supercar, we wouldn't be surprised if the former videogame exec is guilty ofplaying a little real life GTA along with his favorite DUI. Meanwhile, Eriksson's imaginary friend and supposedco-conspirator, "Dietrich," remains at large.[Thanks, Dave M]
