The carrier has released several handsets today, including the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, HTC Radar 4G, myTouch and myTouchQ (online only until November 9th), LG DoublePlay, and the Samsung Exhibit II 4G. It's not too often we see six devices launch on the same day, but 'tis the season, right? If you've been eyeing any of these luscious gadgets for yourself or a loved one, it's high time to make the move.
