 As promised, Toshiba is shipping the HD-A20 to retailers with a MSRP of $499, but can probably be found online for even less. The HD-A20 fits right in the middle of Toshiba's trio of HD DVD players, which make up all of the stand alone HD DVD players available. The extra benjamin over the HD-A2 gets you HDMI 1.3 and 1080p output, but it lacks a few video enhancements like deep color support and additional connections like RS-232 when compared with its bigger brother, the HD-XA2. If this is any indication of what we can expect from second generation HD DVD players, Toshiba is on its way to producing some of the best next-gen physical media movie players anywhere -- at least until Blu-ray finally gets BD-J live done in October.
