Razer can help us live that dream with its Naga MMO mouse, which has a wild assortment of numbered buttons on its side to be theoretically assigned to those high-powered abilities we've theoretically invested countless hours into obtaining -- or theoretically paid a good price to a gold farmer for. Now Razer has a wireless version of the 5600 dpi laser mouse, using the same wired / wireless tech of the Razer Mamba (which is nice for when a theoretical gaming session stretches beyond the 12 hour continuous use mark the mouse is rated for) to let you plug in at will. There's also a charging dock that conveniently doubles as the 2.4GHz wireless base station. "That's great, Razer," you might say, "but what will I put this mouse on top of?" They're glad you asked. Razer is simultaneously launching a new ultrasmooth mousepad dubbed "Ironclad," built out of a single piece of aluminum. The pad will retail for $60 this month, with the mouse following for $130 in November.
