The unboxing shows --as one might expect -- the unit as it goes from its packaging to the wall, where it looks incredibly small when compared to an iMac (the actual display is only 12 x 16cm). Another picture of a letter that accompanied the unit, certifies that at least one of the 400 units being produced has now been accounted for, so you better get your $240 order into designer Buro Vormkrijgers soon, if they're not already sold out. Oh, damn, they are. All the more reason to enjoy the unboxing, eh?
