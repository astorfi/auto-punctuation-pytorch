 Well, it looks like that recently released BIOS update may not have been the cure-all solution that many Alienware M15x users were hoping for, with at least some of 'em now reporting that the update did nothing to fix the so-called "downclocking" problems that many were experiencing. Adding further confusion to the situation is that many users, as evidenced by the discussion on the Notebook Review forums, initially seemed to think that the update had fixed the downclocking problem, only to discover that it had reappeared a week or so later. For its part, Alienware is apparently aware of the ongoing problems and one rep from the company has even chimed with offers of help in on the forums, although there's no indication as to when the problem might be fixed once and for all.
