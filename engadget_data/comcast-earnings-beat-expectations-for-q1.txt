 Looks like it's time for a little endzone celebration in the City of Brotherly Love this week. Comcast issued its earnings, and things are looking up, marking a 30 percent profit increase for the first quarter. Revenue for the cable company is at $14.9 billion, beating out analyst estimates of $14.4 billion. The company did continue to shed video customers however, dropping around 37,000, although it did experience more customers adding on internet and phone service. The Associated Press chalks the happy results up to Super Bowl advertising and the popularity of the company's broadband offerings.
