MrSolidSnake745, who already has a pretty healthy selection of floppy disked video game themes, is offering the world his take on Daft Punk's "Derezzed," from the Tron: Legacy soundtrack, played on five floppy drives. It's loud, it's chaotic and it's enough to make us want to pull the old lightcycle out of storage. Video after the break.
