If it's legit, it hints at more affordable Kepler cards just around the corner -- potentially around $150 less than a GTX 680, if previous GeForce generations are anything to go by. That said, the list price associated with this particular box doesn't stack up: 1380 Malaysian Ringgits converts to $450, which seems over the odds and gives us even more reason to be wary. Hopefully the next customer will pop it open and check for spring phling before heading to the checkout.  [Thanks, Donny]
