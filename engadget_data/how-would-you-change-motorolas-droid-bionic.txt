This go 'round, we've got Motorola's Droid Bionic, yet another LTE handset in Verizon Wireless' stable, and with a $300-on-contract asking price, we're pretty sure the early adopters will have some pointed things to say. Still feeling like your chunk of change was spent on something worthwhile? How's the battery life? Would you have jazzed up the overall design in any way? Feeling like you should've waited for the Galaxy Nexus? Good or bad, we're eager to hear your comments now that you've had a few months to play around with it -- drop 'em in comments below!
