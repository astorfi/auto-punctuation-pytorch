 Intel has been touting its 45-nanometer chips for what seems like ages, but if all goes as planned, Panasonic will actually beat the chip giant to the punch by releasing products to the commercial market over a week earlier. Apparently, the six new Blu-ray recorders we spotted at CEATEC will utilize the firm's new generation "UniPhier system LSI based on the 45-nanometer process technology," and sure enough, those units are slated to hit Japan on November 1st -- a full ten days before Intel will reportedly get its Yorkfield crew out to the mainstream. Bet you didn't see that coming, now did you?[Via RegHardware]
