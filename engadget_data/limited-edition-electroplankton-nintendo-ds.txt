You pretty much have to be either 50 Cent or
Jay Mohr to get a special limited-edition
Nintendo DS—or you have to go
to Japan and hope you win one of ten limited-edition DS consoles that were created to coincide with the Japanese
release Toshio Iwai's new
ElectroPlankton game. Not too
amazingly awesome as far as special-limited edition consoles go—it's really just the original silver-colored DS with a
bit of game-related artwork emblazoned on it—but if anything that should make it a little easier to deal with the fact
that you probably aren't going to win one anyway.
