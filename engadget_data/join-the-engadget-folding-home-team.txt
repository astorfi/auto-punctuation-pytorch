So at the request of Engadget readers (or listeners,
as it were) who overheard our otherwise waylayed grand plan of storming Stanford's
Folding@home project, we're officially announcing the Team Engadget
Folding@home, uh, team.


 What is Folding@home? Well, in a nutshell you can donate your processor's spare cycles (when it's not computing for
you, that is) to the incredibly complex study of protein folding; possible uses for the data including curing many
forms of cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and all sorts of other diseases.

 Team Engadget's F@H team ID is: 39227



Other questions you may have.  Q: Will Engadget compensate me for my time/cycles/electricity/etc.? A: Nope.  Q: Do I win anything for being the #1 F@H unit producer on Team Engadget? A: Nope. But never say never.  Q: Why bother? A: It?s altruistic, it?s fun, and it might just cure a disease you may one day become afflicted with.
