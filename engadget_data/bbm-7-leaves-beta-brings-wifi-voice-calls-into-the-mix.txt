 RIM moves quickly: it was just a few weeks ago that BlackBerry Messenger 7 was in beta, and today we're seeing a finished version roll out to BlackBerry App World. As we saw in mid-November, the revamp lets chatters switch to free VoIP chat on WiFi without having to drop text messaging or photo sharing in mid-session. That's not the only upgrade; there's also direct BBM profile syncing through a BlackBerry ID as well as in-app notifications for future software versions. RIM warns that the BBM 7 upgrade may take as long as a day to show up in the store, so don't be disappointed if it's not immediately available; do, however, expect inter-BlackBerry voice calls to get that much cheaper.
