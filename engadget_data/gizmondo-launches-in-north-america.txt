We're a bit surprised we didn't get a liveblog-like stream of
emailed press releases from Tiger Telematics this morning
because today's their big day in North America. That's right, the
Gizmondo is officially on sale for $229 with
fourteen launch titles. They did roll deep by buying a full-page ad in USA Today with Verne Troyer (aka Mini Me)
shilling the Gizmondo, but we're not so sure a launch with some weak hype, obvious insecurity with their press
presence, abysmal sales abroad, and a third of a billion in
mounting debt is reason enough for Tiger's EU managing
director Carl Freer to be "extremely proud of what [they've] achieved."
