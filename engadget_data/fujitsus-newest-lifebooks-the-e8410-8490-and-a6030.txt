Looking to add to new options to the LifeBook lineup, the E8410/8490 should tout a 15.4-inch WUXGA or WSXGA display, Intel's 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo T7700 processor, and a WM3945ABG Mini-PCI WLAN module that completely shuns 802.11n. The LifeBook A6030 looks to posses the same CPU as its more expensive sibling, but chops the resolution on its 15.4-inch screen down to WXGA. Unfortunately, that's all the dirt that the existing documentation was able to spill on these up and coming lappies, but after this paperwork get ironed out, it shouldn't be too long before it happily joins the ever-growing Santa Rosa population here in America.[Via PCJoint]
