Well, it appears that at least Nokia is feeling our pain, because according to a recent GigaOM rumor, the company is readying a 3G variation of the N95 -- presumably with a US carrier in tow -- due out this September, which makes sense considering some of the company's recent shenanigans. If (and when) this happens, it should make the do-it-all phone, which boasts a 5 megapixel camera, built-in GPS, WiFi, and all sorts of multimedia functions, considerably more attractive to consumers in the States, even with its $749 price tag.
