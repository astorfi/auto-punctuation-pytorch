 While the future of LCD panels may be in LED's, Sony and Samsung think the existing CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp)
technology still has plenty of life in it. Samsung is showing off their
"color reviving" CCFL which uses a different fluorescent substance to
get LCD's much closer to 100% NTSC color range (92% as opposed to the
72% provided by earlier LCD's), without resorting to the more expensive
LED or OLED backlights. No word if this is the same Wide Color
Gamut-CCFL featured in Sony's soon to arrive Bravia line of LCD TV's,
however, although Sony is partnering with Samsung
on the LCD front. Either way, higher quality + lower costs
is always a good thing, and it is no surprise Samsung is also
announcing an increase in their shipment forecast of LCD's by 2 million panels.
