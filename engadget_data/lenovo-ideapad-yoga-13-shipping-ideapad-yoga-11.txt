 Lenovo is pulling back the curtain on several Windows 8 devices today, and among the bunch is a somewhat familiar face: the IdeaPad Yoga. We first got a look at the 13.3-inch device back at CES in January, where it stood out with a flip-and-fold design that lets it transform into a tablet from a notebook and vice versa. In addition to unveiling full spec and pricing information for the Yoga 13, Lenovo is announcing an 11-inch version.

 The IdeaPad Yoga 13 will go for $1,099 and up when it hits Best Buy and Lenovo's online store October 26th (Best Buy pre-orders will start Otober 12th.) The hybrid device will pack a Core i5 or Core i7 Ivy Bridge processor, up to 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of SSD storage. As we already knew from our preview earlier this year, the Yoga boasts a 1,600 x 900 IPS multi-touch display, and there's a 720p front-facing camera for video conferencing. At 0.67 inches thick and 3.4 pounds, this guy is a bit chunkier than some of the slimmest Ultrabooks, but it's certainly no hulk either. Connections include USB 2.0, USB 3.0, a media card reader and HDMI output. Lenovo rates the Yoga 13 for seven hours of battery life.



 Next up is the Yoga 13's little brother, the ARM-powered Yoga 11. This Windows RT hybrid weighs 2.8 pounds and measures 0.61 inches, and its 11.6-inch multi-touch panel boasts a more standard resolution of 1,366 x 768. Other specs include up to 2GB of RAM, up to 64GB of internal storage, a USB 2.0 port and a media card reader. The IdeaPad Yoga 11 will go on sale in December for $799 and up. Check out our hands-on photos of the just-announced 11-incher below.
