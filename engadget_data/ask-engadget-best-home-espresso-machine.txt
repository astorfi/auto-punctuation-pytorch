Ask Engadget took the week off last Thursday, but it's back, this time with a question from reader Phil H. who wants
to know:




I have a pretty boring job. I'm not complaining, but I've just been looking for a good espresso machine for home
 use to get me going in the AM. Semi-auto is fine, but full auto's probably a little much, and it needs to be
 something that  works well, won't require a lot of maintainence, and that the wife won't kick out of the kitchen
 because it's so ugly. I hear the Rancilio Silvia has the best bang/buck, but is there anything else out there worth
 the cash?



Yeah, we're getting a little drowsy over here too in the late afternoon sun—anyone care to shoot a suggestion on a
good shot of the good stuff?
