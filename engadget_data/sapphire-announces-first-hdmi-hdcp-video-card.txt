The new card, from Sapphire, is an RADEON X1600Prowith 128MB of GDDR3 memory, but we can't tell if it's the same as the pictured ATI HDMI card we saw leakedlast month. Either way, looks like it'll be out in April -- hopefully not too late for consumers to sort out this HDmess the industry has made for them.Update: Looks like that leaked picture was of a GeCube card, not of this new Sapphire card (now pictured).
