Twitter just acquired Lucky Sort, a Portland, Oregon-based startup that built TopicWatch, a visualization and navigation engine known for presenting large amounts of data in an easy-to-digest format. With more than 200 million users in more than 160 countries, Twitter certainly has more than enough data to warrant the acquisition, which means hashtag infographics like the one above could be available for Twitter users in the near future. Fans of Lucky Sort's TopicWatch product, on the other hand, will have to find some other venue for their data fix, for the service is set to shutter in the months ahead. Shocking, we know.
