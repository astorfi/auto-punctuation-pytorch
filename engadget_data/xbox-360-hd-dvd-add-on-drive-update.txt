       One aspect of all the next generation movie players is firmware updates and now it is the Xbox 360's HD DVD add-on drive's turn. This update brings a few enhancements such as downmizing TrueHD to DTS at 1.5Mbps and more settings to help you control your audio output settings via TOSLINK and for those elite owners; HDMI. Also like other next-gen players the updates promises to resolve compatibility problems with certain discs. While we look forward to enjoying these new features, we wouldn't be one bit surprised if Microsoft also figured out a way to secure that pesky AACS hardware key that has caused such a ruckus.
