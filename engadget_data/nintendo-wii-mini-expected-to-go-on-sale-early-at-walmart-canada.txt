 While we can't say that extra-dedicated gamers are tripping over themselves to buy the offline-only Wii Mini, we've got good news for those who weren't looking forward to waiting until December 7th to buy a second system for the kids or parties. Walmart Canada tells us Nintendo's $100 console is cleared to go on sale as of Friday, a week ahead of schedule; our local stores haven't yet received stock, but it's early enough that we're not raising alarm bells. We've asked Nintendo about other retailers and will let you know if additional retail chains get the green (or rather, black and red) light.
