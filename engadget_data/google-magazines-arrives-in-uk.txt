 If you're across the pond and have been warming up a spot on your Android tablet or smartphone for Google Play Magazines, there's good news -- it's now in the UK Play Store. You'll be able to buy new or back issues from over a hundred UK publications like Hello!, Glamour and Total Film, either individually or by subscription. Categories include cooking, travel, sports and photography, and you can also grab free 14 or 30 day trials to peruse as well. If that sounds like your cup of Earl Grey, hit the source to grab it.
