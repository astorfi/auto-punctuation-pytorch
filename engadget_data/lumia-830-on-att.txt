Right now, AT&T doesn't offer much diversity in Windows Phones. You're either choosing between the tiny and thrifty Lumia 635 or a decked-out behemoth like the Lumia 1520. Thankfully, the network has heard the calls for a mid-tier option -- it just announced that it's carrying the Lumia 830 sometime later this year. While you'll have to wait a while for launch details, it's reasonable to expect pricing that slots neatly between the 635 and 1520. No, it's not the straight-up 1020 sequel that many are clamoring for, but it's hard to disagree with a wider choice of Microsoft-powered devices in the US.
