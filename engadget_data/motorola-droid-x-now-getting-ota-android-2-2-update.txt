We've received dozens of tips already, from those who both checked manually and received notification in the status bar. In addition to a new Android, there's also improves visual voicemail with Bluetooth support, a refreshed mobile hotspot app, and a fix to prevent data connections from dropping as you move between WiFi and 3G coverage. Go on, check your phone now -- and don't forget to pick up the new Gmail when you're done updating.
