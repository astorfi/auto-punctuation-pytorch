We already more or less knew that Google wanted to get
deep into the WiFi game, now Om Malik is confirming that they've made a bid to blanket the city of San Francisco in
free 300Kbps WiFi. Doesn't mean that they'll actually be building out a network, since San Francisco still has to
accept their bid, but if they do win the contract Google says that they plan to offer wholesale access to other ISPs
(who would be able to offer faster speeds to their subscribers) and that they'll be testing some of those location
based services everyone expects them to roll out (like geotargeted advertising, we presume). And do we even need to
mention that citywide WiFi (potentially) means citywide WiFi phones?
