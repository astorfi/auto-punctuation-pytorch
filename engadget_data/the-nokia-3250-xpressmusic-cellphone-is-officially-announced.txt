  Look out Motorola,Nokia just dropped the deets on their new 3250 music phone wetold you about last week. Not only that, but they also unveiled an entire XpressMusic branding campaign (yawn) whichwill be slapped on all Nokia music devices featuring dedicated music key(s), music pause/resume on incoming calls,support for 3.5-mm headphone jacks, and extended battery life. So the series 60 platform 3250 gets all that plus up to1GB of memory expansion (via microSD slot), 10 hours of music play or 3 hours talktime, triband GSM/EDGE/900/1800/1900,Bluetooth, MP3, WMA,M4A and AAC music format support, an FM radio, and 2 megapixelcamera activated by a twist of the keypad. Oh, and they'll provide easy access to "over-the-air musicdownloads." Gee, wonder who might be providing thatservice? Like the N91, the 3250 will shipjust in time for Christmas in Q1 2006.
