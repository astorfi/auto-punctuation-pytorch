       In a perfect world, we'd be at the point now where we could stop writing about the iPhone and start playing with it, but in the meantime, we're getting to the point where no week is truly complete without a smattering of iPhone rumors du jour. Actually, the first tidbit is less of a rumor and more of a fact: Apple's been taking the liberty of trademarking the word "iPhone" in a variety of countries across the world as of late. While that really comes as no surprise to anyone -- after all, as AppleInsider points out, iphone.org has redirected to apple.com for years -- it'll be interesting to see if Apple actually sticks with the name, seeing how it's become a bit... shall we say, overheated across the 'nets and it seems like it might be to Apple's advantage to take everyone by surprise with a creative new marque (iChat? iCall, perhaps? We know we're going out on a limb here). Next up is the (more interesting) news that the boys and girls in Cupertino appear to be working on not one, but two iPhones: a slim, music-oriented handset, and a full fledged smartphone with integrated keyboard and WiFi, both of which we'll probably have to wait until January's MacWorld Conference to get confirmed. Did someone say, "spiritual Newton successor?"Read - AppleInsiderRead - Red Herring
