In May, Turtle Beach shouted from the hilltops that it snagged Microsoft's blessing to craft Xbox One headsets, and now it's ready to show off the actual hardware. Based on the outfit's Seven Series, the pair of XO Ear Force cans will be available at the console's launch and feature 3.5mm jacks, detachable boom mics and deliver surround sound through wired connections to controller adapters. At $149, the XO Seven boasts a "premium finish," on-ear cups with noise-isolating memory foam cushions, interchangeable speaker plates and a breakaway cable with an in-line mic for use with mobile devices. Liberating $99 from your wallet, however, will net you the more budget-friendly XO Four, which can also be used with devices outfitted with 3.5mm ports.


Bringing other platforms into the mix, Turtle Beach unveiled a trio of Call of Duty: Ghosts-branded headsets, but remained mum on pricing. The wireless Ear Force Phantom boasts dual-band WiFi, rechargeable batteries and compatibility with the Xbox 360, PS3 and mobile devices. The wired Spectre and Shadow are presumably less pricey, and play nice with PC and Mac as well. Sure, E3 may be a video game bonanza, but comic fans are getting some love with an Ear Force Seven headset embellished with Marvel branding, a red accent and swappable speaker covers with different characters.





Turtle Beach also unveiled the iSeries -- a trio of headsets tuned for Apple products -- but remained tight-lipped on price. The top-of-the-line i60 boasts dual-band WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, a microphone, rechargeable battery and surround sound. The i30 and i10 both feature stereo sound, Bluetooth 4.0, rechargeable batteries and a hidden microphone.
