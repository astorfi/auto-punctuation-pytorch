The shirt costs about $20 now, and the mod to take the electroluminescent WiFi signal detector panel, add the necessary power converter and mount it all to the back your car of seems easy enough if you're the type to tinker. Now -- who's going to do this, set up a MiFi, and start charging fellow commuters for access? Video after the break.
