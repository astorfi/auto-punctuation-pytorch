 Acer pushed the boundaries of price for major brand tablets with its $150 Iconia B1. It's not about to quit with just one model under its belt, however. The company's Greater China head, Linxian Lang, explained to China Times that there should also be 8- and 10-inch tablets on the way with "aggressive" prices. Acer isn't just adding more glass, either, as it's looking at quad-core MediaTek processors for a speed jump. There's no word on just when the larger budget slates might appear, although we wouldn't count on them coming to the US when the B1 has already been ruled out.
