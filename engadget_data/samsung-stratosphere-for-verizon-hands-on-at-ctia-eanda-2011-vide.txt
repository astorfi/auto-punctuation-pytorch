The newest addition to Verizon's LTE lineup is also by far the most unique of the bunch, simply due to its physical QWERTY slide-out keyboard. In fact, you're apt to find a hefty number of similarities between the Stratosphere and last year's Epic 4G, as both devices come with 4-inch Super AMOLED displays, 1GHz Hummingbird single-core CPUs and 5MP rear cameras, though the former brandishes a nicer 1.3MP front-facing cam and comes with Android 2.3.4 installed. Verizon's little beauty is priced smugly between the Pantech Breakout and LG Revolution at a cool $150 with a two-year commitment, and will be available on October 13th. Check out our full hands-on gallery and video below.
