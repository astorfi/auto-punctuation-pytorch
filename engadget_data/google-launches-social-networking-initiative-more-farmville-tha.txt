It looks like there is a social networking initiative in the works at Google, which will presumably start with social gaming (think Farmville) and move outward from there. According to the Wall Street Journal, the company's been in talks with game developers, including Playdom, EA's Playfish, and Zynga (which Google's recently invested in). While sure to incorporate Buzz (remember that?), one thing Google does not want to do is come across as just another Facebook, with Schmidt addressing the possibility thusly: "the world doesn't need a copy of the same thing." OK, then. How about Google Match? We already have an idea for your homepage design. One thing is certain, however: expect the service to be in beta until early 2037.
