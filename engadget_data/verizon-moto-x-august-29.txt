The Moto X: a phone that is truly greater than the sum of its parts (at least according to us). The missing ingredient so far? A release date. Well, according to the most recent leak, the day of days will be August 29th... at least for Verizon customers. A Best Buy inventory screen sent in to Android Central indicates that Motorola's customizable flagship will hit stock rooms on the 15th and officially go on sale the 29th. That's a slight change from last week, when a screenshot from the same big box retailer pegged the release date as August 23rd. That's a little over a week after the new slate of Droid devices land, giving them a slight head start on capturing the hearts and minds of moto fans. Of course, if you're really keen designing your own Moto X, you'll have to wait a bit longer. There's still no word on when Big Red's version will be available through Moto Maker.


Update: Seems like the Droid Ultra, Maxx and Mini may not be shipping until August 27th now. What's not clear just yet is if the change in shipping date is because of a delay or a sell out of initial inventory. We've reached out to Verizon for clarification.


Update 2: We heard back from a Verizon rep, who had this to say about the rumored delays: "The 20th is still happening, you'll still find the Ultra and Maxx in stores on that day. Those who pre-ordered prior the date changing, will have their device shipped by the original date. And, for customers pre-ordering now, the date on the website is when the phones will ship."
