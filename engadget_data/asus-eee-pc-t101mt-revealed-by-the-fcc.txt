While details on this particular model are pretty light, the FCC filing does confirm that it packs 802.11b/g/n WiFi, and the "MT" in the model name likely indicates that this one's a multitouch tablet -- the Eee PC T101 that we've seen previously was a 10-inch tablet with the usual unremarkable netbook specs, but an upgrade to Pine Trail seems a safe bet for this model.
