Now there's a new Apple gadget on the block that literally makes every other Apple device look dull. A company called Computer Choppers has put together a Gold-plated MacBook Pro, with an appropriately diamond studded Apple logo. Should go nicely with your gold plated ... HP ... LaserJet. Yeah. Get ready to sell your house.
