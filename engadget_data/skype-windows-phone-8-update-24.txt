 Avid Skype video users on Windows Phone 8, now is the time to get your hair did -- HD video is now possible employing "higher-end" WP8 devices, such as the Lumia 920, HTC 8X, and Samsung Ativ S. "Lower end handsets" will have to settle for VGA video, though Microsoft says call quality across the board was improved in update 2.4. All WP8 handsets will enjoy People Hub integration, meaning you can jump right into Skype calls from your contacts list, rather than having to independently open the app. And should a friend need to use your phone to Skype a buddy in Belgrade, account switching is now integrated into the main menu. The update is of course free, and available right now in the Windows Phone store. Head past the break for the full list of updates.
