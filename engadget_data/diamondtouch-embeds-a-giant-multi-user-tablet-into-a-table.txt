Okay honestly, we can't see a lot of corporate suits gathering around this DiamondTouch table to do some
collaborative doodling — but we totally want one for our living room. The MERL DiamondTouch is basically a ginormous
touchscreen, embedded in a table, that supports multiple simultaneous inputs, so different users can be manipulating
objects on the screen at the same time. This DiamondTouch is totally wasted on research and corporate meetings — all it
needs is some cup holders and we'd ditch our coffee table in a second.
