The rep says that the carrier's currently "performing the testing and preparations necessary to ensure that, when [they] turn this feature on, you will continue to have a world class experience," which would suggest that there might be some lingering network concerns. AT&T's in the midst of a backhaul upgrade as part of its HSPA+ based "4G" network, so it might merely be a matter of waiting for that to go through before flipping the switch.
