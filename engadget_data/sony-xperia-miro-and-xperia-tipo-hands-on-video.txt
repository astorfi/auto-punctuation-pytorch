The point of interest here is Ice Cream Sandwich, which arrives ready-to-go on both devices. The Xperia tipo will be arriving in Europe in its single SIM guise, with the dual-slot brother launching in Asia. It feels unerringly light in the hands at 3.5 ounces, while the 3.2-inch 480 x 320 TFT screen and 800MHz processor just about suffices for web browsing. There's a 3.2-megapixel camera on show on the back, with room for microSD storage expansion.

 The Xperia miro expands the touchscreen to 3.5 inches, and whacks the camera up to five megapixels, although you won't find the same Exmor R sensor that impressed on preceding devices. There's a nice curvature below the Android capacitive button row, although the backing is unfortunately plain on both color options we saw. In sort, both devices aren't going to wow you with their technical prowess -- although they might with their prices. The Xperia tipo is set to arrive in August priced below £100 (less than $155), while the slightly larger Xperia miro will arrive around a month later, priced around £150 ($232). Head on past the break for a video of both handsets in action.
