It's pumpkin spice latte season, and that can only mean one thing: fall TV premieres are right around the corner. Thankfully, Hulu (like several other providers, if you have cable or satellite just take a look at your video on-demand menu) is once again letting you get the jump on your water cooler gossip by offering an early look at a few new and returning shows from ABC, NBC and Fox in advance of their television air dates. So, if you've been suffering from severe withdrawal from The Mindy Project (now with 100% more James Franco) or been intrigued by the overripe nostalgia of The Goldbergs, you're in luck. Also available on Hulu right now are new episodes of Back in the Game, Trophy Wife, Ironside and Welcome to the Family. To get into the spirit of premiere season, follow the source link below.
