Sure enough, the outfit is working its magic once more and dishing out a few new colors (deep red, pink, gold and black) in the Type L line, while the Type C crew gets five new variations, too. Not enough for you? Fret not -- Sony's also updating the Type S family with a slew of design-oriented lids. Click on through for more pictorial delight.
