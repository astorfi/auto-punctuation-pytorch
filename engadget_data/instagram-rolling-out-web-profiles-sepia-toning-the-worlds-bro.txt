 Instagram is getting ready to open up its collection of filtered images to the web. The photosharing service announced via blog post that it's going to be rolling out web profiles over the next few days, bringing profile photos, bios and shared images to easily navigable URLs at instagram.com/[username]. If you have photos set to private, you'll still get a profile, but those images won't be shared with the web at large. The site also notes that web uploading isn't currently enabled, seeing as how it's always been focused on mobile devices. If you don't have a page yet, you should be good to go within the week. In the meantime, you can check out other profiles in Instagram at the source link below.
