Hoping you'd get to do some casual game building on the Xbox One? Microsoft Game Studios' newly revealed Project Spark may be for you. It'll allow users to craft their own digital spaces using Kinect Voice controls to add topographical features like mountains, plains and rivers, while fine tuning things with fingers through SmartGlass. Of course, the look of the world isn't all you can manipulate, as Project Spark also lets you create logic and rules for the objects and characters in your personal digital utopia. Oh, and if you aren't planning on grabbing a One right away, the game looks to be coming to PCs running Windows 8 as well.


Update: Check out two preview videos embedded after the break.
