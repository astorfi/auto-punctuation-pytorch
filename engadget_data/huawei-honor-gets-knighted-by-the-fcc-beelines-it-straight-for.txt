This new CDMA 800/1700(AWS)/1900 variant, making it through the Commission as the M886, indicates the Honor will be making a showing in the US on Cricket as the Huawei Glory. You can expect to see the Gingerbread-running device come with a 4-inch FWVGA (854 x 480) screen, a 1.4GHz single-core CPU, 512MB of RAM, a sizable 1,900mAh battery, an 8 megapixel rear camera and a 2 megapixel front-facing cam. If its expected November release remains true, this may easily be the best-selling device on the prepaid carrier for the holiday season. Check out more pics in the gallery below.
