Thankfully, that issue appears to be resolved in Windows Phone 8, as WP7App.de has dug deep into the emulator (video evidence after the break) and confirmed the feature exists, enabled by clicking the Start and Camera button at the same time. That should make our lives easier and, for most, let them share snaps of their phone of choice's tile setup and inevitable autocorrect mistakes.
