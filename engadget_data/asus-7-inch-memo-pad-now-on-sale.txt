 Cheap tablets are currently on the rise, but not just low-end hardware from manufacturers that you've probably never heard of -- true consumer electronics heavyweights are getting in on the action. Today, ASUS unleashed its $150 MeMo Pad to the frugal masses. This 7-inch slab packs a 1GHz single-core VIA WM8950 processor, 1GB of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, a 1-megapixel front-facing shooter and Android 4.1. While its specs aren't anything to sound-off about, this distant cousin to the highly acclaimed Nexus 7, might be worth considering if your budget happens to fall $50 shy of Google's entry-level slate.
