Naturally that kind of thinness is a little hard to capture in photographs -- it's kind of one of those things you have to see in person. But once you do check it out, you may just find its gorgeous, bright pseudo-HD, 1m:1 contrast ratio picture hypnotizes you from remembering its ridiculously high Â¥200,000 (about $1700 US) price and piddly 11-inch size. We want one on our desk, like, yesterday.
