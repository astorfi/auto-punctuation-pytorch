The Netgear Roku XD Media Player (model NTV250) appears to offer all the same features of its Roku XD cousin including built-in 802.11n WiFi; Netflix, Pandora, and Amazon Video on Demand streaming; and HDMI out for 1080p video. Even the $79.99 price is the same after some "instant savings" shenanigans. Now lets get this baby into Best Buy and Wal-mart for the kind of mass market exposure it deserves.
