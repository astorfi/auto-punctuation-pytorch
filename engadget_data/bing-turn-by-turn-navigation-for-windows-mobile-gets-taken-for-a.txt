It does according to the folks at PocketNow, who have put the app through its paces and kindly provided a quick demo video of it running on an HTC HD2. While there's nothing too shocking or surprising, it looks like the voice input works well, and the turn-by-turn directions seem to be at least up to par with your average navigation device -- it even has a few nice touches like being able to tap on the screen to repeat the instructions. Head on past the break to check it out the video and, if you're still unsure, you can always take the app for a spin yourself -- it is free, after all.
