 DirecTV already broke our hearts once this week, and it's doing its darnedest to shatter the blood pumper once more. The satcaster, while doing fairly well with all things considered, is still looking to reel in spending and watch profits carefully in 2009. Reportedly, the outfit has decided to freeze hiring and suspend any spending on all "but the most critical capital projects." Clearly, the ill-fated HDPC-20 tuner didn't fall into that "most critical" bucket. Moreover, it's looking to ramp up promotions and raise rates as it barrels into the new year, and even though folks are spending less overall, it still "remains bullish" about the year to come. Verizon, AT&T, et al. -- it's time to mobilize and capitalize.[Image courtesy of CipherLTD]
