When iOS 7 finally becomes official later this year, it'll be accompanied by a brand new iTunes, complete with a much anticipated streaming radio feature. iTunes Radio, the oft-rumored, and finally announced Pandora competitor will launch as part of an updated music management app and will have deep hooks in the major mobile OS revamp currently under way at Cupertino. If you're one of the many that maintain a developer account with Apple, you can download the beta at the source link. If, in your travels, you dig up any more dirt on the updated music app let us know in the comments.
