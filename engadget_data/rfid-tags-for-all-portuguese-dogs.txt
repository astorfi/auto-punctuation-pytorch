Digital Angel, under a grant from the Portuguese government is undertaking a plan to implant RFID tags in all of it's
dogs by 2007. The dogs will be tagged and entered into a national canine database. We're not quite sure how tagging a
dog will help to control rabies, unless it's used to punish the owner of the dog for letting it get rabies in the first
place. Why not just give all dogs rabies vaccinations while they're implanting the RFID tags if they really want to
control rabies? They also claim that the next generation of tags should be able to take the animal's temperature to aid
in determining if it's sick.
