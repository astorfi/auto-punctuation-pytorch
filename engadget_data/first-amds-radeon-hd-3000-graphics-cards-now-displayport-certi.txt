VESA just announced that AMD's ATI Radeon HD 3000 series (and the 780G integrated graphics chipset) are the first graphics cards in the Industry granted DisplayPort certification. About time since Dell's 30-inch 3008WFP monitor has been shipping since December. Way to go Paula AMD, way to go! [Via tgdaily]
