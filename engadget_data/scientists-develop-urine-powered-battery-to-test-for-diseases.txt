Those scientists are at it again â€” they've already done a number on
number two and now they're looking out for number one.
They've developed a paper-thin battery that's actually powered by urine. Intuitively, the battery is being used in test
kits for diseases such as diabetes, such that the urine that's being analyzed is able to provide the electricity needed
to power the kit. Bril! The battery is made from a layer of copper chloride-steeped paper sandwiched between layers of
magnesium and copper, and it's coming to a test kit near you.
