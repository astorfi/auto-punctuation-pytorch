According to a report on This Is My Next, a bevy of product logos from Sammy's Android trade show app were unearthed by a tipster searching for clues in the APK. Among the soon-to-be unveiled products are the new Galaxy Tab 7.7, Wave 3 and Galaxy Note. While we've haven't heard much about the Note, we aren't really surprised to see a 7.7-inch (we assume) iteration of the OEM's popular Honeycomb tablet and an update to its Bada OS-running Wave smartphone line. Not to worry folks, you won't have to live with the suspense for long -- we'll be reporting live from Berlin before you know it.
