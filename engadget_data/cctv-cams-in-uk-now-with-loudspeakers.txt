 American civil libertarians would do well to keep out of the UK. Now, on top of the more than 4 million video surveillance cameras blanketing The Kingdom, seven of the 158 CCTV cams in the Northern town of Middlesbrough have been fitted with loudspeakers. Do something "anti-social" and prepare for an earful of reprimand from the camera operators. As Jack Bonner, who manages the system, gloats: 'It is one hell of a deterrent. It's one thing to know that there are CCTV cameras about, but it's quite another when they loudly point out what you have just done wrong." As you might expect, yobs who cease their misanthropics will be acknowledged with a polite "thank you" from our well-mannered special friends. How sweet. And if they continue? Well, it's just a matter of time until the Ministry of Love's robots will be dispatched for collection.[Via Slashdot]
