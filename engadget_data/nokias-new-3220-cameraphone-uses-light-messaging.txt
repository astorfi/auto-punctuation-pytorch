Text messaging is so over. If you really want to communicate with your friends, you gotta use light messaging, like
with Nokia's new budget 3220 cameraphone, which uses "Xpress-On" grips that let you spell out messages in the air with
its LEDs by waving it back and forth in the air (trust us on this one, it works). The 3220 also uses tilt control for
playing some games (a feature sure to be hacked to do lots of other things), and should be out sometime this
summer.
