The Droid was large and in charge when it was announced, the Nexus One a little taller and a little speedier, and HTC's EVO gives the slab moniker new credence. Now there's talk that LG is getting in on the big and beautiful game, with an Android smartphone called the C710 Aloha. It's said to sport an 800 x 480 screen like the EVO and N1, but unlike those two will have a full QWERTY keyboard. It's also said to offer 802.11n WiFi along with GPRS, UMTS, HSDPA and HSUPA connectivity. Nothing is confirmed at this point, but a device called the C710 was given WiFi Alliance approval recently and, more convincing, a user agent profile file has been found, confirming the resolution and wireless capabilities. If true, the Aloha could provide to be a worthy alternative to the Droid for those who want a phone with a little more to love, and a keyboard to boot.
