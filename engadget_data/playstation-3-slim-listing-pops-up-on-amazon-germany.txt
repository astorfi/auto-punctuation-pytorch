Amazon's German site now has a listing for "PlayStation 3 Konsole slim" from Sony Computer Entertainment, and really, it doesn't take years of foreign language class to figure out that English translation. It's listed as "platform independent" (har) and has its own Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN), but on the flip side, we're lacking a picture, release date, or any other tangible details. Can't say we've got a feel for the site's track record on random listings, but after all the rumors and possible sightings as of late, it really makes ya wonder.  Update: In case you're wondering about that picture that now appears in the listing, it looks like a fan render that a customer has uploaded to Amazon.  [Thanks, Mitchell B]
