 
What, the D3100 and its fancy new autofocusing video mode not enough for ya? Ever since Nikon updated its entry level DSLR, rumors have been rife of a new teammate for it, namely a D7000, designed to replace the wildly popular D90 prosumer shooter. Today, those rumors get enriched with a supposedly legit image, showing a realignment of the buttons on the back, a bit more control with a dual jog dial on the left shoulder, and a new Live View-switching toggle as first seen on the D3100. Look for the D7000, along with a new Speedlight flash and a couple of juicy Nikkor prime lenses, to get officially announced early tomorrow morning. Or not, you never know with rumors.
