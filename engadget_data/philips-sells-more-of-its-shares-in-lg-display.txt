 LG.Display, n√©e LG.Philips, will soon have a little less Philips in it, after the Netherlands portion of the collaboration sells off about 23 million shares (valued at $1 billion). Why Philips is distancing itself (dropping from an original 44.6% share of the company to 19.9% before this sale) from what at least seemed to be a good LCD operation once upon a time -- especially when everyone else is looking for a teammate -- is less clear, but maybe it just wants to help Toshiba out with a few bills.
