That's right -- it looks like there is something, at least, to those recent rumors that the country was dissing Redmond and contemplating a national open source OS. There's a lot more to it that appears to be of little interest unless you're a member of the apparat, in which case you'll probably be reading this thing in the original in Russian soon enough. As for us, we're just curious to see how the new software will be used to bedevil dissident groups once Microsoft is out of the picture.
