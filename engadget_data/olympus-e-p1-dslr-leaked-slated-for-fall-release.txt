 Oh, how we adore leaked PowerPoint presentations. Fresh off of discovering that Timex is indeed releasing a Made for iPod watch, it looks like that Olympus E-1 successor will soon become a reality -- we're talking October / November soon. While the 27-page document detailing the E-P1 has since been removed at the request of Olympus, a good amount of details were extracted beforehand. Reportedly, the DSLR will feature a 10-megapixel sensor, dust reduction, splash-proof body, swiveling LCD, image sensor stabilization, eleven-point autofocus, and a weather-sealed extra battery compartment for good measure. So if you're as giddy as we are about finally getting a followup to the aging E-1, give the links below a bit of your time and start pinching those pennies.[Via CNET]
