 Retailers are on the front lines in the HD DVD vs. Blu-ray format war, and Netflix is seeing an even match between the two camps so far. According to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, the total number of HD media rentals there suggest this is more of a "skirmish" than a "war", with the customer demand for the formats amounting to about one percent of total rentals. We don't doubt that the total percentage of HD media is small, but we're a little skeptical about it being an even split between Blu-ray and HD DVD.
