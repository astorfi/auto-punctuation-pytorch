It seems like only yesterday when everyone was first scrambling to describe the text message manipulating bit of Android malware. We've come along way and seen plenty of malicious bits of software since August 2010. Remember the porn-bundled SMS.AndroidOS.FakePlayer.b trojan from October? Or how about the bible-packing Android.Smspacem? Relive all of the handset hijacking memories in the source link below.
      

 

Update: Yeah, we've disabled comments. This was certainly not intended as troll-bait (most of the Engadget staff owns and loves their Android phones) but obviously it was attracting them just the same. Sorry to ruin anybody's fun.
