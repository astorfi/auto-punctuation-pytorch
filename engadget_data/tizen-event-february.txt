Tizen is a relatively new operating system which will be featured on a wide range of devices, from smartphones and tablets to automotive computer systems, but it's been pretty quiet thus far, only getting into the hands of developers and just a couple of cameras available for general consumers. That's all about to change, as Tizen has sent us an invitation to check out the first set of devices running the OS on February 23rd in Barcelona for Mobile World Congress. It doesn't specifically mention that smartphones will be included in this lineup, but it's a pretty safe bet -- especially since the first handset with Tizen was supposed to be coming out at the end of 2013. As always, we'll be on the lookout for more details as they trickle in.
