Last we heard, though, the 360 Natal attachment wouldn't be ready to compete until next holiday season -- but would at least sell for an attractive "impulse buy" price point as low as $50. Now Microsoft's Neil Thompson (the same guy who told us Xbox2Go was a lie) is shattering your 2010 wish list already, denying last week's report and saying the company has "a lot of things" left to figure out before its release. Something tells us MS will handle this a little better than the Wireless N launch debacle.
