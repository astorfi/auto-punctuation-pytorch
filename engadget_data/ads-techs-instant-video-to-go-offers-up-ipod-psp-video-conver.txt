 Sure, there's a myriad of fairly technical methods to convert DVDs, media clips, and TiVo captures to files that play nice with your iPod, PSP, or other portable video player, but ADS Tech is hoping to give us all an easy way out of transcoding every file in our ever-growing media library. Touted as the "industry's first hardware-based H.264 conversion solution for PCs," the Instant Video To-Go comes in a handy USB stick format, and houses a "hardware accelerator" that enables consumers to convert videos for handheld playback "up to five times faster than real time." The device reportedly supports MP4, MP3, AVI, WMV, MOV, RM, JPG, TIFF, and MTP, and provides a "two step procedure" for getting your videos ready for your PMP. Moreover, it can supposedly squash 100 minutes of MPEG2 / VOB into a 320 x 240 H.264 file in "approximately 20 minutes," which ain't half bad if things really work as described. Nevertheless, ADS Tech's sure-to-be-popular device will set you back just $79.95, and should be available on the web right now.[Via CNET]
