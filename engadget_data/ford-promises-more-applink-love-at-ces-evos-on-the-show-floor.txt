We recently made a little stop by the company's Detroit R&D center where we were told not only to expect an announcement at the 2012 CES regarding a suite of new apps in AppLink, but to also get ready to see a hot concept car. Sadly, though, it's a car we've already seen: the cloud-connected Evos will be making its North American debut. But, maybe we'll get lucky and Ford will find room to unveil a second new car at the show. Its booth should certainly be large enough.
