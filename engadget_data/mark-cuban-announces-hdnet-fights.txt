 Mark Cuban is looking to take HDNet into the MMA fight game. Yesterday Cuban announced HDNet Fights, a company that will air its mixed martial arts fights under the namesake network. The first event is scheduled for October 13, and HDNet plans to broadcast fights every week. MMA is growing very rapidly in the United States, with the Ultimate Fighting Championship being the big dog. Cuban has at least three things going for him in this venture: deep pockets, a proven track record dealing with foreign athletic talent, and HD broadcast experience. When asked about what fighters might be coming to the new organization, including PRIDE heavyweight champ Fedor Emelianenko, Cuban said HDNet Fights is "talking to anyone and everyone."
