We'd like to preserve our fantasy that bikers are far too rough and tough to even own something as dainty as a PC,
but we're guessing there has got to be at least one super geeky member of the Hell's Angels who'd use the Road Tech
HA90, a chrome-plated, handlebar-mounted MP3 player from Harley-Davidson. It's got big buttons that you can press even
while wearing gloves and a large LCD display, but uses SD memory cards for storage (it comes with a 64MB one), so at
most you can fit a gig in there. But remember, it's illegal to ride your chopper and listen to music in some states,
don't get caught using it unless you're ready to take a chain to a cop's kneecap or something.
