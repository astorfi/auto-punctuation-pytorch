 Dan Rather Reports premieres tonight on HDNet, and the man himself appeared on The Colbert Report to talk about the show. Check out the clip on Colbert On Demand for information on how Colbert himself has switched entirely to HDTVs -- the old ones have been composted -- and asks Dan hard hitting questions like "Do we really want to see the world in crisp detail?". The show (Rather's not Colbert's) begins tonight at 8 p.m. EST, we'll see if high-def brings the commitment to accuracy, fairness and guts the lead reporter says it will.[Via digg]
