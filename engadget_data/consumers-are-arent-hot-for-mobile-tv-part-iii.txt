Unlike earlierstudies by InSightExpressand IDC, theSiemens poll of 5,300 folks from eight different countries (5,293 from Germany and one each from Brazil, Canada, China,Italy, Russia, South Korea, and the United States, we suspect) indicates that in addition to a high desire for emailon-the-go, 59% of people are "interested in" mobile TV. Also rather surprising (at least in light of thenon-manufacturer-sponsored studies) is the fact that 62% of survey respondents are itching to download tunes onto theircellphones. This surely isn't the last word on the matter, so stay tuned for the next twist and/or turn in thisstatistical soap opera, when we may present more numbers that will shock and amaze you.
