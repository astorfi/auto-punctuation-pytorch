Adobe announced today that, for a limited time, it will offer a $9.99 per month subscription package to Creative Cloud as a part of its Photography Program. Naturally, there are a few caveats involved: the offer is available only to existing Creative Suite customers who own Photoshop CS3 or above and sign-ups close on December 31, 2013. The low price tag won't get you the full Creative Cloud treatment; the Photography Program will grant you access to the diet version, which includes Photoshop CC, Lightroom 5, Behance ProSite access and 20GB of storage space. It's a smart move on Adobe's part, considering that the company has been fielding complaints from disgruntled customers over its subscription pricing model. You'll have to wait until September 17th for the offer to go live, but the good news is that the $9.99 monthly rate isn't an introductory price, therefore it won't increase so long as your account remains active.
