This here is a Verizon-branded Palm Treo 755p, marking one of the rare occasions when Sprint has beat its CDMA rival to the Palm punch by a wide margin. The biggest draw here over its predecessor might be the internal antenna, but hey, for a platform that can be described as "mature" at best (and "older than dirt" at worst), we'll take what we can get! From the looks of it, this thing's pretty much ready to roll; heck, if the original launch date rumors hold up, we may even see it before the month's out.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
