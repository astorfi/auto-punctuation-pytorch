It's a nonexclusive deal so if / when Netflix launches an offering across the pond it could potentially secure similar terms. Stateside, Netflix has access to some Disney content through its deal with ABC, and other movies by way of its deal with Starz. Another interesting element would be if Lovefilm owner Amazon worked out a deal for direct access to Disney flicks for its Prime Instant Video service over here, but for now we can only recommend our UK readers check out the press release after the break.
