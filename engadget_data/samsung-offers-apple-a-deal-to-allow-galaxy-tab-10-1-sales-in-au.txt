  Could Apple and Samsung's Australian patent battle be nearing an end? We're not sure yet, but things are looking slightly rosier, now that Sammy has approached its rival with a proposed compromise. As the Wall Street Journal reports, Samsung offered Apple a deal today that would allow its Galaxy Tab 10.1 to hit the Australian market as early as next week. Justice Annabelle Bennett pointed out that the agreement wouldn't allow Samsung to receive a final ruling on the dispute, but attorney David Catterns explained that it would at least allow the manufacturer to sell its slate ahead of this year's holiday shopping rush. Less clear, however, is what Apple would stand to gain from any compromise. The company's lawyer, Stephen Burley, acknowledged that "[Samsung's] inconvenience would be diminished and we would be comforted" by an agreement, though the details behind Samsung's offer remain unclear, and Burley declined to elaborate upon Apple's stance after today's hearing. As always, we'll keep you up to date with the latest.
