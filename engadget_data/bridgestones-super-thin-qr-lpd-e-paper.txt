Being billed as the world's thinnest sheet of electronic paper (for its size) (and sparsity of colors), the so-called Quick Response Liquid Powder Display (QR-LPD) performs all the same neat tricks as devices shown off by other companies, including the ability to maintain an image when bent or powered down. And because its from Bridgestone, there's a good chance that you'll soon be able to score a set of customizable tires to match your classy PimpStar rims.[Via Akihabara News]
