Well wouldn't you know it? Microsoft' peripheral
announcement earlier today also broke a bit of ground by them offering their new console's controller not only, you
know, for the console itself, but also in a version compatible for the PC. We're not sure if it's corner-cutting on
continuing to make new PC peripherals or if it's really because they want "a consistent gaming entertainment experience
across Microsoft's gaming platforms," but what we want to know is what's up with the $5 MSRP difference on the PC
version (slated for $50) from the $44.99 console version? They're both just going to be the
same freaking USB controller, aren't they? Well, aren't
they?
