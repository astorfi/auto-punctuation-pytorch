  Samsung has retaliated against Apple once again -- this time, in France, where the Korean manufacturer has filed a complaint alleging that Cupertino infringed upon a trio of its patents. Originally filed with a Paris district court in July and announced yesterday, the complaint claims that the UMTS technologies featured in the iPhone and 3G-enabled iPads violate three of Samsung's patents. Unlike a previous case in Germany, which recently resulted in a nationwide injunction against the Galaxy Tab 10.1, this filing "focuses on three technology patents, and not on the design of the tablets," as a Samsung spokesperson was quick to point out. Details on the patents in question remain blurry for the moment, but it'll probably be a while before the case progresses anyway, with the first hearing scheduled for December.
