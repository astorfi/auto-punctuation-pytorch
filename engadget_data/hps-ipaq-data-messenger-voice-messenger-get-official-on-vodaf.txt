The two WinMo 6.1-powered handsets will soon be loosed on Vodafone in Europe, and starting next month, prospective consumers can buy in for £399 ($677) / £333 ($565) off-contract; as for the subsidized rates, you'll have to hold your horses for those. If you're just interested in the hands-on video, however, you can mosey on beyond the break and mash play.
