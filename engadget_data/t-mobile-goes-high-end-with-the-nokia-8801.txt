The tri-band stainless steel 8801 sports both American GSM bands, EDGE data, an 800 x 600 camera, and 64MB of internal flash -- meager specs considering the asking price, but let's be honest, buying a phone at this price pointÂ has nothing to do with the spec sheet and everything to do with appearance. Well-heeled T-Mobile customers looking to take a chance with questionable scratch resistance can sign up now for a hair under $550.[Thanks, supes]
