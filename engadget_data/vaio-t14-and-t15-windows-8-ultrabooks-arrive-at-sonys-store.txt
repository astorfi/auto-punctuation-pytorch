 Sony flaunted its VAIO T series 14- and 15-inch Windows 8 touch-enabled Ultrabooks at CES 2013 last month, but we weren't able to do anything at the time but snap, film and fondle them a bit. Now those models have arrived on Sony's store for pre-order, giving us a complete picture of pricing, specs and availability. We knew about the 15.5-inch, 1920 x 1080 touchscreen for the T15, and now we also know it'll be available with 3rd generation Intel Core i3-3227U, i5-3337U and i7-3537U processors starting at $770, $950 and $1,150 respectively. You'll also get Intel HD 4000 graphics, HDMI out, USB 3.0 and a DVD burner, with 4GB of RAM and 500GB + 24GB hybrid hard drive (HHD) on the i3 model; 6GB of RAM and the same HHD on the i5 model; and 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and Blu-ray disk player on the top Core-i7 model for $1,400.

 The VAIO T series 14-inch models, meanwhile, will sport a 14-inch, 1366 x 768 touch display with 3rd gen Intel Core i5-3337U processors, 6GB of RAM, 500 GB + 24GB SSD HHDs, a DVD burner, Intel HD 4000 graphics, HDMI out and USB 3.0. That model will run $900, but of course you'll be able to customize it (or the T15) to your heart, and wallet's content. Meanwhile, Best Buy is also showing the VAIO T15 model with Core i5, 8GB of RAM and the 500GB + 24GB HHD for $930 or so. Sony's got most of them in stock, with custom models shipping by February 19th, well before its CES prognostication of "early Spring" -- so if you've been hoping to actually, you know, do something with those famous Windows 8 live tiles, hit the source.
