SureWest Communications in Northern California is rolling out IP HDTV functionality for their fiber-optic
subscribers. They claim that they'll be "the first broadband provider in the nation to deliver commercial HD
programming with the technology known as Internet Protocol," which is a rather silly statement, given
Verizon's current IP HD entry in the market, and
since Verizon does video on demandâ€”a reflection of the future of IPTV. SureWest claims to have the goods because they
can get more mainstream programming with their more traditional technology, but right now they're 5 channels short of
Verizon. No matter what, it's still hard to complain about 15 HD channels delivered nice and fresh via fiber-optic
pipes. They're starting trials Tuesday and hoping to go hog wild in November, offering this to their 80,000+
subscribers.
