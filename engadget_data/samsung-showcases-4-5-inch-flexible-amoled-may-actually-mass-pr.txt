 For all intents and purposes, every single flexible display we've seen over the past few years has eventually been filed in the "awesome things that'll never materialize" drawer. There are exceptions to that rule, mind you, but we've largely been frustrated by how often these things pop up at trade shows and then vanish forever. Samsung Mobile Display, however, is hoping to change that. According to reports stemming from FPD International 2010, this here 4.5-incher is dangerously close to production, and given the lustworthy 800 x 480 resolution, we couldn't be more excited about the possibilities. We're told that Samsung is eschewing the traditional glass substrate in favor of a newfangled plastic version, and evidently it's a heck of a lot easier to mass produce. After all, we're still waiting for this thing, guys.
