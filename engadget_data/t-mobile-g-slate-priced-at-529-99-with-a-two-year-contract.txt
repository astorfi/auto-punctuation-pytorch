The Honeycomb, Tegra 2-powered tablet will set you back $529.99 after a $100 mail-in-rebate and that's only if you agree to a two-year contract. Of course, this thing can record 3D video, connect to T-Mobile's "4G" HSPA+ network, and output 1080p video, but that still seems like quite a bit of money when you consider you're also locked into paying at least $20 in data every month. Ready to grace us with the WiFi version, LG? Hit the break for the short press statement.
