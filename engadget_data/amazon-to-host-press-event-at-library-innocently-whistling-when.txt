Maybe they just want to talk about how much they enjoy huge archives of original manuscripts and the smell of aged paper. Whatever the case may be, the last time we went to an Amazon event, they ended up launching the Kindle, so it's not crazy to speculate that we very well could see the introduction of a new iteration of the successful e-book. We've pinged the company for more solid word, but it's been radio silence thus far. Of course, we'll be there live covering any news as it breaks, so just plan on being here... or being square.
