  We found a veritable rainbow of PlayStation Vita prototypes hiding out in the rear of Sony's TGS setup, surrounded by accessories, mock retail packaging, and faux game cards.

Hit the gallery below for a multicolored peek, or just skip past the break for a view of Gravity Daze's mockup retail box.
