 
 TomTom has refreshed its Navigation App for iPhone and iPad with a new user interface, Foursquare integration and constantly updated maps. It'll also automatically check into your favorite hangouts to avoid forgetting to oust your frenemies at your local coffee house. The revised application will also help you avoid French speed traps that don't fall foul of new laws on traffic alerts, with the whole thing playing very nice with the recently announced car kit. The app retails for $50 (€70) in the App Store -- although we're not sure how popular it's going to be if those same features will be bundled in iOS 6.

   ~ Introducing new ways to find new places ~

  AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TomTom launches a new version (v1.11) of its Navigation app for iPhone and iPad. Customers with an older version of the app can download it for free. They'll then be able to navigate to addresses found on the internet, search with foursquare™*, and get the very latest TomTom maps.

   Drivers can now quickly and easily navigate to places they've found on websites and other apps by copying an address and pasting it into their TomTom Navigation app. There's no need to type as the app will automatically work out the destination and direct them straight there.

   While v1.10 integrated Facebook Places with the app, v1.11 adds foursquare. After linking foursquare to the TomTom app, users can search and navigate to their favourite foursquare places, checking in to collect points on arrival.

   "Drivers now have new ways to find places with their TomTom app," says Corinne Vigreux, Managing Director Consumer at TomTom. "This should be particularly helpful when people are off on holidays and day trips. They can find great places to visit and get there fast with foursquare or a quick copy-paste. And that leaves more time to relax and have fun."

   Beyond the new search facilities, v1.11 brings many more improvements to TomTom Navigation for iPhone. Customers will get the very latest TomTom maps, along with a new certified Danger Zones service that helps drivers deal with speed cameras in France while staying within new laws against camera alerts. Numerous changes have also been made to the user interface to make the app even more intuitive to use.

   Coinciding with the release of v1.11, TomTom has recently also launched a new Hands-Free Car Kit for iPhone. This car kit complements the app perfectly, with an in-built 2 watt speaker bringing high-quality audio to both navigational directions and hands-free calls. A new switch on the latest version of the app for iPhone means that drivers can quickly choose to stream their iPhone audio through to their car kit.
