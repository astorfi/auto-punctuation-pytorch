As if the HTC Mozart needed any further confirmation of its existence and imminent arrival to British shores, Orange's official web portal has decided to instruct us on how to replace the internal bits of this unannounced Windows Phone 7 handset. That's right, even though HTC and Microsoft are acting all cloak and dagger about it, the freaking phone's name and likeness are hanging out on Orange's official website. Have we said the word "official" enough times already? Skip past the break for a couple more image grabs which are sure to disappear just as soon as Orange finally figures out what day of the month this is.
