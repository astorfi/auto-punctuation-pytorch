   Motorola didn't provide a launch date for the Droid RAZR Maxx when it officially announced the consonant-heavy phone at CES earlier this week, but it's now filled in that little detail on its website. Assuming it's not a mistake of some sort, you can look for the latest addition to the RAZR family to be available on January 26th from both Verizon and Motorola itself. If you missed the announcement, the Maxx is mostly identical to the existing Droid RAZR, with the notable exception of a longer-lasting battery that promises 21 hours of use on a charge, and a total of 32GB of storage. It'll also set you back $100 more than the standard RAZR.
