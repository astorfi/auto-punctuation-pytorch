Canon decided to put us out of our misery early this morning by announcing theirEOS 20D successor, the EOS 30D which we firstsaw last month. The 30D shares the same 8.19 megapixel CMOS sensor as the 20D including other core components suchas the 9-point AF system, 5 fps max shoot rate, and 1/8000 top shutter speed. And yes, it remains compatible with 20Daccessories. Some notable enhancements include a new 2.5-inch 230K color LCD, Canon's more flexible Picture Style menu,an increased burst depth, and the welcome ability to change the ISO while looking through the viewfinder. Those of youlooking for more than a refined 20D will have to wait and see if we get the rumored 10 megapixel 35D announcementbefore the day is up. More pix after the break.[Thanks, Donian]
