 If you've been waiting(and waiting, and waiting) for Toshiba to roll out its SED TVs,we've got some good news and some bad news. The good news is, yes, they're coming. The bad: you guessed it. You have towait a bit longer. In fact, quite a bit longer. Toshiba now says that the first SED sets will hit the market in thefourth quarter of 2007, after mass production starts in July of next year. Given that when Toshiba first startedshowing SED prototypes in 2004, the company hinted that the first models could be available as early as 2005 (a date that waslater pushed back to early2006), we won't blame you if you just give up on waiting for this and buy a plasma or LCD already. But remember: onthis schedule, Toshiba's first SEDs will arrive just in time for you to catch the 2008 Beijing Olympics in glorious50-inch-plus HD (yes, that really is the spin Toshiba's putting on this).
