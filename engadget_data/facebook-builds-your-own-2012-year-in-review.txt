 We've already seen Google's search-based turn at nostalgia for 2012. Facebook doesn't want to be left out, but it's swinging the focus to a very different subject than the usual politicians and pop stars: ourselves. Now that the Timeline has had a year to weave into our collective consciousness, Facebook is using it to show all the personal highlights of the past 12 months that it deems worthy, such as job changes, new friends and the many photos that reached our news feeds. Not that Facebook isn't willing to look at the bigger picture. It notes that US trends were dominated by elections, The Hunger Games and -- surprise -- Facebook's new buddy, Instagram. There's even more trends to explore at a special 2012 section of Facebook Stories, so you'll have plenty of options if you're as interested in your own life events as reliving the Olympics.
