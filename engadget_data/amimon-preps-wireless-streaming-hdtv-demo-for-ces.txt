 Uncompressed
high definition video streaming wirelessly. Sounds like a pipe dream
right, especially when technologies for reliably streaming compressed
HD are still "on their way" like 802.11n, but AMIMON claims their WHDI
(Wireless High Definition Interface) technology can stream high
definition at the same quality as a wired DVI or HDMI port.As
near as we can tell from the press release, it seems this technology is
planned to allow you to transmit high definition video straight from
you STB/DVD player/game system or whatever to your TV/projector/monitor
wirelessly with no loss in quality at resolutions of 720p or 1080i and
latency of less than a millisecond.Sounds interesting, if they
can pull it off and at what price. They will be showing a live demo at
CES and plan to hit the market in late 2006, so look for further
updates..
