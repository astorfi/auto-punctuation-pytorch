 Wow, um, Bill, old buddy, old pal. We're sorry to skewer you on this one and all but seriously, what the hell were you thinking telling Newsweek that "Nowadays, security guys break the Mac every single day. Every single day, they come out with a total exploit, your machine can be taken over totally. I dare anybody to do that once a month on the Windows machine."? We understand the few questions preceding interviewer Steven Levy's query about Vista's security compared to OS X's may have gotten you a bit riled up, but let's be honest for a second. We follow this stuff fairly closely and we haven't seen or heard about any globe-trotting worms or prominent security threats to Apple's operating system in quite some time; one of the highest risk threats we've heard about in recent memory turned out to be a hoax (although, as many readers have pointed out, there's always the MOAB). We're glad Vista is enhancing Windows security (and usability), we really are, but we really think you and Jobs (and Hodgman) should go have a few drinks and just enjoy your filthy richness or something.Love, Engadget
