APCMag reviewed a leaked copy of the software, and found that it's pretty much your standard service pack fare: a bunch of bug fixes and noticeable performance tweaks. The only new feature is an option to create a recovery disk, along with a crapload of new install packages for Vista's components, with no readily apparent changes. So, what's Microsoft waiting for? Get it out the door already!
