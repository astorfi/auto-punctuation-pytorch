We don't expect to see engineering students in every college
emulating the pioneering work of MIT's students in developing an
LED dance floor that would make Travolta proud â€” well,
actually, we do. You guys may be nerds, but that doesn't mean you can't show the kewl kids a thing or two, right? So,
we're pleased to see that Washington University's engineering students have an LED dance floor team, and are gearing up
to unveil the results of their hard work at a school dance this Saturday. The WU floor matches MIT's specs, with 1,536
LEDs, capable of 4,096 colors. One nice touch is the ability to control the floor wirelessly, which tops the USB-based
controller used by MIT's team. Party on, dudes.
