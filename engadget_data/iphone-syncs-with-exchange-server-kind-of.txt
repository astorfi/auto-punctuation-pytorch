Synchronica, a UK-based company long in the market of getting devices to play nice with Microsoft's business end has devised a solution for the Apple wunder-phone. Using its Mobile Gateway 3.0 software, the phone is able to access email on corporate Exchange servers via Redmond's Outlook Web Access (or OWA), thus delivering emails direct to the iPhone's mail app. Of course, not everyone is going to have the OWA option, as its use is at a company's discretion -- so while this isn't the full-on, seamless integration many were after, it does look like a pretty promising middleware stop-gap until Apple improves its enterprise options.[Thanks, Alvin]
