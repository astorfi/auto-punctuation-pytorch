The Pentagon and Boeing have been working on an anti-missile airborne
laser that's finally achieved "first light" — which basically means it's been switched on for a split second. The
anti-missile laser is slated to eventually be mounted on 747s and is designed to shoot down missiles from hundreds of
miles away. The laser is formed using six identical, pickup-truck-sized, modules linked to fire as a single unit
(wait - isn't that the mega-laser that's mounted on the Death Star?), and the idea is that the system will allow jets
to disable chemical and nuclear missiles before they can arm their warheads, while providing peace of mind for
passenger and military jets.
