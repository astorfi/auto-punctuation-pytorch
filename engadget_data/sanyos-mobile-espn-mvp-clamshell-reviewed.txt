If you're a sports nut with a thick wallet, you can't go far wrong with Mobile ESPN as far as actual services, and therebranded Sanyo MM-9000 phone bringsplenty of power on its own. There's a QVGA screen, MP3 playback, and great reception according to PC Magazine. Theyalso found the service to be plenty extensive, with live scores, up to date news, and even the ability to manage yourfantasy sports teams. The downside is that all these good times don't come cheap, and they don't come in a smallpackage. The phone itself -- a hefty 4.6 ounce, 1-inch thick affair -- can run you upward of $300, and the $65 servicecost doesn't include roaming or quite enough text messages (100) to get through a news heavy sports month like March.At least there's unlimited data, now how about a few more phones?
