 
It’s time for the 2005 Engadget Awards, and we’re askingfor your nominations for the Robot of the Year. Nominating is easy. Just leave a comment as you normallywould with what you're nominating for this category (remember, comments must be validated!). You don’t have toinclude your reasons for nominating it or any of that stuff, just leaving the name is fine. Limit yournominations only to robots that were functional for the first time in 2005 (which means no concept robots, though wewill allow updated versions of previous robots, as well as prototypes). Also, products only need to benominated once to be in the running, so if you’re planning on suggesting something, please make a quick scan tosee if someone’s already beat you to it (i.e., please don't nominate anything more than once!).Thanks!
