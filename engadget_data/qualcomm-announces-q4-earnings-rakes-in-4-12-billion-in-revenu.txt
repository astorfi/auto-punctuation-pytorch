 

The Qualcomm juggernaut just keeps on rolling. As the company's financial year comes to a close it's celebrating yet another stellar quarter, reporting $4.12 billion in revenue -- up 39-percent from the same time last year and a dramatic 14-percent higher than its Q3 earnings. Of that incoming green, $1.06 was profit. For the year as a whole, Qualcomm saw profits rise 31-percent over 2010 to $4.26 billion while revenues were 36-percent higher than last year, reaching $14.96 billion. Qualcomm exceed expectations not only for earnings but also sales -- moving 127 million MSM chips in Q4, when analysts were estimating between 120 and 125 million units sold. You'll find some PR after the break but, for all the pretty financial charts you'll have to hit up the source.
