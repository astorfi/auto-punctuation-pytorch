"Thousand."
"I'm sorry?"
"Twenty-two thousand."
"Wow."
And so it was. Once again, the powers that be at Facebook have been forced to come forward and deny yet another rumor that a FB-branded handset was on the horizon, this time crushing hopes and dreams of an HTC device. Dan Rose, head of business development at the company, came forward with the following statement: "This is really just another example of a manufacturer who has taken our public APIs (application programming interfaces) and integrated them into their device in an interesting way. The rumours around there being something more to this HTC device are overblown." When asked whether or not the handset in question would be Facebook-branded, he followed with this: "No. There's no such thing as Harvard law. And there's no such thing as a Facebook phone."*
