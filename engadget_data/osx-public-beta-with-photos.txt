If you've been anxious to try Apple's Photos app and kick iPhoto to the curb, you now have a (relatively) easy way to do it. The Mac maker has just released the first public beta of OS X Yosemite 10.10.3, which includes the simpler, streamlined imaging tool as a matter of course. This test release is bound to be rough around the edges (don't trust it with your irreplaceable pictures, folks), but it's worth a go if you're willing to experiment and want to know what all the fuss is about.
