Thismonochrome e-ink touchscreen display will be going up against heavyweight Sony's similar Reader device, although the iLiad soundslike it should be able to hold its own, sporting a 400MHz XScale processor, 64MB RAM, 224MB user-accessible internalflash memory, WiFi, Ethernet, 3.5-millimeter audio jack, and slots for SD and CF cards as well as USB drives. iRexclaims over a week of three-hour-a-day reading sessions are possible between charges, and also promises to expand uponthe PDF, XHTML, TXT, and MP3 formats that will supported at launch. No word on pricing so far, but it will have to beequivalent to the $300to $400 Sony is expecting to charge for its model if the iLiad expects to remain competitive. [Warning: PDFlink].Update: Ouch! Reader Axel writes that he corresponded with iRex a few days ago, whoinformed him that the iLiad will cost a steep 650 euros, or more than twice the anticipated price of the Sony.
