Basically, this computer is equipped with the NEC HD DVD drive from Toshiba's HD A1 set-top player (top drive) and the Sony internal PC Blu-ray drive (next one down) that made all those waves a few weeks back. Payback is made possible from the Japanese release of WinDVD 8 Platinum and is feed through Sapphire's HDCP-certified graphics card. Apparently everything runs smooth as silk (so says the owner) on the AMD 64 3200 powering the whole system dispite the fact that Cyberlink claims dual-core processors are necessary for any high-def media playback. In fact he claims the Blu-ray playback is better then the Samsung BD-P1000 set-top player. But here it is, the first hybrid Blu-ray/HD DVD player. Now, can someone please put the drives in a HTPC box so the whole thing doesn't look so nerdy.[Thanks for the tip Tyler]
