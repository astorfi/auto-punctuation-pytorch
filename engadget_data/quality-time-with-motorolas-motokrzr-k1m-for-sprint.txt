Now, we knew that the CDMA variant of Motorola's MOTOKRAZR, the K1m, was coming to Verizon, and thinking that it'd live a long, healthy life there before ever gracing the hands of a Sprint customer would certainly be a reasonable knee-jerk reaction to have. Much to our delight, Phone Scoop's proven our worst fears unfounded by producing a great preview of a Sprint-branded K1m that looks to be just about ready for prime time. Apparently, this variant will get a very different operating system and UI than its GSM cousins, and even the differentiation from the Verizon version should be significant thanks to a good deal of software and UI customization commissioned specifically by Sprint. Phone Scoop came away impressed with what they saw, suggesting the carrier's got a winner on their hands for the holiday season; we'll reserve judgment on the Sprint-ified OS until we meet face to face, but thanks to EV-DO support, we know the K1m's already got the GSM boys and girls spanked in the data department.[Thanks, Sam]
