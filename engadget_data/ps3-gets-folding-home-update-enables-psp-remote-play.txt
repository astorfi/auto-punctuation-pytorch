This go 'round, users will notice a "totally revised rendering engine for the molecules and a more sophisticated display format," but beyond aesthetics, the newest version now supports PSP Remote Play. Yep, this means that you can "now access FAH remotely from your PSP." So go on, Team Engadget, fire up your PS3 client and get to work with a newly revamped flavor, cool?
