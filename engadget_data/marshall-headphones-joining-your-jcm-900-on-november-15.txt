 
Details are few and far betwixt right now, but a legendary name in guitar amplification is about to branch out in a big way. The cans you see above are slated to launch officially on November 15th, proudly boasting the Marshall label, a 1/4-inch input jack and soft, pillowy earcups. We get the impression that at least the initial run may be a limited time offer, so those interested in getting a head start can peek the source link for an early pre-order signup. Mum's the word on price, but given that you sunk well over a grand into the tubes behind you, there's little doubt that you'll be overlooking a modest premium.
