  When we first laid our hands on LG's Optimus 4X at Mobile World Congress, we were left with mixed impressions, which was due in part to its pre-release software. While the phone tore through web pages and pinch-to-zoom actions with 1080p video, it struggled to keep pace with LG's own custom UI -- an unfortunate echo of our experience with the Optimus 2X. Now, LG's latest superphone has been put through the rigors of a few popular benchmark tests, which confirm there's plenty of quad-core, Tegra 3 potential inside this beast. While the Optimus 4X HD was easily surpassed by the One X in Quadrant tests, it actually bested HTC's premiere handset in the similar AnTuTu benchmark. Keep in mind, these aren't final scores, as we'll perform our own tests with a retail unit, but if you'd like to see how everything unfolded, just hop the break.
