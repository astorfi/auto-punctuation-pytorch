Provo citizens who've been craving Google Fiber can finally sign up for service -- some of them, anyway. Google is now accepting early registrations from Veracity Networks' residential customers, whose internet access is already linked to the former iProvo network that Fiber will use. Qualifying locals who register by October 31st will get Google's internet and IPTV services before anyone else, with pricing unchanged from what Google offers in Kansas City. Be prepared to wait if you're not one of the fortunate few, though, as Google won't start general sign-ups until January.
