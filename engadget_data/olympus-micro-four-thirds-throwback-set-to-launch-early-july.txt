But Panny's not the only player here, there's Olympus, the other half of the Micro Four Thirds team remember? Not that you'd forget the camera above taking its visual cues from classic rangefinders while promising a DSLR-sized sensor and Four Thirds lens compatibility stuffed into such a gorgeous compact body. According to AVING, the summer launch has now been narrowed to "early July" with an official announcement coming on June 15th. Oh boy.
