That includes some additional confirmation of specs like a 4-inch qHD screen (of the PenTile variety, it seems), an 8 megapixel camera, HDMI out and a 1500 mAh battery, as well as what appear to be the first benchmarks of the phone and its dual-core OMAP 4430 processor, which is apparently slightly hampered by a mere 512MB of RAM. In other Droid 3 news, Droid Life notes that the device has turned up in Gameloft's compatibility listings for its Android games, and says that its hearing that Verizon is now targeting a July 7th launch. That's obviously still far from confirmed, but it seems safe to bet that a release can't be too much farther off now. Hit the source link below for xda.cn's complete preview.
