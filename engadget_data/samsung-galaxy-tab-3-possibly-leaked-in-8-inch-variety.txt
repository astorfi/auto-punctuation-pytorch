When Samsung revealed the third iteration of its Galaxy Tab line, it was met with a somewhat underwhelming reception. But the Korean firm's never held back on trying out different shapes and sizes. This makes this latest leak -- of a reported 8-inch Galaxy Tab 3 -- at least plausible, and definitely not surprising. The reported resolution of 1,280 x 800 and that of the 7-inch Tab 3 (1,024 x 600) certainly match the mystery profiles we saw earlier this year. Think it looks just like the Galaxy Note 8.0? You'd mostly be right, barring a few details like a thinner side bezel and the camera / speaker arrangement. SamMobile claims to have the full specification, which includes an all-around boost over the 7-inch version: a 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 16GB of on-board storage (expandable up to 64GB) plus 5- and 1.3-megapixel cameras, Bluetooth 4.0 and a 4,450mAh battery. WiFi and 3G versions are mentioned, too, so all your bases should be covered if you really don't want that S pen.
