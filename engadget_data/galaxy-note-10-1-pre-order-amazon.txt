The asking price is $549, and the retailer says it will be available "within 3 to 5 weeks." In line with earlier rumors, it looks like Samsung swapped the Note 10.1's original dual-core processor for a quad-core CPU, though as Unwired View points out, Amazon probably meant a Samsung Exynos processor rather than the Intel Xeon currently listed.

 Update: We've received word from Samsung that Amazon published the page in error, and has since taken it down. The Galaxy Note 10.1 is in fact not available for pre-order at this time.
