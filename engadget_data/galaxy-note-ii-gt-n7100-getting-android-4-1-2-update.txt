 Everyone loves a software update right? Even better when it's an official one. So, Galaxy Note II owners will be pleased as punch to know that Android 4.1.2 is now finding its way to the international variant (GT-N7100) of the handset. You might not think a 0.0.1 refresh will be all that snazzy, but word is that there's actually a reasonable amount of newness going on. This includes the elements we'd expect from 4.1.2, but also some Samsung-specific bits, such as the ability to disable Multi-View, new items in the notification toggles, a customizable notification panel, a new ink effect on the lock screen, and Swype-style typing (without even waiting for 4.2). It's possible you might not see the update right away, but might not hurt to have Kies on hand all the same.
