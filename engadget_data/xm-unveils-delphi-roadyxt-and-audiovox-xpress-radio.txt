Looks like XM dropped some new Holiday 2k5
offerings today (their press event was apparently named Christmas in
Augustâ€”good one, guys), including the new super tiny
Delphi
RoadyXT and its slightly fuglier cousin, the
Audiovox Xpress Radio. Both will be available in September for under a hundred bucks (read: $99.99), and will give you
all that digital radio goodness you like plus FM transmitter, but sans time-shifting.
