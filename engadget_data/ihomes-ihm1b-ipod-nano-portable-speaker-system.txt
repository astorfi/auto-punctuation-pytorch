If you haven't already picked up PodGear's PocketParty, and still need a portable speaker solution for times when tossing that boombox over your left shoulder isn't exact suitable, iHome's iMH1B has you covered. The portable speaker completely encloses your first-generation iPod nano, and adds a set of stereo speakers as well as a questionably elegant stand-up case to your DAP. Touting "SRS TruBass" technology, "easy access" to controls, and a water-resistant carry case, the only thing that's missing is support for Apple's latest selection of nanos. Nevertheless, the iHM1B is available now for $29.99.  [Via Crave]
