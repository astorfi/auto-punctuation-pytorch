We're going for speed. We're (not) all alone in a time of need. All '90s song references aside, today we're going to race through two hours of the latest entry in Microsoft's racing simulation, Forza Motorsport 6. What's that mean for you? Well, you'll be able to watch me careen around race tracks, cause massive amounts of vehicular carnage and generally turn my Drivatar into everyone's worst nightmare. If that sounds like your type of party, come back here at 6 pm ET / 3 pm PT to witness the glory (Tim's feeble racing skills) and the hilarity (Sean Buckley's amazement at said driving skills).



In the meantime, if you've already picked your copy of the game up, I've designed a few simple Engadget liveries and logos in the paintshop that you can download (or even an Audi Formula E car, a Tesla Model S and a bitchin' Ford Focus), and you can totally emblazon your ride with your favorite tech site's colors. Of course, you can always check out Playdate at Twitch.tv/joystiq or the Engadget Gaming homepage as well. Maybe -- just maybe -- Tim will talk about drinking antifreeze again.
