 We've been hearing rumors all morning that Microsoft would release Vista SP1 this week. Now, according to Reuters, Microsoft has just sent Vista SP1 to manufacturing. In the same presentation to investors, Steve Ballmer said that Microsoft has released Windows Server 2008 to manufacturing as well. However, the server software won't formally launch until February 27th. Now we're just waiting for the SP1 download link and/or Windows Update package. Twiddle, twiddle... ah hell, we'll just update you when we get it -- this could take a few days.Update: Hands off the F5 key kids, Microsoft says SP1 won't be available to customers until March, starting with Microsoft Volume Licensing customers. Server 2008 will be available for purchase on March 1st.
