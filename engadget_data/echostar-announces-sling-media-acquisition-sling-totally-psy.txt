More telling, perhaps, is the fact that EchoStar was an early investor in the people responsible for the Slingbox and SlingPlayer software. The acquisition, expected to be approved before the year is up, gives EchoStar access to more displays and more locations thanks to Sling's streaming solutions in and outside of the home. And Blake Krikorian, co-founder, chairman and boss of Sling Media, reaction to the prospects of the new union? "We are psyched to make this announcement" as it "paves the way for the development of a host of new innovative products and services for our subscribers, new digital media consumers and strategic partners." Yeah bro, totally... like the SlingCatcher, eh dude?
