The handset's only readily apparent feature is its reduced modem, and in every other way looks to match its 4G-enabled brother, with a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU, 12-megapixel camera and Gingerbread. Whilst its designed to consume the same AT&T friendly frequencies, this one's destined for a rest-of-the-world arrival to sate the lust of global Sony fans in countries where they do everything a little slower.
