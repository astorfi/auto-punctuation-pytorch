 
 HP, Sony and Toshiba have already outed their new offerings for the back-to-school season, and now Dell is stepping up to the plate with announcements of its own. First up is the XPS One 27 all-in-one. As the name would suggest, it has a 27-inch screen, and the resolution is an impressive 2560 x 1440 pixels. All configurations are going to ship with Ivy Bridge processors (Core i5 or i7) with up to 16GB of memory, and the standard 1TB 7,200RPM hard drive can be swapped out for a 2TB HDD or 32GB SSD. Meanwhile, Waves MaxxAudio 4, Infinity-branded speakers, a Blu-ray drive and optional 2GB NVIDIA GeForce GT640M GPU memory (upgradeable from integrated Intel graphics) up this machine's multimedia cred. An optional internal TV tuner will also be offered. Wrapping things up, there are four USB 3.0 sockets, two USB 2.0 ports with power charge, audio out, HDMI, VGA, mic and headphone jacks and an 8-in-1 memory card reader. The XPS One 27 starts at $1,399, and while it's available in Asia starting today, it's not expected to hit the US for a few weeks.
