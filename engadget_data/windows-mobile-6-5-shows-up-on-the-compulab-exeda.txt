The company says this is an alpha build of the OS, but it does look farther along than those leaked ROMs we've been seeing loaded on a few HTC devices, and we're intrigued by whispers that it takes full advantage of 6.5's inertial scrolling and other touch enhancements. All that running on a phone which can also boot Android, sports an Ethernet port, and has left- and right-click buttons? We'll take two. One more pic at the read link.[Via wmpoweruser]
