 Prepare yourself for yet another strangely-namedwireless carrier to join the ranks of Verizon, Cingular, and Amp'd when Sprint Nextel local phone service spin-offEmbarq becomes an MVNO later this year. Embarq, which will complete its separation from Sprint in the second quarter ofthe year, plans to offer dual-mode handsets that can seamlessly transfer between WiFi and cellular networks. Thecompany's plans, which will pit it against similar WAN/WLAN hopping services from T-Mobile and Lucent,Â  wereannounced by future CEO Dan Hesse at the TelecomNext conference in Las Vegas.[Via TechDirt]
