Apple's holding its hotly-anticipated iPhone 5 (and iPhone 4s?) launch event here this morning, and we're on-hand to bring you a bit of pre- and post-show banter. Join Tim Stevens, Darren Murph and a plethora of Sesame Street characters* as we break down what's likely to go down during today's "Let's Talk iPhone" event. And once we're ushered inside (you know, where live video streams aren't allowed), follow our liveblog right here. Check out the video after the break.

*Pending a response from Cookie Monster's publicist. 




Update: And we're done! Stay tuned for the liveblog and more throughout the day!
