We knew that Austria and Indonesia would get it by the end of October but didn't know when it was likely to land in the States, or how much it would cost when it got here. Fortunately, it has now been spotted at J&R.com, where you will be happy to know that the 16GB version will cost $400, while the 32GB costs a bit more at $500. Now they just need to tell us when the thing will actually arrive.
