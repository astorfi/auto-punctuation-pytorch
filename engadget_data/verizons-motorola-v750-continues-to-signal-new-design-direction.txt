After the so-called VU30 from Motorola got spied for Verizon's airwaves last month, phoneArena's back with another Moto-sourced device that's looking suspiciously similar. Reaction to the VU30 was mixed -- and when we say "mixed" we mean "generally poor" -- so we're expecting that this here V750 will garner similar sentiments from the public at large. There isn't any other info available about the phone at this point, but given the seemingly thin shell and fancy display, we're figuring that the midrange is the name of the game here.
