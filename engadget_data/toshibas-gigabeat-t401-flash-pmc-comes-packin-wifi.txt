A lingering death rattle from this once fertile lineage. The player sports a 2.4-inch, 320 x 240 pixel display; support for WMV video and MP3, WMA 9 Lossless, and DRM'd WMA audio; up to 4GB of flash; 802.11b/g WiFi (nice); Toshiba's latest H2C audio processing tech; and the ability to pump the audio for up to 16-hours or 5-hours of video if that's your thing. Looking pretty swank in that 9.9-mm thin packaging when it hits Japan on October 5th for ¥29,800 (about $258). Check out the WiFi-less 401S models (September 7th, ¥24,800, about $213, with three color options) after the break.
