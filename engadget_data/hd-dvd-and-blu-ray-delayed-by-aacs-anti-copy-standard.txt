 If you'd have asked us last week -- as the AACS licensing authority was supposedly going to finalize thecopy-protection standard -- whether we were all good to go with all the next-gen optical formats' peripheral standards,we'd have probably given you the nod. But, in fact, that's not the case; AACS (Advanced Access Content System), one of the many copyprotection standards being folded into high definition discs, is holding up both standards, and so long as they're bothcommitted to running with it, they're going to be delayed -- which would, in theory, take away Blu-ray's late-releasehandicap with HD DVD. Then again, maybe not; the AACS board is supposed to meet on the 23rd or 24th of this month, andapparently expects to have this all sorted out within as little as two to three weeks. Guess we'll have to wait and seeon this one.[Via Ars Technica]
