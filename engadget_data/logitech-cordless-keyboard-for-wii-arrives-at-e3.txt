The all-white keyboard doesn't quite have the flair of the diNovo Mini, but it does have full-size keys, and for $50 it isn't bad -- and it's officially licensed by Ninty, so there are dedicated zoom, quit, forward / back, and OK buttons. Sadly, however, it's not Bluetooth -- there's a proprietary 2.4GHz USB receiver -- but you can't win 'em all. Should be available in August.
