 QWERTY smartphone fans on GSM carriers, cautiously rejoice: our Italian is admittedly a little rusty, but Italy's Cellulare Magazine seems to be reporting some unconfirmed, wildly speculative deets regarding the forthcoming (?) GSM Q. Not only might it drop in time for Christmas (in Europe, anyway), but when it does, it might be bearing gifts of WiFi and HSDPA for its patient buyers -- up from the previously reported plain-vanilla UMTS -- while maintaining the same lovely form factor. They're also reporting the device will rock quad-band GSM, meaning anxious North Americans should have little trouble jumping the gun if it launches in Europe first. Of course, if the HSDPA support doesn't come in all the right bands, the US will get left out of the 3G fun and we might just end up with another E61 / E62 debacle, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
