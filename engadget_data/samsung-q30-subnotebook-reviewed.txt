TrustedReviews has checked out the Samsung Q30 subnotebook and deemed it one of the "few technology products that
I'd describe as being beautiful." With specs that include a weight of just 2.4 pounds, a 12.1-inch 1280x768 screen,
integrated WiFi, Ethernet, FireWire and memory-card reader, and even 512MB of RAM standard (take that, cheapskates who
make you shell out for anything above 256MB!), who are we to argue? The only thing that's not beautiful is the damage,
which is over $3K, but at that price it's competitive with its primary rivals, Sony's latest
ultra-slim Vaios.
