There's no indication when, or even if Paramount will use the technology on its titles and the press release from Macrovision focuses on its ability to protect video over Internet, cable and satellite. As it is, we're sure Slysoft appreciates all the effort, but it's the people who legally buy their movies that might need a firmware update just to play Transformers 2.[Via Video Business]
