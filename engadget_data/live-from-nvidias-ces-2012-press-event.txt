8:00PM And that's it folks. Music playing and people are getting up. Time to see if we can get our greasy mitts on those tablets while an orchestral rendition of Metalica blares.7:57PM As will a Ferrari. "From super phones to super cars." Catchy.7:56PM Tesla Model S will have two Tegras in it.7:56PM Audi and NVIDIA will have another announcement coming soon -- such teases.7:55PM Now an Audi A7 is up on screen -- it's time to talk NVIDIA Automotive.7:54PM "This is gonna be a fantastic tablet year."

Sure is filled with tiles, imagine that.7:50PM There's a Cut the Rope icon on that home screen. Win 8, the casual gaming platform of the future?7:48PM A Tegra 3 reference tablet is on stage. It's been hiding in plain site this whole time.7:47PM Aidan Marcuss, the Senior Director of Microsoft Windows is in the house to talk Win 8.7:47PM That last empty pillar on stage is about to get populated -- time to start talking Windows.7:46PM Bam!

They like to call it a "ninja core."7:43PM Now we're moving on to talking about Tegra 3 in more detail.7:41PM Hear that noise? That's the sound of minds being blown.7:41PM And it's only going to cost $249!7:40PM We've got a seven-inch ASUS tablet on stage, running ICS on a Tegra 3.7:39PM He knows the real problem, we've gotta make tablets cheaper.7:38PM We're talking the future of tablets now, in very generic terms.7:37PM Jerry Shen, CEO of ASUS, is up on stage.7:36PM Which we take to mean the Transformer Prime is getting ICS today.7:35PM Tegra 3 is getting Ice Cream Sandwich today.7:35PM Giving the ASUS guys a bit of an ego boost right now, saying it's his favorite tablet -- the Acer reps sitting next to us are grumbling a bit.7:34PM "thinnest tablet in the world, the lightest tablet in the world, and it's also full HD"7:34PM "That's not possible, that's not a video right?"

Bee Gees and Justin Timberlake are the stars.7:29PM "If it worked perfectly it wouldn't be a demo now would it." Well put sir.7:28PM Now he's having some mouse trouble. Anything that can go wrong... well, you know the rest.7:27PM This version delivers "full fidelity" when you remote into your PC, unlike past editions.7:26PM Now we're getting another demo -- SplashTop THD.

You know the thing that most of us in the room are here to hear about.7:05PM "sometimes mobile, sometimes computing, most of the time wonderful" -- that's a cute way to describe a tablet.7:04PM We're kind of amazed netbooks were still selling 100 million units five years in.7:03PM "Tablets are the fastest growing consumer device in history"7:02PM Lastly, cars -- "the new consumer electronics device"7:02PM First up tablets, then a surprise Tegra 3 feature.7:02PM Jen-Hsun Huang is on the stage, ready to talk to us about three things.7:01PM Ladies and gentlemen, please silence your cellphones. Seriously, the sooner you do that, the sooner they'll turn off Muse.6:58PM Two minute warning folks!6:55PM Stage is pretty bare. A couple of podiums, some comfy looking chairs and what appears to be a Transformer, presumably of the Prime variety.6:53PM We take that back, it just got offensive in here -- offensive to our sense of good taste. Paramore. Blech.6:50PM The party certainly isn't Rawkus though -- too much inoffensive indie rock for that.6:49PM Every minute or so NVIDIA cranks up the volume just a little bit, as if they're trying to slowly acclimate us to the raucous party that's about to get under way.6:43PM And we're in! And being treat to Cake's Sick of You, in case you were curious. 6:00PM We're just hanging out, waiting for the doors to open.
