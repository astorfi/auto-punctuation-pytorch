 Performance PC builder CompAmerica wasn'tabout to let Brits have all the SLI-enabled 19-inch laptop fun, sothey've announced their own gaming-oriented model that looks (and sounds) a lot like the Rock Xtreme XL andEvesham Quest A630 that we brought you last week. Like its two doppelgangers, the TigerShark TX-5900 (or 9500,according to disconcerting misprint at the top of CompAmerica's page) sports two NVIDIA GeForce Go 7800 GTX 256MB videocards, an AMD Turion processor, WiFi, Bluetooth, integrated 1.3 megapixel webcam, PCI-Express slot, 4-in-1 card reader,and the usual choice of of hard drive and RAM configurations. If you can't wait to get your hands on this $3,500gamer's delight, well you're out of luck, because CA warns of a 2 to 3 week period between order and delivery (althoughthey claim that delivery cycles will return to 2 to 3 days starting April 15th).
