 Intel's GeneralManager of their mobility group, Sean Maloney, has announced that the company is planning on shipping WiMax cardssometime during the second half of this year. WiMax, thelong-range wireless broadband technology, looked to be further away from deployment than Intel's announcement nowindicates, but Maloney says that "we are now at the point where there is a clear coalescing around the 2.3GHz to2.5GHz, 3.5 GHz, and 5GHz bands" which should cover most of the planet. During his keynote, Maloney also gave thefirst public demonstration of a chip that is both WiFi and WiMax-capable, designed to give consumers an option duringthe predicted-three-year transition period.
