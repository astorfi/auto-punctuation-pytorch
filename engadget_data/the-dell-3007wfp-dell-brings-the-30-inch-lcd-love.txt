There's no official announcement yet, but apparently Dell is going to roll out a massive 30-inch LCD monitor to
compete with Apple's lust-inducing 30-inch Cinema Display. The 3007WFP is said to have a a resolution of 2560 x 1600
(that's WQXGA, baby!), a 14ms response time, 400cd/m2 brightness, 700:1 contrast ratio, support for HDCP, and a
built-in 4-port USB hub and 9-in-1 multimedia card reader. No price, but it should hit North America on December 21st,
which means you'll have to choose between buying Christmas presents for your loved ones or buying yourself one sweet
LCD panel.
