The value of this 2.5- and 3.5-inch compatible dock is obvious if like us, you've got gigs of unused storage laying around after years of SATA disk updates. Just pop in that old disk for instant expansion without having to first wrap the drive in a clumsy enclosure. Available now for â‚¬33 / $47. If you still don't get it, check the video after the break... you too will believe.[Via Akihabara News]
