We know some of you were (less than) excited about that edition of the
HP R607 that Gwen Stefani "designed," but we just wanted
to shoot you a memo letting you know that the little bugger's finally available. And not a moment too soonâ€”we have a
strong feeling that a couple-hundie dollar gadget will help slow down that inevitable chart slide she's facing any, uh,
month now.
