The Real Slim Shady's back with another album, titled The Marshall Mathers LP2. And if you're a fan of Eminem and have iTunes Radio, then there's a way to listen to his latest work in full without going the, well, shady way. Starting today in the US, Eminem's MMLP2 (as it's known for short) can be streamed on the "First Play" station of Apple's newfangled music service, allowing users to tune in to the set of tracks ahead of next Tuesday's scheduled release. As 9to5Mac notes, this marks the first time that an entire album is being given early access to exclusively on iTunes Radio, and it could certainly pave the way for more artists to follow suit. Above all, it is another example of how the music industry is adjusting itself as new services become available -- even if it might not be too excited about it.
