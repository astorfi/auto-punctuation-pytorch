 
Well, we just got the first round of Nikon D3S previews this morning, but it looks like we now also have the first few sample videos shot with the camera -- possibly a bit ahead of Nikon's preferred schedule. While it's a bit hard to draw some firm conclusions due to their YouTube-ness (not even a "High Quality" version, unfortunately), the videos do go some way towards backing up claims that the camera truly delivers the goods when it comes to high ISO shooting -- something that's particularly evident in the stunning wildlife video shot by Vincent Munier (pictured above). Head on past the break to check it out for yourself, along with a second, also impressive short shot down under.[Via CrunchGear]
