In fact, the company's showing in the 2009 BUB Motorcycle Speed Trials at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah has proved all this and more, with the bike hitting single pass speeds as high as 161 MPH, and a two-pass average of 150.059 MPH, setting the Land Speed Record for Electric Motorcycles in the process. And this isn't a vehicle that taunts you, forever unavailable, like Evel Knievel's rocket-powered cycle. No, this is a production prototype featuring the same powertrain that customers can look forward to shelling out close to $70,000 for when it becomes available sometime next year. But don't take our word for it, peep the video for yourself after the break. [Via AutoBlog]
