Yes, the Vietnamese site that's been leaking delicious Apple prototypes -- not to mention the HP TouchPad's SIM slot -- found the 0.33-inch thin slate at an unnamed Samsung booth, powered it up, and proceeded to dive into the sticky-sweet mess of Android 3.0 and iPad 2 comparisons that such a discovery affords. You'll find all that and some Angry Birds in the video immediately above.
