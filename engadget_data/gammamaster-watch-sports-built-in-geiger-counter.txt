Unlike the
Active Reactor Radio Active wristwatch, which only
pretends to detect radiation levels, the GammaMaster from GammaWatch includes a fully-functioning Geiger counter to
keep you safe after the Commies drop The Big One. Predetermined, user-defined thresholds let the watch know how much
radiation you think you can handle before it's time to give a warning. For those who will be traversing in and out of a
hot zone, the watch measures both single-dose gamma ray levels as well as cumulative build-up. And to prove that their
product isn't bogus ala some gadgets you might find in the back of Popular Science magazine, GammaWatch thoughtfully
offers to sell you small doses of radioactive material to ensure the accuracy of your $500 investment.
