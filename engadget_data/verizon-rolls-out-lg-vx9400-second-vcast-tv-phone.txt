At least that's the impression we got when we had the opportunity to mess around with both side by side at CES in January, and starting today, Verizon customers can start buying and critiquing VX9400s of their very own (in VCAST TV markets, anyway). Your hard-earned $200 -- plus the standard issue two-year agreement, of course -- will net you the Chocolate-esqe handset with a swivel screen, 1.3 megapixel camera, stereo Bluetooth, microSD expansion, and naturally, EV-DO data. We wouldn't mind a few more teevee channels, but beggars can't be choosers when it comes to the mobile TV landscape here in the US -- and besides, it's a pretty nifty lookin' handset anyway, right?[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
