       O.K. we love high definition. Really, we do but how important is HD in games? Seriously, is high-def more important the content of the games. Some of the best games of all time relied on the story instead of graphics. Zelda, Mario, Civilization and the list goes on. Would a higher resolution improve the games...no; it would enhance the experience abet but would not add anything to the overall game. We are not questioning the fact that HD is great in games but would you trade a great overall gaming experience from the Nintendo Wii for a good game in high-def from the PS3? What if it cost more then twice as much?Just something to think about going into Nintendo's E3 press conference.
