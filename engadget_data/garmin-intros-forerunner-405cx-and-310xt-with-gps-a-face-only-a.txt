Also new is the Forerunner 405CX (after the break), an update to the company's popular (and rather less offensive looking) Forerunner 405, adding "increased accuracy" in calculation of calories burned and comfort improvements to boot. Both work with the company's ANT+ wireless monitors, but only the 310XT is waterproof (up to 50 meters), so you triathaloners know which bit of circuitry to covet in the coming months. No official price was announced for either, but we'd expect the 405XT to cost near the same as its predecessor, which launched at $299, and we're seeing the 310XT on some early retailers for $399.Update: lcbarron commented to let us know these are now up at the Garmin store. $369 for the 405XT, $349 for the 310XT.
