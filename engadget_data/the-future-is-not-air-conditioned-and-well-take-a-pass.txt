 
There were lines around the corner for this "house of the future" at CES, built by NextGenHome, and apparently stuffed with the latest marvels of modern technology from the likes of Microsoft, HP and Intel.But we saw all we needed to from the outside, without having to wait on line for an hour: window fans, as shown in thepicture above. We don't know about the rest of you, but we have absolutely no interest in being part of any future thatisn't air conditioned.
