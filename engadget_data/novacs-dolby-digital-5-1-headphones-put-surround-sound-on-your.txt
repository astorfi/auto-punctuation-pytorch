While Wave-on just unveiled its own rendition of surround sound 'phones, Novac's upping the ante quite literally by offering up two pairs of Dolby-loving units. The Champion (HP-850XB) model rocks the more common headphones-plus-decoder-box setup, as the standalone unit accepts 3.5-millimeter stereo and coaxial / optical digital inputs, and channels the tones through a G9 connector where it hits your head. The headphones themselves sport both cinema and game modes and weigh (an admittedly hefty) 17.6-ounces. The USB-powered counterpart, dubbed Tusnami (HP-850U), was designed for PC use, and uses the internal decoder to deliver that svelte 5.1 goodness. Additionally, it sports a handy microphone for use with VoIP, voice chat, and online karaoke applications. So if you're stuck in a studio apartment, but lust after the luscious surround sound experience, the HP-850XB should run you ¥24,800 ($214), while the USB-friendly HP-850U requires just ¥12,800 ($110).Read - Novac's HP-850XB headphonesRead - Novac's HP-850U headphones[Via Impress]
