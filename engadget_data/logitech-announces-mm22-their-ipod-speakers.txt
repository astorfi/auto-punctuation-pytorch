Logitech, the makers of fine peripherals for everything from gaming to productivity, have finally dipped into the
overcrowded iPod speaker
market with their mm22 (though to be honest, we thought they already had come out with iPod speakers).  Rather
than use the dock connector to grab sound, the mm22 uses the headphone out.  This means the mm22 is compatible
with virtually any iPod, even those pre-dock dinosaurs some of us still carry around like badges of honor (it comes
with several cradles to accomodate various sizes).  This also means it will work with any music player, Apple-made
or not.  The company swears by the speakers they chose: four neodymium microdrivers (probably the basis for the
"22" in the name) that they promise deliver rich, smooth sound with tremendous depth for their size.
