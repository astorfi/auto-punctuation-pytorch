The real win here is that since Tegra is already a power sipping affair -- a traditional tablet should get about 40 hours with regular use -- so with Pixel Qi's 10x power advantage over LCD, the device could get nearly 400 hours of battery in backlight-off mode. That sounds silly high (and most likely wrong), but even with 40+ hours of use as an e-reader it would be pretty great. The tablet device has a capacitive touchscreen, and like other slates we've seen recently, it's surprisingly heavy. There's apparently a newer mockup that should reflect more accurately the final form factor, so we'll try to track that down as well, but most excitingly the device will have a rear-facing touchpad for no-look control. No word on price or when this should hit the market, but last time we heard around $300 US and June. Check out a video after the break.
