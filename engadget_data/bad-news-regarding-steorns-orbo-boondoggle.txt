This morning, Steorn is carrying the following announcement on their home page:"We are experiencing some technical difficulties with the demo unit in London. Our initial assessment indicates that this is probably due to the intense heat from the camera lighting. We have commenced a technical assessment and will provide an update later today. As a consequence, Kinetica will not be open to the public today (5th July). We apologise for this delay and appreciate your patience." Yeah, whatever. Still, like a car crash we just can't turn away no matter how wrong we know it to be.Update: You can watch their shysters engineers on cam number 3. That's the device in the glass cube above! However, unlike camera 3, the Orbo prototype is not working. Thanks, Dan.Update 2: The other cameras now appear to be live (or looping anyway). That's a close up of the device which is still not moving. Hell, we're not even sure if it's the "free energy" powered device or just a stand-in. After all, it was supposed to be lifting a weight, remember?[Thanks, Daniel H.]
