Today at Apple's next-generation iPhone event, Tim Cook revealed on stage that the iWork suite of applications -- Keynote, Pages and Numbers -- will be available for free on all new iOS devices. That's not it, however, as the Apple CEO also announced that iPhoto and iMovie will follow suit and be up for grabs at no cost. Apple only mentioned that this will apply to "new" devices and the 5th-gen iPod touch -- we're looking into which other iPhone and iPad models can also take advantage of the company's now-free productivity apps, so stay tuned to this post as we'll be updating it as soon we find out.


Update: As some you, our dear readers, have pointed out, below is the official footnote displayed on Apple's website.



iPhoto, iMovie, Keynote, Pages, and Numbers are free on the App Store for qualifying iOS 7 compatible devices activated after September 1, 2013. See www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/for iOS 7 compatible devices. Downloading apps requires an Apple ID.
