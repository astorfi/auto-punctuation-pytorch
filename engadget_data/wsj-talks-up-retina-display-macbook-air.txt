Buried in a lot of stuff we may not believe about a 12.9-inch iPad, the Wall Street Journal believes that a new MacBook Air is on the way. According to the paper's gang of people familiar with the matter, the company's suppliers are working on a 12-inch Air with a "higher resolution display." The piece goes on to say that factories have been told to be ready to ship "large quantities in the second quarter." Now, it's hard to see Apple adding yet another laptop to its previously spartan product line, but if true, then maybe we now know that the "one more thing" at next week's event will be a Retina display MacBook Air.
