 Hot on the heels of the news that Intel's shutting down a big old manufacturing facility in the Philippines, we get a little unrelated ray of sunshine out of the company. We're hearing they'll apparently debut some new, 320GB solid states this fall, about doubling the capacity of its current models. None of this has been confirmed by Intel, of course, but the reports are that the company is telling PC manufacturers to expect them. That's all we've got on it for now but we'll let you know when something more concrete appears, okay?
