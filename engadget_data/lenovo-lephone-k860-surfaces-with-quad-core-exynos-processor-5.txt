Perhaps most notably, this one is said to pack a quad-core, 1.4GHz Exynos 4412 processor (the same found in some variants of the Galaxy S III), along with a 5-inch screen boasting a 1280 x 720 resolution. Otherwise, you'll apparently get a 2 megapixel camera up front and 8 megapixels 'round back, 1GB of RAM, and Android 4.0 for an OS (no mention of a 4.1 upgrade). No indication of a price, but it looks like it will be hitting China in August.  [Thanks, FT]
