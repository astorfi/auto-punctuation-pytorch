The company's consumer division chief, Richard Yu, has pushed back the phone's volume production from this month to August. Blame for the setback rests squarely on that custom-developed K3V2 processor -- there have been "technical problems" getting it ready, if we go by Huawei's less than precise explanation. The timing certainly isn't what we'd call ideal: now that the Galaxy S III and One X are both common features of the smartphone landscape, the Ascend D Quad's performance won't be turning nearly as many heads when it arrives. We'll have to make do with the solid Ascend P1 in the meantime.
