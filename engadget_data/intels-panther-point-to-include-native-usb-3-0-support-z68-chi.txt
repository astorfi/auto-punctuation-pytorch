According to the seemingly authentic slide above that we've just obtained, it looks like the company's forthcoming Panther Point chipset will indeed include native USB 3.0 as previously rumored, along with support for both Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge processors, and support for up to three displays. What's more, a separate rumor is now also pointing to Intel's high-end Z68 chipset being released on May 8th. It supports the latest Sandy Bridge processors, and will allow for performance to be boosted even further with things like overclocking and RST SSD caching.
