       Several Russian TV operators have recently released details on plans for HD in the country, where HDTV service just launched last year on satellite via NTV-Plus. First up is HD Media, which has announced plans for up to 15 HD channels to hit Moscow this year, available via cable, IPTV or OTA. One of those providers could be Comcor TV's Akado service, which plans to start trials of two sports HD channels and one film station later this year, followed by a rollout of new HD-compatible set-top boxes in 2009. We don't know what the Kremlin's been watching on its 71-inch gold-plated plasma, but there will definitely be more options available soon.
