After dropping iOS 5 beta 2 on us on June 24th, Apple has now unleashed beta 3, meaning those with sensitive taste buds (and developer accounts) can start sniffing and sussing out what's changed. Of note seem to be a bevy of toggles controlling location services in detail, while there's also a new switch for voice roaming in settings. From what we're seeing not a lot has changed visually anywhere outside of the gears icon, but don't let that stop you from grabbing this savory download.

Update: In case you were wondering, yes indeed this new beta can still be jailbroken.
