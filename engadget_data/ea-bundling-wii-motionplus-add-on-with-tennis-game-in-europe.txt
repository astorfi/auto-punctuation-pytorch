According to a listing on Amazon.de, the add-on will actually be available in a bundle with the game (in Europe, at least), which will set you back â‚¬53.99, or just over $70, when it launches on July 2nd. As Joystiq speculates, however, this move could also be just the excuse Nintendo has been looking for to delay its own Wii Sports Resort game, which itself was supposed to come bundled with MotionPlus add-on but has been largely missing in action since its debut at E3 last year.[Via Joystiq]
