 We know that many of you are waiting for HDMI 1.3 devices. That's cool 'cause some should be here soon. The standard was just approved and the maker of the HDMI 1.3 chips, Silicon Image, is sampling them right now. This means that there will be some CE devices sporting the upgraded port here before Christmas but not many. The Playstation 3 will be one of 'em but that is it as of now. Many manufacturers are waiting for CES '07 to announce their new products. Pioneer is stating that they will have A/V receivers and Blu-ray players out within the first quarter with the new standard.We really don't see many people that want the new standard actually waiting for it. By the time device X is on the market, chances are would have already caved and got something different. Right?[via HDBlog.net]
