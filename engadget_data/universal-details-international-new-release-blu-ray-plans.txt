A few titles to expect among the 40 due in the second half of this year that we didn't mention previously are the studio's big summer releases The Incredible Hulk, Hellboy II, Mamma Mia and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Home Entertainment division Craig Kornblau has moved on from his red past and appears set to embrace BD-Live, although there weren't any specific plans announced. Otherwise, The Hollywood Reporter says we can expect 29 international Blu-ray releases from Universal, led by the global debut of Heroes seasons one and two.
