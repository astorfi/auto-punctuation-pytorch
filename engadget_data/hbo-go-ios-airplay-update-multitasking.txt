 Now that you can finally watch HBO Go on your Apple TV via AirPlay, the premium cable network has decided to sweeten its iOS app with AirPlay multitasking in a 2.1 update. The new version of the app also offers enhancements to Game of Throne's interactive features and general performance improvements as well. We'd obviously prefer that the app offers a standalone option instead, but being able to catch up on episodes of GoT  on the HDTV while looking up how to say "winter is coming" in Dothraki is good too. (It's "Aheshke jada.")
