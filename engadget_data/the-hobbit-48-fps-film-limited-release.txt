Regardless, rumor now has it Warner Bros. is supposedly planning a "limited release" of the 48 fps version because, according to Variety, the studio "wants to protect the format" by choosing to go the select-viewing route -- that said, WB's allegedly hoping to "expand the HFR release for the second and third installments." Still, nothing's set in stone just yet, so we'd hold off on throwing any temper tantrums (or celebrating, depending on which side you're on) until we hear something official from Warner.
