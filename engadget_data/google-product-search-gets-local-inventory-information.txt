The biggest addition is local inventory information, which will let you check up on the price and stock status of a particular product at nearby stores -- or at least those that are taking part in the service (there's about 70 retailers to start). Along with it comes a few other features "borrowed" from brick and mortar stores, including "popular products" and "aisles" that promise to help you discover products you might not be specifically looking for, and Google's even thrown in an updated Google Shopper Android app for good measure. Look for all of the new features to be available by the end of the week -- in the US only, unfortunately.
