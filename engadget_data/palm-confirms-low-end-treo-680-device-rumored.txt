Palm, in a recent earnings call, confirmed that there will be more info "in the coming weeks" in regards to a new "price sensitive" Treo, due for 20 networks worldwide in a few months. Lucky for us, it looks to be that oft-rumored Lowrider phone -- at least according to the rumors currently being mongered -- with the same form-factor as the 750v, but a VGA camera and no 3G data. Happily, the unit should feature 64MB of RAM, and if it can manage to otherwise duplicate the 650's functionality -- minus the bugs -- Palm might have a nice little solution for those wannabe handheld users who don't need all the bleeding-edge features, and don't want that bleeding-edge price.
