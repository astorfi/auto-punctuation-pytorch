 
Go figure -- Sprint goes live with its XOHM WiMAX service, and all of a sudden, the long-awaited Nokia N810 WiMAX edition pops in stock. Crazy, we know. After seeing this puppy announced (and in the flesh) way back in April of this year, it's about time Nokia made it available to Americans with the cash to spare. As of right now, the 4.13-inch, QWERTY-packin' Internet Tablet can be ordered for $493, and unless Nokia's fibbing, it's in stock for shipment. Hello 4G, we're thrilled you're here.
