Variety has the details on an agreement for more then 350 screens in Europe, Asia and the Americas, which differs from its main competitor Real D by avoiding the need for a new screen, and opting to sell the system outright instead of collecting royalties from ticket sales. All the same, no matter where you are, expect the opportunity to check out Journey to the Center of the Earth while wearing silly-looking glasses later this summer.
