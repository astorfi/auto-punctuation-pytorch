How do we know that Philips will unveil a 65-inch 4K television at IFA on September 5th? Because that same, unannounced device has just won the European Ultra HD TV of 2013-14 award. The self-congratulatory press release mentions that the Ambilight XL-packing hardware will be offered at a "significantly lower" price point than current UHD sets, which generally retail for upwards of $7,000 for this sort of screen size. There's no word on how much cheaper this new unit will be, but we're hoping that Philips has updated its (slightly clunky) smart TV interface to complement the eye-watering resolution.

The EISA Jury appointed the Philips 65PFL9708 as EUROPEAN ULTRA HD TV 2013-2014. The 165cm (65'') Philips UHD TV that will become available at a significantly lower price point than seen before for Ultra HD TVs, continues the Philips 9000 series' track record having received an EISA award ten years in a row now.

The EISA Jury said: "With Ultra HD content the Philips 65PFL9708 offers astonishing depth and clarity and its upscaling talents improve the quality of Blu-ray, DVD and direct broadcast sources. Passive 3D images on this 65-inch TV also look razor-sharp thanks to the screen's greater resolution. Other picture quality highlights include a robust edge LED system and superb brightness, contrast and motion performance, while Ambilight XL illumination makes the whole experience more immersive. "

"We see an increasing demand from both retail and consumers for top UHD TVs displaying crisp and sharp images from any source at an affordable price point. Therefore we incorporated all of our skills in picture quality to make our Philips UHD TV a good choice for a broad audience," said Maarten de Vries, CEO TP Vision.
