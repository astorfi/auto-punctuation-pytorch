Tokyo may not be the first city to rollout WiMax coverage
(actually, for once, that title would appear to go to an
American cityâ€”go fig!), but equipment manufacturer
Airspan's going to be supplying Tokyo with the gear for launching a trial city-wide rollout in the 2nd quarter, and
expected blanket-coverage of Tokyo thereafter. Something worth noting however: as you may or may not remember,
WiMax isn't even done yet. And still, some might wonder
why they'd bother deploying WiMax to a place like Tokyo, where everyone has 100mbit fiber lines to the home, and
undoubtedly extensive WiFi coverage. So why? Well, because it's freaking Tokyo, that's why.
