It may not be marked on most calendars, but if you're a math nerd (or a nerd in general -- of which we count ourselves, obviously), you know what March 14th is. It's 3/14, otherwise known as the first three digits of Pi. That's since become a minor geek holiday of sorts, and has prompted some fairly unique celebrations over the years. One of the latest comes from musician Michael John Blake, who interpreted Pi to the first 31 decimal places as musical notes and turned it into a song -- played at 157 beats per minute, no less (or half of 314). As it turns out, however, Blake wasn't the first to come up with the idea -- composer Lars Erickson wrote his own "Pi Symphony" a few years back, and has now sparked a bit of a copyright spat on YouTube over who actually owns the rights to Pi in musical form. Head on past the break to check out both versions for yourself.
