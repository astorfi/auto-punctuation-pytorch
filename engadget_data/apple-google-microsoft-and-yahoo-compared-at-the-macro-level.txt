Nick Bilton of the New York Times has put together a segment-by-segment comparison between America's tech heavyweights, which does a fine job of pinpointing who competes with whom and where. We find the gaps in coverage more intriguing than the overlaps, though, with Microsoft's only unticked box -- mobile hardware -- raising habitual rumors of a Pink phone. Apple's absence from the provision of mapping services might also soon be at an end, given the company acquired map maker Placebase in July of last year (see Computerworld). Anyway, there should be plenty more for you to enjoy, so hit the source for the full chart and get analyzin'.
