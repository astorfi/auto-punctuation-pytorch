 Sure, wireless USB hubs for your mice, keyboards, printers, and other random peripherals are quite handy in removing that rat's nest of wires you're currently dealing with, but now it seems the "wire free PC" is within our grasp. DisplayLink's DL-120 and DL-160 ICs allow "monitor manufacturers, PC OEMs and PC accessory companies to develop products for multi-monitor computing including USB-connected monitors, video-enabled USB laptop docks, and a host of other goodies for the cordless monitor. These USB chips are the "world's first" to offer VGA over a USB 2.0 connection, and there's reportedly no loss in quality or lag incurred when watching films or performing other fast-moving tasks, but that's a claim we'd have to see to truly believe. The DL-120 supports resolutions up to 1,280 x 1,024, while the more robust DL-160 kicks it all the way up to 1,600 x 1,200. Notably, DisplayLink mentions that these chips could not only be used in LCD monitors, but in digiframes as well, potentially giving users the ability to beam new galleries over wireless USB. While both ICs are current "available in production," we've no idea how much the firm plans on charging folks to integrate the wireless goods into their monitors, but at least the countdown to a cable-less PC (and some real-world wireless USB applications) has begun -- now we're just waiting for a few hundred watts to be channeled sans cabling.[Via EverythingUSB]
