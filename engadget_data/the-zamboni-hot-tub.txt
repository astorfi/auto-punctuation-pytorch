The problem with being a do-it-yourselfer is that you're constantly under pressure to outdo your latest project. So
if you're a hot tub rental company who's already installed a jacuzzi in an old VW Beetle and another in a speedboat
(complete with beverage cooler), finding that next project to mod can be quite a daunting task. Fortunately for Brent
Noels, co-owner of Ontario-based London Hot Tub Rentals, he happened upon a 1971 Zamboni for sale and immediately
pictured 8 to 10 people relaxing in the engine compartment. After a year of retrofitting the icemobile, Noels began
renting out the Hot Tub Zamboni along with the rest of his collection, and apparently it has proven to be quite popular
in hockey-mad Canada. Noels tried renting his creation out across the border, but found little to no interest from
Americans, most of whom had no idea that hockey was still a professional sport.
