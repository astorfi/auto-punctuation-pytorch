The freshly-announced Moto Droid Pro's keyboard feels like it, to be sure, and after trying it out, we believed the Motorola rep who told us they tested comparable speeds of 37WPM in several focus groups. But that's definitely Android under the hood, paired with a nice, responsive capacitive touchscreen and a 1GHz processor that sped through the UI. Check it out in our gallery below while we go find out more!

Update: We just had a nice long chat with a Motorola representative, and found out what's under the Droid Pro's hood -- it's a 1GHz OMAP 3620, to be precise, with an MDM6600 chipset, 512MB of RAM, 2GB of onboard storage ROM and 8GB internal storage, plus 802.11n 2.4GHz WIFI, Bluetooth 2.1 and tri-band UMTS. There's a dual LED flash alongside that auto-focus camera, and a programmable key on the side that asks you what you want it to do the first time you press it. There's 3G mobile hotspot support for up to five devices, and an optional 1860mAh extended battery and case, plus a desktop charger dock like those for the Droid and Droid 2 but that holds the handset vertically. It also just so happens that the Droid Pro has the push functionality of Blur even though it isn't weighed down by the full Blur UI, and supports SD card remote wipes (and full device encryption in Q1 2011), has spellcheck integrated into the OS and a "multi-headed" VPN client. Had enough yet? We've got a series of screenshots below pulled directly from the device.

Update 2: Video of the Droid Pro and Motorola Citrus after the break! 

Update 3: According to Motorola's Developer page (at the link below) the Droid Pro's also got PowerVR SGX 530 graphics inside, just like the Droid 2, among other devices. Speaking of Droid 2, we've got some a couple comparison shots in the gallery below, as well as pics with and without that 1860mAh extended battery.
