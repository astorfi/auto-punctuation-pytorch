That there is hip-hop's Pharrell Williams, doing his best not to show any signs of discomfort while struggling to hold up his 18-karat gold BlackBerry 8700. We have to believe that thing weighs a proverbial ton if it's anything close to solid, and to pick a device as utilitarian as the friggin' BlackBerry 8700 to pimp out seems a bit off to us. At any rate, if RIM had anything to do with this monstrosity's manufacture, at least it probably put a decent dent into their legal bills.
