Two researchers from the Kyoto Institute of
Technology have created electronic goggles that help blind people cross streets safely.  The electronic eye
detects the location of a crosswalk using a digital camera and computer, then calculates the width of the crossing and
the color of assocaited traffic lights.  The system worked 194 out of 196 times in tests.  In those two
failures, the system mistakenly said there wasn't a crosswalk where there was one.  Better that than the other way
around, we suppose.
