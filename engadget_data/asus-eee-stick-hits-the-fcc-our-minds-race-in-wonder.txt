Today, said controller has just surfaced in the depths of the FCC, complete with internal / external photographs, a user's manual and a few reports certifying that no one grew a third leg during testing. Apparently the GMC-1 package will include a pair of joysticks (one with a D-pad, one with an analog stick), a USB dongle and the obligatory Quick Start guide and Support CD. Heck, these critters even come with bundled wrist straps, eliminating any lingering doubt that the inspiration for these didn't come from The Big N. Still, we can't help but be slightly excited about the possibilities here, but whether or not they actually prove useful remains to be seen.
