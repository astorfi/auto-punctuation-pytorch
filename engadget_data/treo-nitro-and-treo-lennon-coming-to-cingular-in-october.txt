Codenamed "Nitro" and "Lennon", both Treos appear to be the first significant evolution of the Treo formfactor since the Treo 600 debuted in 2003, and though it's hard to make out too many details, neither appears to have an external antenna.The Treo Lennon is listed as having UMTS and Class 10 EDGE, a 1.3 megapixel digital camera, WiFi (built-in, one can only hope), and sports Windows Mobile 5.0 with MSFP. Not quite as many details about the Treo Nitro, but it is listed as having a 1.3 megapixel digital camera and appears to be running the Palm OS.
