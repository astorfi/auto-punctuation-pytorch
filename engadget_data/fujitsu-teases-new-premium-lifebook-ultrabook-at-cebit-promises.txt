  We're here at the Fujitsu press conference at CeBIT, where the company just teased a yet-to-be-named premium Ultrabook. We don't have many details at this point, but we were able to confirm that it will include a 14-inch frameless display, a magnesium housing and a standard variety of connectivity options, including LTE, WLAN and Bluetooth. The notebook will weigh in at less than 1.5 kg and will measure 16mm thick. Fujitsu is marketing the Ultrabook as an enterprise device, with a full suit of security features, including a fingerprint scanner, TPM module, FDE and ATP. More details are promised for tomorrow, so you'll need to hang tight for a model number, pricing and a full spec rundown, though we're told to expect it to hit the market this summer.
