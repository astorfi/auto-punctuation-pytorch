Lenovo's current flagship phone, the Vibe Z (K910), opted for plastic instead of metal like its predecessor, so it's nice to see metal making a comeback on the next model, dubbed the Vibe Z2 Pro. This is according to several photos that have been making the rounds on Sina Weibo, and our sources have since confirmed that these were taken at an internal event, so someone's been a bit naughty. The specs are top notch: 6-inch quad HD display, 16-megapixel OIS camera (with dual LED flash), massive 4,000mAh battery and 2.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 chip. These are all wrapped inside a 7.7mm-thick metallic body that also supports NFC.



Like the Vivo Xplay 3S which packs the same display, the Vibe Z2 Pro appears to feature a very high screen-to-bezel ratio, which is always welcomed as long as the touchscreen's edges aren't too sensitive. You can also see that this is a dual-SIM device with LTE support, though the international variants may differ. Oddly enough, the usual "Lenovo" logo spot on the back has been taken up by "Vibe," thus suggesting that for some reason, the Chinese company is making a bigger push for its mobile sub-brand.

Given the fact that this was from an internal event, we should be hearing an official announcement very soon. With ex-Nokia vet Colin Giles recently quitting Huawei to run Lenovo's global mobile division, here's hoping he'll do something about that ugly UI before bringing it to our side of the world.
