This time the market is GPS and the players are US-based Garmin suing rival Dutch outfit TomTom. They've been slugging it out in Europe for years withTomTom going on the offensive recently in the US with a blitz of TeeVee ads. Garmin is calling for unspecifiedfinancial damages in their claim that TomTom is illegally using five US-patented Garmin technologies designed to"calculate which streets are important enough to a driverâ€™s route to be displayed." Analysts havechimed-in calling this potentially bad news for TomTom who would have to stop marketing their products in the US shouldthey lose the case not to mention the resources tied up in fighting this claim. Well, at least this time the company protecting its patents actually manufactures goods unlike someother high-profile cases we likes to follow.
