It's a handsome, svelte and undeniably powerful device, a set of qualities that is in full show during AndroidHD's 11-minute long video of a day spent in the company of a Tab 10.1. Now, this isn't a hands-on video so much as a commercial made by someone other than Samsung. You can tell Sammy didn't author it because nobody tries to fit this Galaxy Tab inside a pocket. Jump after the break for the ocular feast.
