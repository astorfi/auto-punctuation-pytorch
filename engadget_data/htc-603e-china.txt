 Another day, another new phone pops up in China's telecom equipment certification database. This time it's an HTC Android 4.1 phone dubbed the 603e, and judging by the specs, it seems to be a follow-up to the One SU with WCDMA radio in China: 4.3-inch 800 x 480 display, 1.15GHz dual-core processor, 1GB RAM, 5-megapixel main camera (capable of 720p video capture) and microSD expansion. On top of this near-identical set of features (but very different appearance), the 603e benefits from an additional 2-megapixel front-facing camera; and overall, this would conveniently place said phone somewhere in between the rumored M4 and G2. The body comes in at 9.8mm thick and 130g heavy, and it'll apparently be available in black, white, green and yellow. What we don't know is whether this modest-looking device will also have a second SIM card slot, but chances are we'll find out very soon.
