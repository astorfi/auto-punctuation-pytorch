 This one isn't quite as dodgy as they come, but the very notable limitations really keep this from being the whiz-bang hack that it appears to be on the surface. Hacker StreetskaterFU had no trouble getting confirmation from others that his method of running Blu-ray games from the PlayStation 3's hard drive was indeed legitimate, but it is only confirmed to work with select "older titles" including Warhawk, MotorStorm and Call of Duty 3. To make matters worse, instructions are sketchy at best, but at least there's a video of the process working after the break. Let us know how things go should you give this a whirl.
