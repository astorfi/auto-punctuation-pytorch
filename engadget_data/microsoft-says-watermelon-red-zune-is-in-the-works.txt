 When will the madness end? While Microsoft ponders the future of its Zune line (free Zunes? We vote yes!), the whole "what mysterious color might we release the Zune in next?" song and dance is keeping us occupied surprisingly well. Apparently the next flavor to hit the shelves, after that fashionista-fave pink version hits on May 1st, is "watermelon red." Don't worry about that artist's rendition to the top, we're sure Microsoft's actual version will look much more watermelon-ish, just worry about how silly you're going to feel a few months down the road when you pull out your brown Zune and try to rock a few of your "so totally 2006" indie rock faves.
