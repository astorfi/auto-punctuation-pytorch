 Acer looks ready to launch an entry-level tablet into the market judging by an FCC application that popped up today along with an earlier GLBenchmark leak. The test site's report shows a likely 7-inch or so tab with a 1,024 x 600 display, Android 4.1.2 Jellybean, 1.2GHz dual-core processor and PowerVR SGX 531 GPU along with distinctly non-barnburning test results. Those specs now look quite credible when combined with the new FCC document, which shows it sporting WiFi radios but no cellular wireless options. The company has been mum so far about when or where such a device would arrive and at what cost, but judging by the above, it's unlikely to break any banks. Check the source if parsing radio reports is your bag.

 Update: Russian forum member vladimirdowla spotted pics of the new tab, which you can peek below the break.
