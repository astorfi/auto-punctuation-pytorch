Last year, Microsoft said that the next-gen version of Kinect was coming to Windows, but has been relatively quiet since. That changes now, as Redmond has lifted the curtain on the new sensor and it looks... a lot like the Xbox One version. The unit is missing the Xbox logo power-indicator of its console-tethered counterpart, but as the Kinect for Windows Blog points out, that's about all that's different between the two. The software giant also says this reveal is a sign that we're getting "closer and closer" to launch, but didn't give any other release details. For the nitty gritty specs about power supplies and voltage ratings, check the source.
