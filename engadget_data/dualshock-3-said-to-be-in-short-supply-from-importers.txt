According to GamesIndustry.biz, Play Asia says that it's already filled all its pre-orders, and it's speculating that prices could "skyrocket" when the controller's released on November 11th. Some retailers are apparently even being advised by suppliers to only sell the controller with the purchase of a PS3 console, although it's not clear if anyone's actually going that far. National Console Support, however, says it expects prices to return to normal within two to three weeks of the Japanese launch, which would still give you plenty of time to taunt your friends with it before it's available 'round these parts.
