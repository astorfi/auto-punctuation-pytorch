The 3CCD camera will include a 4GB SDHC card, for 85 minutes of 6Mbps video, or 55 minutes with 9Mbps compression. Otherwise we're in the dark, and this picture we've got looks like a prototype or concept version of the cam at best. Still, we're guessing Panasonic can't be too far off from release, since Sony has been parading around their own AVCHD offerings for quite some time now.
