With manufacturers jumping out of the woodwork to trumpet their compliance with Energy Star 3.0, TWICE expects a slew of top-tier TV manufacturers to boast about low power consumption numbers, and considering that a bunch of 'em will be demonstrating LED or OLED-based sets, we aren't surprised to hear it. Potentially more interesting, however, is the notion that "a number of plasma makers are expected to get into the power-savings act with models that significantly reduce draw levels in big-screen displays, taking away another advantage often cited by LCD TV competitors." In related news, we're expecting a record number of internet-connected sets, as TV manufacturers look to steal away market share currently held by STB makers. Sure, we won't see any panel size records shattered, but we're already giddy at what Vegas will hold in just under a month.
