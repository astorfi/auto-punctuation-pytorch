Now, before you ask why the hell pixel density would be of concern for a cloud storage app, remember that SkyDrive also allows users to view photos and documents from within the application -- only now at a properly rendered 264ppi. In addition to the peeper-pleasing improvement, SkyDrive users will also find the ability to upload multiple photos and videos from their iPad to the cloud, new file-sharing options (either via email, or a link that you can copy and paste), along with the ability to open SkyDrive files from within other iOS apps. It's funny how something so out of place can be so right.
