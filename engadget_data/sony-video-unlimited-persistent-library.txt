Using Sony's Video Unlimited platform just got a little more appealing. Prior to Shacknews' discovery of a change in the store's terms of service, once you purchased a video it was only available on the PlayStation device it was downloaded to. Now, there's parity between its storefront and the likes of iTunes and Amazon Video that allow media access from a range of hardware tied to your account. Frankly, it's long overdue but not the first time the hardware giant's been slow to evolve. We've reached out to Sony to see if this applies to gadgets not carrying PlayStation branding and will update if we hear back. Till then, take a moment to appreciate a fuller, more apt definition of "unlimited."
