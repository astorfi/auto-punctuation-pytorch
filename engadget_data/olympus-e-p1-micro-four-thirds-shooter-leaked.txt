Turns out, the camera outfit decided the shelve that codename and settle on the E-3, but evidently it's time to bust said moniker back out. If the above image is to be believed, the new E-P1 is a Micro Four Thirds shooter, complete with a 17mm f/2.8 lens. Only time will tell if this thing's really on the way out, but considering just how infatuated Olympus seems to be with MFT, we wouldn't be shocked to see it get the official seal of authenticity here soon.Update: Seems Olympus is having some kind of Micro Four Thirds announcement on June 16th. Wonder what that could be for? Thanks, Howard!
