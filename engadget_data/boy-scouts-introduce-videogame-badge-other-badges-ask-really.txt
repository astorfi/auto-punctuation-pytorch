However, our initial excitement on this momentous day is drastically lessened after reading how one goes about earning them. Here are the belt loop's three requirements:

Explain why it is important to have a rating system for video games. Check your video games to be sure they are right for your age.
With an adult, create a schedule for you to do things that includes your chores, homework, and video gaming. Do your best to follow this schedule.
Learn to play a new video game that is approved by your parent, guardian, or teacher.

To go on and earn the pin, Scouts will need to teach adults how to play videogames, participate in a family gaming tournament, and learn how to comparison shop for prices. In other words, the Boy Scouts aren't interested in how many digits you have in your Gamerscore, don't care how stuffed your Trophy Room is, and shun your techniques for surviving the latest Trials HD expansion. We, however, are all ears.

Update: We're getting a number of e-mails upset that this post does not explicitly point out that these awards are for the Cub Scouts, not for the Boy Scouts. Mind you, the Cub Scouts are most definitely a part of the greater Boy Scouts of America organization, and anyone who knows anything about the BSA in the first place knows that pins and belt loops are exclusively for Cub Scouts. So, chill, yeah? Also, we're still waiting on that Trials HD advice -- we can't get 10 feet on those new Extreme levels without repeated faceplants.
