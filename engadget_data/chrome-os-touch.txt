When Google launched the Chromebook Pixel, we weren't really sure what to make of the premium device's touchscreen. Sure, finger-friendly displays were trendy, but Chrome OS just wasn't asking for the technologies: it didn't feature many touch apps, the laptop didn't launch with a gesture update and user's couldn't even pinch-zoom web pages. Now, that's changing -- to go along with more touch-enabled Chromebooks now on sale, the latest update to Chrome OS' stable channel adds a touch-enabled window manager and pinch/zoom webpage scaling.

The updated touch features have been around for a while, but Chrome OS users had to be on the "Canary" release channel to play around with the system's unfinished features until recently. Google's also been experimenting with a on-screen keyboard for some time. Put together, these features could make Chrome OS a viable options for tablets (and in the near future, convertibles like Lenovo's Yoga), though Google hasn't announced anything of that nature.
