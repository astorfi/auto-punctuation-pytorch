 We've seen plenty of space-aged (and cosmically-influenced) lighting systems in our day, but a newfangled German operation is melding high-class style, energy efficiency, and whole lot of pizazz into one nifty lighting structure. Neues Licht's UFO Chandelier rocks strands of fiber optics arranged above a floating ring, which give off a colored glow depending on whatever light source you attach to it. The designer, Simon Bruenner, describes his innovative chandelier as "simplicity from another planet," and describes that its origin of light can be from the sun or in a different room altogether. Furthermore, the fixture is reportedly waterproof, making it feasible for use in your new spa / pool room, and considering the potential energy savings from pumping in sunlight, you shouldn't have too much trouble convincing your SO that this thing's worthwhile. Simon's masterpiece was on display lighting things up at last week's Cologne Furniture Fair, and while there's no set date for mass production, we can't imagine Lowe's not jumping all over this one sometime soon.[Via Inhabitat]
