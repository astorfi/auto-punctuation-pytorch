 While quite a few reports seemed pretty confident that Sony was indeed looking to sell its PS3 chip production facilities to Toshiba, Sony has now hit back with denials. Reportedly, the firm stated that it was "looking at ways to improve its chip operations but had reached no decision on whether to sell it," and just in case you needed a bit of proof from the other side, a spokesman for Toshiba "also said that no deal had been decided." According to Sony spokesman Tomio Takizawa, "nothing concrete has been decided," so until we hear otherwise, we'll take his word for it.
