Enter Verizon's enV (aka VX9900) in a new color scheme that closely resembles a color normally reserved for Crayola's Crayons (think burnt sienna). With no "official" word on pricing or a release date from Verizon, we doubt this will stay under wraps for much longer. Stay tuned for more info![Thanks, Roc A Fella]
