 Providing emergency assistant kits for the geriatric set seems to be all the rage these days, and now NTT DoCoMo is jumping into the mix in a presumed attempt to look after the constantly aging Japanese population. The firm's latest FOMA device is designed for bedridden individuals who aren't exactly as dexterous as they were in the good ole days, as it provides a channel of video telephony to give faraway caregivers a look at just what the problem is. Sporting a white finish and a 7-inch WVGA touchscreen display, the machine boasts automatic dialing to a user-selected individual, different fonts in order to appeal to aging eyes, a 1.3-megapixel CMOS camera, automatic answering in video mode, and a wireless remote to trigger an emergency call if panic strikes. No word just yet on how much coinage this peace of mind will run you, but there's nothing like being on call 24/7 for the great-grandparents, eh?[Via AkihabaraNews]
