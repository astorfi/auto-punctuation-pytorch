This isn't the first "ultimate gaming keyboard" we've
seen, but Logitech's G15 still has some features that might appeal to both gamers and office nerds alike. For one
thing, it has a built-in LCD display that can show select information from compatible games, including score, strength
and ammo. The LCD can also display info from other programs, such as waiting email, and Logitech will provide an SDK to
let programmers add their own info to the display. There are also 18 programmable function keys, the obligatory blue
LED glow, and two USB ports. Oh, and when you enter gaming mode the Windows key is disabled, ensuring you won't
accidentally pop up the Start menu when you're in the middle of a frag-fest. Available in October at an MSRP of
$79.99.
