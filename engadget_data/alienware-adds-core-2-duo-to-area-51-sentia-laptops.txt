Of course, to score the 17-inch m5750 for it's base price of $1,399 you'll have to settle for the 1.66GHz T5500 Core 2 Duo, a 60GB HDD, 512MB of RAM and a CD-RW / DVD ROM combo drive, but the specs only go up from there, and all m5750 configurations include an ATI Radeon Mobility X1800 card with 256MB of memory. The other laptops feature similarly weak base configurations, but even better prices. The 15.4-inch Area-51 m5550 starts at $899, while the 14.1-inch Sentia m3450 hits $849. All three models have the full range of Core 2 Duo chips available to them, from the T5500 to the 2.33GHz T7600, other than the Sentia which omits the middling T5600. The laptops are due to ship in the first half of September.Read - Area-51 m5750Read - Area-51 m5550Read - Sentia m3450
