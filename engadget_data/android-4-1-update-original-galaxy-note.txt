 If fortune smiles upon original Galaxy Note owners, there's a good chance of finding an Android 4.1 update before year's end. Rather than just the usual suspects like Google Now, however, a recently leaked software build suggests that Samsung's original smartphone / tablet may receive some of the same features as the current Galaxy Note II. We've embedded a video after the break that reveals what could be in store, which includes the Nature UX, the ability to watch video previews with the S Pen (Air View) and the ability to view two apps at once (Multi-Window). Whether the features make it to the final build is anyone's guess, though we're certainly crossing our fingers. In the meantime, feel free to hop the break to see what's in store -- sorry that it's in French.
