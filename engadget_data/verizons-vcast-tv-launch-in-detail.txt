       As we rumble and stumble toward a sometime-in-Q1 release of Verizon's MediaFLO-based VCAST TV service, details are starting to filter in regarding the three most important questions: "what," "where," and "how much." First up, it looks like VCAST TV will be offered in three flavors: Limited for $13 monthly, Basic for $15, and Select at $25. Limited will include CBS Mobile, NBC Mobile, NBC News, and Fox Mobile, while Basic (anyone a little confused with the naming convention here?) adds Comedy Central, ESPN, MTV Mobile, and Nickelodeon. Select, meanwhile, is nothing more than a bundle of Basic plus traditional VCAST and mobile web for a princely $5 discount over the unbundled price. Launch cities should include Jacksonville, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Omaha, Wichita, Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Colorado springs, Denver, Dallas, Las Vegas, Portland, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Tucson, Atlanta, Richmond, New Orleans, New York, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Long Island, Philadelphia and St. Louis -- whew -- not bad, though we're kinda hoping more get added post haste. And while you're at it adding cities, beef up that channel lineup, will ya, Verizon?[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
