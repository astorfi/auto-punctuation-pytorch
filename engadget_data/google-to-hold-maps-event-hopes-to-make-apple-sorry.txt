The company will reportedly hold an event to give the press a "behind-the-scenes look at Google Maps and share our vision" on June 6th. According to the invitation, Google will demo new features that "will get people where they want to go -- both physically and virtually." That shindig will go down just five days before Apple's WWDC, where Cupertino will likely announce its own Google Maps replacement.
