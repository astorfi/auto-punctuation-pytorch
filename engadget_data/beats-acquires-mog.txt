Beats Electronics, the house that Dre built, is acquiring the MOG music streaming service, adding a little content to its brightly-colored can offerings. No word on cost, but MOG is said to have raised $33 million in funding to date, so that might give you a ballpark figure. It's also unclear how or whether Beats-investor HTC might be involved in this new relationship, but if recent happenings are any indication, don't go expecting too much on that front.
