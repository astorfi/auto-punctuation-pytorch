 So Alienware is busting out their new MJ-12 7500 desktops featuringIntel and AMD's finest dual core chips, along with NVIDIAQuadro FX graphics and a liquid cooling option. The systems start at $1500 and shoot up dramatically from there, withthe dual NVIDIA Quadro FX 4500 cards jacking the price up $3000 all by their lonesome. It wasn't much trouble for us tobreak the 10 grand barrier, but if you're sure you don't need four 24-inch LCDs and 3TB of RAID storage, we'resure you can find something a tad more in line with your budget.
