According to Marketing Magazine, Elop & Co. have already devoted some Â£80 million (about $127 million) to the six-month ad endeavor, which is expected to launch in October. Considering all the job cuts and downwardly revised corporate forecasts, an advertising refresh would seem like a logical way for Nokia to embark on a new era. But the company is remaining rather mum on the subject, saying, "We are excited about the Nokia with Windows phone, but it's not our policy to comment on specific campaigns for unannounced products." Awkwardly executed "leaks," on the other hand, are an entirely different matter.
