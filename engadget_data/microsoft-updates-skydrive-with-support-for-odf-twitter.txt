First, Google went and updated Chrome's Cloud Print with the convenience of FedEx and now Microsoft's taking a spin at the remote wheel, enhancing its SkyDrive service with support for ODF (Open Document Format) -- an XML-based file type for documents and spreadsheets -- and an increased browser upload cap of 300MB. Twitter also gets a nod or two in this feature refresh, as users entrenched in Redmond's ecosystem will have the ability to share to the social service, in addition to sending out shortened image links. We'd normally advise you to check out the release for more info, but the tech company's kept this missive short and sweet. See for yourself at the source below.
