ATIC (Advanced Technology Investment Company) is on board as well, and the newly-formed GLOBALFOUNDRIES has $6 billion in investments to start out with, along with 2,800 employees. GLOBALFOUNDRIES will be primarily be building chips for AMD, just like usual, but will also be open to other gigs as a 3rd party chip builder -- its main rival TSMC just scored a deal with Intel to produce Atom chips on the cheap, a first for Intel who usually keeps production and processes in-house. First up for the new company? Churning out a 32nm process. We like the sound of that.
