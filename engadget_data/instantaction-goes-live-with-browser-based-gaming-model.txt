If you've forgotten the dirty-dirty on this here company, be sure and give our prior hands-on a look; once you're up to speed, you may be interested in knowing that the company's first weekend in business (in the consumer's eye, anyway) is this one you're living in right now. The new "direct-to-consumer online video game distribution service" has gone live with LucasArts' The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition, enabling gamers to embed full titles into blogs, Facebook profiles and pretty much any other site that'll handle an HTML embed string. The magic involves a delicate mix of in-browser, thin-client, and progressive downloading technologies, and while this title may not float your boat, the concept could be gold for indie developers looking to reach directly to potential clients. Head on past the break for the full release, not to mention a play-by-play of how to try this thing out.

The service debuts with LucasArts' The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition, available now.Using a combination of in-browser, thin-client, and progressive downloading technologies, InstantAction makes embedding video games as easy as embedding a standard video or photo, and at equivalent speeds – in most cases, saving consumers hours of download time. As a result, game publishers can dramatically expand distribution by embedding games online, where gamers' recommendations and invitations are most effective."It was only a matter of time before the Internet disrupted the extremely limited distribution channels available to game creators, enabling direct-to-consumer access and more control over sales performance and profits," said Evan S. Wilson, senior research analyst of Pacific Crest Securities. "The InstantAction platform virtually obliterates the obstacles to game distribution by making it possible for anyone to embed any video game anywhere on the web, just like embedding a video. For game creators, this opens up distribution channels that haven't previously been an option – especially for console-quality games. For consumers, it creates endless possibilities for game discovery, risk-free trial, and faster downloads."The InstantAction platform allows players to play Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition via Facebook, most websites that allow users to embed objects via iframes; and popular blog sites such as personal domain pages on Wordpress.org, TypePad, Movable Type, Tumblr and Google's Blogger. The InstantAction embed code will also work on any webpage that lets you edit the HTML code."The InstantAction platform provides a brand new way to get games from their creators to customers, thus avoiding obstacles to publishing and discovering new games that are inherent in the traditional brick and mortar model," said Louis Castle, CEO of InstantAction."We give game creators a secure way to offer free trials, item purchases and pay-as-you play options, with a broad range of monetization formats and platform compatibility," continued Castle. "Gamers not only get the try-before-you buy and rent-to-own benefits; they can easily embed full games into their social networks, accessing their friends' lists and adding social features to games where they may not have existed. InstantAction not only changes how games are distributed and discovered, but how they are enjoyed."To play, purchase or embed The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition on Facebook:· Go to www.Facebook.com and sign into your Facebook account· Enter the following URL into your address bar: apps.facebook.com/monkey-island.
