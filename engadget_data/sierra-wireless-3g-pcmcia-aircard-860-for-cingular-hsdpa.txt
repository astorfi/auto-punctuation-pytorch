Sierra Wireless has just announced a partnership with Cingular that will result in the sale of their AirCard 860
Wireless 3G PCMCIA card, making this one of the first products to support Cingular's upgraded UMTS
HSDPA network. The 860 features both 850/1900 UMTS
and quad-band (850/900/1800/1900) GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, with claimed 3G speeds of 400 to 700 kbps with 1Mbps bursts.
Price is still unknown, but expect to see this new card for sale by the end of the year.
