Confusingly, they'll be called the Galaxy U and the Galaxy K -- apparently in tribute to their carriers' names -- but they'll both be a touch smaller than the original S, clocking in at 3.7 inches (see the U pictured next to an S above). Word on the street is that they'll both be hitting between August and September, so the wait's a mercifully short one. Ironically, it's the supply of Samsung's 3.7-inch AMOLED displays that forced HTC's hand on moving into SLCD -- so we guess this is where part of that supply's being diverted. Check another picture of the U after the break.
