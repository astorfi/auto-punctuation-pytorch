That's right, Panny took the drab yet so, so sexy CEATEC prototype and turned her out with some shiny new paint as the HDC-SD1. Fortunately, it's still packing that 12x optical zoom Leica DICOMAR lens in addition to a 3-inch LCD, 1.5-hour battery, and HDMI (1.2a) for output and control with Panasonic's VIERA Link universal remote. The camera utilizes those three 1/4-inch CCDs to record video to SD/SDHC cards for up to 90/60/40-minutes with 13/9/6-Mbps compression, respectively, when toting the bundled 4GB SDHC card. It'll even grab a 1.5 megapixel snap while simultaneously recording if you have the urge. On sale in Japan for ¥180,000 or about $1,531 starting December 1st. Oh, and Panny also announced their HDC-DX1 model which shares the same specs but records to 8-cm DVDs instead for ¥160,000 (about $1,361) starting December 15th.
