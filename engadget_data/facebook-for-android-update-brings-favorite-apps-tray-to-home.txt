Now that Facebook Home is a practical reality, Facebook has to support both a full launcher and its traditional app at the same time -- and an update to Facebook for Android reflects that newly expanded focus. The big addition comes to Home, which gets its promised (and frankly needed) favorites tray for heavily used apps. Those relying on the traditional Android experience will mostly notice improved sharing: they can send multiple photos in one message, and it's easier for them to filter the visibility of shared content. No matter how committed you are to Facebook's vision of our mobile future, there's just one upgrade to grab at the source link.
