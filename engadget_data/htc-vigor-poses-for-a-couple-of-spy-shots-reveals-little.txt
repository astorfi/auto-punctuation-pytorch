Gracing its derriere is a texturized backplate, which sports the usual self-explanatory "WITH HTC SENSE" label along with a large lens plus dual LED flash; whereas on the other side we see a front-facing camera along with four capacitive buttons. Whether or not it'll arrive with the also rumored 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage remains to be seen, but you'll know more when we do.
