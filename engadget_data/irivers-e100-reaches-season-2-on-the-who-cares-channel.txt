If so, you're in luck, the E100 just reached "Season 2" which includes a re-run of all the same specs (up to 8GB storage, 2.4-inch display, audio/video playback) dipped in a few new color combinations. Better, yes, but it's still just the E100. We'll wait and see if they blow-out CES again like they did in January 2008 -- that's something worth caring about.[Via Akihabara News]
