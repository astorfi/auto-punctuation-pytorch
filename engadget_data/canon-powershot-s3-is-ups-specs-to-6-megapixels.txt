The company is also rolling out a stack of consumer digicams, topped off by the S3 IS, an upgrade tothe popular S2 IS, Canon'slong-zoom, image stabilized compact EVF. The S3 keeps the earlier model's 12x optical zoom, ups the megapixel countfrom 5 to 6, pushes the maximum ISO to 800, bumps the flip-out LCD to 2 inches and adds a 60fps QVGA movie mode.Pricing has yet to be announced, but it should be in line with the S2, which currently sells for about $400.
