 
The day has finally come and only a week later than we originally thought. If your setup is up to it, you can now enjoy the 21 new HD channels -- four are new to just about everyone. The good news is that the HD channels are the same channel numbers as the SD equivalent, the bad news is that if you direct dial them you still have to hit the channel up button once to get the HD version, which means that most people won't ever see them. Yes, we've personally witnessed people watch an SD channel when the HD was available, just because they were on the wrong channel. If the SD channel is included in your service plan then you'll get the HD one too. Here is the list of channels that are live now, we expect more to launch as we get closer to the end of the year.
