Demonstrated in the above video, developer Trevor Eckheart found that a recent HTC update packed in a suite of logging tools that collects data on user accounts (including email addresses), recent GPS locations, SMS data and encoded text, phone numbers, system logs, running processes and more -- all of which can be accessed by common apps requesting access to android.permission.INTERNET.

HTC is already looking into the issue, stating, "HTC takes our customers' security very seriously, and we are working to investigate this claim as quickly as possible. We will provide an update as soon as we're able to determine the accuracy of the claim and what steps, if any, need to be taken." If you're too antsy to wait for HTC's update, head on over to the source link below -- Eckheart says the issue can be resolved by removing HTCloggers from a rooted device.
