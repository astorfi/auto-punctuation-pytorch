We've done a fair amount of embroidery in our day, and we have to say, seeing this machine in action is pretty impressive. Disappointing Disney branding aside (yup, that's Mickey Mouse beneath the giant 4.5 x 7-inch Sharp HD LCD), the Quattro boasts a 50 square inch workspace that is probably any quilter's dream, and it's also got 3 USB ports. Sadly, the purchase price ("about $9,000") is probably prohibitive for most of us casual stitchers. No word yet on availability, but check the gallery and video after the break.
