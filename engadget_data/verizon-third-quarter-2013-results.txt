Verizon's third quarter results are out, and it's not suffering any malaise after its break-up with Vodafone. In fact, it landed 1.1 million new mobile customers and over 300,000 new subscribers to its FiOS internet and video services during the three-month period. More than 67% of people on the carrier's books are now rocking smartphones, some of which will be handsets that joined the LTE line-up this quarter, including the HTC One, Motorola's new Droids, the iPhone 5s and 5c, and most recently, the Galaxy Note 3. In its wired business, the number of FiOS video customers grew to 5.2 million, up 12.6 percent from last year as the company also promised more live channels on the way for its mobile app. In total, Verizon took $5.6 billion in profit (a whopping 30 percent more than in Q3 2012) from $30.3 billion in revenue. It's not a huge increase over last quarter's success, but we doubt the head honchos care too much about growth when looking at that many zeros.
