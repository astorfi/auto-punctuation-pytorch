 Mountain View has silently been updating Google Now for a while -- throwing in a pedometer, some travel tools and even limited desktop support. A premature update to the feature's support page has revealed what's next: widgets. The proposed tool promises to give your Now cards a suitable abode on your device's home or lock screens, presenting a summary of your card selection at a glance. A single tap will dive directly into the full Google Now experience, offering you a better look at the corresponding deets. We aren't sure when or even how this feature will land, but it's sure to be a welcome addition when it does. After all, it's all about getting the right information at the right time.
