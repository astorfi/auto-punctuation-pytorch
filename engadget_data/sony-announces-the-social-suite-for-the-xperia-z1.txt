To go along with the Xperia Z1's 1/2.3-inch, 20.7-megapixel G lens sensor, Sony's just announced the Social Camera Suite at IFA 2013. The glamor feature is Info-Eye, which gives you a visual search function on any captured landmarks or items like wine or books. There's also the AR effects function, which can overlay animations (dinosaurs, for instance) on top of your pictures. Rounding out the suite is Social live, giving you instant social network broadcast, and Timeshift burst, which takes 61 images in 2 seconds before and after you press the shutter to avoid missed shots. To get it you'll need the Xperia Z1, aka Honami, of course -- check out our hands-on here.
