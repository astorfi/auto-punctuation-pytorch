 We're still reeling about the fact that several hundred people showed to our SF event (they seem to get bigger and bigger)-but even better are all the amazing photographs you took of the thing. Attendees played with devices from Motorola, Microsoft, OQO, Nokia, Sling Media, Sonos, chilled with Engadget editors (whether or not they knew it), and took home some seriously sweet prizes from all of the above. We'd like to thank Metaliq and PGP for putting the thing on with us, and for all the readers who were able to make it out. If you weren't among them, don't worry, we'll surely be coming your way soon enough!



    Very before.  OQO founder Jory Bell gets down and dirty with some users.  Technorati: JC + Niall Kennedy + Peter   Is that the look of disappointed longing?    This was the line you had to stand in to see...  Mrs. Rojas, who would give you...  one of the two hundred and fifty shirts we wound up giving away.  Mr. GoogleNet himself, the one and onlyOm Malik.   Our man Eric Lin, Engadget writer #2 and last of the famous international PhoneScoop playboys.  Free drinks: the happymaker.     Sorry guys, we left our soapboxes at home.    It actually got booed. Whatev, you know you wanted one (for free).   The Chairman of the Board looks on.  Dude won!  But this dude won the grand prize: a brand new OQO Model 01+.  Boy meets (ultramicro-)computer. The end!
