Doing the honors for us today are Android and Me, who've compared the new Droid to the classic variant. Funnily enough, they didn't find too much deviation from Motorola, describing the two handsets as "virtually identical," with the major physical change being the replacement of the previous keyboard's navigation pad with arrow buttons. The front end's soft buttons have also changed to Moto's Blur options, but otherwise you're still looking at a 3.7-incher with a 5 megapixel imager. The big improvement seems to have been under the hood with a new 1GHz TI OMAP3630 processor and 512MB of RAM (PowerVR SGX530 graphics unit remains the same) driving the Droid 2 to some robust benchmark scores. Of course, we don't see the handset booted up in this hands-on video, so treat these specs and results as provisional until we hear from the official horse's mouth in a couple of days.
