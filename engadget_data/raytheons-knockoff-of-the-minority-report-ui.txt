We aren't normally too fond of drawing comparisons between sci-fi flicks and tomorrow-tech, but we can't really
avoid defense contractor Raytheon's gloved user-interface inspiration, which was admittedly pulled from the Philip K.
Dick film-adaptation of Minority Report. Apparently the Air Force and feds are interested in the system for its ability
to enable commanding officers command of a quicker interface for navigating the huge amount of logistics data during a
battle. As always, we know it's also got a lot to do with certain high-ranking military officers wanting to be a little
more like Tom, and perhaps a mite bit of a crush on Sam Morton.
