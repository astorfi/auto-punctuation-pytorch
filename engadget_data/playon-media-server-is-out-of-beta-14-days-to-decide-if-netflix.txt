 
PlayOn's media server software -- capable of streaming Internet video from YouTube, Hulu, CBS, Netflix, CNN, ESPN and others to your PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 or other DLNA compliant hardware via a PC -- is finally out of beta. Going official means the trial period resets to 14 days for all users, keeping it after that will require $29.99. So tell us, now that Netflix streaming is implemented, bugs have been stomped and Wii support on the way, is it worth the one time payment to keep this service?
