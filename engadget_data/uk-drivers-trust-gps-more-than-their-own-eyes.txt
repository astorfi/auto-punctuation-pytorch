       We've heard reports before about thedangers of driving while under the influence of GPS, but it looks like drivers in the UK have taken trust of theirnavigation units to the extreme. Twice in the space of the last two weeks, we've seen reports of British drivers takingserious risks because they trust the info displayed on the small screen more than what they see through theirwindshield. In the most recent case, drivers passing through the village of Luckington have found themselves landing inthe River Avon, by following a GPS-recommended route that pointed to a bridge that has been closed for a week. Despitewarning signs on both sides of the road, and nothing but water straight ahead, local villagers have found themselvespulling an average of two cars a day out of the river for the past week. "When you ask what happened, they say,‘My sat-nav told me it was this way,'" one resident told The Times. Meanwhile, the  village of Crackpot(yes, that's really its name) has had to deal with drivers whose navigation systems have directed them to the edge of acliff with a hundred-foot drop. So far, there have been no serious injuries, but drivers have found themselves strandedon a rocky path. "It's only a matter of time before something happens," said one resident.Listen, we like GPS as much as the next sense-of-direction-impaired driver. But we also do our best to use our eyes, aswell. And if you don't, well, there's a village in England named for you, and it ain't Luckington.Read - LuckingtonRead - Crackpot
