But if your machine has a 54 slot, you can viewand record multiple DVB-T, digital, or analog sources simultaneously in MPEG-1/2/4 via digital antenna, S-Video, andcomposite in with the M5, and the same without the analog antenna on the M3. Of course, we know what would make thisreally useful is ATSC support, but we don't really think LifeView, the Taiwanese company who produces the FlyTV, wasaiming for US soil when they launched this one.[Thanks, Steve]
