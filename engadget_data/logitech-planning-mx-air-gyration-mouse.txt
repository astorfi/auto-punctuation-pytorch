Not a lot of info on it, but apparently it does the cursor thing with a combination of an in-air gyration mouse and traditional desktop laser mouse tech. No Bluetooth for this one, Logitech is sticking with its RF dongle method, and purportedly plans to release it this summer. Our Wiimote isn't so sure it's ready to fork over the friendly skies so soon.[Thanks, Anonymous]
