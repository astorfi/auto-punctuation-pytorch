       There have been many indications that the investigation surrounding US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's use of private email servers during her time as Secretary of State is wrapping up. Now, US Attorney General Loretta Lynch has released a statement saying she has accepted the FBI's recommendation and will not bring charges against Clinton or anyone else involved in the investigation.
      

 
According to the statement, Lynch met with FBI director James Comey and other prosecutors and agents who conducted the investigation. On their recommendation, Lynch said she'll consider the year-long investigation closed and accept the FBI's recommendation to not charge anyone. Comey is set to testify tomorrow to give full details on why he and the FBI believe Clinton shouldn't be charged.

Yesterday, Comey said that while Clinton's email handling was "extremely careless," the FBI found no evidence that she was trying to break the law and that "no reasonable prosecutor" would bring charges over the matter. Unsurprisingly, Republicans disagree with this assessment, and tomorrow's testimony could get contentious as Comey will be scrutinized for his position. And while Clinton may be in the clear from a legal standpoint, we're sure to hear all about this for the remainder of the year heading into the presidential election this November.

Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch:
Late this afternoon, I met with FBI Director James Comey and career prosecutors and agents who conducted the investigation of Secretary Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email system during her time as Secretary of State. I received and accepted their unanimous recommendation that the thorough, year-long investigation be closed and that no charges be brought against any individuals within the scope of the investigation.
