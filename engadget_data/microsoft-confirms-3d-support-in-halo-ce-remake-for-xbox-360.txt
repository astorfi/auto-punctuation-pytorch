Joystiq experienced a demo at Gamescom in Germany, and reports that it only works with the game's updated graphics mode, and that the game's producer claims the framerate will stay consistent even in 3D. While there are already a number of Xbox 360 games that support 3DTVs, this is the first one we've heard developed by Microsoft, although Epic revealed earlier this month that the Microsoft-produced Gears of War 3 will support 3D. that's good news for gamers that have made the extra dimensional jump already, while those of us playing in 2D can hopefully still see performance improvements, especially while playing co-op -- we always bring a wingman / shoulder to cry on for The Flood.
