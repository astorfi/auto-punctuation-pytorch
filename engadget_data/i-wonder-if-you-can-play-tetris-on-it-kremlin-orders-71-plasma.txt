        Remember that special limited-edition 71" gold-plated plasma TV we told you about? Well, I don't know where the other 999 are going, but one of them will grace the wall of the Kremlin Cabinet meeting room. Hmm, I'm sure there are a few Congressmen who'd like to go in on a group buy for one of these things.Maybe they got a discount, since LG will be launching in Russia later this year, but I've never seen a coupon for a $80,000 TV before.
