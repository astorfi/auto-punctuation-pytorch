But once you get past its monumental moniker you'll notice that the 32GB (¥17,000 about $200), 16GB (¥9,000 or $106), and 8GB (¥5,000 / $59) MS-HXB series memory cards boast an impressive 50MB per second transfer rate as tested by Sony. That's a pretty decent jump past Sony's older MS-HXA series of cards and should help keep the few remaining Memory Stick-only devices happily bursting into a future dominated by Secure Digital.
