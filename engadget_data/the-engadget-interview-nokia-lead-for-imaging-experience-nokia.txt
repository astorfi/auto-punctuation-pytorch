  Hot on the heels of yesterday's interview with Stefan Pannenbecker, we had a chance to sit down with Damian Dinning, Lead Manager for Imaging Experience at Nokia, to discuss the mother of all cameraphones -- the Symbian Belle-based 808 PureView -- which was announced yesterday at Mobile World Congress. With such incredible specs as a 41-megapixel sensor and f/2.4 Carl Zeiss autofocus lens, we wanted to get a better understanding of the technology behind this flagship shooter. Watch the video to find out how Nokia is redefining mobile photography by using sub-pixel interpolation and oversampling for high-quality digital zooming and image stabilization, plus improved low-light performance.
