ROM version 1.17.605.1 is starting to make its way into the world via the phone's over-the-air update mechanism, fixing an intermittent bad signal indicator when bringing it out of standby. Yep, that's it -- so there'd better be a much heartier update in the wings later this quarter as Big Red has previously promised.
