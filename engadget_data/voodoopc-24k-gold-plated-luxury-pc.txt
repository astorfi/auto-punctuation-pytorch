We get the fact that VoodooPC offers upscale "luxury" PCs. But up
until now, we had to give them props for at least trying to pair high-end functionality with high prices, so that
would-be purchasers could justify their splurge based on the fact that they absolutely had to have a liquid-cooled PC
with 8GB of RAM, dual nVidia GeForce 6800 GT 256 PCI Express cards, an AMD Athlon 64 FX-57 and a VoodooPC t-shirt
(okay, maybe the t-shirt is an indulgence). But all of that is out the window with the latest from Voodoo: a 24-karat
gold-plated version of the company's Omen desktop. The specs of the Omen 24K appear to be pretty similar to the regular
Omen, which means it's a fast, powerful desktop targeted at extreme gamers and media producers. But 24-karat gold?
Voodoo's PR people may claim that this is "the type of PC that will show up in luxe holiday catalogues and under
Diddy's Christmas tree." We have a somewhat different take on it: this is the PC that show-off execs will position in
the front-office next to the leather couches and framed modernist paintings to convey just how successful they are.
Hmm. Maybe this will show up in those catalogs after all.
