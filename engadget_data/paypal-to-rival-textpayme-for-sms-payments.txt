 We ran TextPayMe by you lastyear, a service that allows you to make PayPal-like payments over SMS. Well now it looks like PayPal is hoping to makethose SMS payments a little more PayPal-like, since they're advertising for a business manager and senior productmanager for their "PayPal Mobile" group, "a new mobile payments 'start-up' unit" in the company. Soit looks like we might have some friendly competition in the mobile payment space sooner rather than later, which soundsfine by us.[Via textually.org]
