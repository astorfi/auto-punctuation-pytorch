First of all, it has a different collection of Android-friendly "buttons" along the bottom and seems to be void of Samsung's TouchWiz UI skin. It's also carrying a P1000 model number. Well, at least the 7-inch Super AMOLED remains the same. See the quick action go by in a blur after the break.

P.S. The dialer pictured above seems to confirm that the Tab can be used like a giant phone. No, really. We've heard this previously as rumor but didn't believe it until now. The second video perfectly illustrates the reason for our concern. [Thanks, Saad]
