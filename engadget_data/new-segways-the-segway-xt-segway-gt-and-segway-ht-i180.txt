Three new Segways today:




The Segway XT, aka the Segway Cross-Train Transporter, a ruggedized version of the original Segway HT with larger
all-terrain tires, a new "robust" fender design, and a longer-lasting battery (so you can off-road without fear of
having to recharge). Despite doing its best to look like a monster truck, you still won't look tough riding one of
these. Retail price: $4,995.

The Segway GT, or Golf Transporter, the purpose of which should be perfectly
obvious. This one comes with a golf bag carrier, enhanced traction tires, extended-range batteries, and a special
standby key (since presumably you'll be getting on and off a lot while you're hitting the back nine). Retail price:
$5,495.
