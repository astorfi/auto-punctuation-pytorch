Possibly concerned that merely showing off a giant 105-inch curved, ultrawidescreen (with a resolution of 5,120 x 2,160 it's being marketed as 5K) Ultra HD television wasn't enough, LG just announced a few more super high-res displays it's bringing this week. Alongside the 105UC9, the UB9800 4K Ultra HD series includes flat LCD televisions in 65-, 79-, 84- and 98-inch sizes. Other than their 3,840 x 2,160 resolution, the calling card of this line is its "Tru-ULTRA HD Engine Pro" chip that handles any upscaling from SD, HD, or "True HD" (1080p) sources, and has "4K Motion Estimation Motion Compensation (MEMC)" for 4K source content.


The 105-inch Curved Ultra HD TV also sports one other unique feature, that massive speaker along the bottom is something LG calls the "Ultra Surround" concept. It contains 7.2-channel forward facing speakers designed with Harmon Kardon. LG says its new TVs can play Ultra HD content from almost any source thanks to HDMI 2.0, USB and LAN inputs, plus support for h.264 and the new HEVC format. Not enough new displays for you? LG will also have new Ultra HD OLEDs, and just for giggles, probably a few more affordable options at its press conference Monday and CES booth later this week.
