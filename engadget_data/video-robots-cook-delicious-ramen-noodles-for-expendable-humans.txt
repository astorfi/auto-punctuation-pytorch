The latest culinary drone, hailing from Nagoya, Japan, features a pair of delightfully dextrous arms and is capable of serving up a yummy bowl of ramen noodles in under two minutes. With such rapid speed, the bots get some downtime, which they fill by performing a little show for their clientele. Trust us, you really don't wanna be the one person who didn't see the surreal duel that lies beyond the break.[Via Switched]
