 While Yahoo has had a tumultuous last few years, one unit that has consistently been at the top of the heap is its sports news division. At the same time, NBC Sports has been getting a boost -- even without the NHL's help -- ever since Comcast bought NBCUniversal. Apparently between Yahoo's need to better leverage its media properties and NBC's free agency after calling it quits with Microsoft the two have found common ground and struck a deal. Although both websites will continue to operate independently, expect multi-platform crossover between TV and internet, cross-promotion with links to NBC Sports Live Extra streams from within Yahoo, new made-for-the-internet video shows combining their assets and Yahoo's fantasy sports will be the exclusive game for NBC's Rotoworld site. Check after the break for the press release and a heads up on why even non-sports fans that pay for TV may need to keep an eye on this move.



 Whether or not you watch sports, channels like these already account for a significant part of cable and satellite TV bills, and will likely gobble up more going forward. That's pushing moves like this one and similar efforts like Time Warner Cable's SportsNet that now broadcasts LA Lakers games in Southern California and is reportedly seeking a deal for the Dodgers. In other corners, ESPN continues to expand its influence (snagging all of the new Division 1 college football playoff games for a dozen years), previously niche segments like regional conferences are driving up the demand for their networks and the dual threat of social media and DVRs are making live TV events more important than ever. The details on Yahoo and NBC's deal are in the press release -- we'll just be happy if the official Engadget HD Fantasy leagues don't see any more outages as we go into the playoffs.
