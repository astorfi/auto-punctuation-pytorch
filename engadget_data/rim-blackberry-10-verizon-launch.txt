 This bit of news got a bit buried amid the back-to-back-to-back press events that happened earlier this week, but Verizon Chief Marketing Officer Tami Erwin confirmed in an interview with CNET on Wednesday that the carrier will be offering at least one BlackBerry 10 smartphone at launch. As you'll recall, that launch date now sits at sometime in the first quarter of 2013, following some delays, and it's expected than an all-touch device will debut prior to a more traditional keyboard-equipped BlackBerry. Unfortunately, Erwin didn't offer any more specifics than that, but it looks like RIM's recent push to woo carriers has paid off with at least one of the big three in the US.
