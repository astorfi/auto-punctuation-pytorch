This week, AMD has introduced what it's calling the world's first mobile graphics with DX11 compatibility, and the Mobility Radeon HD 5870 -- which just so happens to be featured in ASUS' recently revealed G73jh -- is leading the way. The HD 5800, HD 5700, HD 5600 and HD 5400 series are all new at the show, and each one comes with baked in support for ATI Eyefinity multi-display technology and helping tech-adoring geeks find their soulmates (as is clearly shown above). Hit the source link for more details on each, and figure on seeing these filter out to new ultraportables, mainstream rigs and gaming lappies in the seconds, days and weeks ahead.
