think HDTVs aren't expensive enough, which is why we just submitted an
expense report for the "LG Royal" Gold 71-inch HDTV set that Luxist
found. This 1080p PDP  becomes available to the masses in Dubai this week and
we're certain that the common-folk are lining up in advance to get one
of the 1,000 limited edition sets. We're not sure that Dubai even
offers any HDTV stations, but if you can afford a gold-plated 71-inch
1080p set, you can probably buy an HDTV broadcasting company too.

Funny; we haven't heard back on that expense report just yet. I wonder
if it got lost in the mail? Shoot, I can't remember if I submitted a
separate report for the remote control!
