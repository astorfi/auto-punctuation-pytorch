 
The Division may not be coming out until next year, but you can get a (very) brief taste of it in Ubisoft's new E3 teaser. 

Really, it's nothing more than a teaser for the show and the upcoming reveals, but the shot of New York City in fast motion set against a soft voice singing "Silent Night" delivers on atmosphere if not details. You can check it out after the break.
