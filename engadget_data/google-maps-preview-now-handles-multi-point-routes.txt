When the Google Maps web preview launched, it omitted the previous version's multi-point directions -- a big setback for tourists and other frequent travelers. Much to our relief, the company just brought this navigation back for Americans. Preview users only need to hit a button to add extra destinations to their trip, with details syncing to other devices. On top of this update, Google Maps is now useful for finding local events; search for concerts in a given area and you'll see what's playing nearby. Google hasn't said when its improved routing will reach other parts of the world, but we won't be surprised if it spreads quickly.
