Available in n端vi 3790T, n端vi 3760T and n端vi 3750 models, the devices are all just 9mm thick, and pack a 4.3-inch capacitive WVGA display (with full multitouch), Garmin's own EcoRoute and n端Route with trafficTrends services, the usual 2D and 3D views, and a microSD card slot for expansion, among other standard fare. The 3790T and 3760T also add Bluetooth and free lifetime traffic alerts, while the 3790T is the only one of the lot with complete voice-activated navigation including a customizable wake-up phrase. Of course, the real news here is the design, which has earned Garmin a Red Dot Design Award, and features a brushed metal enclosure, a flush glass display and only the minimum buttons required on the side. As you might have guessed, however, these aren't exactly Garmin's new entry-level offerings, with the 3750, 3760T and 3790T set to run $349, $399 and $449 when they roll out sometime in the third quarter.
