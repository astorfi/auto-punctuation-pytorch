  As expected, Nintendo has announced the US launch date and pricing for the DS Lite. The handheld gaming system will arrive on US shores on June 11 for about $129.99, and will come in an "inaugural color" of white. Since we've already seen the Lite in other colors, we assume those and more will make their way to the US soon enough, and the Wii factory is just teasing us by making us wait. Everything else you already know about the Lite remains unchanged, including the fact that, if you really can't wait a whole month to get it, your favorite gray market dealers can still get it for you sooner for about $200 plus shipping.
