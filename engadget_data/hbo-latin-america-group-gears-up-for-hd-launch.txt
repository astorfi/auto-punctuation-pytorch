 We already heard HBO's CEO Bill Nelson proclaim that all 26 of its channels would soon be airing in HD, but today we've received confirmation that those parked in Latin America will also be enjoying the spoils. Motorola has announced that it will be adding multiple MPEG-4 AVC encoding channels at the HBO Latin America Group digital transmission facility in Florida, which will enable "rapid deployment of HBO's new HD services." According to HBO's Pierre Jaspar, it has seen "marked acceleration in demand" for HD programming in the Latin America region, and while we're not given specific dates, carriers, etc., it seems safe to assume more of the aforementioned region will soon be seeing HBO in high-def.
