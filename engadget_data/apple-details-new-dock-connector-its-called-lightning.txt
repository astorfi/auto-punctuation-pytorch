The likes of Bose, BLW and B&O are already working on new compatible docks while the new connector itself is now easier to connect, more durable, all digital, with an adaptive interface which warrants some closer inspection. Naturally, an adapter will also be made available for your existing iPhone peripherals, but if you have a number of devices to connect, it's likely to put a hurt on your wallet -- the adapter is now for sale in the Apple Store for a whopping $29. At least it'll pair well with that Thunderbolt connection, right?
