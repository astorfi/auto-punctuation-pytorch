There's a docking port on the bottom and a headphone jack (and what looks like a volume rocker) on the left side. That's literally all we know for now. You're such a tease, Dell.

Update: Dell says it's called the Streak 10. Makes sense, no? By the way, that's a non-functional unit that Dell's held up on stage -- just a backlit, static image on a device that's not yet ready for primetime.
