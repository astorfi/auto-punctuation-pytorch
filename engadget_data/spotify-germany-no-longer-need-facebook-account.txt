Since Spotify buddied up with the social network last year, users across the globe have had to hand over their Facebook info to create an account and start streaming. Now Germans will have the option to create a Spotify account by providing their email address and creating a username, though the Facebook requirement holds true for all other countries. As TNW points out, that change in policy may have something to do with the fact that less than 30 percent of Germans are on Facebook, compared to more than 50 percent for Americans and Brits -- but we suspect Germany's notoriously heavy emphasis on privacy had something to do with it as well.
