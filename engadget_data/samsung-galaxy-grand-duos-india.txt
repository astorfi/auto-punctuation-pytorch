 Earlier today, Samsung announced the availability of its dual-sim Galaxy Grand Duos for markets in India. Shipping with an included flip cover, the budget-friendly phablet will sell for Rs 21,500 ($400). Loaded with mid-range specs, the device's highlights include a 5-inch WVGA display, a 1.5GHz 1.2GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of internal storage, an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera with Android 4.1 running the show. We recently managed to get some hands-on time with a pre-production build of this handset, which felt like a hefty GSIII, but performed more like an overgrown Galaxy S III mini. However, if you've got phablets on the brain and you're balling on a budget, this thrifty hybrid device begins shipping the first week of February.

 Update: This post originally (and incorrectly) indicated a 1.5GHz processor. The correct number is 1.2GHz.
