The big deal here is speed -- the new build stamps out many lag-related concerns buyers had at the phone's initial release, and we've heard (and seen) that the new code is nothing short of magic. Unfortunately, US residents still don't have a good reason to expect to find this on their local HTC support site yet -- Sprint won't be dropping the Hero until early next month, at which point we'd certainly hope the latest and greatest speed improvements would've already been incorporated -- but Europeans hesitant to give the Hero a shot might want to give it another look with the new goods installed.
