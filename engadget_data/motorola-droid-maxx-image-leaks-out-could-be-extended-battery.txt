Closing out a week full of Motorola leaks, @evleaks has posted this image of a device claimed to be the Droid Maxx, due on Verizon later this year and flashing a Kevlar frame with capacitive buttons. Earlier tweets and a source from Droid Life suggest this is the XT1080M, an extended battery version of the Droid Ultra (XT1080) that popped up on Motorola's website. An XT1080 recently appeared in the FCC database as well, spurring rumors we'll see more Droid-branded smartphones on the Big Red carrier very soon. To round out the rumors, the XT1030 is pegged as a Droid Mini, plus the XT1060 Moto X variant for Verizon. There's still no word on specs, but at this rate we'll probably have more info by tomorrow.
