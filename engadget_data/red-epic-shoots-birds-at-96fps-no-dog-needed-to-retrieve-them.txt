The video below (and picture above) come courtesy of Tom Lowe, who filmed a sequence of birds frolicking in the water at Salton Sea, California, captured at 5K resolution and at 96fps. This gives everything a rather majestic air to it -- though the soundtrack certainly doesn't hurt. Click "play" and enjoy, and then wish that your connection were fast enough to handle an uncompressed 5K video stream.

[Thanks, Tom]
