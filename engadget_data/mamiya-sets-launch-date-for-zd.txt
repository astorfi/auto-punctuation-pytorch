We're still saving our pennies for a digital SLR, but if you're a pro used to medium-format gear (or a very
well-heeled consumer), $12 grand may seem like a reasonable price for the Mamiya ZD, the first medium format digital
camera kit (especially since digital backs for medium format film cameras can go for even more than that). The 22
megapixel (yes, that says 22) Mamiya ZD has been the subject of buzz, rumors and lust since it was first announced at
Photokina last September, and now it looks like the wait is almost over. Mamiya has announced that the camera should
start shipping this summer. We, of course, will still be saving our pennies.
