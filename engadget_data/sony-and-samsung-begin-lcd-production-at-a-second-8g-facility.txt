 The S-LCD joint venture between Sony and Samsung now has a second 8th-generation production line to its credit, as the companies announced the $1.5 billion dollar expansion is now in operation and will be capable of producing up to 70,000 glass sheets per month for 32, 46- and 52-inch HDTV screens by the end of the year. We've seen prices at that size fall sharply since the first line was introduced two years ago, and we can't help but think this bodes well for Black Friday bargain hunters in 2009 and beyond.[Via AV Watch]
