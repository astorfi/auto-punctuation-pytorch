Sounds like Google's been busy cutting international licensing deals, because the company's just expanded its Play Movies and Music services to a huge bunch of countries. Between the two, the latter touts the longer list, as the Play Movies & TV Android app has been updated to work in 37 new locations across the globe. These include the Netherlands, Venezuela and Rwanda, as you can see in the roster (that Android Police spotted on Google Play's support page) posted after the break. While residents in all these countries can watch movies they've bought or rented from Google, TV shows are still only limited to people living in the US, the UK, Australia and Japan.



On the other hand, folks from Sweden, Norway, Greece and Slovakia can now buy albums and tracks via Play Music. It comes with Google's All Access music streaming in tow, as the service continues its European journey after making a detour to Mexico. Slovakians only need to pay €4.49 ($7) a month after their 30-day trial expires, but Greeks have to pay €7.99 ($11) for a subscription. Swedes and Norwegians get the worst deal, though, as they have to pony up 79 Kroner ($15) a month. But hey, at least they're better off than our good friends in Canada, who are still waiting for All Access to arrive.

Google Play Movies is now available in these countries:
