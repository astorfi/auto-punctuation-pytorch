Technologizer recently discovered the highlighted line above in the source code for the Hulu website, and if correct, you'll need a PlayStation Plus subscription on top of your Hulu Plus one in order to stream the best brain-numbing shows from broadcast TV. While that adds up to an additional $18 for three months or $50 annually on top of your $10 monthly Hulu Plus fee, it's not like you'll get a better deal on a different game console -- Microsoft has confirmed Hulu will require Xbox Live Gold when it launches on Xbox 360 next year. Besides, this isn't like those janky Netflix Instant Streaming Discs -- further down the source code, there are hints that Hulu's developing a bona fide app for PlayStation 3. See the relevant section of the code right after the break.
