Now, it's introducing its successor, which also claims a mobile first -- a ceramic body (and they don't just mean the color). Apart from the fancy housing, there's a generous 4.8-inch, 720p LCD screen. It's Qualcomm in the engine room again, this time the MSM8960 S4 variant. This offers the same number of cores, but Krait is a much more tantalizing prospect over the aging S3. It also means you can expect LTE along with the usual suspects like WiFi, FM and GPS. If you can't hold out for that other Korean handset, you should be able to part with your Won later this month.
