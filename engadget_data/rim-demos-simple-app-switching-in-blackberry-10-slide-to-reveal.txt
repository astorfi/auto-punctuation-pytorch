Instead of going the task list route, as webOS and Android have done, RIM's latest simply lets you swipe to reveal background tasks. Drag your thumb from left to right to peek at other apps that are currently running in the background. You can simply glance at them and go back to the foreground, or you can actually swipe back to go to programs launched earlier. It's slick, intuitive and perhaps the most familiar multitasking solution to those accustomed to the desktop metaphor. For more info check out our recent hands-on.
