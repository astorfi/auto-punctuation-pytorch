       Rumors are just that -- rumors -- until they start to take shape and more people can confirm them. That being said, this one's pretty juicy: sources tell us AT&T the BlackBerry 8300 has appeared on their internal website with a tentative ("tentative" as in "close our eyes and hope for the best") launch date of May 25th. That date would fall right in line with Boy Genius and his predictions, making for a fabulous month of May (for BlackBerry fans, anyhow!).[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
