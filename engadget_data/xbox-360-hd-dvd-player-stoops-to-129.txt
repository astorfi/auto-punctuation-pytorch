That's right kids, the attachment has just plummeted to a juicy $129, which would honestly sound a whole lot sweeter if not for that sub-$100 HD DVD fiasco still lingering in our heads. Nevertheless, we've already noticed the player's new price tag over at Amazon and Toys R Us, but feel free to point out any other price slashings in comments below.Read - $129.99 at AmazonRead - $129.98 at Toys R Us
