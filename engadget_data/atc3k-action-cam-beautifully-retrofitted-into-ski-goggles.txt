Over at Biobug, one rather talented modder has decided to integrate said device into his UVEX ski goggles, and the result is nothing short of breathtaking. All that was required was a soldering iron, some cabling, a Dremel cutting tool, an ATC3K camera, AA battery box and a small plastic case. Oh, and time -- lots and lots of spare time. Hit the read link for a pictorial trip down assembly lane, and feel free to create your own for this winter's best-ever YouTube vids.
