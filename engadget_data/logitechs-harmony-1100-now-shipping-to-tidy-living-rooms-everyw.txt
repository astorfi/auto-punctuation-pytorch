Most like to use remote controls without looking down, and that could be a bit of a challenge here. However, as the buttons on most Harmony remotes tend to start failing after about 12 months or so, perhaps ditching most of them is a good move for Logitech. Regardless of the intent, if you're so sick of multiple controllers you're willing to spend $500 on the company's latest and greatest, you'd better get that credit card warmed up and click the read link. Our failing economy thanks you.
