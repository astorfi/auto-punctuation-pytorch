 Well, we just caught sight of it in all its dissected glory courtesy of the FCC last week, but it looks like the Archos 9 tablet / media player may not be quite so close to a release after all. According to UMPC Portal, Archos now says that the initial batch of pre-orders won't start shipping until "early December" -- well past the already-missed October 22nd launch date -- while the retail release has been pushed back all the way until sometime in the first quarter of 2010. Let's just hope the price doesn't keep going up in the meantime.
