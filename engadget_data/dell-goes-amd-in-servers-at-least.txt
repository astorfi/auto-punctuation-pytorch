 It's been a long time coming, but Dell finally managed to cram an AMD chip into a system of theirs, ending years of Intel monogamy (other than their recently acquired Alienware lines). They're starting off slow, with a just a few Opteron Dual-Core processors in high end servers, but it could be a sign of things to come. Dell CEO Kevin Rollins sure played things down, mentioning "it's a fairly small category in terms of units," and that "we will still be launching this year a broad line of Intel products." But with recent AMD successes, especially in the desktop market, it's been long rumored that Dell is going to give up their AMD boycott. We'll keep our eyes peeled.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
