 While in Helsinki, do as the Finns do -- shop at Nokia's flagship store, right? Just as we were contemplating the purchase of an unlocked Asha (or three) as stocking stuffers, we stumbled upon this delightfully futuristic 808 PureView display -- complete with quirky dioramas. Sadly, we weren't packing Nokia's imaging handset, nor the phenomenal Lumia 920 camera, so we used our trusty HTC One X to capture the moment. Check out the gallery below -- where you'll find the 808 PureView serving as a swimming pool and being assembled by tiny workers -- then hit the break for a short video.
