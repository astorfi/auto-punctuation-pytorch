From EraTech, the same company behind that coin-sized MP3 player that is never going to go on sale here is the
EMP-ZII, an egg-shaped wearable MP3 player with a color screen for showing digital photos (which seems to be the one
feature everyone is putting into their players this year). Comes in 128MB, 256MB, and 512MB varieties.
