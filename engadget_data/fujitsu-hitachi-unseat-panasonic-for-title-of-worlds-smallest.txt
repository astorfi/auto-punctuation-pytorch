produce the "world's smallest" 1080p plasma. The new 1920 x 1080 42-inch PDP snatches the title from previous record
holder Panasonic, whose 50-inch model seems positively
huge in comparison. This 16:9 widescreen features a 3000:1 contrast ratio and 1000 cd/m2 brightnessâ€”no word yet on
pricing or availability, but we'll be following this story closely, as you can be sure that the 42-incher isn't the
last contender we'll see in this heated battle.
