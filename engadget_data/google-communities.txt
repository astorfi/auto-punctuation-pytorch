 Google's social service has provided a venue for chatting and collaborating with family and friends, but it hasn't exactly been the best place to get to know strangers who happen to share similar interests. That seems to be the idea behind Communities -- think of it as Facebook Groups, but within the Google ecosystem. Google+ Communities can be open to anyone on the network, but they can be private if you wish, so members have the opportunity to share photos, forum posts, and even add Hangouts and Events without worrying about that content being available to anyone and everyone on the web. The network's latest feature is set to roll out today, so keep an eye out for the Communities icon to hit your Google+ sidebar. You can also snag a sneak peek in the intro video just past the break.
