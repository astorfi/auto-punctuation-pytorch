Better late than never -- we were expecting this zippy peripheral sometime late last year -- the 595U will be available from Sprint next month for "as low as $49.99," which means that you'll be signing a two-year contract and mailing in some rebates. Sure going USB isn't quite as convenient as built-in 3G or ExpressCard / PCMCIA models, but our lone slot is already filled with a MoGo Mouse, and we wouldn't give up that convenience for anything.
