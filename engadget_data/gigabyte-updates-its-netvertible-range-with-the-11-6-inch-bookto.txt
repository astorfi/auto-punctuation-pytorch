 

With Gigabyte's gaming motherboards doing so well, it's nice to be reminded that the company makes whole PCs too. The latest in its Booktop line of swiveling tablet hybrids is the T1132, which trumps the T1125 with a 1.6GHz Core i5-2467M processor and a GeForce GT520M GPU with 1GB and NVIDIA Optimus switching technology. You get one USB 3.0, one USB 2.0, eSATA and HDMI on the 1.76kg (3.9-pound) lappie itself, but you can add more ports and an optical drive with the optional docking station. There's no indication as to availability or whether it'll cost more or less than the T1125's original $1300 asking price, but you could always try to snag a free one via Gigabyte's wanton Facebook bribery competition detailed after the break.
