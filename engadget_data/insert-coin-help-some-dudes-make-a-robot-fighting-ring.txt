 In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line.  The fine folks at Mech Warfare have a problem: their robots are a little too awesome. The housing tents made from PVC pipes and canvas just aren't cutting it. The crew needs a cool $6,000 to provide their 'bots with the modular lexan & aluminum-armored arena they deserve -- because the last thing you want to do is upset a team of weaponized fighting robots, right? Mech Warfare has promised to offer up the plans for the arena online, while using any extra money for networking equipment, so that you can enjoy the inalienable human right that is robot fighting from the comfort of your own home. Pledge $10 or more, and you'll get your name on the Sponsors page -- pledge more than $5,000, and the crew will help coach you in designing a battling 'bot of your very own. Check out some sweet robot fighting action in the video after the break.
 

   Previous project update: With 46 days left to contribute, Instaprint still has a ways to go, with around $133,000 of its $500,000 goal reached, thanks to some 494 backers.
