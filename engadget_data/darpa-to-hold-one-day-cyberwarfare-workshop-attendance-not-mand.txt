It's the advanced decomposition of that latter rotten apple, however, that has DARPA -- the government's far-out research arm -- taking a proactive stance and casting an agency-wide intelligence net to shore up on future defense protocol. To do this, the DoD offshoot's holding a one-time workshop next month, dubbed Plan X Proposers' Day, with the aim of bringing personnel together to brainstorm and implement infrastructure specifically centered around cyberwarfare analysis and research. One area the project, which just received $110 million in funding, will specifically avoid is the creation of actual cyberweapons. So, yeah, while this effort's less Goldeneye and more of a strategic think tank initiative, it still warms the heart to know our nation's best, brightest and most secretive are hard at work protecting our digital butts.
