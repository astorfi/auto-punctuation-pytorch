In fact, the majority of folks in Mexico often choose to go this route rather than sticking with some sort of monthly contract. Not surprisingly, Skype's done its homework and has taken note of this situation, as the Microsoft-owned service has announced its plans to start selling a couple of prepaid card options in Mexico. For starters, there's a 100 pesos (around $8) per-month deal which offers an unlimited calling plan to both mobile and landlines in the US, while the pay-as-you-go sheet costs 150 pesos but charges by the minute at a modest .30 pesos and includes calls to more than 170 countries. According to Skype, these cards will be available at multiple stores all over Mexico, such as Best Buy, Radio Shack, 7 Eleven and El Palacio de Hierro.
