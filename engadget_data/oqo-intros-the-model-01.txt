OQO announced a long overdue update
to their Model 01 ultrapersonal computer earlier today. As its name suggests, the new model 01+ isn't the Model 02
we've been waiting for (that's due out next year we hear), but it is a solid upgrade and comes with 512MB of RAM, a
30GB hard drive, USB 2.0, a 1GHz processor, an internal speaker, and a 5-inch, 800 x 480 LCD screen. The Model 01+
we've been playing with definitely feels like a significant improvement over the original — for starters, it's much
snappier and just feels easier to use — but it almost makes you wish they'd been able to release the 01 with these
specs in the first place (we'll cut them slack since it was a first-gen product and just be happy that they got it
right this time).
