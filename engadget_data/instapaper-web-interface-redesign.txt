When Instapaper got acquired, its new owners swore they wouldn't let it go stale. Now, we're seeing the first wave of changes roll out since the save-and-read-later tool changed hands, starting with a complete overhaul of its web interface. Instapaper's new website still remains simple -- good thing, because that's part of its charm -- but borrows design elements from its iOS and Android apps. In the next few weeks, Betaworks (the company that now owns Instapaper as well as Digg), will also unleash revamped mobile apps, improved browser extensions and a handful of new features. Whether these Instapaper updates can insta-entice people to switch from Pocket and other competitors remains to be seen, but hit the source links if you'd like to give the tool a shot.
