 
Believe it or not, it was around this day two full years ago that LG managed to climb atop Matsushita, Hitachi and the rest of the gang to claim the label of top plasma maker in the world. Shortly thereafter, Matsushita roared to number one and has remained there ever since -- until now. The aforesaid firm slipped from #1 to #3 in Q1 2008, as LG's share surged 34.8-percent on 97-percent year-over-year growth. Samsung SDI took advantage of Matsushita's folly and claimed the silver for the first time, while Hitachi, Pioneer and Orion closed out the bottom in that order. We've got a good feeling about PDP this year, but we aren't about to call it a comeback.[Via Tech-On]
