 If you find it rather appalling that a $300 graphics card is on the budget end of things these days -- back in our day that was the price of a next-gen console, now get off our lawn! -- you might be comforted to know that NVIDIA's 320MB 8800 GTS ain't no sloucher. Sure, the 500MHz G80 core is stepped down from the 575MHz in the GTX, with the 320MB of memory falling far short of the 768MB in the GTX or even the 640MB in the beefier version of the GTS, but you're still getting a whole lot of DirectX 10 juice for your dollar, relative to the $600+ GTX and $400+ 640MB GTS. If you're still having trouble justifying the price, just google yourself a few Crysis screenshots -- there won't be any turning back. Be sure to peep the uniformly awkward OEM box art after the break.[Via TrustedReviews]
      

 

The day when our culture advances past the point of finding high-rise undies sexy will be an important milestone for our civilization."With this card you too can control faceless puppet men in the holy fight against eyeball umbrellas from space attempting to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids."We're just confused here, is her hair on fire, or is there a sort of fire / hair hybrid thing going on?What the carp is this? A hairy man? A dogmanwolfguy? We see the intelligence and danger in his eyes, but the puppy fuzz confuses us so.
