Originally shown at CES, the Home Theater Scaler Pro takes any source via its dual HDMI 1.3, component, S-video or composite inputs and upscales to 1080p with the same video processing usually reserved for high end equipment like Denon and Marantz's Blu-ray players. True 1080i-to-1080p deinterlacing and per pixel detail enhancement mean your SD sources will look as good as possible -- and not depend on your 1080p HDTV's scaling ability or possible lack thereof -- whenever this box hits shelves.
