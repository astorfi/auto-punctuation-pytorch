Some folks like to pass the time with a playlist or TV show while getting a treadmill workout in, but for musician Wesley Stace, it was the perfect time to recreate highly-recognizable album covers. Using his emoji library, Stace has since created over 50 such works that range from The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Springsteen's Born in the USA. He tells Fast Company that what started as a way to pass the time turned into a guessing game of sorts, so he decided to beam them to Twitter. If you ask me, the emoji version of Nirvana's Nevermind is quite stellar.
