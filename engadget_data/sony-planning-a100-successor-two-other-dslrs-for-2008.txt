At a recent press event at Sonimagfoto in Barcelona, Spain, it was reported that the firm is hoping to crank out an all new flagship model, a true A100 successor and another flavor that's likely to hit at a lower price point than its higher-end Alpha siblings. Additionally, it's looking to increase its lens collection from around 24 to 40 within the next two years, many of which will be new designs from Carl Zeiss. Beyond that, we're simply left to speculate, so be our guests in comments, would ya?[Thanks, Jakob G.]
