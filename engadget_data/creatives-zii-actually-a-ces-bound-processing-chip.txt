The curious Zii website we peeked a few days back is reportedly referring to an all new processing chip, and while eipZENter isn't being too forthcoming with details just yet, we are told that it will likely be "one of the biggest projects Creative has invested in." If that's just too vague for your tastes, try this: "[Zii] is completely different from the X-Fi audio chip and it will be used in a variety of upcoming products." Alrighty then.[Thanks, Swild]
