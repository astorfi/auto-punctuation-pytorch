 We kinda thought they'd have a bigger showingat CeBIT than a single 37-inch 1080 HDTV, but hey, here it is, the Aquos LC-37GE1E. Apparently it's got a 1200:1 contrast ratio, dualHDMI-HDCP connectors, and a backlight that makes use of a crimson tone, which should supposedly result in more naturalseeming color representation. No word on price or date of release, or even whether it's going to dethrone Fujitsu /Hitachi's 42-inch as the world's smallest 1080p display, but you'll know when we do.
