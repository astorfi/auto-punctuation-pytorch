Apple's new iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s are now in the wild, and here's how you'll be able to grab one. Both will arrive on September 20th in the US, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore and the UK, with iPhone 5c pre-orders starting September 13th. That marks the first time China will get the iPhone at launch, and NTT DoCoMo will get it in Japan for the first time. By December, Apple said the phones will be available in over 100 countries.


Stateside, a basic 16GB iPhone 5s model will run $199 for the 16GB version, $299 for 32GB and $399 for 64GB on a two year contract. The iPhone 5c will cost $99 for the 16GB model and $199 for the 32GB model. You'll also be able to grab them at those prices from AT&T, Sprint and Verizon, while an unlocked, contract free iPhone 5c will be available through T-Mobile for $549 (16GB) and $649 (32GB). T-Mobile will also have the unlocked iPhone 5s for $649, $749 and $849, for 16GB, 32GB and 64GB respectively. Though the iPhone 5 will be discontinued, the iPhone 4s will stay on the roster and be free on a two-year contract. The new models will start shipping out on September 20th (there's no pre-order for the iPhone 5s), but if you decide you want one in your hand on that very day, you can also hit Apple stores, of course -- if you're feeling lucky.
