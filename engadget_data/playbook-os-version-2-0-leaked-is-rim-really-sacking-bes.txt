Nevertheless, it purports to show the account setup page from BlackBerry Tablet OS 2.0 and it distinctly lacks any option to sync with BlackBerry Enterprise Server or Internet Service. Instead, you're able to configure Exchange/Active Sync, IMAP, POP, CalDAV and CardDAV accounts, which suggests that RIM is switching to the same integrated email, contacts and calendar solutions as everyone else. Of course, it could be that the BES/BIS simply isn't enabled on this particular device, or that it'll be added in a later version of the OS. Then again, we can't help but recall those Colt rumors which also hinted that RIM's in-house service would be incompatible with QNX.

Another juicy tidbit: a second screen shot after the break reveals a green robot icon in the far left. So, even if its Android integration has been delayed, at least it hasn't been forgotten.
