 Camera aficionados, looks like it's time for the pre-PMA rumor mill to start churning. Our inaugural whisper this season comes care of a forum poster at d-spot.co.il, who according to Canon Rumors' tipster has been accurate in the past (at this point we've been unable to corroborate). Here's the deal: a Canon 60D and Canon 550D / 600D (i.e. Rebel series). Both apparently feature a 15.1 megapixel APS-C sensor, articulating screens, and 720p video at 30 frames per second. The 60D, however, can also claim 1080p footage -- odd that the Rebel doesn't, since the current T1i has 1080p -- an electronic level, and a new battery and grip compared to its 50D successor. That one's apparently priced at around $1,190 and due out in May, while the other is $799 with no connection to a release date given. Make no mistake, between this and those waterproof Sony point-and-shoots, this is only the beginning.
