 At this point, is there anyone that doesn't suspect the next iPad will sport a camera? We've heard as much, more or less, and now here's more fodder for the suspicious out there: according to Digitimes, a Taiwan Stock Exchange filing from Largan Precision pegs itself as the "sole lens module supplier" for the impending second-generation iPad, with shipments (of the part or of the tablet, we're not sure) due out in the first quarter of 2011. It's worth noting that Largan is the camera parts supplier for the iPhone 4. We haven't been able to check out the filing ourselves yet, and for its part Largan's not saying a word, but we'll let you know what we dig up. You can now return to the part of your iPad 2 dream where it's rocking a glasses-free 3D ultra-retina display... on both sides... and it's transparent... and foldable... and not real.

Update: China Times is reporting that Largan got lucky with the exclusive order because Apple's other iPhone 4 camera supplier GSEO (Genius Electronic Optical) is already running at full capacity. Said publication also casually mentions an "end of Q1" launch for the iPad 2, which makes sense given that the original iPad was launched in April.
