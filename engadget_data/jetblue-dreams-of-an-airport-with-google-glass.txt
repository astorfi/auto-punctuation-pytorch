Google has been asking prospective Glass owners how they would use the eyewear if they had the chance. The team at JetBlue did more than write a hashtagged post and call it a day: the airline posted mockups of its vision for how Google Glass would work at the airport. Its concept would mostly save passengers from the labyrinthine mess they know today by popping up useful alerts and directions in the right locations, such as flight times at the gate or (our favorite) the locations of those seemingly invisible power outlets. Of course, JetBlue's images don't necessarily reflect the final product, if there even is one. It's not the likely gap between theory and practice that we're worried about, mind you -- we just have trouble believing in an airport where our flights are on time.
