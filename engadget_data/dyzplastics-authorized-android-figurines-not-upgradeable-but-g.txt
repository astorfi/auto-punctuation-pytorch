Good news, though: artist Andrew Bell has teamed up with Google to release a series of authorized Android robot figurines, starting with an initial run of 12 designs in blind boxes (collect 'em all!). The statuettes of the cute little guy stand 3 inches tall, feature articulating heads and arms, and will be available starting the 10th of this month -- just in time for that Devour, with any luck.
