Happy June. While you're sitting in front of your AC, why not take a minute to click on over to Amazon to check out a pretty impressive deal on SanDisk cards and drives? For today only (or, you know, while supplies last), the mega-retailer is offering some deep discounts on a number of products from the memory maker, including a 32GB MicroSDHC, which has been knocked down to $21.49 from an original $70 asking price, and a $100 64GB thumb drive, which is now $33. After today, they'll all be an, ahem, memory.
