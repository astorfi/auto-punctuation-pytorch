 Apple's announced that its updated 21.5-inch iMac range will be in stores and online on November 30th. The bigger 27-inch version will arrive later and start shipping next month. This year's refresh manages to cram a 1TB Fusion Drive, quad-core Core i5 processor and NVIDIA graphics into that oh-so-slim redesigned chassis. The 21.5-inch version is available with a 2.7GHz processor and NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M, priced at $1,299. However, bump the processor up to the 2.9GHz variant and NVIDIA's GeForce GT 650M and you can expect to pay $1,499. If you're willing to wait for the 27-incher, build options start with a 2.9GHz processor and a GeForce GTX 660M at $1,799, moving up to $1,999 for the top-of-the-range 3.2GHz Core i5 model with GeForce GTX 675MX graphics. A shame it missed those Black Friday sales, though.
