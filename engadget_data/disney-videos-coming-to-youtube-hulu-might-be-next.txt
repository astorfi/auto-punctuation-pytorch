 It's a bit surprising to see the Disney family of channels mixing it up with the riff raff like YouTube and, potentially, Hulu given so much time spent increasing its online video presence already (ABC.com, ESPN 360, etc.) but here we are. The deal with YouTube will put video clips (with shared advertising revenue from 15 second prerolls, overlays and banners) and all ESPN to embed its own player on YouTube's page, similar to the deal with CBS and its March Madness Silverlight powered page. About the possibility of a deal with Hulu, Disney's not talking, but if they do take an equity stake, hopefully it will bring the same priority for HD streaming (and boxee cooperation) that's been pushed on its own site.
