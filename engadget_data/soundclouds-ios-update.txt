SoundCloud's tune-sharing prowess continues to drawn the eye of musicians looking to distribute their tracks around the web and social channels. Today, the audio outfit's iOS app got a major redesign that makes access to tracks you fancy a breeze. In addition to the simplicity-focused aesthetic overhaul, the software now sports "one thumb" controls: tapping anywhere toggles play/pause, swiping skips tracks and sliding along the tune's waveform moves around the song and its corresponding artwork. There's also a new You tab that compiles tracks, artists and playlists that you've both liked and created from scratch in one place so that you can get at them quickly. Songs found on the Search page can be played from that section in addition to giving a quick follow to users of note. Since SoundCloud took a listening focus with this version of the app, the recording function is no longer built in, so you'll have to look elsewhere to capture on the go.
