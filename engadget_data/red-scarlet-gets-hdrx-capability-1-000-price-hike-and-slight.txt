No, not quite the halo-inducing HDR you're probably thinking of, this is better. Got that? Good, now for the lesson in TANSTAAFL: the upgrade is going to add about $1,000 to the Scarlet's eventual price tag, and additionally, there'll be a "slight delay" in the program. Just hang in there, and maybe grip your Mysterium X a little tighter tonight. No, not that tight, you don't want to break it.
