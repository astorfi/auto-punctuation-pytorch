 Zakang just dropped a little love on the MP3 market with their candy heart inspired Kiss MP3 Player. Available in128MB and 1GB models... as if you care, 'cause if this is the type of player that give you an optical interrupt, thenall you really need to know is yeah, those 23 crystals are cut by SWAROVSKI. Available in silver, white and of course,red with headphones integrated into a messy necklace strap. Just please, promise not to chuck it at thehelp in a fit of rage, mkay?[Via The MP3 Players]
