After recently announcing its forthcoming NAND memory cards, the company is back with word of 2Gb DDR3 DRAM modules that consume 30 percent less power than their 50nm counterparts, yet are also more cost-effective to manufacture. Operating at either 1.5 or 1.35 volts, the 30nm parts are set for mass production in the second half of 2010, so they won't be here quite as soon as we'd like, but at least we'll know what to put down in our next Holiday Gift Guide. Just imagine your laptop purring along with a paired set of ultra-efficient RAM sticks and one of those newfangled 25nm-based SSDs from Intel -- you could probably power it on the sheer strength of your geek lust alone.
