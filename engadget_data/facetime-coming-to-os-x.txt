Update: It's real! It appears to be an all-new app, instead of a version of iChat AV. You use your Mac's Address Book and make calls right from the app. If your chat counterpart is in portrait or landscape the display automatically adjusts, and you can also go to full screen. Better yet? It's out today, in a beta form. Find out more in our hands-on.
