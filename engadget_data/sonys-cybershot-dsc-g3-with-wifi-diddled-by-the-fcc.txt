From that we can tell you that Sony's about to release its new DSC-G3 Cyber-shot boasting 802.11b/g WiFi. As a followup to the WiFi-packing DSC-G1 announced more than a year ago, we're expecting the 3.5-inch LCD (now probably touchscreen like the T700) to carryover with storage twisted above 2GB and a sensor bump into the 10.1 megapixel range like Sony's new T500. Just a guess though, we hope to hear more at the Photokina show later this month.
