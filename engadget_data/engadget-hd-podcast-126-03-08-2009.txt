In this special edition of the Engadget HD Podcast we sit down for an all Media Center, all the time show with the new host of the Custom Integrator show, Derek R Flickinger -- or Dr. Flick as we like to call him. Derek isn't just a Media Center enthusiast, in fact he does this for a living and could quite possibly be the biggest Media Center fanboy ever -- loves himself some HDMI too. His new show is all about how to be a professional Media Center integrator and he's not focusing on easy installs. As you'll find out, his show covers the nitty gritty tips and tricks on how to design and install a reliable Media Center system in even the most exotic of homes. So yeah, you can learn more than a thing or two about Media Center.
