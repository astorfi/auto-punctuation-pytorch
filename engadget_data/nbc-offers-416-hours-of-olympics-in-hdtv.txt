 Hope you have 17.3 days offree time next month because that's how long 416 hours is. NBC announced that much high-defcoverage of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games from Torino, so we're already looking for a few spare terabytes of storage onour WMCE PC. If you just have to planyour calendar events in advance, you might as well jot "Busy" from February 10th to the 26th for the games.Stock on up spare remote batteries too since you'll be flipping between NBC, USA, MSNBC, and CNBC. Given that NBC iscurrently the only high-def channel in that lineup, you might be able to park your HDTV there for the live HD simulcasts in 5.1Surround.
