Android has made its share of appearances on laptops before, but today Lenovo announced that it's taking a crack at the idea with the A10, a 10.1-inch notebook with a fold-back touchscreen display. The 2.2-pound convertible, which you can use in laptop or tablet mode, comes with a 1.6GHz quad-core Rockchip RK3188 Cortex-A9 processor, a 1,366 x 768 display, Android 4.2, 2GB of RAM, 32GB internal storage with microSD expansion, VGA webcam, two USB 2.0 ports and one HDMI port. The whole package is 0.69 inch thick, and Lenovo claims it offers nine hours of battery life with continuous video playback. We haven't heard details on pricing or availability -- Lenovo tells us that it'll vary by region -- but earlier rumors pegged it at about $340.
