Apple's earnings are in, and as expected the company got a nice boost in sales over the holidays. We're talking 51 million iPhones sold -- an all-time quarterly record -- up from 47.8 million during the same quarter last year. It's unclear just how the iPhone sales break down between the iPhone 5c and 5s models, as Apple didn't offer those numbers. iPad sales reached a record quarterly high as well, at 26 million up from 22.9 million during the same year-ago quarter. Profit, meanwhile, comes in at $13.1 billion, showing no change year-over-year.


Mac sales are also up; with a jump to 4.8 million from 4.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Also record-setting was Cupertino's reported quarterly revenue of $57.6 billion. Apple's board of directors has also announced that shareholders will receive a $3.05 cash dividend per share early next month.


If Apple took a huge hit anywhere, though, it's with iPods. Year-over-year sales are down a whopping 52 percent, with revenue down 55 percent. Those figures suggest that the more expensive iPod models took the hardest hit. That ugly stat aside, there are plenty of positive numbers this time around. As always, we'll be listening in on Apple's earnings conference call, so stay tuned.
