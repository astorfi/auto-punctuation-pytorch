This 56-inch monstrosity is hailed as a Quad Full Autostereoscopic 3D HDTV, which means that it packs a slightly absurd (in a good way, of course) 3,840 x 2,160 resolution and can churn through data at an alarming rate. Additionally, Philips is promising that this one can produce up to 46 views at once, which should go a long way in making the third-dimension a lot more believable on TV. There's no definitive release date just yet, but it'll probably run upwards of $25,000 whenever it's ready for prime time.
