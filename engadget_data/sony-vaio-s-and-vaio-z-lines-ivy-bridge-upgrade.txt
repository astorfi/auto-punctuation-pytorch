Today, the company announced two larger models to round out that family, the VAIO E Series 15 and 17. Unlike the 14P, these notebooks don't come with Ivy Bridge power, but then their larger displays (15.5 inches and 17.3 inches, respectively) and an optional Blu-ray player on the larger model should be enough to tell you that these are entertainment-focused machines rather than next-gen powerhouses. Both the VAIO 15 and 17 run Intel Core i5-2450M CPUS and handle graphics with a AMD Radeon 7650M GPU and either 1GB or 2GB of VRAM depending on the model. Each also has a 750GB hard drive spinning at 5,400 RPM, plus a built-in webcam, USB 3.0 with a sleep-charge feature, HDMI, Bluetooth and WiFi. The main difference between the two is screen resolution: while the 15.5-incher sports a 1366 x 768 display, the 17.3-inch version has a more brilliant 1600 x 900 pixels. Pricing info is still MIA.

 While the VAIO E 15 and 17 didn't make the Ivy Bridge cut, Sony's business-focused VAIO S and VAIO Z lines will get the processor update. The VAIO S will be available in 13.5- and 15.5-inch flavors, each sporting backlit keyboards and a thin design featuring aluminium, magnesium or carbon fiber (depending on the model). While the 13.3-incher's display resolution is yet to be determined, the 15.5-inch model will ship with a 1080p IPS screen. And while we simply know that the VAIO S 13 will come with a choice of Core i5 or Core i7 processors, the VAIO S 15 runs a Intel Core i7-3612QM with 8GB of RAM and an NVIDIA GT640M LE GPU (along with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 chip). On the storage side, the 15 has a 1TB hard drive. Both the VAIO S 13 and 15 will have SSD options, and Sony will offer a separate sheet battery for up to 14 hours of longevity. Weight-wise, the outlet is short on specifics, though both models will tip in at less than 4.4 pounds.



 The 13.1-inch VAIO Z will have the same Core i7 CPU and 8GB of RAM as the VAIO S 15, but it switches out the 1TB hard drive for a 256GB SSD. Sony is positioning this model as its fastest notebook ever, and certain configurations will offer 3G/LTE connectivity. The optional Power Media Dock will add an optical drive an AMD Radeon HD 7670M graphics (the notebook itself is limited to Intel HD Graphics 4000). The Z is even lighter than the VAIO S, weighing less than 2.6 pounds and measuring less than 0.7 inches. As with the previously mentioned models, pricing and availability info has yet to be released.
