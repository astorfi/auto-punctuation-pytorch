That order was set to go into effect on April 19th, and it looks like HTC's two new stateside superphones are the first to feel Apple's the government's wrath. Here's HTC's take on the matter:

  The US availability of the HTC One X and HTC EVO 4G LTE has been delayed due to a standard U.S. Customs review of shipments that is required after an ITC exclusion order. We believe we are in compliance with the ruling and HTC is working closely with Customs to secure approval. The HTC One X and HTC EVO 4G LTE have been received enthusiastically by customers and we appreciate their patience as we work to get these products into their hands as soon as possible.

 We've reached out to HTC for clarification on the delay and to find out if this will affect the launch of the EVO 4G LTE, which is expected to hit the shelves this Friday, May 18th. Stay tuned for updates.

 Update: While HTC doesn't have any additional information to share at this time, we've also contacted AT&T and Sprint for comment. Let's just hope that the issue can be resolved in a timely manner.

 Update 2: Sprint and AT&T both declined to comment, but HTC provided the following information about the EVO 4G LTE:

  We can confirm that the product will not be in stores this Friday. Products for pre-order are on hold. We'll provide a ship date as soon as we're able. HTC will work with Sprint to maintain the promise for pre-order customers so they will be among the first to receive their HTC EVO 4G LTE units when available.
