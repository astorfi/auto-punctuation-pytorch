  Heads-up, Android users -- Netflix has just issued a revised build of its app on the aforementioned platform, and while the changelog here is but three points long, they seem to be somewhat significant. For starters, there's a polished user interface, particularly dealing with the volume control function, allowing users to more easily tweak levels as well as fast-forward / rewind. There are also a number of unspecified stability improvements and bug fixes, with some Motorola tablet owners reporting far smoother streaming. Updated it yourself? Let us know how it's going in comments below (and hit the source for a link to Google Play).
