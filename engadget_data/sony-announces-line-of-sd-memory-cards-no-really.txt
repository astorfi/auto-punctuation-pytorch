Those will come in the form of both SD and mircoSD cards, the former of which run the gamut from 2GB to 32GB (all Class 4), while the latter will be available in 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB capacities. Is this the beginning of the end for Memory Stick? Not according to Sony, which assures us that the SD cards merely "complement" its existing Memory Stick line, and strengthen its position as a "full line media supplier." The folks at Sony don't even seem to have been able to bring themselves to show some pictures of the actual cards just yet, but you'll be able to see them for yourself when they roll out later this month, at prices ranging from $14.99 to $159.99.
