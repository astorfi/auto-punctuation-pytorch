We first met Acer's Aspire S7 at Computex in 2012, and since then it's gone through a major overhaul to become the Aspire S7-392 -- a Haswell-equipped Ultrabook that's now available in the US. You can choose between two models up for sale at retail outlets and on Acer's online store, with the cheaper $1,450 package toting a 1.6GHz Core i5 processor and a 128GB SSD. The $1,700 variant comes with a more powerful 1.8GHz Core i7 processor and double the storage space, but their other specs are identical. Both Windows 8 Ultrabooks boast a 13.3-inch 1,920 x 1,080 touchscreen display, an HD webcam, an 8GB of DDR3 RAM, and a bigger battery that promises up to 7 hours of power. It's too bad the European version's 2,560 x 1,440 screen didn't make it stateside, but at least the US incarnations are a bit easier on the wallet.


Update: We've revised the post to reflect that the higher-end model comes with a Core i7 processor, and not a Core i5.
