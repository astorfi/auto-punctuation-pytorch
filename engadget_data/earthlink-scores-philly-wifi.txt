Looks like before the big G's going to get their chance at blanketing San Francisco's 2.4GHz airspace with
free WiFi, EarthLink will get theirs having finally
bagged the PhillyFi proposal that began over a year
ago. (Man, has it really been that long?) EarthLink's apparently buying the network out of pocket—which is good news
for John and Jane Q. Taxpayer—and they'll attempt to monetize it by reselling access to other ISPs, business, and
hotspot operators. And who knows
how else?
