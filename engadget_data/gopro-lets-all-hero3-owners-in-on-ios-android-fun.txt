 If you splurged for the $400 GoPro Hero3 Black Edition, you'll be glad to know that it'll finally work with the Android and iOS GoPro apps, thanks to a new update. The Silver and White Edition Hero3 models will now work with Android as well, which didn't support any flavors of that camera when it first came out. You'll want to update the firmware in all three models of the talented shooter before trying to use the app, according to a tweet from the company, which will let you in on all the live preview and remote control goodies we saw earlier. Check the source to see how to grab everything.
