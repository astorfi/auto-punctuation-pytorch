If you're not familiar with Kevin Thau, you ought to be: he worked on many of Twitter's early mobile efforts, helped integrate it into major platforms and headed up the Twitter #Music app. That's what makes his newly confirmed move to Twitter co-founder Biz Stone's new firm, Jelly, so interesting. While little is known about Jelly beyond its plan for a decentralized service, Thau will be heading up numerous aspects of business operations at the company while it builds "world class mobile products." We'll have to wait awhile before we see his influence, but his presence hints that Jelly is more than just a casual project.
