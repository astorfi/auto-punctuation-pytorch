As we learned when it debuted, DRM requirements are making live TV streaming an Android 4.0-only (devices that have been rooted however, are not invited) affair, but at least it's here. Subscribers can snag TWC TV 2.0 from Google Play at the link below, although they are encouraged to try uninstalling if they experience any glitches after upgrading. There's a blog post linked below with more details, but we're pretty sure a TV screen you can take to the can with you explains itself.
