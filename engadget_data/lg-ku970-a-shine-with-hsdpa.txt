If you can look past the rather dazzling shell of the KE970 and take a glance at the spec sheet, you'll find that it lacks any semblance of 3G-ness, but not to fret: it looks like LG is acknowledging that fatal flaw and correcting it with the KU970. Czech site iDNES.cz is reporting that the phone's formula will stay basically untouched from its predecessor; improvements will be mostly in the guts, with an HSDPA radio, 512MB of onboard storage, and a front-facing cam for video calling. Seems believable enough, considering that the Shine's look is fresh and a model matching the KU970's description just hit the FCC. Any love for the US 3G bands here, LG?[Via Unwired View]Read - iDNES.czRead - FCC documents
