 
Considering that we just gave away 25 pairs of tickets to a 3D screening, we're expecting some serious responses to this one. With 3D doing its best to come storming back into relevancy, we've seen studio after studio commit to pumping out flicks in 3D. All the while, cinemas have been transitioning just as quickly, giving viewers the option to catch new films in 3D so long as they're kosher with rockin' the shades. So, have you checked out a theater screening in 3D? How was it? Do you plan to go again? Avoid 3D at all costs?
