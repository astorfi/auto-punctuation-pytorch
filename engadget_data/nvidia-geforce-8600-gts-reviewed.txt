 NVIDIA's GeForce 8600 GTS graphics card has been attracting a fair bit of interest with its relatively low price tag and promised performance gains, but we're guessing most of you aren't just going to go on NVIDIA's word to make your purchase decision. Helping out in that respect, the folks at PC Perspective have put the card through the usual battery of tests to see just how well it stacks up. While they certainly welcomed the $199-229 price tag, they were somewhat let down by the card's performance, with it getting out-performed in some cases by ATI's comparatively priced X1950 Pro. That said, the 8600 GTS does still have the edge when it comes to DirectX 10 support, which they say should be enough to at least garner it some consideration from budget-minded gamers.
