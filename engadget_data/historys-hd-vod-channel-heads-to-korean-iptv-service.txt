 History (it recently dropped such innocuous terms like The and Channel to describe a lineup of Ax Men and Crime 360) has linked up with Korea Telecom to distribute its network via video on demand. Parent A&E Television is completely committed to HD production for its shows, and plans to continue expanding the channel -- already on the air in the U.K., Scandinavia and Central Europe -- to Asia and Latin America over the next year. Expect more syndication-friendly content on the way, as A&E sees a big future for HD & VOD distribution.
