The cats over at DBSTalk have had the privilege of toying with it, and they even assembled a lovely PDF with setup instructions and images of the show search, recording and show cards functionality. For iPhone lovers with DirecTV, there's absolutely no excuse to not check this out. Sadly, we're no closer to figuring out when it'll be available, but we're just relieved to know it'll be here someday.
