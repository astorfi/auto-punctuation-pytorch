Looks like Sony took a page out of the slightly more practical book of
Orb (or perhaps slightly more accurately, the
Slingbox) with their new
Locationfree LF-PK1 deviceâ€”they dropped that
literal location free wireless TV unit in favor of the straight concept of "location free TV." Not surprising, really,
given their release of Locationfree as
software for your PC, but it's nice to know the price
overhead of that TV will no longer stop users from being able to just add a box for intelligently-streaming
place-shifted content delivery. Should run you about $300 US in October if you're living in Japan.
