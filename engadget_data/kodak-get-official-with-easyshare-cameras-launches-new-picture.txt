We mean really, really, super official with pricing and dates as opposed to the information gleaned off their site courtesy of Google's cache. The $300 V1253, $250 V1233, and $300 Z812 IS are all available now. They're also launching their $100 Easyshare HDTV dock with remote control for a quick and dirty TV hookup along with a 10-inch SV1011 digital picture frame with 800 x 480 resolution for $200. See, you don't know everything.
