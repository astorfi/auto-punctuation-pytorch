Following Samsung's slashing of the BD-P1400, Sony has come around and taken the BDP-S300 from $600 down to $499 down to $299.99, which is where it currently sits. The unit is priced as such at Best Buy and Circuit City, and judging by the whispers we've heard, we have all ideas this isn't a temporary / store specific sale.[Thanks, Kyran R.]Read - BDP-S300 at Best BuyRead - BDP-S300 at Circuit City
