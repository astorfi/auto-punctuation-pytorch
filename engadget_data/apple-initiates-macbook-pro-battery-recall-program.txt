Looks like after the "silent" MacBook Pro battery recall has officially turned into a full blown 15-inch MacBook Pro Battery Exchange Program. So, got a MacBook Pro from between February through May of this year? Check your battery out, because if you've got a model A1175 cell with a 12-digit serial number that ends in U7SA, U7SB or U7SC, then sign up, get that replacement shipped out, and send your old one back. Because who knows what might happen if you don't, right? Just kidding, we wouldn't want to alarm anyone, but seriously, check it out, ok? Companies don't issue battery recalls for their damn health.
