 At a San Francisco pressbriefing and product demonstration that hopefully went better than its disastrous Koreancounterpart last month, executives from Samsung, Microsoft, and Intel jointly announced pricing and availabilitydetails for the official U.S. release of the Q1 UMPC. Starting on May 7th, early-adopters will be able to pick up aQ1 -- along with all the high-profit-margin accessories -- at Best Buy's e-tail location for $1,100, with an in-storerollout planned for "later this summer." As you're probably already aware, the Q1, along with models from Asus, Founder, and TabletKiosk, is among the first generation of so-called UltraMobile PCs designed to enhance your on-the-go lifestyle, and sports a 7-inch touchscreen, Celeron M ULV processor, 40GBhard drive, 512MB RAM, 802.11b/g, and Bluetooth 2.0.
