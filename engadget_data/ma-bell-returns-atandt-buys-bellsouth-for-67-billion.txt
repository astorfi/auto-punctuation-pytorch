(Before we get started, we mightrecommend you hit up The EngadgetGuide to AT&T Wireless/Cingular/SBC/AT&T merger mania we wrote last year.) So AT&T (formerly SBC, formerly AT&T), isbuying one of the last two un-amalgamated missing links in the Ma Bell puzzle, BellSouth (the other being Qwest). Asyou may recall, BellSouth, one of the original 7 baby bells,also owns 40% of Cingular (complementing the 60% once owned by SBC,which is now called AT&T). Thus this sale would effectively transfer ownership of the nation's largest wirelesscarrier to AT&T. Now, to give this a little context: the only other baby bells left outside the AT&T umbrellain one form or another is Verizon (formerly Bell Atlantic, which merged with Nynex and GTE) and Qwest (which absorbedUS West), neither of which will likely be comin' home to mama. So there you have it, if the SEC approves AT&T'spurchase of BellSouth, we once again more or less return to the AT&T of 1984, 'cept now with a little morecompetition in the backbone and wireless services space. See, with a little of our help you'll know for whom the belltolls; the bell tolls for Ma.P.S. -Upon closer inspection of their press release, it might seem as thoughthey'll be bringing Cingular under the AT&T brand after all, stating that the merger will "strengthen Cingularthrough unified ownership and a single brand," and that "simplifying the ownership structure will lead to...asingle AT&T brand." Yes, this even though it'd be flying in the face of AT&T's previous statements aboutkeeping Cingular, well, Cingular. Whereas they seem pretty clear about this, we have a feeling all will be revealedtomorrow morning at their webcast press conference at 10:00AM EST.
