The most recent update on the Android market adds a Honeycomb version with remote control and video on-demand browsing seen above (only officially certified for the Xoom, but it should work on others as well) -- but not Play Now streaming, yet -- and also should fix the app on phones running Gingerbread. iOS users haven't been completely left out, as a minor bump has been issued that should fix a few technical issues on those platforms too. The free apps are available at the source links below, choose your preferred flavor and download away.
