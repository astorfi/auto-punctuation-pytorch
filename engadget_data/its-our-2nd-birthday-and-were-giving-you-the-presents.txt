Today we're giving away a T-Mobile MDA (aka HTC Wizard). Winning this fine instrument is easy: just tell us oneof your favorite Engadget posts of the past year. It can be anything (except this post): a regular post, an interview, ahow-to, a review, or whatever, just post a comment below with a link to it along with a couple of lines about why it'syour fave and we'll pick a winner at random. Three runners-up will each win an Engadget t-shirt.A couple ofthings: 

You can only enter each day's contest once. If you post more than once you'll beautomatically disqualified and barred from all future giveaways. (Yes, we're checking thoroughly to ensurefairness.)
You can only win once. (If you win and go for a second prize, you'll beautomatically disqualified and barred, etc.)
Contests are open to anyone, anywhere.Unless you work for Engadget or Weblogs, Inc.

We'll keep comments open for about 24 hours, best of luck toeveryone and thanks for all of your support for these past two years!Yesterday's winner: Oluwaseun!Congratulations, Oluwaseun!
