 What good is a homesecurity system if you can't check up on your home while you're out? Hawking Technologies has you covered wherever youare with its HomeRemote system, which lets you monitor a range of home security devices over the internet. HomeRemoteworks with motion detectors and window/door sensors, which can connect to a home network over WiFi or Ethernet, and cannotify a homeowner in realtime via e-mail, SMS and a web-based interface whenever it detects an intrusion. TheHomeRemote can also monitor your utilities and trigger lighting and alarms. Of course, if you're halfway around theworld while thieves are rifling through your possessions, you're still going to have to notify local authorities. Butat least you'll know immediately when your TV and stereo are being carted off.[Read]
