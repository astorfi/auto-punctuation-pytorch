The folks in Espoo have confirmed that the footage was indeed captured using a different camera. "Of course, hindsight is 20 / 20, but we should have posted a disclaimer stating this was a representation of OIS only," the company's Heidi Lemmetyinen penned on the Nokia Conversations blog. "This was not shot with a Lumia 920. At least, not yet. We apologize for the confusion we created." You can catch the offending video and a shorter, but accurate clip comparing a prototype of the PureView handset with a competing device after the break.
