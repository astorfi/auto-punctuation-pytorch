 We know, we just told you less than 48 hours ago that the dual screen Toshiba Libretto W100 was finally on sale and after $1,100 of your hard earned cash, but it looks like those that didn't move quick enough are out of luck. Both Toshiba and Amazon list the Windows 7-running Libretto W100 as out of stock at the moment. Now, of course, Tosh has always said the W100 was going to be available on a limited basis so there's no telling how many of these were actually sold, but it certainly seems impressive for a very niche gadget. We've reached out to Toshiba to ask if they plan on refreshing the depleted stock and for a bit of information on how many they had boxed up to begin with -- stay tuned, we'll let you know what we hear. 

Update: If you're still lusting after one of these bad boys there's still some available through Conics.com and some Japanese retailers.
