You'll already be familiar with the mooted specs -- including 720p HD video recording, WVGA screen resolution, and an 8 megapixel imager -- so what else does this handset tour reveal? Well, the family resemblance to HTC's other 4.3-inchers is inevitably apparent to see, with the Desire HD sticking its headphone port at the bottom just like the HD2, and employing a dual LED flash Ã  la the EVO 4G. Beyond that, it looks like yet another well rounded device from the prolific Taiwanese phone maker -- hurry past the break to see it for yourself.
