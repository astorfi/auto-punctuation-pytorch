They alsothrew out a couple of slightly less impressive but slightly more affordable displays, the ¥600,000 ($5100 US)50-inch PDP-507HX, and ¥480,000 ($4100 US) 42-inch PDP-427HX. They feature 1,365 x 768 and 1,024 x 768 panelsrespectively, and dual digital tuners, dual HDMI, three composite, VGA, and Ethernet (among other, more Japaneseinputs). No word when or if they'll jump the pond, or how much tariffs will bloat up that price, but we know you'rewaiting for the bighundie-three, ain'tcha?[Via Impress]
