 Companies that developinflight entertainment (IFE) systems for airlines have been in discussions with Apple about integrating the iPod andiTunes into IFE systems, according to several of the companies. Proposed applications include seatback-based iPod dockswith USB and charging ports, allowing passengers to charge song and video purchases to frequent-flyer miles, and addingother ecommerce applications. "Our interests are wider – not just Apple, but enabling any e-commerce on theaircraft. Music is one thing in that category we are working on," said an exec with Panasonic Avionics. However,numerous obstacles stand in the way of inflight downloads, including changing Apple's licensing, so that songsdownloaded directly to an iPod in the air could later be copied back to a customer's hard drive, and the issue oflicensing and payment while a plane is in international airspace. Then, there's the issue of getting Apple toparticipate in the first place. When asked for a comment by editors at  Flight International, the company issuedwhat has to be one of our favorite "no comment" lines, especially for a technology company: "Apple nevertalks about the future." We'll keep that in mind.
