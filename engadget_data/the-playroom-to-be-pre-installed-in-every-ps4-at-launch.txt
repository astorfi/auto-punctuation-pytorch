We just got word that Sony's tech demo, The Playroom, will be pre-installed on every PS4 at launch. It's essentially a bundle of demonstrations designed to show off the DualShock 4, the PS4 Eye and of course the console itself. For example, there's an air hockey game that gives you a feel of the controls, an interactive AR Bots demo that lets you play with tiny little robots using the DualShock's touchpad and accelerometer, plus a scenario where you can flick away those same bots using your hands in front of the Eye. If you have a Sony Xperia device lying around, you can also use the demo to see how it'll work with the next-gen console. For a more thorough walkthrough on The Playroom, have a peek at our hands-on of the PS4 controller and camera right here.
