 If you spend any amount of time in front of a computer, you're already sold on the idea of a second monitor -- luckily, there are an ever-increasing number of options out there for you. Looking to give DisplayLink a run for its money, Accell Cables is throwin' down with their UltraVideo USB 2.0 to VGA Adapter. This guy is bus powered, rocks up to UXGA (1600 x 1200) resolution, and the display drivers (available for PC and Mac) support up to four adapters. Listed for $89.99, it will be making the rounds at CES this week.[Via About Projectors]
