 Sprint announced its quarterly (and annual) results today, with overall revenues totaling $9 billion, up from the preceding quarter. Its wireless services formed $7 billion of that, but Hurricane Sandy was responsible for a $45 million hit to its bottom line. Sprint added that it's been able to sell 2.2 million iPhones, while its LTE network, launched last July, now handles more than 3 million connections. The network picked up 401,000 new post-paid subscribers in the process, but according to the figures, shedded 1 million existing ones from the Nextel part of the business. Its future owner, Softbank, was briefly mentioned in passing -- the Now Network received a $3.1 billion bond from the Japanese phone network for the merger.
