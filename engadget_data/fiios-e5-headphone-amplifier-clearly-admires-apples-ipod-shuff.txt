The device reportedly puts out 150mW at 16-ohms with a rate distortion of <0.009% at 10mW. The rechargeable battery (which gets juiced via USB) is said to be good for around 20 hours of use, and while it's difficult to say exactly how awesome this thing is, the $20 price tag sure is tempting.[Via SlashGear]
