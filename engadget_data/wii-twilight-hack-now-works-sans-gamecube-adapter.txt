Seems like there aren't any more excuses to keep out of the game now that you can do the hack with a regular SD card in the Wii's regular SD card slot -- no more GameCube memory adapters required. No fancy boot sector surgery is required either, you just drop a .elf file onto your memory card and you're ready to go. Check out the video after the break if you still need more convincing.Update: Now with actual video goodness after the break.[Via Wii Fanboy]
