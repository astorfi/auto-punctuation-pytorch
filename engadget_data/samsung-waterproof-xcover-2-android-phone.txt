The Galaxy Xcover 2 is its new ruggedized smartphone, with GPS and GLONASS pitching it directly at the adventurers among us. It's water resistant up to a depth of one meter and can hold its breath for 30 minutes, while a 4-inch WVGA display will beam out Android 4.1. Expect to see the same Motion UI features spotted on other Samsung devices recently, including the ability to overturn and mute incoming calls. It'll be powered by an as-yet unmentioned 1GHz dual-core processor, while a 5-megapixel camera will peer out the back. There's also a physical camera button to ensure you don't miss any of your underwater adventures.

 Samsung mentions that the Xcover 2 will also pack a Cardio trainer Pro workout app, although there doesn't appear to be any hardware additions to augment the fitness program -- aside from a strap holder. No word yet on where the phone is expected to land, nor how much the jungle-ready slab might set you back, but we'll be sure to drop it on the ground in Barcelona in a few weeks time.
