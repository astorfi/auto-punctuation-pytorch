The specs aren't bad neither, with a 6.5-inch touchscreen, 802.11b/g WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0, onboard GPS, DVB-T tuner and webcam. In fact, if this thing manages to weigh less than thirty pounds and cost less than twenty grand we're pretty sure Medion has got themselves a winner -- or should at least be able to give Sony's UX and Averatec's forthcoming AHI a bit of competition.
