 
 Acer's quad-core tablet effort is now available to buy, direct from the manufacturer itself. Alongside NVIDIA's Tegra 3 processor, the Iconia A700 packs a substantial 1920 x 1200 resolution display, while 5.1-channel surround sound is packed in to complement a big screen-friendly HDMI port. The 32GB version rings up at $450, but if it's any consolation, that does include free overnight shipping. You can hand over your order (and your cash) at the Acer link below.
