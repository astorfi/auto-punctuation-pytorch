Intellectual children (dweebs) have long suffered the humiliation of being chosen last for such illustrious sports
as Dodgeball and Piggy Move Up. Up to now, parents could only implant a
BrainGate in hopes of supplanting hand-eye coordination
with thought-control (be the ball Danny, be the ball). But now, NeuroSky (a fab(u)less startup of US chip designers and
Russian neuroscientists chillin' in NorCal) claims a "breakthrough" in non-invasive neural sensors allowing low-cost,
dry (no contact gels) neural mapping solutions to be applied to those things you'd most like to mind control
(spouse, voters, TV, game console, cellphone). Initially, they will focus on three
applications: sleep/drowsiness detectors for the automotive and industrial markets; therapeutic solutions for attention
deficit disorder (ADD) problems; and gaming consoles. They've already inked a deal with China Mobile and their 100
million cellphone subscribers. Hmm, China embracing thought-control technology - who woulda guessed it?
