The punches started flying on the issues of networking, screen beauty, and application support, where the Q1 stunned the Newton with its high-resolution LCD and Windows-based OS. When it came to usability and synchronization, the two were deemed evenly matched, rendering these two categories a draw. The Newton stole the glory on design, size, and reliability, as CNET UK editors were quite annoyed at the "crashability" of the Q1,and crowned the Newton's OS champion of stability. Although there wasn't a unanimous decision made based on these brawls alone, the Newton pulled out all the stops by landing a mean 30 hours of battery life, while the Q1 waved the white flag at 2.5 hours. To add insult to injury, the Samsung costs well over $1,000 (if you can manage to find one), while the Newton can be acquired for substantially less on the used market. While we realize it may be hard to comprehend that a portable from nearly 10 years ago could best a UMPC, there's no denying that even the most ingenious handheld in the world won't do you much good after the battery craps out, and maybe these results are just the Apple needs needs to make good on all these tablet patents, right Steve?[Via Slashdot]
