Take the following specs with a pinch of salt, but the device is believed to have a 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8255 CPU and comes with an eight megapixel camera and a 3.97-inch WVGA IPS screen. So far, so normal -- what's not normal is the ad campaign for the phone, in which a bemused Leonardo DiCaprio stares glumly out of a moving train as a woman writes "find me" in condensation on a perfectly clean window. That's right after the break and you won't have to look too hard to find press shots of the phone itself either. They're down there in the gallery.
