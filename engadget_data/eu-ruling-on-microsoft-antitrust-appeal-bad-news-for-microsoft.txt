As such, the $688 million fine imposed in 2004 stands and Microsoft must pay 80% of the Commission's legal costs as additional insult. Microsoft did succeed at abolishing the independent monitoring trustee established to supervise Microsoft's behavior. Microsoft can still appeal to the highest court in Europe so this isn't over by any stretch of the imagination.
