We mentioned iRobot's PackBot battlefield robot the
other day, but we hadn't known that they were working on a version called the Bloodhound, a semi-autonomous robot
designed to dispense medical assistance to wounded soldiers during battle. Lest you think that the Bloodhound will be
roving about on its own looking for soldiers to inject epinephrine into and wrap bandages around, they're actually
going to be dispatched to wounded soldiers via GPS and then remotely controlled via medics (who could be anywhere in
the world) to apply treatment.Â
