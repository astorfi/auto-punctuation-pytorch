 
Can wait to check out the new and improved Android Market slated for inclusion in the upcoming Android 1.6 release? Then it looks like you won't have to wait for the official release after all. You will, however, need a rooted Android device, and the latest, less-than-official Cyanogen ROM. Among other updates and fixes, it includes what appears to be the very same Android Market revision that's headlining Android 1.6 (a.k.a. Donut), and includes such enhancements as a bright new look, screenshots of apps, and a number of new browsing options to help you find what you're looking for. All rooted and ready to go? Then hit up the link below to get started.
