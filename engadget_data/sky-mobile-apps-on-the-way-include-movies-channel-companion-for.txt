Telling Tech-Radar the app is still due "in the coming months", Sky has already indicated in a recent earnings report that it has more than 1.6 million viewers of its aggregated mobile VOD on iOS. Speaking of, iOS users will be getting a new app designed to work alongside the Sky Movies channel. It can show what movies are on the channel at the moment, schedule recordings, display info on movies in theaters, and even launch streaming flicks in the Sky Go app when it hits iTunes next week. The screenshot above gives a hint of what it will look like and expect more like it -- the company plans more individualized companion apps that work together, as opposed to the all-in-one approach of a DirecTV or TiVo.
