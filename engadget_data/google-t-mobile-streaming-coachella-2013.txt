 Dig hazy music festivals, but tickets to Coachella are too expensive? Don't fret, Google and T-Mobile may have the next best thing. For the third consecutive year the folks from Mountain View will air a free live stream of the show on YouTube. The remote festivities run from April 12th - 14th, giving you and your posse plenty of time to designate a device worthy of this broadcast. While some equipment may work better than others, you and your besties shouldn't have too much trouble finding a YouTube-friendly doodad that's up to the task.
