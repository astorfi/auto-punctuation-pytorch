The portable conglomerate is a "cross between a data acquisition system, diagnostic tool, automotive gauge display, and a handheld computer," and is targeting automotive gurus who crave performance monitoring, data charts, and customized gauges / diagnostic meters. With a bit of 1337 programming skills, the device can display nearly anything you desire, and can double as a navigation monitor, CarPC display, or snazzy tachometer to boot. It boasts a 4-inch QWVGA touchscreen, adjustable backlight, 200MHz ARM processor, 64MB of internal RAM, MMC / SD card slots, USB 2.0 connectivity, a serial port, and support for optional Bluetooth / WiFi add-ons. It also plays nice with OBDII, EGT, O2, and a plethora of other vehicle sensors. If this hodgepodge has you in a tizzy, but the gearhead in you longs for "one more toy," be sure to peep the video of DrewTech's multi-purpose device in action to determine if its worth the $595 pricetag.
