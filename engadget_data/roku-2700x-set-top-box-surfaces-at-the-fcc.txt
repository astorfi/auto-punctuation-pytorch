The Roku 3 might not be the only Roku set-top box arriving this year: an unannounced 2700X has just passed through the FCC for approval. The filing shows a streaming hub that's curvy like the Roku 3, but is limited to single-band, 2.4GHz 802.11n WiFi. Combine this spec with the low model number (the Roku 3 is the 4200X) and it's not hard to figure out what we're looking at -- this is an entry-level device based on Roku's newer design language. When the company's confidentiality request to the FCC will expire in less than 90 days, we'd expect the 2700X to launch relatively soon. Check out a second image of the hardware after the break.
