We earlier had a tip from OfficeMax stating July 17th and, while this morning's info pointed to a June 22nd release, Amazon seems pretty confident that the former date is correct. Go to Amazon.com, search for "hp touchpad" and enjoy the little advertisement that appears saying "HP will release the sleek and sophisticated webOS-empowered TouchPad on July 17, 2011." That's about as concrete as you can get, meaning you have just over a month to save up.
