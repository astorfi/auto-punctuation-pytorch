Their 31-inch and 14-inch OLEDs easily best Sony's 27-inch prototype and 11-inch production sets. Both of the Sammys feature the same amazing contrast which makes us swoon over OLEDs while offering 1080p video in a crazy thin panel. Samsung has no plans to take these production. Then again, with Sony's XEL-1 already out there, we all know how Samsung hates to be second-best.
