We really wish wecould say it did PlaysForSure (or was intended to at some point), or who was going to get the phone first in the USbetween Sprint and Verizon -- but we're serious when we say it's a RAZR through and through, and besides the color orthe MP3 audio pumping out the back, you'd probably never know it wasn't any other V3c.
