Samsung doesn't have a formal name for it just yet, but this concept device is expected to launch sometime this summer. It's basically a first-party Bluetooth controller with a full complement of face buttons, dual analog sticks, a D-pad and even shoulder buttons on the back. It's powered by dual AAA batteries and connects wirelessly, the phone held in place by an expanding clamp up top that looks plenty big enough to support a Note II (we tried, it fit fine) and maybe even something like the Note 8.0!

 Again, no pricing or details at this point, but it certainly felt nicer than your average Bluetooth controller. And, hopefully, that it's made by Samsung means we'll see widespread support.
