 Ahh, so that's what happened to the Q3 launch of Samsung's i607, eh Cingular? With FCC approval now out of the way let's hope the long wait is nearly over for this quad-band GSM and dual-band UMTS/HSDPA Smartphone. As you might recall, the i607 Blackjack runs Windows Mobile Smartphone up on that QVGA display and features a 1.3 megapixel camera around back, Bluetooth, microSD slot for expansion, and a slim, albeit rather unappealing 1/2-inch thick shell. So what's keeping ya Cingular, go ahead and launch already... pretty please, with sugar. [Via PhoneArena]
