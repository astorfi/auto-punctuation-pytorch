As promised earlier, it'll set you back a fairly reasonable $179, which'll get you a 533MHz ARM9 processor-based handheld that's capable of running a handful of official games and a whole boatload of unofficial games, not to mention some applications from the app store that's slated for launch this summer. All set to add one more handheld to your collection? Then hit up the link below to get your order in.[Thanks, Conrad]
