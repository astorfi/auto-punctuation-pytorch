Deemed the "smallest earphones on the market," these diminutive buds boast dual micro armatures, the bass-enhancing AirBooster, silicon sleeves in a variety of sizes, and a flexible cable setup to boot. Additionally, the q-JAYS arrive with a white leather case, two extension cords, a flight / stereo adapter, and seven total pairs of sleeves. The price? Just $180 -- and those in the UK can look forward to a probable release in the not-too-distant future. Click on for a couple closeups.[Thanks, Adam]
