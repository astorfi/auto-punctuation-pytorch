 Welcome back for another episode of Stupid Gadget Criminals. For today's edition, we take you to France, where in the village of Mussidan in the southwestern part of the country, a malefactor stole a television along with a set of hunting rifles, according to local police. So where does the stupidity come in? Well, messieurs et mesdames, it appears that this ruffian didn't make it back to his evil lair with the remote control -- and upon so realizing, returned to the scene of the crime to retrieve the last of the loot. The neighbors caught him doing the dastardly deed, and he was turned over to the proper authorities. So remember kids, you can always pick up a replacement remote at your local Best Buy, or in his case, Fnac.
