Three videos of what appears to be Acer's 10-inch Android tablet have popped up on YouTube, and not only is the slate powered on, but the footage provides a pretty clear look at some of Acer's custom Android apps. The entire UI looks like it's still in a beta stage and the video itself looks like it is some sort of internal test demo -- don't forget Acer is planning to ship these with Honeycomb in April -- but the company seems to be messing around with gyroscope-based page turns and some unique zoom gestures within the photo / e-reader application. We're assuming the tablet is running Froyo as there's a quick peek at the homescreen and app drawer in the first video, but other than that we're really at a loss for details here. Hit the break for the trio of videos and to see it all for yourself. Oh, and Acer, if you send us one, we promise to go easier on the screen (see 0:12 of video three) than this lady... just sayin'!
