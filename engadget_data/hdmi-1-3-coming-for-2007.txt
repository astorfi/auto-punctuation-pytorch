       Unless you've got a PlayStation 3, we can probably peg the number of HDMI 1.3-equipped devices in your home right now at exactly zero. However, if you've been waiting for Deep Color displays and receivers that support all next generation audio codecs like DTS-HD Master, Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Digital Plus there are plenty of devices on their way in 2007. According to EETimes online, Sony and Mitsubishi will be debuting new TVs (like Mitsu's Laser rear projecting HDTV) that take advantage of the wider color gamut afforded by HDMI 1.3. Besides xvYCC, 32-bit Deep Color support will increase color accuracy on upcoming TVs. Denon might not be ready to jump into the HD DVD / Blu-ray battle, but it's got several 1080p and HDMI 1.3-compatible receivers on the way including advanced audio and video processing capabilities. We should see one more HDMI 1.3 device this year when Toshiba releases the HD-XA2 HD DVD player, but the real treats will be waiting at CES 2007.[Thanks, Brian]Read - HDMI 1.3: Better DTV images, sound in 2007Read - Denon's HDMI 1.3 Receivers "scheduled for mid-year introduction"Read - Why today's best HDTVs aren't worth buying
