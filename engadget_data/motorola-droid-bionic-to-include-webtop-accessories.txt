Judging by the screenshot grabbed by Droid Life, we might have a winner as the add-ons look to be interchangeable, possibly a first step towards CEO Sanjay Jha's promised improvements. The product page also says the accessories will be "affordable" for those "curious about the Webtop application" -- count us in.
