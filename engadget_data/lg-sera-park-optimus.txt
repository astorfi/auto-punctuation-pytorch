 LG's Sera Park has been talking about her latest handset, the Optimus G, and how it carries the DNA of its Chocolate and Prada phones from way back when. One of the aims was to build a display that was seamless with the rest of its unibody construction, so that it "floats in your hand," as you use it. It also banished all front-side decoration, but compensated by adding a crystal reflection method to bling up the back. Of course, we wouldn't be surprised if the clip was timed to appear as a timely reminder to those sensitive about design that LG certainly can't be accused of following a trend. The company isn't letting people embed the video, so if you'd like to watch her wax lyrical about rectangles, you'll have to head on down to the source link.

"Optimus G has many of the elements that we incorporated in the past in phones such as Chocolate, Prada and L-Series. For example, the front face of Optimus G is completely black with lines that are nearly invisible when the phone is off, an effect similar to the original LG Prada."

   The Crystal Reflection process used for the first time on the back of LG's new Optimus G smartphone was developed and patented over a period of 15 months. Crystal Reflection gives the Optimus G's back cover the ability to display different patterns depending on the viewing angle and lighting. The intricate polarized 3D pattern, which sparkles just under the surface, looks almost jewel-like. Laser cutting adds to the clean finish, as do the metallic highlights.
