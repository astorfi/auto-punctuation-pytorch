Pixel Qi's tech seems more advanced, with 5X power savings with the backlight off, versus CPT's 2X, but if CPT can get this 10.1-inch, 1366 x 768 panel onto the market soon for a good price, we think they could find some takers. Check out a hands-on video after the break. Interestingly, Netbook News says text is a bit less clear when the backlight is off, so perhaps Pixel Qi doesn't have so much to worry about... though of course they'd have a lot less to worry about if one of the devices using their tech started shipping!
