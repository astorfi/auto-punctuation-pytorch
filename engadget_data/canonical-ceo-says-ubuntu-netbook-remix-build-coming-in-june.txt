 You never really know what all will emerge from a simple interview, and thanks to a recent sit-down with Canonical chief executive Mark Shuttleworth, we now know that a build of Ubuntu tailored for ultraportables (or subnotes, as it were) is just around the bend. According to Mr. Shuttleworth, the aforesaid software will be announced "in the first week of June," and it'll be called the Netbook Remix. He also noted that the outfit is currently "working with Intel, which produces chips custom-made for this sector." Sadly, it seems we'll have to wait a week or so before finding out more, but those interested in reading the interview in full can certainly give the read link a visit.[Image courtesy of TurboGadgets, thanks KC Kim]
