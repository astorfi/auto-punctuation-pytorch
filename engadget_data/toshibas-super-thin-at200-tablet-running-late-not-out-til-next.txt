A blogger posited a question on the company's official Facebook page and promptly got himself an answer: the 7.7mm thick, 1.2GHz dual-core slate will be commercially available from January 2012. Unless there's a different schedule for the US, then we have to say, boo, hiss, and other pantomime expressions. We were originally told it'd ship before Christmas. Let's hope there'll be a post-holiday bargain price tag to make up for it.
