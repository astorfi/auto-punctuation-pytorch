 Look, we're not so hot about making our mulaan RFID free-for-all, but thatdoesn't mean we're necessarily sure the little chips mark the coming of the Antichrist either. Nevertheless, it's funto see some of the more paranoid types take matters into their own hands and kill those privacy invaders dead with theRFID-Zapper, a hacked up disposable camera that delivers an EMP of sorts to unsuspecting RFID tags, sending them tothat great inventory management system in the sky. Doesn't look like the hardest DIY project, but we'll stick with ourcurrent methods of tin-foil hat wearing and off key humming -- it's gotten us this far.[Via TRFJ]
