Beyond the obvious new hardware flying about and news from Naughty Dog, there were a few additional tidbits revealed tonight at Sony's PlayStation 4 launch event. The PlayStation brand as a whole will offer gamers a few things they can't get elsewhere, with the PS3 and PS4 both offering the earliest access to a beta test for Bungie's Destiny (if you haven't pre-ordered, check the blog for invite codes) early next year, plus an exclusive "classic" Solid Snake skin and mission in Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes when it launches next spring. Finally, the next entry for Sucker Punch's Infamous series has a release date, as it revealed Infamous: Second Son will be released March 21st, 2014. There's a trailer for each after the break (plus an overall PS4 launch trailer), view and plan your next-gen purchases wisely.
