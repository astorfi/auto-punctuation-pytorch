PC overclocking enthusiasts are certainly never the type
to be outdone by the pesky Mac world and their trifling
couple hundred megahertz overclocks, and normally we
wouldn't give to much credit due to the laborious results of liquid nitrogen pumps and whatnot, but seriously, it's not
every day someone cranks their CPU up to 7.2GHz. Now, does it actually run? Well, not really, no, but it can
POST and hold still long enough for a shot of the screen, and that's all that matters. Right?
