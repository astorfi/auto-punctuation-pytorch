In an effort to grab an "ownable trademark" that will be more easily recognized on EPGs and online video portals such as iTunes and Hulu, NBC Universal has decided it best to rebrand Sci Fi Channel as 'Syfy.' Phonetically, everything remains the same, but it's the visual difference that counts. The change is expected to take place on July 7th here in the US, with other regions following suit in Q3. We're still not sure we're hot on the whole MHD-to-Palladia thing, but we kind of dig this change -- agree / disagree?
