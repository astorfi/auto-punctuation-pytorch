Good news, gaming friends, because if your laptop was ordered, but hasn't yet shipped, Dell's doing you a solid by upgrading the chip automatically for you. Best part is, the company will swap in "comparably-priced" new silicon for free, which leaves you to spend your money elsewhere to prep for your forthcoming Diablo III launch party.
