  Panasonic (Matsushita) showed off their long-awaited 1080p plasma HDTVs today, and unlike their smaller 1366x768 1080p-compatible LCD cousins shown off earlier this month these VIERA PZ600 sets give you every pixel of 1920x1080 high-def goodness. From the baby 50-inch to the mammoth 103-inch (which is already on sale & built to order, hopefully they bring it over here as well), they include not only full HD, but also their VIERA Link HDMI control system, 4000:1 contrast ratio and Panasonic's new 1080p PEAKS 16-bit video processing which they say will improve video scaling and provide blacker blacks. They are very proud of the fact that these HDTVs will display 100% more shades of gradation than the old TH-PX500 plasmas, as opposed to the 50% jump claimed in the PX600 series. The PEAKS system also powers the included Wide Intelligent TV Program Guide, for use with the included terrestrial, satellite and digital broadcast tuners. If that isn't enough for you, they've also thrown in an SD card reader and three 1080p HDMI inputs on each set. It appears that the just-released Pioneer PRO-FHD1 1080p plasma will be bested shortly when these are released on September 1. With a higher contrast ratio, additional features and much lower estimated price, the TH-50PZ600 could make a much more attractive prospect if/when it hits American shores. They will definitely all look good with your DMP-BD10 & friends.
