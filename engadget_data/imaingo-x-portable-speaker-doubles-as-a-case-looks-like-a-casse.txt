The iMainGo X portable speaker doubles as a PMP enclosure, with a clear back that still allows for access to on-unit controls. It also packs a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an internal speaker, a 3.5 millimeter auxiliary input and the ability to daisy-chain with other X devices. At $69.95, it's not exactly an impulse buy, but at least they're tossing in a travel bag, wrist strap and carrying case, right?
