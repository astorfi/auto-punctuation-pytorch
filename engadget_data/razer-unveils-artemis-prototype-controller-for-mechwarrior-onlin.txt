Called Artemis, that lovely bit of kit you see above is a prototype Razer's cooked up for MechWarrior Online aficionados. It features modular construction with one section housing 12 mechanical keys and sliding throttle input, a central unit housing an 8-inch LCD display (to serve as a secondary screen during gameplay) and an adjustable force-feedback flight stick module.
