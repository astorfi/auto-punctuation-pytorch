Take a gander at your Notification Area in the Taskbar and you should find a Windows icon that, when clicked, reveals a shiny new Windows 10 upgrade panel. It's currently being rolled out to select users, since plenty of you have emailed in screenshots, but we've yet to see it ourselves. As before, users will have a year to climb onto the Free Windows 10 bandwagon, but once they do, they'll get free security upgrades for the life of the device.
