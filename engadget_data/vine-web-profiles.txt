Up to this point, your only chance of viewing vids on Vine was via its mobile app or if someone decided to share those clips on Twitter or Facebook. Soon, however, you can do so via the web as well thanks to its newly announced Web profiles. Just like with Instagram's web presence, we're guessing you won't be able to upload anything over the browser, but you'd be able to scan your Vine history as well as peruse through your timeline and other folks' pages. If you're so inclined, you may even sign up for custom URLs, though you should be careful of what you pick as you'll be stuck with it for the foreseeable future. Those fortunate enough to be verified on Twitter will get relevant usernames pre-reserved for you, while others will have to take their chances. We're not sure when Vine's web profiles will go live just yet, but we'll update this post when they do.


Update: We initially said vanity URLs were only for verified users today, but it appears they're open for everyone now. According to our comments, it also seems that you need a minimum of two posts in order to reserve a name.
