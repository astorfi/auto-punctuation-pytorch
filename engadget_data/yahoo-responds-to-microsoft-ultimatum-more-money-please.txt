In the "Dear Steve" response to Ballmer they state, "we will not allow you or anyone else to acquire the company for anything less than its full value." They go on to state that, "We consider your threat to commence an unsolicited offer and proxy contest to displace our independent Board members to be counterproductive and inconsistent with your stated objective of a friendly transaction." Make no mistake about it, this is corporate war and will likely end with Yahoo's best engineers working for Google.
