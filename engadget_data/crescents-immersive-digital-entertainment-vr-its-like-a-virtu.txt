It's a motion gaming solution... that you wear. On your head. When placed in the proper scenario, it gives gamers a full 360 degree space to interact in, with an array of HD motion capture cameras making the virtual reality that much less virtual (and in turn, that much more reality). Hard to say if this thing will ever have a life in the commercial realm, but yeah, we'd buy one.
