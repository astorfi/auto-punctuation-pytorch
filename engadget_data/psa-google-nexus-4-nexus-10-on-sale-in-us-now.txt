 All three sizes of Google's hardware family are now available for purchase in both the US and Canada. Joining a 3G-flavored Nexus 7, the LG-made Nexus 4 starts at $299 for 8GB, Samsung's Nexus 10 rings in at $399 for 16GB. And what do you get for that kind of money? A whole lot; the new Nexus phone houses Android 4.2, Snapdragon S4 Pro and rich 4.7-inch 1,280 x 768 display. Meanwhile the ten-inch Nexus tablet packs the same fresh software, an incredible 2,560 x 1,600 resolution screen and a quad dual-core 1.7 GHz processor, so a whole lot of bang for several hundred of bucks. Hit up Google Play below and pick your screen and storage size.

 Update: And like that, it appears the 16GB both models of the Nexus 4 are sold out. Already.
