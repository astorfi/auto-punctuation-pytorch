Ok, not really two, since the DN7000 and DN6000 are essentially the same slab, only with your choice of Intel or AMD processors as is the rage these days. The DN7000 is the 1.66GHz Core Duo T2300E model with Intel 945GM graphics while the DN6000 nuzzles up to the 1.6GHz Turion 64 X2 and ATI Radeon Xpress 1100. Both feature a 15.4-inch, 1280 x 800 LCD and base-level configs with 512MB of DDR2 RAM, 40GB SATA disk, and dual-layer DVD burner. The DN6000 will set you back about Â¥99,800/$889 while the DN7000 will demand another Benjamin for that proud Intel sticker. Available today for our Japanese brethren and the more resourceful amongst you.
