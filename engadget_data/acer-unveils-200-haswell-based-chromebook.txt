Acer gave its Chromebook line a welcome tune-up when it launched the Haswell-based C720, but the $250 starting price was no doubt disappointing to those who wanted the C7's $200 entry point. The company is accommodating those spendthrifts today with its $200 C720-2848 variant. The only sacrifice is a lower 2GB of RAM; owners still get a 1.4GHz Celeron processor, a 16GB solid-state drive and that vaunted 8.5 hours of battery life. Should you want to save a cool $50, or are just frustrated that you can't buy a Chromebook 11, you can pick up the new C720 today from Amazon or Best Buy.
