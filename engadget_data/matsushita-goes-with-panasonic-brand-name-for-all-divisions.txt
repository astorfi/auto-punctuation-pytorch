 For the few people who knew the brand Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., the company is finally, officially going with the Panasonic brand name we all know and love. After much deliberation, shareholders approved a proposal to change the company's name to Panasonic Corporation. The change will begin in Japan October 1, 2008 with an NYSE symbol change from "MC" to "PC" and will be complete in March 2010 with all products and divisions under the Panasonic moniker. While this won't be a big deal to those of us who know Panasonic for its displays and electronics, gone will be the Matsushita battery, ecology, and welding division names. Good bye Matsushita, it was fun while it lasted.
