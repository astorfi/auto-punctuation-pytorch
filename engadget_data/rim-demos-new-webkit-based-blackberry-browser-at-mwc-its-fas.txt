We're assuming this is what came out of that Torch Mobile acquisition, and the early build shown off on-screen looks pretty solid, rendering Amazon.com quickly and scoring a full 100/100 on the Acid3 test. Unfortunately, there's no word on when BlackBerry users will actually be able to get their hands on this, but rest assured we're digging for more info. Video after the break.
