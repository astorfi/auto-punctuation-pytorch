We realize that not everyone can afford to set up a multi-display system as impressive as the
HIPerWall at UC Irvine, so for those power users who need
less than 50 monitors (namely, 48 less) and have around $200 to blow as opposed to $200,000, Matrox will soon be
shipping a device that creates a dual-monitor configuration using your PC's existing graphics card. The DualHead2Go, as
it's known, tricks your system into thinking that your two 1280 x 1024 monitors are really one big 2560 x 1024 beast,
allowing your desktop to flow across two screens. Users of certain laptops can even employ the DualHead2Go for hooking
up two more monitors in addition to the built-in LCD for a super-cheap three-monitor setup. Expect this to ship in the
middle of the month for around $170, although we're gonna withhold final judgement until we find out if pushing three
displays off of one card compromises your notebook's performance in any way.
