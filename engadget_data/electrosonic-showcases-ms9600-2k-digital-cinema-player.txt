 If you've been wishing that those double digit theater prices would actually net your local hot spot an upgrade, here's an idea you can certainly nudge their way. Showing off at ShoWest 2008 in Las Vegas, the Electrosonic MS9600 is hailed as a "high-performance JPEG2000 appliance," which plays back unencrypted JPEG2000 content at 2K, 1080p and 720p resolutions. Designed specifically for digital cinema, post production and show control applications, this unit also touts dual HD-SDI / dual DVI-I video outputs and 16-channels of broadcast quality digital audio. Furthermore, it even supports 48fps 3D playback, but unfortunately, we've no idea how soon it's destined to hit cinemas of any kind.
