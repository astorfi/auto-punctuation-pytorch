Last summer, Sony's PRS-T2 e-reader was leaked when it visited the FCC, and was available for pre-order a week ahead of its official launch. Therefore, it's with a sense of deja-vu that we tell you that Sony's annual update, the PRS-T3, has now passed through the FCC's hallowed halls and been deemed fit for human consumption. There's not much we can glean from the documents, except to say that it's got a 3.6Wh battery, 802.11 b/g/n WiFi and will probably be available in stores about a month or two from now.


Update: The folks over at The Digital Reader have found some official photos of the new device, which we've added above and below the fold.
