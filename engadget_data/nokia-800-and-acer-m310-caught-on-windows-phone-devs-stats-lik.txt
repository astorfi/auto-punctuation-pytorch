 The fact that Nokia and Acer are busily preparing Windows Phones is no secret, but Sea Ray and W4 may not be the manufacturers' only projects. Elbert Perez, a Windows Phone game developer with a keen eye for statistics, was looking through a list of the various devices that run his games, and a couple gems stood out -- the Nokia 800 and Acer M310. The plot thickens when realizing that these names have never been seen before. Sadly, such a revelation prompts more questions than answers: are these completely new phones, or just the Sea Ray and W4 with new names? If testers are playing games on them, can we assume these are close to production? But don't forget the lingering question that won't ever be answered: are they winning the game?
