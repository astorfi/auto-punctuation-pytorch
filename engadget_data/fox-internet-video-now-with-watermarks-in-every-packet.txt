 The cat-and-mouse game of DRM is probably never going to end, but 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has signed up with USVO's MediaEscort technology to add watermarking to its arsenal. MediaEscort is suited for the growing internet streaming market, and embeds watermarks during content delivery. Thus, if either the legitimate recipient or an online interloper decides to "share the wealth," there's forensic evidence that can be used to figure out both where the leak occurred and how big it is. While we aren't big fans of DRM, it's really because of all the problems it inevitably causes legitimate end-users; watermarking is a different story. As watermarking grows in popularity, we'll see if efforts to strip watermarks grow to the level we currently see in DRM removal.
