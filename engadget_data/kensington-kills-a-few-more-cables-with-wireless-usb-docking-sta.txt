 Look out, cable pundits, your next must-have gadget has arrived. Kensington's Wireless USB Docking Station is pretty straightforward -- you simply plug in up to five USB devices along with your external monitor in order to access all of those gizmos sans cabling from your Wireless USB-enabled machine. Sure, the range is capped at 15-feet, but never having to plug in that printer / scanner / external HDD / USB-powered fan again when setting up your work lappie at home will be a huge relief. Look for this one to ship soon for $229.99.[Via Electronista]
