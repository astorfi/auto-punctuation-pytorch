 So far we've had the opportunity to review the global edition of the Samsung Galaxy Note II -- as well as get our hands on three of the five variants known to be making their way to the US -- but tonight we got our first official look at Verizon's particular flavor. Not that it's much different than the rest of the crowd: it's loaded with the same specs we've seen on the N7100 model (5.5-inch HD Super AMOLED display at 1,280 x 720, 3,100mAh battery and a quad-core Exynos processor clocked at 1.6GHz), with the exception of Verizon-specific LTE bands, and have the same button layout that we've come to expect. Of course, there's that hideous Verizon logo on the main button, but that's the only visual difference we could spot.

 Software-wise, Verizon's version of the Note II contains the built-in apps we've gotten accustomed to with its Android phones: VZ Navigator, My Verizon Mobile, and Mobile Hotspot. The device we picked up was running Jelly Bean, like its counterparts from other carriers. Sadly, no pricing or availability is yet available for the Note II on Verizon, with reps at the Samsung event we're at saying that it's up to Verizon to loose that news.
