 It should be very obvious by now that the theme for 2007 is watching downloadable or streaming content on your HDTV. These devices have been out for years, but it is just recently that all the big players have been getting in the market, and now it's Sony's turn. But rather than try to come up with a snazzy name like SlingCatcher they chose "BRAVIAâ„¢ Internet Video Link". This device will allow most new Bravia televisions to access free Internet video -- including HD -- from providers including AOL, Yahoo! and Grouper, as well as Sony Pictures and BMG Music. The content is streamed over your boradband connection and does not require a PC. The box also supports video via RSS feeds and features the new Xross Media Bar interface just like the PS3 and PSP.
