       One of our readers, Mark from St. Louis, woke to a surprise this morning. There was a message on his digital cable box indicating that Charter was adding two new high-def stations on July 18th - TNT-HD and MHD. We are happy for our St. Louis readers. TNT-HD is a nice station even though they play a bunch of up-converted SD stuff, but they are invaluable during the NBA playoffs. MHD is MTV's new high-def station that from what we hear, we don't have it in our areas yet, plays music. Yeah, we know; kind of shocking. Enjoy 'em folks and cable companies, keep 'em coming.
