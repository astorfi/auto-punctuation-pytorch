 With Apple's general methodof publicly denying the demand for a product until they announce its imminent release, Steve Jobs' words at today'sannual shareholder meeting were quite telling. Without giving much away, Jobs stated: "The new products in thepipeline are the best I’ve ever seen in my life." But in response to a particular shareholder's request forApple to develop "the ultimate media center" to give Microsoft's WMCE a run for its money, Jobs responded:"we hear you loud and clear." Quite the strong words from such a secretive man, though he was on a bit of aroll. In regards to the recent 17-inchMacBook Pro's release, Jobs let everyone know, "Everyone wants a MacBook Pro because they are sobitchin’." Thanks for that, Steve. Jobs also mentioned the possible demise of the CRT in their lineup, dueto environmental concerns and their general lack of bitchin-ness.
