 Aside from its own plans for global domination, History recently laid out plans for several new series to expect and the one that caught our eye was WWII in HD. Set to debut in the fall the 10 episode series pulls from over 3,000 hours of color film recorded during the war, restored in high definition, plus contemporary HD footage and a 5.1 surround sound audio track formed from authentic and new sounds, including recordings from the Library of Congress. Described as following the experiences of a handful of men as their journeys cross-connect throughout the war, this should fit right in not only with history buffs, but also fans of Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan.[Via TV Squad]
