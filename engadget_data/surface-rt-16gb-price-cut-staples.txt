It didn't take long for us to grab some important details (well, a time and a place) about an incoming Surface RT price cut. Our source has forwarded a Staples ad -- and working link -- which reveals that a $150 price cut on the entry-level 32GB Surface RT will start this Sunday 14th July. No word on a discounted Touch Cover option, however, at least not from Staples, but we'll fill you in if there's other retailers jumping on the discount.


(Thanks, Brandon!)
