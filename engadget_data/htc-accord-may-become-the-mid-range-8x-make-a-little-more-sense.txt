We saw XDA-Developer member Football4PDA post a schematic of the Accord less than a week ago, and today he's posting what could be more concrete information. Supposedly, HTC's inaugural device might be named the 8X -- not quite as charming, but definitely simple. More importantly, the software in the claimed leak suggests the company will bring a trace of Sense UI style to the home screen, rather than having to relegate it to the HTC Hub: a live tile would bring the oversized clock and weather that One owners know so well. Just don't anticipate a flagship device here. If the specifications are real, the 8X would bear more in common with the Droid Incredible 4G LTE, sharing its 1.2GHz dual-core chip, 8-megapixel rear camera, Beats Audio and NFC while picking up a slightly larger 4.3-inch screen and 16GB of storage. Our main question centers around the unveiling. While HTC has an event lined up for later this month, there's no guarantee that the 8X will show up at that gathering or even launch side-by-side with Windows Phone 8 itself.
