 If Dell's E1505 that went up on their site looks suspiciously similar to the Inspiron 9400 ortheir E1705, it's because it's the 15-inch version of that same new Core Duo line of theirs. The E1505 can beconfigured with your choice of specs up to a 2.0GHz Core Duo, Media Center 2005, 2GB of DDR2 SDRAM, a 15.4-inch WSXGA (1680 x 1050) display, 120GB drive, and dual layer DVD burner in a 10.45 x 14 x 1.44-inch chassis. No word on how muchor when ("coming soon!"), but if you can't wait, it's not like you don't have other Core Duo laptop options right now.[Thanks, Michael andBen]
