The new smartphone, called the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G, isn't set to be available until later this year, which unfortunately means we're getting very little details at the moment. According to the press release, the Blaze will have a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU, 42Mbps HSPA+ and a "brilliant Super AMOLED touch screen." Again, this is all we have been given at the moment, and we're confused by the fact that the display doesn't have an HD in front nor a Plus in back, as well as the phone's use of "Galaxy S" in the title. As always, it's our hope that this CES announcement will be shortly followed up with an opportunity to get some hands-on time and more details, and we'll keep you posted with any updates as they come in.

Update: At tonight's T-Mobile event, we heard a slightly narrower timeframe for launch: sometime in the first half of the year.
