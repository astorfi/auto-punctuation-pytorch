Spotify's Discover area isn't quite as ubiquitous as we'd hoped by this point, primarily serving computer-based Spotify users. But today that trend begins to change, with Spotify's iOS app getting an update (version 0.7.1) which adds the long-awaited Discover functionality alongside a slew of other updates. The "Now Playing" section is changing a bit as well, getting a makeover, and playlists can now be edited directly from your phone. Oh, and Spotify says all this stuff is heading to other mobile devices "soon." The full list of changes is below, including the always exciting fictitious addition. We won't spoil it for you.
