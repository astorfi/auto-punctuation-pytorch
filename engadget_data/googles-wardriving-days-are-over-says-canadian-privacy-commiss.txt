That's one of several findings in a report by Canada's privacy commissioner today, which also claims that the controversial data collection feature was the work of a single Google engineer, and that Google intends to use smartphones to pinpoint WiFi networks from now on. Naturally, the latter caused the commissioner concern that Android phones might capture the same data as the cars. Perhaps you'd best keep those shields up after all.
