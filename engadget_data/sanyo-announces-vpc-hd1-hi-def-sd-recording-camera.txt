 Sanyo has just unloaded the VPC-HD1, which looks to be the first camcorder to record high definition video to anSD card (and something which should also make it one of the smallest high-def cameras available). The $800 camerameasures 3.1-in. x 4.7 in. x 1.4 in and weighs only 8.3 ounces with the battery, but despite its size, the VPC-HD1still packs a 10x optical zoom lens.  The camera can record 720p video at 30 frames per second and uses real-timeMPEG-4 compression -- still pics come in at a nice 5.1 megapixels. It also has a handful of manual controls, includingfocus, aperture, exposure compensation, shutter speed, ND filter toggle, and manual white balance control.  Lookfor it in March.
