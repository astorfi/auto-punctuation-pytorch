Come on, admit it: you've all secretly been longing for more Plants vs. Zombies action, right? Well fans, today's your lucky day. PopCap's just uploaded a YouTube video announcing that the sequel to its wildly successful game -- appropriately called Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time -- will be launched this July. The company makes fun of itself in the video, which shows frustrated gamers yelling and asking for a sequel to the popular game. It's unclear which platform the new title will support at launch, but the original Plants vs. Zombies -- which is four years old now -- first appeared on Mac and PC in 2009 before making its way to PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo DS, PS Vita, Chrome, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry and even Bada (!). The game's success was likely one of the reasons EA acquired the company in 2011. Now, if you'll excuse us, we have to find our Samsung Wave review unit so we can play Plants vs. Zombies on that long forgotten mobile OS. Hit the break for PopCap's video.
