Lenovo currently has Quanta, Compal, Wistron and Inventec building for it in Taiwan, and the company plans to drop one of those from its consumer line and add one manufacturer to its ThinkPad line. This apparently means that Lenovo's outsourcing its laptop manufacturing completely for the first time in its history, which might seem a bit odd for a Chinese company, but with Lenovo's market share slipping to the likes of Acer, it seems the time is right to make a move.  [Via DigiTimes]Update: According to Lenovo, this news of laptop production moving to Taiwan is 100% false.
