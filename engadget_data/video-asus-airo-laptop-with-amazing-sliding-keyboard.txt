The design raises the keyboard to cool the hot running components beneath allowing for a fan-less, convection-cooled design. Unfortunately, this prototype is just a chipset-less mechanical shell. Raise the lid and the keyboard slides back smoother than a greased-up Pete Rose. This allows for a larger, more comfortable wrist rest from which to slap those angled keys. Sexy? Oh yeah, with mojo to spare. Check the video after the break.
