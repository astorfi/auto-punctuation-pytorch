We say officially, because as these things go, there's a chance the gadget will make it into the limelight via unofficial channels. No indication what it might be, but if we had our say, the Continuum and its secondary OLED screen would make for a nice treat... hey, why are you even asking? Of course we'll be there covering it live!
