 What's CES without a few bigazz prototype displays? Sony announced two, not-quite-ready-for-prime-time panels today. The first is their 82-inch LCD, easily topping Sony's current top of the line 70-inch BRAVIA LCD by a diagonal foot. The other display is a 27-inch Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) capable of Full HD (1080p) performance in what Sony calls a "razor-thin" form factor. Sounds great, but without the accompanying pics (that's a teeny, tiny pic of their new 70-incher to the right) we'll just have to be quietly amazed. No worries, we'll hunt 'em down on the show floor tomorrow and bring the pix in the process.
