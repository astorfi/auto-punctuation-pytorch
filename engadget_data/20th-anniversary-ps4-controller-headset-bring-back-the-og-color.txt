PlayStation fans who have been with Sony's system since the beginning can pledge their allegiance with a pair of new PS4 accessories. Designed to commemorate the original PlayStation's 20th anniversary, this DualShock 4 and Gold Wireless rock the familiar two-tone gray color scheme with its distinctive PlayStation logo. They'll arrive in the US for $65 and $99 (respectively) this September. The controller is coming to Europe and Asia too, but there's no word on the headphones.
