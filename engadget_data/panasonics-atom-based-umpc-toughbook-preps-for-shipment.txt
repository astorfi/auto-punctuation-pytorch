Since getting really official at CeBIT in March, we haven't heard a peep from Panny in regard to a definitive ship date. According to PC World, the rugged mini tablet will be loosed "later this week," and it will of course include a touch-sensitive 5.6-inch screen, compact QWERTY keypad, a variety of ports, Intel's Atom processor and a chassis built to withstand just about anything next to getting pelted with napalm. As for fleshed out specs and global ship dates, we're told to expect those on Wednesday.[Via TG Daily]
