 South Korea's biggest internet provider plans to recoup high traffic network upgrades by charging YouTube and other data-hungry sites. KT will start by blocking access to some TV apps found Samsung's internet TVs, looking to strike up a payment deal where data-heavy services would possibly have to share advertising income or pay fees to the ISP. According an interview with Reuters, KT's vice president of smart network policy, Kim Taehwan said it's not just Samsung that it'll be tapping up for cash; once its system is in place, the company will be moving on to bandwidth-taxing manufacturers, "be it Apple or Google."
