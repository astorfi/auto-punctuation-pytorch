Look no further, friends; we've got you covered with a three-pack of previews for the device. Sentiment for Waterloo's latest QWERTY handset is overwhelmingly positive, focusing on a few key points: great keyboard, great media support (a 3.5mm jack sure doesn't hurt there), and surprisingly good battery life. The camera seems to be decent -- all 2 megapixels of it, anyway -- and none of the lucky previewers seemed too bummed about the EDGE-only data speeds. Throw in what might be the most attractive case on a RIM phone to date, and it seems the Curve might do the seemingly impossible by filling both Pearl and 8800 owners with envy when it launches on AT&T in the not-too-distant future.Read - LAPTOP Magazine (4 / 5 stars, "...this is the best BlackBerry...")Read - PC Magazine ("...an extremely promising BlackBerry for folks who want a fun device with a full keyboard")Read - Airtime Manager ("...we're convinced that the new BlackBerry 8300 will have been worth the wait")
