  AT&T's fiber-based television service certainly has enough channels to launch HDTV, it seems that the concern right now is do they have the bandwidth? According to U-verse customers, they are being told to expect a new Motorola VIP 1216 HD set-top box on that date that will allow, at least to start, one h.264-encoded HD stream to the home. That means one high definition channel at a time for your house, no dual-tuners, or even dual-TVs, yet. We're sure that even one high-def channel is better than the currently zero available, but the possibility of family-wrecking battles over the remote is high: proceed with caution.[Via Broadband Reports]
