 Ardent followers of the Apple v. Samsung hearing in California have another date to circle in their calendars: December 6th. AllThingsD and Reuters report Judge Lucy Koh has put that down as the day the two companies can make their cases over two key steps in the process since the verdict (check out our breakdown of the decision and what its $1.05 billion damage award means here) was handed down Friday evening. Apple is requesting an injunction to block the sale of Samsung phones that were found to infringe upon its patents, while Samsung wants to have the jury's verdict set aside. This changes the plans for the previously scheduled September 20th hearing, which will focus on Samsung's effort to get the injunction lifted on its Galaxy Tab 10.1 that was found not to infringe upon Apple's design patent. Whether you'll be tuned in to Twitter for each line by line update or avoiding the internet altogether, at least now you know which day to plan for.
