Lucky for us, he thought to snap a few pics, albeit 'shopped to appear in the traditional blurrycam art style. No word on pricing or availability, but let's hope Wacom isn't planning to tease us too much longer. Update: An anonymous tipster managed to snap a photo of a Future Shop inventory screen that shows four Intuos4 models and pricing: 4 x 6 inch small for $299, 6 x 9 inch medium for $479, 8 x 13 inch large for $999, and 12 x 19 extra large for $649 (all prices Canadian). No clue why the extra large one is over $300 cheaper. They're all apparently in stock at the distribution center, but there's no word on when they'll actually ship to stores.[Thanks, Joseph]
