This one, the EX623, a 16-incher from the hallowed depths of MSI's genius labs packs an Intel Centrino Core 2 Duo CPU, up to 4GB of DDR2 RAM, a max 320GB hard drive, and NVIDIA GeForce 9500M GS graphics, with a 16:9 widescreen display. The "Bravo," as it's also known, is apparently being marketed as an entertainment laptop (we know this because we watched the super sweet video MSI has up on their site which shows a band totally rocking out), and as such houses things like a Blu-ray drive, an eSATA port, stereo speakers and a subwoofer, though there's no HDMI output and of course the 1366 x 768 resolution won't display 1080p HD. Still, we're pretty sure that "Breakpoint" will have never sounded so good. No word on the price or availability. [Via SlashGear]
