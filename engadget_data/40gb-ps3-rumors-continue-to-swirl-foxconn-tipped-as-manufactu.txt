 Pocket-link UK is confidently reporting that those 40GB PS3 rumors are true. In fact, they've gone so far as to claim that Sony has turned away from ASUS and in the direction of Foxconn to manufacture their new entry-level console. Pricing is still unknown but formerly pegged at $400 for the US. If there's any truth to this then we should expect a Sony announcement to come during the Tokyo Game show, underway as we speak, or early next week in order to "spoil" Microsoft's Halo 3 launch.
