According to this video, it sure borrows a lot from the PSP, and therefore seems a bit limited for all the crazy uses Sony has planned for the console. Though we're sure Sony has put a lot more thought into this than we have. Also, the PSP interface has been generally well received, so why try to fix what isn't broken? The biggest additions are the new "Users" and "Friends" options, the former allowing you switch between different user profiles, while the latter didn't look quite fleshed out, but we guess it'll do what it sounds like. We also noticed under the settings option a mention of keyboard and mouse settings, rumored accessories which would seem quite appropriate for all of the PS3's PC leanings, so we'll keep an eye out for more news on that front.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
