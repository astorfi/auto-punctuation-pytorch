Clearly, Tosh has been shoring 'em up, waiting for this day to arrive when it would introduce four newcomers in one fell swoop. Starting us off is the ultrathin Portégé R600, which packs your choice of a Core 2 Duo CPU, 2.14-pound shell, a battery good for nine hours and a price tag ranging between $1,499 and $3,299. The Portégé A600 includes most of the same specs along with a GMA X4500 graphics controller and a more pedestrian price; the Portégé M750 Tablet PC adds in that always-exciting swivel action for those who care. Lastly, we've got the Tecra R10, which features a 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo SP9400, 4GB of DDR2 RAM, 200GB 7,200 RPM hard drive, NVIDIA Quadro NVS 150M GPU and an MSRP of $1,999. No word on when these will head south to the US, but Canadians should be able to indulge soon enough.[Via GottaBeMobile]
