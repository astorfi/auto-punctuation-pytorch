Scosche understands your frustrations, and it's out to make coping somewhat easier with the Revive II dual-USB chargers. With one for the car and one for the home, you'll most likely never, ever be in a location where your iPad can't be juiced. In case you haven't guessed, one of the USB ports on each charger is of the high-power variety, while the other will happily charge your iPhone, iPod or nearly any other USB-infused gadget that's smaller than a 9.7-inch tablet PC. Both of 'em are up for pre-order now through the company's website, though the $24.99 (car) and $29.99 (home) price tags do feel a touch steep.
