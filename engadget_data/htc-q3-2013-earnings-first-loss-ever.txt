HTC's issues appear to have worsened, as the company announced its first-ever net loss for a quarter in Q3. According to the statement, it's notched a net loss of $101.2 million (NT$2.97 billion) on revenue of $1.6 billion. As we noted last quarter, a shrinking profit put the load on the new HTC One Mini, which has faced shortages, reportedly due to problems producing casings for the device. Of course, other bad news of late has included layoffs, investigations over stolen trade secrets and rumors the company will be sold. Adding insult to injury, while the folks at Samsung haven't released a detailed report yet, they're expecting yet another massive profit for the past quarter.
