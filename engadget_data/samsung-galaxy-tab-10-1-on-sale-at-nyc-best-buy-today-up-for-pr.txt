At noon Eastern Time today, Best Buy's New York City store at Union Square will start selling Samsung's extra-slim 10-inch Tegra 2 tablet, with the first 200 buyers also receiving a matching leather pouch to store their precious inside of. Geographically challenged Android tablet lovers will also be able to pre-order the Tab 10.1 from Best Buy today (eventually, the pre-order button doesn't currently work) and widespread US availability is still expected on June 17th. Pricing isn't explicitly listed on Best Buy's landing page, but we presume it's the same as we've been told earlier: $499 for the 16GB or $599 for the 32GB WiFi-only versions. If you can't live without some LTE goodness in your mobile life, Verizon's also promised pre-orders for the 4G-capable Galaxy Tab 10.1 today, though that costs a far less palatable $530 (16GB) and $630 (32GB) on top of a two-year data contract.

Update: Best Buy has sorted out its systems and all four WiFi variants (black or white, with 16GB or 32GB storage) are up for pre-order.
