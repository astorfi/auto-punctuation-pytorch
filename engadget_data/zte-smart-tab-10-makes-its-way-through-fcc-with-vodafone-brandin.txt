The probable 10-incher isn't revealing a whole lot, but it does have the same Bluetooth, WiFi and 3G logos riding on its lower back. It's also sporting what looks to be a back-facing camera in the upper-right corner, just like little sis. What's more, this filing lists the tablet as the Vodafone Smart Tab 10, which further confirms our suspicions that this and the Smart Tab 7 are the same Honeycomb tablets announced by the carrier at IFA. Those slates are said to share a 1280 x 800 pixel screen, 1GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, and a dual-core 1.2GHz processor -- and, of course, a thing for lower back tattoos.
