Owners of the flagship device can grab it now through a manual download, and the good news is that it's meant to fix some connectivity issues. Bad news is it's just for 3G. The new code is also meant to stabilize data-dependent apps, speed up GPS updates for Google Maps and VZ Navigator, and fix a few minor messaging glitches. We're glad the wait is over, but would it have killed them to fix LTE too?
