Yep, Yeezy just picked up the year-old Serenata in Singapore, and he's thoughtfully posted up some unboxing pics for us. We thought the Samsung-built handset was a hot little number when we played with it back in January at CES, but we've moved on since then -- it's a triband dumbphone, after all. We've got some hotter gear to show you, 'Ye -- call anytime.[Thanks, Philip]
