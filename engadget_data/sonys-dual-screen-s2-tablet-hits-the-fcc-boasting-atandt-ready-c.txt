The FCC recently got a glimpse at Sir Howard's dual-screen Honeycomb clamshell, and thanks to the public portion of their reports, we've got some crucial specs: the Sony "SGPT211US" will sport 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth, and most tellingly, 850MHz and 1900MHz 3G bands suggesting a launch on AT&T. Now, those frequencies are certainly also used by several prominent Canadian carriers, but it just so happens that this particular model tested is a US variant -- with others designated for Canada and Japan -- and this particular cellular module is the Ericsson F5521gw, which means we could even be looking at 21Mbps HSPA+ speeds. Before you start speculating, however, there's one more crucial spec to share: the prototypes apparently have a removable 3080mAh lithium-ion battery pack. Swell.
