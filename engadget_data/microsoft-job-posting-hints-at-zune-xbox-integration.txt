Winter rolls around, the fires get going, the cocoa gets to cookin', and we get to thinking that the Zune and Xbox 360 just have to have some tighter integration in the not-too-distant future. This go 'round, we've got a suspicious job posting over at Microsoft that's stirring up a little speculation, and for good reason. In fact, the listing -- which seeks a particular User Experience Designer -- specifically mentions that the perfect candidate will be comfortable working closely with "creative directors to propose innovative designs and content solutions for the Zune Device UI, Zune Xbox and Zune PC Application." In case that wasn't definitive enough for you, it also mentions "embracing and extending" the Zune brand. Oh, and on another note, are any of you applying? Sounds like a pretty sweet gig.[Via CNET]
