We hinted that this was on the way just last week, now
Gateway's 700GR officially becomes the first PC to use Intel's new BTX (which stands for Balanced Technology Extended)
advanced cooling system which makes it easier and more efficient to keep your PC from overheating by blowing air over
horizontally aligned memory chips and upturned expansion boards, then over the chipset and CPU. In case you're thinking
of picking it up, the rest of the specs on the 700GR are pretty decent: a 250GB hard drive, up to 2GB of RAM, a Pentium
4 550 processor, a dual-layer, a 128MB ATI Radeon X300SE graphics card, and an 8X DVD+/-RW drive.
