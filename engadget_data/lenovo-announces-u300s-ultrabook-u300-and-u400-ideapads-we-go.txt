 

The unchallenged reign of the MacBook Air on the thin-and-light domain is nearing an end -- the Ultrabooks are coming, and the Lenovo U300s looks to be one of the strongest competitors we've yet seen. It's a new entry to the IdeaPad lineup, the thinnest and lightest of a redesigned and reborn U Series that will also include the slightly stockier 13.3-inch U300 and the even bigger but even more serious 14-inch U400. All three are shipping in October, and we recently got a chance to try out the tiny trio. Read on for full details and our full impressions.




          
 
 
 Intel's long-vaunted Ultrabooks are finally coming to market, and while they're going to be shipping with a range of price points and designs, they're all going to be very thin. The U300s is naturally the thinnest, 14.9mm thick at the front and the rear thanks to a book-inspired design that is slightly concave around the edges. That's actually 2mm thinner than the Air, but of course the Air has that delicious taper making it seem thinner overall (as you can see in the comparison photos in the gallery, and below). But, really, they're both very, very thin indeed. The U300s takes many design inspirations from the Air, including a glass trackpad and a machined aluminum body, but it's been given a sandblasting and an anodization that Lenovo pledges will make it more scratch resistant than the competition. We didn't get a chance to put that to the test, but the build and construction did indeed feel good on the unit we got our hands on. Again like the Air the bottom of the U300s lacks vents, with air being sucked in through the keyboard. That keyboard is rather unfortunately not backlit, but it is still spill-proof -- another claim we'll have to take Lenovo's word for.The U300s weighs in at 1.34kg (2.95 pounds), while the still 13.3-inch but 18.3mm thick U300 clicks in at a slightly heavier 1.58kg (3.48 pounds), and the 14-inch U400 is 22.6mm thick and 1.98kg (4.36 pounds). That last one is the only one with dedicated graphics, AMD Radeon HD5470M HD6470M to be specific. All three models have 1,366 x 768 displays (the same as the 11-inch Air, but less than the 1,440 x 900 13-incher) and all also support WiDi tech, for wirelessly beaming video to external displays. Finally, they all sport HDMI output -- not to mention USB 3.0. When it comes to storage all models can be configured with up to 256GB SSDs that, on the U300s at least, enables 10 second bootups and up to eight hours of battery life. The U300 and U400 also have an array of platter-based storage options up to 1TB and have six and seven hours of battery life, respectively. The U300s maxes out at 4GB of DDR3 memory and can be configured with Intel Core i5 2467M or Core i7 2667M processors, while the other two can double the memory and offer Core i5 2430M or Core i7 2620M silicon. Only the U400 has an optical drive, a slot-loading DVD-RW unit.All are said to be shipping in October, most in gray but the U300s will have a delectable Clementine Orange color, a limited edition spec for early adopters. The U300s will start at $1,195 while the U300 can be had for $799 and the U400 $849. We'll be back with full reviews then, but if you'd like the full details check out the PR below.Update: There appears to be a typo in the press release. We're looking at 6470M graphics on the U400, not 5470M.
