But that doesn't mean Philips is sittingstill. TrustedReviews took a look at Philips' latest music streamer, the WACS700, which is available in Europe now forabout $938, and can be purchased in the US through the usual sources. The base unit includes a CD player and 40GB harddrive, along with embedded Gracenote software, so that CDs can be ripped PC-free with song data included. The systemcan connect to a home network via WiFi or Ethernet, and music from your PC can be transferred to the WACS700's harddrive over the network (unfortunately, it doesn't support streaming files from your PC; you first need to transfer themusic to the unit itself). While TrustedReviews found the sound quality decent and some other features, includingwireless reception, to be good, the reviewer also found the WACS700 to be lacking in a number of key features,including support for DRM'd files, slow ripping (as long as 20 minutes per CD), and the size of the hard drive (40GB iskind of skimpy). Conclusion: while it's not cheap, it is cheaper than Sonos' offerings, and could be an ok solution forthe less technically inclined. The rest of us are likely to find more flexible PC-centric solutions.
