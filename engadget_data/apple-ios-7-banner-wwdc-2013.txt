Well, we were pretty sure that Apple was going to out a new version of iOS next week, and a banner just went up at the Moscone Center in San Francisco (the venue for WWDC) seems to confirm the rumors. As you can see, it shows only the number '7', which all but confirms that we'll be seeing Jony Ive's first iteration of Apple's mobile OS in just a few days. Tune in to our coverage next week to check the accuracy of our deductive powers and find out what other goodies Apple has in store.


Update: Our friends at 9 to 5 Mac have more pics, including photos of an ad with a big 'X' in front of a wave. That should put to rest any hopes for this being the launch of OS XI.
