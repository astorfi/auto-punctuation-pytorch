 We've heard of the Federales handing out aging Xbox consoles in return for random pieces of weaponry, but a modern day case of Jet Grind Radio has Garner, North Carolina officials miffed. In a peculiar bout with vandals who are littering the town with "Ghost" graffiti tags, the local police are actually offering up some handsome rewards to informants that lead the boys in blue to any rightful arrests. Of course, the $1,000 cash prize looks tempting enough, but if the "miscreant is a juvenile," police are offering $500 or their choice of a Microsoft Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 (the 20GB flavor, we presume), or Nintendo Wii on top of the cool thousand just for participating. Here's to hoping the bandits are kids, eh?[Via NintendoWiiFanboy]
