Even as HBO Go has launched on new platforms over the years, people who pay for TV service and HBO have occasionally found that their provider won't play along. That's been the case for DirecTV subscribers with a Roku ever since the app rolled out in 2011, but now things have changed. Customers started seeing the change Thursday and now the DirecTV Twitter account confirms subscribers can use their account logins on Roku. The Syfy Now app on iOS also has a fresh update that says it supports DirecTV accounts, while some users say they've been able to login to apps for History, A&E, and Lifetime, although that doesn't appear to be officially available yet. Comcast Xfinity customers are the most notable remaining group still denied activations on Roku and Samsung Smart TVs, although the service does support Apple TV and Xbox 360. Will that ever change? After this move and the recent arrival of YouTube on the platform, here's hoping Comcast, Roku and Time Warner can get together to keep the streak going.
