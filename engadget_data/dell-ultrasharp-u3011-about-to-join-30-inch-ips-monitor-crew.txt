Dell's unannounced, but seemingly all too real UltraSharp U3011 has been snapped over in China, and we're being told it'll offer a formidable 2,560 x 1,600 resolution while maintaining the styling of the smaller U2711. TFT Central reports it'll be a 10-bit H-IPS panel from LG Display, bearing a 7ms response time, 1,000:1 contrast ratio, 370 nits of brightness (ahem, overkill), and 178-degree viewing angles on both the horizontal and vertical axis. HDMI and DVI connections come in packs of two, accompanied by a lone DisplayPort. Sounds like it's shaping up to be a fine competitor to HP's ZR30w.
