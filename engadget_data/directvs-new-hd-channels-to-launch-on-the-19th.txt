       With DirecTV 10 in position, all the new HD channels could be released any day now, it appears now that a leaked internal document from DirecTV has revealed the day. While most believe that this Sunday the 16th, was the big day, this internal documents seems to imply that the day when the HD comes is next Wednesday the 19th. The channel lineup appears to be the same as we saw last week, but it's nice to get additional confirmation. The only thing we know for sure, is that all these new channels can't get here fast enough.
