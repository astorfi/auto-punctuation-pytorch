But, as they say, maybe first-gen Roku owners should simply be elated that their box is still on the update trail. A week (and change) after the Roku 2 and Roku LT saw a fairly significant software update, the company is now pushing v3.1 to OG models. As the company says: "Unless your Roku player is smaller than a hockey puck, this update applies to you." The fresh bytes provide added enhancements to support the official Roku iPhone app, improved playback of MP4 files streamed over the internet and over USB via the USB Media Player channel, and the ability to purchase Roku players, accessories and toys within the Roku Channel Store.

Furthermore, we're told that issues found when navigating channels that display content in a grid screen have been solved, and perhaps most importantly, there's support for Amazon's downright delightful new Instant Video channel. Every last unit should see the update pushed their way in the coming hours, but if you're not exactly the "patient" type, just head to Settings -> Playing info -> Check for update.
