Well, if for some reason you've got the desire to power through Finnegans Wake in your browser (though, we're not really sure why you'd do that to yourself) we've got good news -- the Google Books app for Chrome now caches your titles for local reading. To download a book, just hover over the cover in library view and select "make available offline" from the pop-up. Then, even when you can't get your Chromebook connected, you'll be able to sit back and relax with a classic novel or seedy romance tale.
