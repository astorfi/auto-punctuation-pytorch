Embattled voting-machine maker Diebold Election Systems has been
accused of hiding "major problems" in its equipment by a whistleblower called "Dieb-Throat." In an interview with The
Raw Story, the source, identified as a company insider, claims Diebold has broken state election laws "many times" and
"screwing with the software" was "part of their recipe for getting into the election business." Although the source
stopped short of directly charging Diebold with fixing elections, Dieb-Throat said that management "felt that if they
controlled an election company, they could have great influence over the outcome." A Diebold spokesman denies the
charges, saying the company "has a sterling reputation in the industry." Earlier this year, Diebold
pulled out of North Carolina, after the state insisted on
reviewing the company's source code.
