Coming in March, the USB Punch Head enables users to beat and batter a USB-connected head and receive all sorts of instant gratification as the on-screen face gets disfigured and a variety of expected "oohs" and "arghs" are emitted from your speakers. Best of all, the actual head that you maul is interchangeable, and users can even upload photos of their favorite enemies for maximum satisfaction. Hit the read for a couple of demonstrative videos.
