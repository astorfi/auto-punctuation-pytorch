A note to all the parents in the house: Sure, maybe you'd save a few bucks by buying your kid a POP Station Value
Pack instead of a PlayStation Portable (we know it can be
tough even finding a PSP in some parts of the country), but you better be prepared for the look of crushing
disappointment you're going to receive when you give them this janktastic knockoff.


P.S. - Scarily enough, this is actually the 4th PSP clone we've spotted, you might also recall the
GM-219, that
Lenovo cellphone, and some other
random Chinese one that turned up in January.


[Thanks, Robert G.]
