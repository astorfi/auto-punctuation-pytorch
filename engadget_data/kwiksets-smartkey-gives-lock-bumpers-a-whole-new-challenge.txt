Available in handsets, deadbolts, knobs and levers, the SmartKey technology effectively eliminates the possibility of using a rigged key to exploit the lock, and better still, the included Learn Tool enables owners to re-key a lock in under half a minute if necessary. Reportedly, the side-locking bar deadbolt system features ANSI Grade 1 certification and has passed "the most stringent lock picking standard." 'Course, it's only a matter of time before the tinkerers of the world have even this all figured out, but hey, at least SmartKey puts you ever-so-slightly ahead of the curve, right?[Via Apartment Therapy]
