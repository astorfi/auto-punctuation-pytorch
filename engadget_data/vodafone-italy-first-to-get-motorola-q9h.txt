The Q9h has made what appears to be its first official bow on a carrier site, showing up with Vodafone's Italian outpost (so much for the European exclusivity theory for 3, we guess). No word on an exact release date, but the number being thrown around for the sticker is â‚¬499 (about $680), which we think (read: hope) is an unsubsidized price. Vodafone branding -- quite a throwback to the original Norman prototype, eh?[Via the::unwired]
