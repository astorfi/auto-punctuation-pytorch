An eagle-eyed forum poster managed to snag shots of what appear to be the camera in action, taken in Belgium this August doing what it does best... snapping pictures. There's not much more to say, but this should thoroughly wet your whistle for the model's forthcoming introduction, which we can only imagine will be happening sometime around the upcoming Photokina.[Via Digital Photography Review; Thanks, Douglas]
