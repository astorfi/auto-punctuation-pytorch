Starting November 26th (that's Black Friday, we'll have you know), sleepy-eyed consumers can drag themselves into their local AT&T store in order to pick up an LG Quantum, HTC Surround or Samsung Focus in BOGO fashion -- best of all, you can mix and match, enabling users to snag a Quantum and a Surround (or a Focus) for just $199. Naturally, you'll still be signing a pair of two-year agreements with Ma Bell, but it's still the cheapest way to indulge in WP7 for the time being. There's no telling when the deal will end, but common sense would say to jump in early if you've got a hankerin'.
