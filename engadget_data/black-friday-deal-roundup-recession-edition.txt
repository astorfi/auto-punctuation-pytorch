 
Sure, we get to say the word "recession" because we're just that "with it," but were we really being honest, we'd call these deals "kind of weak," or perhaps "simplistic, repetitive, and absolute doggerel." Or maybe we're just spoiled. Either way, we haven't seen much worth lining up at 3am for this morning, which is why we're safely indoors, coffee in hand, making fun of the poor souls out there braving the cold. But, in case you wanted a refresher of what's out there, online and off, here's what we've got so far:New finds:

Dell's "Day of Ultimate Deals!"
HP and MSN Live cashback savings
HP's Thanksgiving Savings Event

The rest:

Amazon's Canon SD770IS deal is much better than it looks
Apple's US Black Friday sale now live
Vizio hacks prices on select HDTVs prior to Black Friday
Black Friday Mac discounts underway
Amazon gets Black Friday started early, shows off a few deals
Kmart publishes next wave of Black Friday-style deals as world ends
Walmart Black Friday doorbuster deals leak out early, we'll sleep in
Circuit City's Black Friday deals leak, no word on if it'll be open to sell things
Best Buy's "doorbuster" Black Friday deals probably won't result in the literal busting of doors
Dell to offer Xbox 360 Arcade and Rock Band 2 for $199 on Black Friday

These are by no means a comprehensive list of the deals -- some legendary, some completely mediocre -- that are available today and through the weekend, so if you spot something else that's worth sharing, feel free to drop it in the comments. Oh, and please stay safe out there -- if none of this "buying stuff" methodology is really your bag, you can always track with our Black Friday Giveaways for a chance at some free swag, without ever leaving your chair.[Thanks to everyone who sent these in]
