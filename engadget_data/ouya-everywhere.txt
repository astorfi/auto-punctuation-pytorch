OUYA has plans to level up in the near future, and it has nothing to do with a new console. In fact, it has nothing to do with any console at all, as the startup has confirmed to Engadget that its software/platform will soon extend to other devices, including set-top boxes and smart TVs. As you'd expect, the firm's keeping most details about the "Everywhere" initiative a secret at this point, but OUYA's slated to announce its first deal with a hardware manufacturer within the next two weeks.


This development doesn't mean one of Kickstarter's biggest success stories is about to get out of the hardware business, though, as a rep told us "...there will always be OUYA hardware." The firm will push through with the annual refresh cycle it promised, though he couldn't share details about the next reference design. If you're crossing your fingers for a mobile release, though, we're sorry to say that won't be happening. At this point, we're told the Everywhere project has nothing to do with mobile, since "Julie [Uhrman] believes strongly that the most immersive way to game is with controller and screen."
