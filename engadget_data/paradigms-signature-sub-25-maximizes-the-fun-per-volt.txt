Put all that power behind a 15-inch driver with 3-inches of travel and you've got a formidable low frequency generator that will definitely expose any room nodes (or loose fillings) you have. And that's just where the Paradigm Perfect Bass Kit (PBK-1) room correction system comes in, using tech from the Anthem ARC-1 to help you tune those problems away. Expect the SUB 25 and PBK-1 in late Q3 for $3999 and $299, respectively.
