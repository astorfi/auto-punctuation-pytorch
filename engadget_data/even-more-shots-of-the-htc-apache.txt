The pics we found last week weren't so hot, but Mobile01 actually has a nice, clear shot of the
HTC Apache, that CDMA/EV-DO version of the HTC Wizard
that Sprint is supposedly going to sell as the Audiovox
PPC-6700. Or something like that. Anyway, in case you missed this one earlier, as far as we know the
Apache/PPC-6700 is 4.5 x 2.5 x 1-inches in size, runs on
Windows Mobile 5.0 and has
a QVGA display, 128MB of ROM, 64MB of RAM, a QWERTY keyboard that slides out horizontally, 802.11b, Bluetooth, a 1.3
megapixel digital camera, and a miniSD card slot.
