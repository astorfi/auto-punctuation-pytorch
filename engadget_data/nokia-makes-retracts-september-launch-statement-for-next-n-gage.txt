 Apparently, a loose-lipped writer on Nokia's official N-Gage blog had tossed out the s-word ("September," that is) regarding a launch from publishers EA Mobile and Gameloft for the next-gen version of its much-maligned gaming platform -- which is now a software concept more than a hardware one -- but a quick scan of the site now reveals no such verbage. Conspiracy theories aside, it seems that either September wasn't quite accurate or Espoo wasn't ready to spill the beans, but since the platform is shaping up to be little more than a bunch of specially-branded games running on phones deemed "N-Gage ready," we're not getting too worked up about it -- especially since we doubt we'll be able to taco-talk.[Via Pocket Gamer]
