Moreover, the 15.4-inch machine would boast an Intel Core 2 Duo T7500 CPU and PM965 Express chipset, but we're left to wonder if any of the other critical components would be upgraded, too. Nevertheless, it seems that a price / release date is also uncertain, but if you just so happen to peep one of these in downtown Tokyo, be sure to holler in comments.[Via SlashGear]
