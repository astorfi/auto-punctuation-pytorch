And since the company knows how you can't resist a good romance, it's now bundling the Reader with (count 'em!) three books by Danielle Steel. That's right, Danielle Steel: the one woman single-handedly responsible for bringing the glamor, the fame, the triumphs, and the heartbreaks of the imaginary jet-set to your seat on the bus as it takes you to your lousy retail gig every morning at 6:30 AM. Not only is her name embossed on the e-reader's elegant red cover, but the whole shebang comes with a personalized form letter from the bestselling author herself. This bad boy is available to the Lifetime Network-set as we speak for a cool $279.99, so grab your plastic and hit that read link.[Via Electronista]
