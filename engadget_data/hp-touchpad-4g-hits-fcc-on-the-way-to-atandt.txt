Earlier today, HP quietly rolled a permanent price drop on the first generation TouchPad, and now it seems that the 4G version of the a seven-inch webOS slate has paid a visit to the folks at the FCC. The filing has "TouchPad Go" written all over it -- literally -- plus a few labels sporting "HSPA+ AT&T."

Update: Turns out we were mistaken about this being the Touchpad 4G, as you can see on the labels below, this is the seven-inch TouchPad Go, previously known as Opal. This smaller HP tablet will apparently come in 16 and 32GB models, and you'll be able to get a WiFi only model as well.
