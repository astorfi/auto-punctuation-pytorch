You'll have to ask for it specifically, as this won't be an advertised undertaking, and you'll also need to swallow the cost of a $50 RadioShack Gift Card for the privilege. Moreover, the company makes sure to inform employees that the launch date for this Sprint-bound smartphone is still unknown -- meaning that what you're really signing up for is a glorified reservation. Still, if the retailers are stirring, we can't imagine the wait for actual stock will be lasting too much longer.
