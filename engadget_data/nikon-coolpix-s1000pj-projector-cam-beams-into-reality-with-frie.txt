Leaked specs for the S1000pj were dead-on: a 12.1 megapixel sensor with ISO 6400 sensitivity mounted behind a 5x wide-angle zoom lens with five-way VR stabilization, and that LED-powered projector that'll put up a 40-inch image for slideshows complete with music, effects and transitions. We're a little less excited about the $430 list price this thing will carry when it hits in September, but on the whole it's a pretty terrific idea and we're completely intrigued -- looks like we'll be saving our pennies this month. Pictures of everything in the gallery, deets on the other cams and a video of the S1000pj after the break.





  The Coolpix S70 (pictured in red) is essentially the same cam as the S1000pj, although it has an OLED touchscreen instead of the projector: 12.1 megapixels, 5x zoom with five-way VR. It'll be available in quite a few color combos this September for $400. The Coolpix S640 is focused on speed -- it offers a .7-second boot-up time and "ultra-fast" autofocus, along with a 12.2 megapixel sensor, 5x four-way VR zoom and a 2.7-inch LCD. Tons of colors, September, $250. Lastly, the the Coolpix S570 is the basic model of the group, with a 12.0 megapixel ISO 3200 sensor behind a 5x four-way VR lens and a 2.7-inch LCD. Again, tons of colors when it lands in September for $200.-- NIKON INTRODUCES FOUR NEW COOLPIX CAMERAS OFFERING SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE, DESIGN AND INNOVATION   Nikon Continues to Lead in Innovation with a New Touch Camera and First Compact Digital Camera with Built-in Projector*   MELVILLE, NY (Aug. 4, 2009) â€“ Nikon Inc. continues its tradition of innovation, design and performance with the introduction of four new COOLPIX Style Series compact digital cameras. Building on the success of Nikon's previous touch-screen models, the ultra-stylish COOLPIX S70 features an enhanced interface and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display technology for a new user experience, housed in a stylish, camera body. The COOLPIX S1000pj features the world's first built-in projector, which enables consumers to share their images and videos in an all-new fun way. Additionally, the COOLPIX S640 and COOLPIX S570, leaders in speed and affordability, respectively, complete the new smarter, cooler, simpler COOLPIX line.  "These latest Nikon COOLPIX digital cameras reflect hallmarks of the COOLPIX line: performance, design and innovation," said Bill Giordano, general manager marketing, COOLPIX for Nikon Inc. "With new features such as a built-in projector and new touch controls for viewing, shooting and zooming, these COOLPIX cameras will appeal to users of every level."  The Nikon COOLPIX cameras incorporate Nikon's world-class NIKKOR lenses, delivering accurate detail and brilliant color, as well as Nikon's EXPEEDTM digital image processing concept, which ensures high-quality pictures with stunning color and sharpness. A new enhancement to Nikon's Smart Portrait System that helps create beautiful portraits includes an all new Skin Softening feature designed to both smooth and even skin tones. Other COOLPIX features include Vibration Reduction (VR) Image Stabilization, minimizing blur that may appear in pictures, even in low-light or unsteady conditions; and Scene Auto Selector, which automatically recognizes the shooting situation and adjusts camera settings accordingly.  NEW COOLPIX S70 FEATURES SUPERIOR STYLING AND OLED TOUCH-SCREEN INTERFACE  Built on the success of Nikon's previous touch-screen models, COOLPIX S70 features Nikon's newly developed 3.5-inch Clear Color Display and a new generation of touch-screen controls that offer an enhanced shooting and playback experience.

The touch-screen also makes viewing and retouching images more fun and efficient. With the swipe of a finger, users can scroll through images and use a pinching motion with two fingers to zoom in or out on displayed images, switching between thumbnail and full screen views.
