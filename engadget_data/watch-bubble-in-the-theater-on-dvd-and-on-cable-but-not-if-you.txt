 Or any of the other dozen states where movie theaters haverefused to show the movie, fighting like the Luddites theyare to protect their antiquated way of doing business. Director Steven Soderbergh, in partnership with our friendMark Cuban and others is releasing his new movie"Bubble" ("theweirdest goddamn movie ever released by a major American filmmaker.") in theater, on cable and on DVD on the sameday, giving viewers the choice of how they want to experience it from the beginning, instead of artificial timedelays between each step.Immediate (or close to it) digital distribution is the future, and these theaters aresilly to fight it.Â  If they had any sense, they'd sell copies o the DVD on the way out. if they had offered me acopy of The Island as I exited the theater, I would have gladly dropped $20 more on top of what I had just spent on aticket and popcorn. Any HDBeat readers live in states that won't be getting a choice of how they want tosee their movies?
