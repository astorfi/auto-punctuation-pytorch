The most notable of the lot here is the Penryn-packing M51SN model, which boasts a 15.4-inch WSXGA + display, NVIDIA GeForce 9500M GS graphics, a max 250GB hard drive, up to 4GB of RAM, and your choice of DVD, HD-DVD or Blu-ray drives, among other top-end features. If that's all a bit more than you need, you'll also apparently soon have your choice of M51Sr and M51Se models, which drop the Penryn processors and opt for some slightly less capable ATI Mobility Radeon 2400 graphics but keeps most of the other specs in tact. No word on a price or release date, but we'd expect those little details to make themselves known before too long.
