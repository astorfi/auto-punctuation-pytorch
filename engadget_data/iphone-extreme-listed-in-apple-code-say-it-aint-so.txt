The code, which was noticed "while looking through the source on the feedback site," lists iPhone Extreme as a product value, but that's absolutely all we have to go on for now. Notably, this isn't the first time a handset has been prematurely discovered by snooping through code, but here's to hoping that this thing gets a name change if it indeed proves real.UPDATE: AppleInsider is now reporting that the phrase was "simply a sloppy copy-and-paste job on the part of an Apple webmaster who apparently used the company's existing AirPort Extreme feedback form to creating one for the iPhone."
