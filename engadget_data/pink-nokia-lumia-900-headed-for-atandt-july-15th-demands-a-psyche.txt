 
 That Nokia Lumia 900 Batman edition not quite your thing? Looks like the Windows Phone handset's getting yet another version, this time in an eye-catching pink. The new color joins white, black and cyan, heading exclusively to AT&T this Sunday, July 15th. Need some apps to run on that 1.4Ghz processor? Nokia recommends Groupon, Fruit Ninja and the Instagram-esque Apict, for interested parties.
