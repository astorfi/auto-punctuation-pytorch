You know you want it. We don't even have to ask, and Sony is delivering! LittleBigPlanet 3 is coming. The most immediately notable change is the slew of new characters, like the quadrupedal Oddsock and the flying Swoop. Flying is an obvious new trick, but there's also the ability to wall jump and a larger character that can shove obstacles out of the way and generally hurl his girth around the level. The idea is that multiple characters can cooperate to extend the world of LittleBigPlanet in interesting ways. And don't worry, if you and your friends have invested countless hours crafting levels for the first two titles, they'll actually be playable in the newest installment -- complete with automatically upscaled graphics! There are also all sorts of great new mechanics and beautiful new graphics to enjoy. Though, you'll have to be patient, LittleBigPlanet 3 won't hit the PlayStation 4 until the holiday season.
