 A "small percentage" of Twitter users may have noticed the feature earlier this week, but the rest of us should officially have access to the service's archive tool soon. After downloading your own Twitter archive, you'll be able to launch an HTML file that provides a familiar web interface, but with vastly improved searching features and full access to all of your tweets since your very first day on the site. The advantage of Twitter archive is twofold: you'll have a backup of all of your tweets (and retweets), but you'll also be able to dig through all those masterfully crafted messages more quickly and efficiently, thanks to localized storage. Initially, the archive option will only be available for users with accounts set to English, but those of you displaying the site in other languages will have access "over the coming weeks and months." Check it out at the source link below.
