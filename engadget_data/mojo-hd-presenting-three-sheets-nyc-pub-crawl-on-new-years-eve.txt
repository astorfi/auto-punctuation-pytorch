Personally, we'd let the dual-tuner HD DVR solve the aforementioned quandary, but if you're a Three Sheets fanatic, you can tune in at 9:00PM EST on December 31st to catch a three-hour special of the program. As expected, the well-traveled Lamprey will be shuffled around in the heart of New York as he searches for the best pubs the city can offer. Though, it's really a shame this doesn't run on the 30th in order to give you time to put his findings to work the next night, now isn't it?
