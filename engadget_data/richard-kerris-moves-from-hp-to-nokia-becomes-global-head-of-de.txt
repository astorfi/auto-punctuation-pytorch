   Well, that certainly didn't take long. Just a couple of days after leaving HP to "pursue an opportunity outside of the company," ex-VP of Worldwide Developer Relations for webOS Richard Kerris has now turned up at Nokia, where he'll be serving as the company's Global Head of Developer Relations. As you may recall, Kerris only took on the HP job at the beginning of this year, having previously served as Chief Technology Officer at Lucasfilm. He's also not the first individual to chart this particular course -- designer Peter Skillman also left Palm / HP last year to take on a similar gig at Nokia, where he's since had a hand in the N9 and the company's new Lumia 800.
