Premier subscribers will still be able to take advantage of the perks provided by their accounts through the end of the year, but once the calendar flips to 2012 you'll be thrown back in with the rest of the riffraff. Gold members, who previously enjoyed discounted handset upgrades every year, will have through the end of 2012 to take advantage of one more subsidized phone. But, after that, they'll be on the same 22 month schedule as everyone else. Sorry folks, dem's da breaks. Check out the FAQ at the source link for more details.

[Thanks, Eric]
