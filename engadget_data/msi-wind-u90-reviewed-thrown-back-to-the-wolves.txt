 Laptop Mag would evidently like to make two things quite clear: if you pick up MSI's Wind U90, you better love SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 and be totally cool with the sub-2 hour battery life. For those of you still with us, you can probably guess that the 8.9-inch Wind didn't do so hot during its review, with those two rubs really overshadowing the solid design, great keyboard and delicious price tag ($350). For whatever reason, MSI figured it'd be peachy to toss a 3-cell battery in there and let mobile users just deal with the 1 hour, 39 minute lifespan; obviously, that's an issue serious road warriors can't ignore. If you're willing to pony up for an extra battery and install your own OS (if SUSE isn't your cup of tea), the Wind U90 might not make for a bad companion, but as-is, you better do some serious soul searching before pulling the trigger.
