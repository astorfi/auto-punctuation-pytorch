That's the good news, the bad newsis that this slider is debuting at $820 without contract and a bargain basement $700 with a 2 year. Of course you'vegot world roaming with GSM and CDMA support, but not a whole lot else, so here's hoping this rumor added a zerosomewhere in transmission.[Thanks, Karterius]Read
