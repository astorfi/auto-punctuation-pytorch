 No surprise here: Verizon announced today that they'll be carrying the UTStarcom XV6700, their rebadgedversion of the HTC Apache that Sprint sells as the PPC-6700. Not sure why anyone feels like they have to getUTStarcom's imprimatur on these phones, but just like the Sprint version the XV6700 runs Windows Mobile 5.0 and hasEV-DO, WiFi, Bluetooth, 64MB of RAM, 128MB of flash ROM, a miniSD memory card slot, a 1.3 megapixel digital camera, a416MHz processor, a 2.8-inch, 320 x 240 LCD display, and a slide-out QWERTY keyboard. Hits stores January 19th for$299.99 with a two-year service agreement.
