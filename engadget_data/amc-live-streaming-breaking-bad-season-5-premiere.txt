Good news are in for those of you who were affected by the ongoing kerfuffle between Dish and AMC: the TV network just announced it'll be live streaming the return of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman on its website. As you're likely aware, this announcement comes shortly after Dish Network revealed it was dropping the home of Breaking Bad and Mad Men from its lineup, after both parties couldn't reach a deal to keep the channel in place -- if there ever was one on the table to begin with. Nevertheless, AMC's taken it to the interwebs to stand its ground, and has rolled out a page inviting Dish customers to sign up for the free live stream of the season premiere this Sunday. Notably, TechCrunch reports an AMC rep told the site that "there's no real way for the network to verify that viewers are actually Dish subscribers," which pretty much opens the doors to anyone wanting to join the Season Five fun. The link to the nice streaming gesture is down below, so give it a bookmark if you're planning on tuning in.
