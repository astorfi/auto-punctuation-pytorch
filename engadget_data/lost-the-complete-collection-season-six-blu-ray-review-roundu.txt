After checking out a number of reviews, there's no doubt that the picture and audio quality on this release are top notch, if you, like us, were drawn in by the beautiful scenery and surroundings you'll get the best look possible here, a noticeable upgrade over the original broadcasts, along with a DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack. TheHDRoom notes the complete collection also includes D-BOX Motion Code on each disc, while the Complete Collection packaging hides secrets including an episode guide, game of Senet, UV light and more for the fans. One nice extra is Disney's SeasonPlay feature, which Home Theater Forum mentions will keep track of which episodes you've already watched, and make a bookmark where you leave off.

The Sixth Season has its own extras, including a new BD-Live connected Masters Program for Lost University attendees, New Man in Charge epilogue, commentaries and half hour featurette on the making of Lost's final season. Whether you found the series fantastic, infuriating or just skipped the whole phenomenon altogether, if you're not already mid-way through a Lost viewing party take a look at some of the reviews to see what you've been missing, or check out a few bonus clips embedded after the break..
