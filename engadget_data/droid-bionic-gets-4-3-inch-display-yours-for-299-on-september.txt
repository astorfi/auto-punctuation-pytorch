The latest round of spy shots come from a Best Buy flyer, a tips and tricks manual and a pic purported to come from Verizon's Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) system -- all of which lead us to believe launch is right around the corner. Most of the info here is not terribly surprising (an 8 megapixel camera, 1GHz dual-core processor, etc...), but there is one detail that threw us for a loop -- the screen is only 4.3-inches. Rumor had it that the Bionic had been bumped to a 4.5-incher, and photos of it next to a Charge seemed to bear that out. Well, that was primarily an illusion created by the large bezel and a pair of very petite hands. This also means the Droid HD is packing a 4.3-inch screen, which may disappoint those hoping for a truly expansive 720p display. On the plus side, we can tell you the Bionic will support WebTop, wireless printing, and ZumoCast for streaming media from your home PC. And per Droid Life, it'll be priced at $299 when it goes on sale September 8th. Now, we just have to wait for Verizon and Motorola to make it all official. Head on past the break for two images, and check the source links for even more.
