While 4,400 peeps currently inhabit the Reston location (which it inherited as Nextel's former HQ), the Overland Park campus already employs a much larger base of 13,000. The chief says that Sprint will maintain a "significant" presence out in its Reston offices, but the big boys and girls in the boardroom are going to find themselves back in the land of Toto, tornadoes, and Garmin in the not-too-distant future.[Via mocoNews]
