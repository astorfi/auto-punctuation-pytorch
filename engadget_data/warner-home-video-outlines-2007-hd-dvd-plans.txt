 Warner Home Video unveiled some of the highlights of its planned HD DVD lineup for 2007 tonight, highlighted by hits like The Matrix and the entire Harry Potter series. Six-time Golden Globe nominee The Departed hits on an HD DVD combo February 13, but it doesn't stop there. Ocean's 11 and Ocean's 12, as well as classics like Bullitt and The Getaway (1972) are also planned. Expect to see more Ultimate Collector's Editions like The Forbidden Planet on both HD DVD and Blu-ray this year. WHV has been the most prolific studio releasing on both high definition formats, not to mention putting HD content in other avenues like Xbox Live Video Marketplace, and as a result can claim to have six of the top ten selling HD DVD titles, led at #1 by Superman Returns.
