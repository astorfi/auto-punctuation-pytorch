The Motorola MOTOROI is definitely a stunner, but the looks are almost surpassed by just how amazing it feels, it glows with quality -- think Milestone, but somehow nicer. The display and UI on this Android 2.0 set are right on, with no lag to speak of -- in our really limited hanging-from-a-tether-being-jostled take on it -- while flipping about the OS. Sadly, like most other sets on display, the internet wasn't going anywhere for us to really take it for a spin. But, hey, the MOTOROI is apparently headed to the US in March, and we're without a doubt going to get a little more in-depth with this phone just as soon as we're able.
