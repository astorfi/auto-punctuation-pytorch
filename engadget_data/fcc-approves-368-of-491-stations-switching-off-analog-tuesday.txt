 In the daily DTV transition update, the FCC saw fit to hold up 123 of 491 stations planning to shut off analog TV on February 17, based on factors like whether or not there would be any stations still available in a given market. Those 123 can still make a case for going all digital by tomorrow evening, so even this list is not the final one. As it is, 368 stations are definitely making the switch, but with 5 days to go we still don't have a complete list of who is doing what, when, so stay tuned (if you can.)
