Japanese-language afficionados and manga otaku may be interested to know that someone's come up
with a Java app that lets you send and receive email in Japanese from your inferior Western cellphone. What possible
use is that to you? Have a Japanese friend email you that kanji character you're getting tattooed on your arm next
week—then at least you'll know it (a) exists and (b) is the right way up. (Made by
Omronsoft, though they don't divulge any info on their site; K-Tai Watch claims
they're going to sell it to handset makers rather than us individuals, which if true means Omronsoft is so off
our Christmas card list.)
