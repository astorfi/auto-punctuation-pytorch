Starting right about now, WWAN lovers can order up a LifeBook T5010, T1010, P1630 and / or T2020 with built-in support for AT&T's BroadbandConnect HSUPA network. For those who like to live on the CDMA side of life, the outfit is planning to add EV-DO support in Q2 of this year, though we're not told which carrier will be selected to carry that torch.
