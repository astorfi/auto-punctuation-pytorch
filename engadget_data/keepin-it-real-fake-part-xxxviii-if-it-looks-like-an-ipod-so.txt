Usually you can spot faux iPods a mile away, but this one takes fakery to a new level, right down to the plastic case that it comes in and the "Designed by Apple in California" on the back. Harry, a reader of the French Mac site MacBidouille, apparently found this psuedo-iPod nano in Thailand -- we're sure that Cupertino's cease-and-desist letters have already been drafted and are on their way across the Pacific as we speak.
