As far as these things go it's appropriately straightforward -- find tracks, buy them, play them on your device without using your PC. Of course, the whole concept kind of flies in the face of Apple's long standing philosophy of keeping your computer (read: your Mac) at the "center of your digital life" now that you can acquire content without using iTunes proper. But does this mean we can look forward to the Apple TV being able to download content directly from the store? Speaking of downloading video -- it's probably worth mentioning you can't download video over WiFi to the touch (and presumably also the iPhone). Hit the gallery for the full rundown on screens.
