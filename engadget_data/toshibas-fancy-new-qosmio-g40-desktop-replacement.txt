There's the "usual" 17-inch 1920 x 1200 screen, dual 200GB hard drives, T7300P Core 2 Duo processor (Santa Rosa), 2GB of RAM and other basic necessities like that, but things get extra interesting with the 512MB GeForce 8600M GT graphics, an HD DVD-R drive and HDMI 1.3. The laptop should be come to at least Europe in June, with an asking price of around 3000 euros (about $4004 US).[Via Electronista]
