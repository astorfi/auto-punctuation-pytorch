The mad scientists at DARPA are encouraged to come up with crazy schemes to provide the US with an edge in future military campaigns. It looks as if the Z-Man Program, presumably subtitled "project make soldiers climb walls like Spider-man," has come to a successful conclusion. Copying the physical structure of a Gecko's toe, a team at Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, Mass., has constructed a pair of paddles that enable a 218-pound human to scale a wall with a 50-pound load strapped to their back. Naturally, it'll be a while until we see snipers scaling enemy buildings with this sort of tech, but it's a damn sight more useful than suction cups or a strong rope and a lot of pulling.
