   We're back in our old digs, and boy do we have a lot of show for you. Tim and Brian kick things off in style with a high flying segment involving planes, all-terrain vehicles, a desert sandstorm and ultra-rugged cameras from Contour and GoPro. HD senior editor Richard Lawler sits down with Sony Electronics president Phil Molyneux to discuss the company's home entertainment strategy. Next up, we take a look at some of the month's hottest gadgets, including the new iPad, the Lytro camera and Samsung's Galaxy Note 10.1, before heading to Bedford, MA to check out the latest devices from iRobot. Mat Smith, Sean Cooper and Myriam Joire are your tour guides on our trip through this year's Mobile World Congress, and we wrap things up with a visit from media theorist Douglas Rushkoff to discuss his book, Program or be Programmed.
