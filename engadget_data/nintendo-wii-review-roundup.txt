We've got a collection of early adopter reviews to tide you over until Saturday night (or Sunday morning), and the general consensus is that you'll be pleased. Admittedly, the Wii's graphical output isn't up to snuff with its HD-toutin' brethren, but as PC Mag states, "within a half hour, you won't care." The big N apparently did everything right with its newfangled Wiimote, leaving reviewers "amazed" and craving just one more round of Bowling, but some folks did point out that the built-in software "lacked some promising features" and "felt unpolished" in some areas. Nevertheless, CNET probably said it best when they recommended that pixel freaks let the Xbox 360 or PS3 win over their hearts, while those clamoring for innovative, fresh gameplay should be more than pleased with Nintendo's $250 machine.Read - CNET (8 out of 10; Excellent)Read - PC Mag (4 out of 5; Editor's Choice)Read - Time (Recommended)Read - CNN Money ("A heck of a lot of fun.")
