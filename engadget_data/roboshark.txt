Roboshark, a robotic shark used to film real sharks for a BBC documentary will soon be the main attraction at a
giant robotic aquarium in Birmingham, England, set to open in 2006.  Visitors will be able to explore the
aquarium, which also includes robotic tuna and stingrays, in mini submarine pods.  Best of all, Roboshark is
programed to enjoy a spot of human hunting, which could prove interesting as the facility will also be used to train
scuba divers.  This sounds like the beginning of a bad sci-fi movie to us.
