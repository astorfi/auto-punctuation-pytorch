Scheduled for release on August 15th, the specs of the Gingerbread-toting gizmo haven't changed since we first spotted them. New to us, however, are the four hues we spied on the duo's website (which you can peep after the fold). Unfortunately for pigment lovers, one can only call dibs the black version this far out, but with more than a month before shipment, we'd pull the trigger anyway -- you've got more than enough time to sweat color choices, we say.
