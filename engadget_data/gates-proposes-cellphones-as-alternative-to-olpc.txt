  Looks like it's getting harder to separate Bill Gates the aggressive monopolist from Bill Gates thesaintly man of the year. While hobnobbing with the world's elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,last week, Gates (pictured above at CES) proposed an alternative to Nicholas Negroponte's vaunted $100 One Laptop PerChild program: cheap smartphones that could be used as computers. According to reports, both Gates and Microsoft CTOCraig J. Mundie talked up the idea of a specially designed smartphone that could be connected to a TV and keyboard,turning it into a full-fledged computer. "Everyone is going to have a cellphone," Mundie said. While we haveno doubt that Gates is sincere in his desire to help get the world's poor connected, reports also point out that he wasdisappointed that Negroponte chose Linux for OLPC -- even after Gates offered an open-source version of Windows CE topower the laptop. A Windows-powered smartphone could get Microsoft back into the game and assist the man of the yearwith his efforts to help the downtrodden.
