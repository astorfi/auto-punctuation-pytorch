We're sure they could sense we'd all want to have a Nigel Barker moment, when really we should be focusing on the fact that this camera can shoot 31.6 friggin megapixels. It should be out later this year -- not as though you'll be able to afford it. Well, not you Bill, just pretty much everybody else.
