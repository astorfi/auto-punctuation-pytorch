According to user reports stemming from Atlanta / Alpharetta, Georgia and certain sections of Michigan, they too are enjoying the luxury of recording one high-def program while viewing another live. We fully expect the carrier to spread the 2HD / 2SD service to more of the country here soon, but until it decides to open its own mouth, we'd highly recommend keeping an eye on your box for a certain surprise.
