We've seen a whole lot of crap that people can hang on
their dogs, but rarely do we see a genuinely useful product like the GPS PRO Dog collar from Environmental Studies that
helps your pet without humiliating her. Simply strap the collar around your beloved's neck, and as long as the built-in
receiver can pull in both GPS and GSM signals, you can call the collar from anywhere in the world and get texted back
with its exact location (or view a map on a smartphone). Both collar and harness-mounted versions are available, but
you better remember to insert a SIM card and charge the batteries at least every five days, or this becomes the only
non-Vuitton, non-Tiffany's, non-functional $1000 dog collar we've ever come across.
