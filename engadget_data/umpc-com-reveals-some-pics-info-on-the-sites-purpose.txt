Botha "usage" and a "FAQ" section are available to the public, with the former being of more interestas it has pictures of people using an as-yet-unseen UMPC with a slide-out keyboard. The rest of the material isbasically generic marketing and n00b information regarding UMPCs and the purpose of the site, but a few of the folks inthe photos look like they're having an awfully good time with their mini PCs, which has gotten us just that much moreexcited about March 9th.
