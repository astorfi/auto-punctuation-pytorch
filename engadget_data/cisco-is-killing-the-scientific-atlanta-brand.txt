 When Cisco first acquired Scientific Atlanta back in 2006, we wondered how long it would take before the brand was dropped and it appears that CES 2008 is the time. In an attempt to make the Cisco brand as well known in the consumer market as it is in the information technology field; according to Ken Wirt, Cisco's vice president of consumer marketing, when Cisco announces it's new set-top boxes at CES, all the new gear will proudly carry the Cisco name. Hopefully, with the new brand will come better products, as most people unlucky enough to experience Scientific Atlanta's SARA software will tell you, it's in contention for the worst home media experience around.
