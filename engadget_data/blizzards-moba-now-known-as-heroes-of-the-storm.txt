This is the second change in the game's title, as it was originally known as Blizzard DOTA prior to Blizzard's settlement of a lawsuit with Valve in May 2012 over the use of the trademarked term DOTA. The term stands for "Defense of the Ancients," a fan-made map for Blizzard's Warcraft 3. The settlement stipulated that Valve could continue using "DOTA" commercially in selling games such as DOTA 2, and forced Blizzard to change its MOBA game to Blizzard All-Stars.

Blizzard filed a trademark application for Heroes of the Storm just a few weeks ago, so the publisher certainly won't be changing the game's title again, unless it does so out of boredom.
