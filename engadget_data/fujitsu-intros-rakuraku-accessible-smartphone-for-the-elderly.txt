There's devices like the Jitterbug, but they're not particularly "smart." Fujitsu's latest entrant in its RakuRaku line, however, is loaded with friendly features and hardware designed specifically with the elderly in mind -- and it runs Android. When it lands in Japan this August it'll sport a customized UI with large text and oversized virtual buttons. Even the few physical buttons are large and easy to operate for those whose agility may be waning. The screen is even able to distinguish between accidental touches and purposeful taps. To see the device in action check out the video after the break.
