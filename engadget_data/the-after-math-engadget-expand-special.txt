 Welcome to The After Math, where we attempt to summarize this week's tech news through numbers, decimal places and percentages.
 Last weekend, we wrapped up our inaugural Expand event, and while several of our international editors (yours truly included) are still battling an unhappy combo of jet lag and the sniffles, we've pulled together some numbers that should offer at least a glimpse at how the weekend in San Francisco all went down. What if you missed out on all the tech, discussions, Engadget editors and giveaways this time? We wouldn't worry. Next stop, New York.
