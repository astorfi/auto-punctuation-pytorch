If you'll recall, this isn't the first time (this month) that we've seen a rather believable hint that such an occurrence was on the way, and generally speaking, smokes tends to signal fire. We were always curious about Palm's choice to launch this directly at high-end business users without giving it to a carrier, and apparently, it's been curious as well. So, anyone got any outlandish guesses on a release date?[Thanks, Hugh]
