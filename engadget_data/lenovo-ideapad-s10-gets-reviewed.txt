As you might expect, while they did find the netbook to be one of the most stylish options currently avaialble, they also found quite a few trade-offs, including a slightly less spacious keyboard than is normally found on a 10-inch netbook, and an unfortunately weak three-cell battery. Somewhat notably, they also found that while the S10 was a "bit warmer" than other netbooks, it wasn't the worst they've seen, with the highest measured temperature being 101Â° fahrenheit, which is a bit less toasty than some earlier reports. Be sure to hit up the read link below for the full rundown, including some benchmarks and, of course, plenty of pictures.
