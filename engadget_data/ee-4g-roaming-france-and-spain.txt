If you're an EE customer, and reading this on the 12:15 from St Pancras International, then you can continue to do so -- over 4G -- once you emerge from the tunnel without it costing you un bras or une jambe. That's because the UK network has just announced it's offering 4G roaming in France and Spain. EE states that you'll be able to get 100MB of 4G roaming data for Â£3, which is probably less than the price of a Eurostar coffee. While the deal covers just the two countries at the moment, EE states that this is the beginning of a broader scheme that will see similar agreements in the USA, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Netherlands just in time for your summer holiday.
