In an effort to increase popularity of the league in the US, MLS announced a new broadcasting partnership with ESPN, FOX and Univision. As part of the deal with these TV networks, which will run through 2022, MLS is bringing (some) out-market games to ESPN3. That, of course, includes the WatchESPN applications and the ESPN3 website. For Major League Soccer, this is a huge step, as it previously kept these games tied to one of its subscription services, including MLS Direct Kick and MLS Live. According to ESPN, the agreement is for "more than 200 MLS matches" per season, over the next eight years -- for reference, 323 matches were played during the 2013 season, not taking into account the playoffs. 



          
 
 
 What's more, ESPN will now be able to provide access to more extensive coverage of MLS through its digital properties, such as the SportsCenter and ESPN FC apps, with things like in-progress highlights being pushed to your mobile device. At the announcement event in NYC, ESPN President John Skipper said the goal is to have viewers "engage in a whole new way with MLS," adding that the network is "bullish on where the sport is going." So, now you won't have to worry about missing those New York Red Bulls games the next time you go visit your family, wherever outside of the tri-state area that may be.[Image credit: Getty Images]
