LG had its own Ultra HD news to reveal here at CEDIA 2013, and first up are two new edge LED lit LCD TVs joining the family. The cheaper models the company announced in Korea last month are coming to the US this month, with the 65-inch LA9650 (shown above) rocking a $5,000 price tag, and the 55-inch coming home for just $3,500 -- even less than we'd expected. Coming along with the new TVs is an LG "Sound Plate" it first showed off at IFA (pictured after the break). There's no price or release date yet, but expect it to hit in Q4. Beyond the new TVs, LG is also slashing prices on its existing lineup, with the higher end LA9700 models in the same sizes dropping to $6,500 and $4,500. Concerned about needing HDMI 2.0 in the future? We don't have firm answers yet, but LG says it's working on a solution for existing models. Even its 55-inch curved OLED TV is getting a price break, dropping down to $10,000 at retail from its previous launch price of $14,000.

Latest 65- and 55-inch Class Ultra HD TVs DemonstrateLG's Commitment to the New Market Segment
DENVER, Sept. 27, 2013 – LG Electronics USA today introduced its newest series of Ultra High Definition TVs, furthering its prominence in the Ultra HD* market by increasing its lineup to five models.

Officially announced in conjunction with the start of the 2013 Custom Electronic Design and Installation Association (CEDIA) Expo, the new LG LA9650 series comes in 65- and 55-inch class sizes (64.7- and 54.6-inch diagonal, respectively) and features a native Ultra HD screen resolution of 3,820 x 2,160 for superior picture quality.

The 65 and 55-inch class LA9650 Ultra HD TVs will be available through U.S. retailers beginning this month at suggested prices of $4,999 and $3,499, respectively. These new sets join LG's LA9700 series 65- and 55-inch class (64.7- and 54.6-inch diagonal, respectively) Ultra HD TVs, which are now priced at $6,499 and $4,499, respectively. The step up LA9700 series features LG's proprietary NANO FULL LED array backlighting and unique sliding speaker. LG's award-winning 84-inch class (84.04 inch diagonal) LM9600 sells for $16,999.

"This time last year we became the first manufacturer to launch an Ultra HD TV in the U.S. with our revolutionary 84-inch class model," said Jay Vandenbree, senior vice president, home entertainment, LG Electronics USA, Inc. "Today, we're solidifying our leadership role in Ultra HD TV by rounding out our lineup that displays 8 million pixels and incorporates technologies that allow consumers to enjoy Ultra HD picture even without 4K content."

Picture Quality and MoreThe LA9650 series delivers a stunning Ultra HD picture in an edge-lit LED screen – quadrupling the resolution of Full HD TVs – and that also includes LG's Smart TV and CINEMA 3D technologies. With picture quality the central focus, LG included its LED Plus technology, which provides great brightness control through edge LED local dimming, delivering better contrast. The TV's IPS panel display provides true-to-life color and contrast even at wide viewing angles.

To ensure consumers will be able to enjoy almost any content (Full HD, HD or Standard definition) in Ultra HD, LG has implemented is "Tru-ULTRA HD Engine," which is a series of algorithms designed to upscale content. Equally significant, it incorporates the new H.265 high efficiency video coding (HEVC) decoder, making these models forward-compatible if content providers begin to utilize this new standard for encoding broadcast or streaming content.

LG's Smart TV platform is included with the LA9650 series, offering users access to thousands of proprietary apps, premium content services including Netflix, Hulu Plus and more**. With LG Smart TV platform, users can access LG's "3D World," where blockbuster 3D content is available. Additionally, LG Smart Share simplifies the process of accessing content from other devices, such as smartphones, tablets and laptops, through a number of connectivity options. DLNA, WiDi, Miracast™, MHL™ and 2nd Display provide a plethora of possibilities for streaming and sharing content.

Users can easily navigate LG's expansive Smart TV ecosystem using LG's four-mode Magic Remote, which acts like an air mouse with point and click capabilities, plus gesture commands, a scroll wheel and voice recognition capable of recognizing how people naturally speak rather than only simple commands.
