 Well, would you look at this. No sooner than LG gets official with its second HD DVD / Blu-ray hybrid player, along comes Samsung with more details on its forthcoming competitor. The device will indeed support HDi and BD-Java, tout HQV video processing, and play back imagery at 1080p24. Additionally, users can look forward to "selectable DVD upconversion (720p / 1080i / 1080p)," coaxial / optical digital audio connections, Dolby Digital / Digital Plus / TrueHD / DTS-HD support, HDMI 1.3, component / composite / S-Video outputs, MPEG2, VC-1, H.264 and HD JPEG decoding, and an Ethernet port for good measure. Unfortunately, the release date is still a bit vague, but we do know it'll run you $999 when it lands sometime during Q4. [Warning: PDF read link]
