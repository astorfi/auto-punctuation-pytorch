We couldn't glean any info as to whether these will support HSDPA as well, butwhat we do know is that the compact X60 'books score you an XGA 12.1-inch screen, 7.5 hours of battery life, and weigh2.7 pounds, while the T60 line (pictured) sports 15.1-inch displays, but still keeps things light and skinny at 4.5pounds and 1-inch thick. All the laptops are privy to PCI-Express graphics, with the T60p running the 256MB ATI FireGLcard, and the T60 line can support serial ATA drives and up to 4GBs of RAM.[Thanks, The Futonhow]
