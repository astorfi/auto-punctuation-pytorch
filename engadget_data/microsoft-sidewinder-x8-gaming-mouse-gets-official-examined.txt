Those touches include a play and charge system to let you keep playing while your battery recharges, switchable DPI settings, interchangeable feet to suit your "glide preference," seven programmable buttons, and a dedicated macro record button, to name a few. Unfortunately, you're going to have to wait even longer to get your hands on this one, with it only set to be released in February, 2009 (for $100), but you can at least get a good idea of what's in store by hitting up Maximum PC's hands-on below.Read - Microsoft Press ReleaseRead - Maximum PC, "Hands-on with Microsoft's SideWinder X8 Mouse"
