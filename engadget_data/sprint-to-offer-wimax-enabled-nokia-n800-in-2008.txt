According to LinuxDevices, the operator "will offer a mobile WiMAX-enabled version of Nokia's N800 Internet Tablet to North American customers next year," which reportedly falls in line with the carrier's grand scheme of making 4G services available "to over 100 million people during 2008." Furthermore, Nokia's director of open source, Dr. Ari Jaaksi, was quoted as saying that this here device would "most probably" include WiFi and Bluetooth as well, but as expected, no details regarding a specific launch timeframe were divulged.[Via JustAMP]
