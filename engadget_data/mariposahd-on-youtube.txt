We can understand your hesitance in expending your bandwidth to download nearly a gig (1.5GB for the 1080p flavor) just to watch something you might not like. Well, mariposaHD is now on YouTube -- kind of. The producers put a promo clip on the site so people can easily see what they are all about. The only thing is that YouTube doesn't do HD and the show is based around beauty that works oh-so-well with high-def. Even still, it is worth peeping if you're still not on the mariposaHD bandwagon.
