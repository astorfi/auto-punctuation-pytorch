 
Since releasing the initial Blu-ray players on the market years ago, Sony has been lagging a little behind in regards to features. Today that's about to change as the top of the line BDP-S770 (pictured above) not only supports 3D, but also has built in WiFi, and iPhone/iPod Touch app for a remote (in addition to the standard remote) and plenty of streaming options like Netflix, Amazon and many others. The BDP-S570 also has built in WiFi, but unlike the 770, it will require a firmware update before DLNA works. The BDP-S370 brings the line home which is similar to its bigger brothers but requires an optional WiFi adapter if you need wireless.
