Reports are coming in from early adopters that their MacBook Airs are on the way, with some projected arrivals as early as February 1st -- pretty much right on target for Apple's projected two week wait. The rest of you suckers who dilly dallied in your purchasing decision might have to wait a bit longer, and potentially be subject to the humiliation of the laptop hitting stores before it arrives on your doorstep.
