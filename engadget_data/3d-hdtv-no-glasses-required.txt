Seems like 3D glasses are taking a beating this week.
Newsight Corporation has developed a technique for displaying HDTV in 3D without the need for wearing special glasses.
The technique uses software processing to pass HD video streams through a converter chip that creates eight stereo
views on-the-fly. When a filter is applied to project each of the eight views in a slightly different direction on an
LCD monitor, the human eye picks up the different scenes and composites them into a coherent three-dimensional view. We
hope this means horror movies are about to get a whole lot scarier.
