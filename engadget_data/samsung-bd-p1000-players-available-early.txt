Through the magic of early shipments and clueless retail employees, at least two guys were able to walk home with their high definition DVD players (after making the mandatory $999 charitable donation), and one of them was able to get several Blu-ray movies to boot. Not much to report yet, although both have noted a couple glitches already, but it remains to be seen if that is a consistent problem. The one individual who was able to get hold of Blu-ray movies reported excellent PQ, loading time around half that of the Toshiba HD-XA1, although he preferred the Toshiba unit's much-maligned remote. If Blu-ray is your choice or you just feel like taking one for the team, you may want to stop by Best Buy on your lunch break. Those guys at Samsung really know how to debunk rumors of a delay, imagine that sitting next to your HDTV right now.
