Remember that stay-at-home-dad who's been obsessively
converting a PEZ dispenser into an MP3 player from his basement? Well, he's finally taking orders for his product.
For $99US, you get a 512MB flash-based MP3 and WMA player which doubles as a USB2.0 mass storage device. The single AAA
battery provides up to 20 hours of tasty licks on the included earbud headphones â€” hell, it even comes preloaded with
"Indie tracks" (any chance that'll include the Jackie-O MF reissues?). All this in an old-school PEZ "Pal Boy"
dispenser; go get your kitsch on and support an underdog, we're sure
Cupertino won't mind.
