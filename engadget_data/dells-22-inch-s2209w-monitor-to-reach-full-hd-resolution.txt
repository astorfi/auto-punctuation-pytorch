Now it looks like Dell is about to change that with the introduction of a newly designed, S2209W monitor with rumored 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution. The evidence stems from that prototype pictured above as well as drivers already available on Dell's support site. Still not sure how we feel about the piano-black, Samsung-esque design, though. One more snap after the break.[Thanks, Alex P.]Read -- Dell drivers Read -- Prototype
