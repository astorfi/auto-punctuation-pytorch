The folks at Hipstamatic know better than to mess with success. Their flagship photo filter app will continue to evolve, albeit slowly. More dramatic experiments in business model and UI design will instead show up in Oggl, the company's newest app that doesn't stray too far from the mold. The basic functionality is the same: snap a pic, edit it then post it for others to see. There are some key differences, however, besides the obvious aesthetic ones. Perhaps the most striking is the new business model, where users are charged $0.99 a month or $9.99 a year for full access to the library of Hipstamatic photo effects. There's also a focus on building a photo-sharing community around Oggl, much in the way Instagram has. The app is invite only (and we're still waiting for ours), but when it launches later this week the crowded high-brow photo sharing space will have yet another competitor.
