Alongside some good hints that it'll house a high-capacity battery like the RAZR Maxx series, we'd hazard a guess that there's a kevlar finish to that red weave pattern, although we'll probably have to wait for that incoming Motorola event before we're able to clarify that. Fortunate, then, that it will all kick off with Verizon in just a few days.
