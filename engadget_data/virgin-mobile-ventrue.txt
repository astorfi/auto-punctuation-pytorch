   Alcatel OneTouch isn't a heavy hitter in the States, but that doesn't stop it from doing its darndest to push devices here with a little help from distributor PCD. The Venture is the latest model and is heading to Virgin Mobile on March 15th with an option to pre-order right now. What it's got is actually not too shabby for a $100 prepaid messaging device: Android 2.3, 2.8-inch touchscreen, 600MHz single-core CPU, 2MP camera with LED flash and 512MB of RAM.
