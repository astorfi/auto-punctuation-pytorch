In a session at MIX10, Microsoft's Charlie Kindel has laid down the law that WP7S will be 800 x 480 -- just 800 x 480 -- at launch, a message we heard at MWC last month, but the new tidbit here is that there'll be 480 x 320 in the pipe for an unannounced later date. All devices will have precisely the same amount of available RAM and the same capacitive touch capability, and as we've already know, manufacturers will be able to tack on a keyboard if they like.
