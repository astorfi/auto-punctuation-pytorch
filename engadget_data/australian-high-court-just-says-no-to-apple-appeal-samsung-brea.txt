Undaunted, Apple vowed to appeal the Korean company's victory to the High Court of Australia, and today, The Register reports that the court has denied Apple's appeal. Details are sparse as to why Cupertino's arguments were unpersuasive, but one thing's for sure: Samsung's going to have a much more merry Christmas as a result of its latest legal victory.
