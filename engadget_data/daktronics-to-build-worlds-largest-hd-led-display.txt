Big news, people: we've just placed an order for a new TV set, and we guarantee it's gonna be bigger than anything
you've ever seen. Arriving soon at Engadget Stadium (currently Dolphins Stadium, but Santa knows we've been extra-good
this year) is a megaginormous flat-panel LED screen that measures—are you ready for this—freakin' 1,750-inches diagonal
(props to our man Pythagoras for the assist on the calculation). Our new baby is being custom built by South
Dakota-based Daktronics, and will feature a 2,112 x 736 (that's like 1.5 million pixels) resolution with a
super-widescreen format that puts 16:9 to shame. Unfortunately, this won't be available till next season, but that just
gives us extra time to build the 50TB DVR we're gonna need to capture all the action.


[Thanks, Omer]
