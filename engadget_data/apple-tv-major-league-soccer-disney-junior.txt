It seems that Apple's taking its little hobby more seriously with each passing day. Not long after adding a slew of new features to Apple TV, the company has quietly added two additional channels to its growing lineup: Major League Soccer and Disney Junior. For its part, the MLS app lets viewers watch live league matches with a $25-per-season subscription, while the latter offering brings video content for young ones but relies on participating cable providers for access, similarly to the Disney Channel and Disney XD. We should mention the pair of channels appear to be only available in the US, so fret not if some of you don't see these show up on your Apple TV's homescreen.
