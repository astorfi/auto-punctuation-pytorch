If the team at Georgia Tech's Mobile
Technologies Group has its way, you may soon be waving your cellphone around in order to play games with it. The group
has developed a system for gesture-based games that uses the cellphone's camera to track hand movement. Prototype games
include a version of Pong in which the player moves the whole phone to the left and right to control a paddle, and a
drawing program that they say "demonstrates the various degrees of freedom." We can only imagine what kind of gestures
they'll put together so you can play Doom on your phone.
