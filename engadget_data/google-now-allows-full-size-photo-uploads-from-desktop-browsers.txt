 As glad as we are that Google gave mobile photographers the chance to upload full-size photos to Google+ back in December, the absence of a desktop equivalent has been more than a little conspicuous. We're back to equilibrium now that Google has enabled full-size uploading from any old computer's browser. Enable the option and a collection can hit the servers just as you'd remembered it. Like with mobile uploads, though, this isn't intended as a large-scale backup service: any images more than 2,048 pixels across (or videos over 15 minutes) will still count towards whatever your Google Drive cap may be. Don't upload a gigapixel-class photo of your vacation, then, but do know you'll have a safe place to store everyday photos in all their original glory.
