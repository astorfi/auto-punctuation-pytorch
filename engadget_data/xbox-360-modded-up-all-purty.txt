Those same nerds modders responsible for that first
evar Xbox 360 hack, the relatively
modest controller LED swap, have really upped the bar
with their first 360 case mod. Along with the
obvious bling, they boosted the fans to 12V for better cooling, and internally mounted a 60GB USB drive that plugs into
an external port, allowing for a PC connection if needed. We can only mourn the playtime lost at the hands of this
little project, but modders will be modders.
