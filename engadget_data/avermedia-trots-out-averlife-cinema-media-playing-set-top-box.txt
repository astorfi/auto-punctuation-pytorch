 
Need a new digital media player? Can't say that you have any particular need for network connectivity? We're guessing you're in the minority, but hey, that's what Avermedia's here for. The company has just introduced its newest media playing STB, the AVerLife Cinema. The relatively simplistic box supports a variety of multimedia files, and it plays back content on USB 2.0 drives or memory cards at up to 720p over HDMI; it should be noted that component and composite outputs are also included for those operating with a set from yesteryear. The dearth of an Ethernet port or WiFi module is a downer for sure, but the comparatively low $69.99 price point just about makes up for it. It should be available starting today for those interested.
