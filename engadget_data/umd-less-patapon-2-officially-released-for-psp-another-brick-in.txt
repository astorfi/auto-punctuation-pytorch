The followup game is now available as a digital download on the PSN, and as a redemption code voucher in retail locations. The sans-UMD format is a United States only test for Sony, and certainly leads us to wonder if that UMD-less PSP could possibly, potentially be in the works. The $19.99 title is available today, disc-less PSP available in your wildest dreams.
