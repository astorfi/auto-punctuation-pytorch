Their new range of Lumix compacts has some considerable spec bumps, and even if the designs do seem a little "safe" after Samsung's recent release, we're sure most consumers could fine a decent fit among the new lineup. Headlining is the DMC-LX2 (pictured), a successor to their LX1 which introduced the first compact 16:9 widescreen sensor. The LX2 bumps the megapixels to 10.2, has a 2.8-inch widescreen LCD, ISO 3200 (though not at full resolution) and intelligent ISO control that can automatically adjust for the sudden movement of a subject. Despite the increase in resolution, Panasonic claims they've significantly reduced noise thanks to their Venus III engine. The LX2 also includes a 4x zoom, and optical image stabilisation. Next up we have the DMC-FX50 and FX07, dual successors to the FX01 shooter. Both of them share a 7.2 megapixel CCD, 3.6x zoom, optical image stabilisation, and that Venus III processor, ISO 3200 and intelligent ISO control featured in big brother LX2. The FX50 goes for a new 3-inch screen, while the FX07 sticks with 2.5-inches and manages a slightly more compact body. Finally, the DMC-FX3 takes some cues from its siblings, but cuts the megapixels to 6. The optical image stabilisation is always welcome, but the ISO 1600 and 3x zoom specs are a bit more standard. Some of the best news here is the prices for these four cameras, ranging from the $500 LX2 ($100 cheaper than the initial LX1 pricetag) to $280 for the FX3. All four should be out some time this September. Keep reading for pics of the rest of the lineup.Read - DMC-LX2Read - DMC-FX50 & DMC-FX07Read - DMC-FX3
