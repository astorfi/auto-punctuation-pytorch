Whether your flavor is streaming, Blu-ray or plain old DVD there's something helpful that's been built via the company's API, including queue managers for iPhone or other mobile device, or websites offering a different level of organization for the Watch Instantly directory like InstantWatcher or Flicks-Now and to organize all those bits and pieces it's launched the App Gallery to let users see them and rate which are the best. Take a sec and check it out, there's only a dozen or so items listed so far but we wouldn't be surprised if there's already one that makes your rental experience a little easier.[Via The Netflix Blog]
