We officially don't condone using these for remotely stalking your latest crush, but a company called Cyber
Defense Systems is trying to commercialize a line of low-cost battery-powered aerial surveillance drones similar to the
unmanned aerial vehicles the US military currently uses in Iraq and Afghanistan that are simple enough to be operated
by anyone who knows their way around a joystick (which pretty much equals 100% of our readership). They're aiming these
primarily at law enforcement (a police force in Maryland already used one of the company's CyberBug UAVs to keep tabs
on a recent "community event"), but they're also hoping that there'll be plenty of businesses (like power plants,
contractors, TV stations, etc.) that'll want to use these, too.
