The interface appears to be equivalent, however running it will require the installation of Adobe AIR on your Android 2.2 or higher device (no tablet optimizations yet and there's no Honeycomb mention in the press release after the break, but it's probably on the list after the iPad-optimized version drops later this month). The downsides are still the same however, only TV subscribers to ESPNNetworks enabled providers (Time Warner Cable, Bright House or Verizon FiOS TV) can stream everything (ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3 and ESPNU) while those with just FiOS internet can access ESPN3, and all others are locked out entirely. If you have the right service plan, click the market link below to download the app (there's another app in the market called Watch ESPN Free, but we'd probably avoid that for now) for free.
