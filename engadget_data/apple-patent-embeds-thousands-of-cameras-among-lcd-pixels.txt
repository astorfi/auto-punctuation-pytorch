 Oh Barry Fox, does a week ever go by when you don't find a great patent or two? Today the intrepid Mr. Foxmanages to dig up an application by consumer-darling Apple for an LCD display embedded with thousands of microscopicimage sensors that would allow users to video-conference while looking straight into the "camera." Dataaccumulated by the individual sensors would be stitched into actual images using special software, which will probablybe bundled into future versions of iLife. Since the patent specifies almost as many sensors per screen as there arepixels, some of those sensors could have different focal lengths, with a defacto zoom lens created by switching betweenthem. Apple goes on to suggest portable uses for the technology, such as employing the displays in cellphones and PDAs,so you can add another item to the list of features we'll be expecting from the iPhone and Newton 2.0 when they finallyhit stores.[Via New Scientist]
