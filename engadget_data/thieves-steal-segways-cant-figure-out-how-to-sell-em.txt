You know it's harsh when you hear that thieves who managed to swipe ten of your $5,000+
product—Segways in this case—get away scot free,
and can't even figure out a way to sell the product on the gray market. Apparently the ten scooters were found in mint
condition after sitting in a warehouse for four months, abandoned by the perps. Sheez guys, haven't you ever heard of
eBay or Craigslist?
