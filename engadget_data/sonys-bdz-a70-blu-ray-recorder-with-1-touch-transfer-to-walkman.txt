As a Blu-ray recorder, the BDZ-A70 features all the in/outs you'd expect and recording to a 320GB (the new BDZ-T90 offers 500GB) disk or dual-layer BD-RE media from a host of analog and digital tuners. Great, but what's most notable here is the new one-touch video transfer to Sony's PSP, select mobile phones including NTT DoCoMo's FOMA 905i, and video Walkmans like Sony's new NW-A820. As you may have noticed, those last two are Japanese products. Appropriate given the Japan-only launch of these players in April for about Â¥170,000 ($1,658). Still, we're pretty sure they'll go global soon enough. Quickie demonstration video after the break. [Via Impress]
