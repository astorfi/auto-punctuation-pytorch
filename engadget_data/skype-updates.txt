The Windows flavor gained various UI improvements, including a pinnable contacts list, backwards-compatible video rendering for older machines and better Facebook integration. Meanwhile, the Mac version got a similarly refreshed interface, improved screen sharing for premium users and a bunch of fixes necessary to get the software ready for Mountain Lion. Over on the Linux table, users will find improved video and audio quality along with a raft of minor bug fixes and improvements. The revised versions are available to grab as soon as you re-launch the phone-troubling software.
