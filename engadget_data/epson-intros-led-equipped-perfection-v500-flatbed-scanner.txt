Sporting a 6400dpi optical resolution and 48-bit color depth, the V500 steps it way up by also throwing in the firm's ReadyScan LED technology, "which delivers fast scans and no warm-up time." Furthermore, you can expect nonexistent wait times when flipping between reflective and film scanning, less power usage, and a LED that automatically "adjusts the color of the light source based on the type of original being scanned, using white light for positive film and blue light for negative film." Not too shabby at all for $249.99, and for those needing an Automatic Document Feeder, the optional add-on will soon be available for $199.99.
