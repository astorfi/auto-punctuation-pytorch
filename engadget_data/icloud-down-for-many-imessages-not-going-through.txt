We've received many reports of iCloud and iMessage problems and, looking online, plenty of other folks are issuing the same complaints. Seeing something amiss on your end? Add your experiences in comments below -- while you still can.

 Update: Luke wrote in to let us know that Apple has acknowledged the issue. "Normal service will be restored ASAP."

 Update 2: "All services are online." That's as of 4:06 ET.   [Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
