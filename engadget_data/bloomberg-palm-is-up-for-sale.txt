That's pretty wild news, considering CEO Jon Rubinstein was adamant just a few days ago that Palm had a plan to get profitable -- even while his company's stock price went on a buyout-rumor fueled rollercoaster. Bloomberg says that Palm's already retained Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners to find a buyer, with HTC (yes!) and Lenovo both expressing interest -- and Dell's apparently already taken a pass. Naturally none of these parties are saying anything on the record -- we just pinged Palm and they declined comment -- but if this is true, things are about to get wild, and fast. We'll keep you updated, stay tuned.
