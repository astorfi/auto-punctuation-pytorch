  Although the PlayStation Vita's official US launch brought with it the pleasures of LiveTweeting, WiFi-only Netflix access and Flickr's photo-based networking, its Facebook, Foursquare and Skype apps were curiously absent. Today that's partially changed, however, as Sony's announced that the service that Zuckerberg built is now available as a free 12MB download from the PlayStation Store (on the wall of its PlayStation Facebook profile no less). We've gained access to the social network without a hitch, so be sure to let us know how it goes on your side of the screen in the comments. Hopefully it's more pleasing than AR table soccer.
