While the date has been rumored before, now TechnoBuffalo has posted the image above showing off the date and details, while Phandroid also points out that source code for the FF18 update has already arrived on Samsung's servers indicating a release is imminent. That the update is showing up just in time to still be out of date now that Jelly Bean is officially shipping however, still puts just a little drizzle on the parade.
