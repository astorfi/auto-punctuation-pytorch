Verizon's subscription streaming TV service, Redbox Instant, now supports Apple's AirPlay thanks to a new version 1.4 iOS app update -- with some caveats. For starters, though you'll be able to play streaming content on your iOS 6 device, the app doesn't support downloaded material as yet. Also, your viewing may be broken off if you receive texts and certain notifications, if you lock the device or if you quit Redbox to use another app. Meanwhile, AirPlay Mirroring, which lets you play from your device with your TV as a second screen, will still work just fine. Other tweaks include the usual bug fixes and improvements to the recommendations engine. So, if you've got Apple TV and want to give it a whirl, hit the source -- just make sure to tell your pals not to contact you mid-film.
