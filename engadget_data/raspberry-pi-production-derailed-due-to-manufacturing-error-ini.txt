  Those Raspberry Pi Linux PCs you've been waiting on? Well, they've hit another "bump in the road" no thanks to a manufacturing process error. The production gaffe, which integrated non-magnetic jacks where the opposite was clearly needed, resulted in a backlog of defective devices incapable of achieving network connectivity. The company's managed to rectify the gaffe easily, as repairs are reportedly already underway, so if you've place an early order your shipment should still arrive on time. Further setbacks are expected, however, for later batches due to an unforeseen component shortage. Schadenfreude types can delight themselves with additional shots of these faulty ports in question at the source below.
