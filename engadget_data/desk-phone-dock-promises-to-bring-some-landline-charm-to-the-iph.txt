Complete details (including pricing and availability) will apparently have to wait until then, but the dock does promise to charge and sync your iPhone while it's in place, and it will function as a speakerphone as well if you don't feel like using the handset -- or simply as speaker for your iPhone, for that matter (that's a volume knob / mute button on top). Unfortunately, we won't be at the fair to check it out first hand, but we'll certainly be keeping a close watch on this one.
