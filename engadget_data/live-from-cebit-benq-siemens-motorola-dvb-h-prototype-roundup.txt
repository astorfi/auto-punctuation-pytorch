 

Today, we found two additional unannouncedDVB-H devices from Motorola (pictured) and Sagem at the T-Mobile Germany booth as the country, or rather, major citiesin Germany gear up for the launch of digital mobile TV before the FIFA World Cup. We also learned the deets behind thetelephony capabilities of that BenQ-Siemensdevice we brought you yesterday -- it's tri-band GSM/GPRS, features a 3.6-inch 640 x 480 262k color TFT display,250 minutes talk time, 1.3 megapixel camera, USB-host mode, 64MB of memory with memory card expansion (which we can'tsee, but that's what they are saying), and a media player capable of MP3 / AAC and (unspecified) video playback. Picsof all three devices after the break.

Hey, a 1.3megapixel shooter.
Sagem also joining the party.
Here's a viewat the OS level on that BenQ-Siemens device. As reader Eugenia points out, looks like Trolltech's Linux-based Qtopia.
