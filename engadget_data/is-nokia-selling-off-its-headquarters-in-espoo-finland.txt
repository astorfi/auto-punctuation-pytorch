 Just how deep do Nokia's financial woes go? According to Finnish journal Helsingin Sanomat and Reuters, deep enough that it's mulling the sale of Nokia House, its principal HQ located in Espoo, Finland. The company told the journals that it's looking to divest "non-core parts" of its business, "and that includes the headquarters," according to a spokesman. Since Nokia has lost billions just in the last two quarters alone, it is likely looking for cash wherever it can and its Espoo property is worth $250-400 million, according to Helsingin. However, the cellphone maker is adamant it would stay in its home country, and could remain a primary tenant in the sprawling complex after such a sale. If they do unload the property, we're just glad we recently got some souvenirs.
