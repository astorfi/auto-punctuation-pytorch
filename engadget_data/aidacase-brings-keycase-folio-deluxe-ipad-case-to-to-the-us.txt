That naturally includes the same Bluetooth keyboard as before, but AIDACASE has opted to use a micro USB cable instead of an Apple dock connector for charging the keyboard, and it's added a new magnetic flap to keep the case securely closed. Otherwise, the case looks to be identical to the non-deluxe version, and it's available on Amazon right now for $100. Full press release is after the break.
