You may remember Neuros as the company who had
those early "backpack" audio devices, and more recently (soft-)launched their
442. Well, they've long tried to rock the open-source
firmware for their products, but now it seems like they're stepping it up for some much-anticipated advances in their
next device. Not only are they going directly to the audiophile crowd—a group largely un-catered to by the portable
media device market—for input on their forthcoming player, but they're actually eliciting said audiophiles' help in
designing the hardware platform. The product is still in the planning phase, but the "open-source" platform they're
going with will run Linux and can support (but may not necessarily feature) a 200MHz ARM CPU, up to 128MB of SDRAM and
8MB of flash, USB 2.0, SD/MMC/CF slots, 10/100 Ethernet, S-Video out, 24/96 audio I/O, and SP-DIF. Anyhow, the real
news here remains the paradigm shift back to the old school when personal computers were almost infinitely hackable;
herein a niche product is developed not solely by a devicemaker's team, but with the welcome help of the wayfaring
light of the actual user base. Next step: completely user-created electronics, designed by audiophiles through online
collaboration for small manufacturing runs.
