 
Just in time to catch some portable audio buzz runoff from yesterday's Apple madness, we present the iRiver S10, the South Korean company's latest D-Click input-based portable media device. The scant 17.5g / 42 x 30 x 10.8mm device features 2GB of storage, MP3, OGG, and WMA playback (presume PlaysForSure, of course), as well as an 8 hour battery life. We hope you'll forgive us as details are thin at this hour and only CNET Asia's got the skinny on it, but we'll update you guys as we can.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
