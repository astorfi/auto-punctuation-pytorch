Our Chinese bureau had a chance to go hands-on with the trio of Micro Four Thirds cams at an event in Hong Kong, and walked away with some fairly positive impressions. The $900 E-P3 feels solidly built, and did appear to offer excellent autofocus performance, though we weren't able to verify Olympus's rather lofty claims that the new flagship model features "the world's fastest autofocus." We were able to capture an image within a second of tapping the shutter button, including the time required to refocus on a subject. The 3-inch OLED display was sufficiently bright for outdoor use, with noticeable improvements over its predecessor, and the touchscreen was a pleasure to use, offering three straightforward shooting functions -- focus, focus and shoot, and enlarge. We'll have additional details to share after spending more time with all three models, but our hands-on photos in the gallery below should help whet your appetite in the meantime.
