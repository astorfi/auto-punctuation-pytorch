This is totally not replacing HDTV for a good million years or so, but NHK
of Japan has demoed some "Super Hi-Vision" TV running at 7680 x 4320 â€” 16 times the resolution of that lame old 1080i
your grandparents are talking about. The demo involved a live feed from a couple of custom built cameras based around 8
megapixel CCDs, with their 24Gbps signal being chopped into 16 HD signals and sent 161 miles over a fiber optic network
to the the demo site at the 2005 World Exposition in Aichi Japan. So the good news is that they can rock the live TV
with this technology, but the gooder news is that this isn't even out of the labs yet, so that brand spanking new HDTV
of yours won't be going out of style anytime soon.
