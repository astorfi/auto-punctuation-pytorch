 Nabaztag was only just birthed onto these golden shores to the quivering delight of geeks a-plenty. Now, just like you'd expect from a dirty, drrrty French bunny, Violet got busy on the quick and conceived Nabaztag/tag for release into the Internet wilds. On display at DEMOfall starting today, Nabaztag part deux brings all that 9-inches of WiFi interactivity only now with a fully-functional mic in the belly for two-way, verbal communication and the ability to play podcasts and web radio. Just an additional Jackson to take the $169 Nabaztag/tag home starting November 18th. [Via NetworkWorld]
