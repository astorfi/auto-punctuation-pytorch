They say there's no such thing as bad publicity, but we somehow
suspect that Apple is none too pleased about the latest buzz over the iPod nano, which increasingly has come to focus
on how scratch-prone the player is. The
latest salvo comes in the form of a new class action lawsuit, in which international plaintiffs, mainly from Mexico and
the UK, are joining their American counterparts in suing the company for alleged product defects. Attorney Steve
Berman, who also represents American plaintiffs in their suit
against Apple, commented: "It seems that wherever the Nano is sold, problems with the defective design soon
follow." Of course, this could just be an attempt by Berman to add some pesos and pounds to the dollars he'll get if
there's a favorable verdict or settlement, but we doubt this is a part of what Stevie J. had in mind when he whipped
that nano out of his pants pocket a couple of months ago.
