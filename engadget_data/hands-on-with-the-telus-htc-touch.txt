While nothing much has changed under the hood -- well, except for double the RAM, ROM on the GSM variant and a 400 MHz CPU -- we thought it only proper to do up a gallery and present it to you. As a quick reminder if you're pondering picking one up, these are sitting comfortably chez Telus at $99 on a three year bit or $499 free and clear. Hit the pics below to see the gallery.
