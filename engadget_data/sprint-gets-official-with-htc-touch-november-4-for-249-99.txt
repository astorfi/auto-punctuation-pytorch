Sprint today has officially announced its HTC Touch, a device codenamed "Vogue" that brings all of the original's unique personality to the world of CDMA (and, thankfully, EV-DO). Besides the touted support for 3G data, features include a 2 megapixel cam, microSD slot with support for up to 4GB of expansion, Windows Mobile 6 Professional with HTC's TouchFLO interface, and comprehensive support for Sprint's media features including Sprint TV and the Sprint Music Store, all packed into a shell measuring 4 x 2.4 x 0.6 inches and weighing in at 4 ounces (trust us, it looks and feels pretty flippin' small). Interested parties don't have terribly long to wait, either -- look for it to start showing up in retail channels November 4 for a penny under $250 on contract with rebates.
