Two research projects from the University of Essex are using a combination of Linux, tiny embedded computer modules,
and Bluetooth to control fleets of unmanned aircraft that can fly in formation and perform parallel, distributed
computing tasks. The Gridswarm project uses model aerobatic trainers that can fly at speeds up 120mph, while the
Ultraswarm project uses co-axial helicopters that can fly indoors (seen at right). That helicopter also apparently has
the distinction of being the world's smallest flying web server. Kind of brings a whole new meaning to a server crash
(forgive us).
