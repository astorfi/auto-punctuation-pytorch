 YouTube asks nicely if you would like to post comments using your Google+ name, and now a similar change has quietly made it to the Play Store. When we say similar, we mean in this case, you're forced into revealing your true identity from now on -- at least when you're accessing Google's virtual marketplace from a browser. We'd guess that linking ratings and reviews to your account ties in with the enhanced Google+ integration recently added to the app, and will serve to provide better download recommendations based on your profile and friends. The requirement, however, has not yet been implemented in the app, so if you've been meaning to leave a few damning reviews, this loophole is your last chance to do so anonymously.
