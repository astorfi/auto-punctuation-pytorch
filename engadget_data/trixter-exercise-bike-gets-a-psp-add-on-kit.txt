Of course, we're not sure if this newfangled motivational tool will help you melt off the pounds like other systems we've seen, but the half-hearted attempt to integrate the PSP into an exercise bike allows users to watch movies (or fitness tapes) whilst burning calories. Interestingly, the product page doesn't mention the possibility of gaming, but we see no reason why the uber-coordinated couldn't mash a few buttons while maintaining their balance on the bike, so feel free to drop your $100 if you know you're in that elite crowd.[Via Joystiq]
