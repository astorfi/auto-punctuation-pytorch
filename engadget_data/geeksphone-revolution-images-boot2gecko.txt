Though we were able to tell you all about the Geeksphone Revolution's specs last month, the gestation-themed stock photo gave no clue as to how it actually looked. Now, we finally have pictures of the Firefox OS/Android multiOS handset (there's another after the break) and a further description of how it'll work. First off, Geeksphone is referring to the Firefox OS option using the original "Boot2Gecko by Mozilla" name, since Geeksphone isn't licensed to use the Firefox brand or logo. It'll come with Android installed (a version hasn't been specified yet) but you'll be able to switch to Boot2Gecko or "any other community-supported ROM" via a user-friendly graphical interface with "just a couple of clicks." That'll also let you get OTA updates for whichever OS option you choose, along with any additional software packages. As for the phone's hardware, you'll still get a dual-core 1.6GHz Intel Atom CPU, 4.7-inch 960 x 540 screen, 1GB of RAM and 8-megapixel rear/2-megapixel front cameras. There's still no sign of a release date and, more importantly, the price -- that'll no doubt weed out those willing try the MultiOS device from those who prefer the devil they know.


Update: Geeksphone has got back to us again to clarify why it's not using the Firefox OS brand and how switching the OS will work, so we've updated the post. See below for its (translated) statement:



The name Firefox OS and the logo Firefox are registered trademarks owned by Mozilla. Up to this date, there is no certification process known by Geeksphone for its use by independent manufacturers (not associated with a mobile carrier). When this process is available, Geeksphone will obtain such authorization for its terminals. Since it's a branding issue, code and functionality is exactly the same.


The phone may change OS with just a couple clicks, through a user friendly graphical interface. In this manner, it may also receive updates OTA or install additional software packages.
