"Wedon't take a stand in that fight, and actually we're very sorry that fight is happening," a Fujitsu-Siemens exectold Reuters. The move isn't exactly a shock: Fujitsu has already declared its neutrality, and Siemens has neverendorsed either platform. And Fujitsu-Siemens is hardly a major force in the global market for HD hardware (though theydo make the world's mostdesirable laptop, which has to count for something). Still, we doubt this makes either Toshiba or Sony very happy.As far as they're concerned, when it comes to next-gen data and HD media, there can be only one.
