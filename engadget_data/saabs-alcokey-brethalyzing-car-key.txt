The Alcolock, the
Alco-Detector, so many
breathalyzers being built into so many devices these days, it's
almost enough to make us wonder whether or not everyone is always functionally drunk, and we're just too sober and
oblivious to know it. Now Saab's getting on the wagon (the bandwagon, if you will) with their Alcokey, which will add
$400 to the pricetag of your car and will not disarm an integrated engine immobilizer unless you can breathe good and
sober into the device pictured. It's being trialed first in Saab's home country of Sweden, so maybe they're also taking
on opportunity to make a statement about a little too much Absolut sippy sippy going on this bitter Winter. Or maybe
they're just being progressive, socially conscious Europeans. You know, either way.
