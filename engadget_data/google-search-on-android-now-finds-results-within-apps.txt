As much as Google's search business revolves around the web, the company knows that mobile apps sometimes have more relevant info. Accordingly, Google has updated Android's native search app and its web-based search to take you directly to content within certain apps -- an actor's biography in IMDB, for example. Only a handful of titles support the feature, although more are on the way. You won't have to worry if you don't have the software just yet, though, as the update also puts Google Play app shortcuts in result pages. Both of the app-savvy search features are available today.
