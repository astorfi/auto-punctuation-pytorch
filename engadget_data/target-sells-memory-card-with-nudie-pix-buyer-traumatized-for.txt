 It's not the first time someonehas been surprised to find some fleshy pics on their electronics, and it certainly won't be the last. Aleta Kelleyof Tucson was, quote "shocked I mean absolutely shocked, there is no other word" to find nearly 80 nude andgraphic photos of a middle-aged woman on her supposedly new memory card she purchased at Target. Apparently inpreparation for her bizillion-dollar lawsuit, she goes on spewing, "to me this is traumatizing, for my daughterthis was traumatizing. It's horrifying to think if my granddaughter had gotten this." Of course you know what thismeans don't you? Target memory card sales are about to skyrocket!
