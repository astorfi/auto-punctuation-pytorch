Leading the list of attention-grabbing specifications is the monitor's 2560 x 1600 (or WQXGA) resolution which, when combined with the dual DVI inputs, can also be split down the middle to let you use two computers at 1200 x 1600 apiece. Otherwise, Eizo says you'll get 100% coverage of the NTSC color gamut, along with a 900:1 contrast ratio, a brightness rating of 260cd/m2, and a pair of USB 2.0 ports, among other more common features. Look for it to set you back around $2,555 when it lands this December.[Via Engadget Japanese]
