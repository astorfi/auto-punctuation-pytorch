It's not enough to simply strap an action camera on your helmet these days; now that you can mount a camera on a drone or get one built-in, aerial sports footage is the way to go. And GoPro knows it, apparently. The Wall Street Journal hears that GoPro is creating its own line of camera-equipped multirotor drones. Details are scarce at this early stage, but the range is meant to cost between $500 to $1,000 and should ship by the end of 2015. The company isn't confirming the rumor, although it's not too worried about being late to the party -- as a spokesman tells the Journal, plenty of people are already capturing footage with GoPro cams strapped to unmanned aircraft. With that said, it's likely eager to have its own airborne robotic camera before DJI, Parrot and other drone makers become too powerful.
