We're still looking for an unsaturated WiFi network to get things setup, but until the impressions roll in, we couldn't resist bringing you a first look at what's easily the most beautiful Galaxy Tab to date from a nerd's perspective. The 8.6mm frame is thinner than thin, and there's enough gloss on the front panel to chunk your mirror and just multi-task with this. The star of the show, of course, is the vanilla rear, bespeckled with Androids and oozing with geek love. Have a glance at the video below the break!
