Velocity Micro's Cruz Tablet has finally hit the shipping stage, and sure enough, it's doing so in the month that was promised back in September. $299.99 lands you a 7-inch Android 2.0 tablet with an 800 x 480 capacitive touch panel, 512MB of RAM, 12GB of total storage, 802.11n WiFi, inbuilt speakers, a headphone jack, mini-USB port and a rechargeable Li-ion good for around ten hours of use -- or so they say. Of course, you'll be stuck accessing the Cruz Market rather than the bona fide Android Market, and you can forget about embedded 3G. But hey, it's three Benjamins sans any sort of life-altering contract. And that's got to count for something, right?
