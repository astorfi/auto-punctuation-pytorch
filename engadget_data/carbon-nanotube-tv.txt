It's just a proof of concept for now, but still â€” it's essentially the real deal. Applied Nanotech has demoed a
25-inch display powered by carbon nanotubes, which are extremely tiny (about 50,000 times thinner than a human hair)
tubes that are strong, yet flexible. Apparently one of the advantages of such a display is a complete lack of ghosting,
and perhaps quite a bit of power savings as well. Applied Nanotech is aiming to use the technology to produce a 1280 x
720 resolution 80-inch screen. Until then, we're stuck with this curious low-res video to catch a glimpse of that rosy
future.
