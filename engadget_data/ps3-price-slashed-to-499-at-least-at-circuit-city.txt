Sony's perennially overpriced PS3 is about to get a welcome pricebreak to the tune of $100, at least according to a scan of an upcoming Circuit City advertisement leaked onto the interwebs. That puts the console at $499, and with the 5 free Blu-ray movies Sony is tossing in with every purchase, there's never been a better time to buy. The promotion runs from July 15th to the 21st, and there's no word if that price drop will stick, if it has Sony's blessing, or if will get expanded to other retailers, but we'll all hope for the best.[Via Joystiq; thanks to everyone who sent this in]Update: GameDaily is reporting this is going to be an official change of price as of July 12th, which is, surprise surprise, during E3. We'll keep an eye on this.
