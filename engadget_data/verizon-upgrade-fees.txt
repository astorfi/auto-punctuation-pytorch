  Ah, it was only a matter of time before Verizon decided to jump on the bandwagon of ridiculously high upgrade fees, now that Sprint and AT&T have both exercised the option. Big Red announced this morning that April 22nd will be the magic date in which it will charge you a cool $30 just for the privilege of purchasing a subsidized handset and signing a fresh two-year commitment. Granted, it's still less than the $36 sum that Verizon's two largest competitors now demand, but we're going in the wrong direction here, folks. Catch the dreary announcement after the break.
      

 

  Show full PR text  On April 22, Verizon Wireless is implementing a $30 upgrade fee for existing customers purchasing new mobile equipment at a discounted price with a two-year contract. This fee will help us continue to provide customers with the level of service and support they have come to expect which includes Wireless Workshops, online educational tools, and consultations with experts who provide advice and guidance on devices that are more sophisticated than ever.  While the upgrade fee is not unique to Verizon Wireless, most devices can be traded in with our green friendly trade-in program at www.verizonwireless.com/tradein as a way to save money or potentially offset the fee completely.
