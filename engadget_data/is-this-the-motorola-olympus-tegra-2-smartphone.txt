At first glance, it looks like a Motorola Defy. Closer inspection, however, reveals a slightly elongated speaker above the Motorola logo, different volume controls down the right-hand side, and possibly a front-facing camera top-left. We've already seen the words "Motorola" and "Olympus" cohabiting in the official UPnP Forum with bluetooth 2.1 + EDR and dual-band 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi confirmed by the Bluetooth SIG and WiFi Alliance. What this is, we can only guess. See a second snap after the break.
