From New England to DC to the beautiful Pacific Coast, HD VOD seems to be sweeping across nearly every FiOS TV area. Early reports are stating that quality looks "just as good as broadcast [HD programming]," but we're out to see if it really is everyone that's invited to the party. Got FiOS TV? Yeah? Well, do you suddenly have HD VOD? Chime in with your locale below.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
