 Sprint's efforts to bring LTE to the masses have led to a large amount of frustration from the consumer base, but an announcement made by the carrier this morning shows that it's hard at work to rectify that. The Now Network is nearly ready to blanket up to 100 markets with the high-speed data tech in the near future, and the full list of cities (shown after the break) can expect to enjoy LTE in the "coming months." That leaves a whole lot of wiggle room for Sprint, admittedly, but at least the company is not backing away from its Network Vision goals. Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, Miami, New Orleans, Orlando, Philadelphia and Washington DC are among the major markets listed, but take a look below to see if your municipality has made the cut this time around.

  Sprint 4G LTE service is expected to be available in the coming months in Chicago, Boston, New York and Los Angeles. And that's not all. We expect to bring Sprint's all-new network to more than 100 new cities during this period.
