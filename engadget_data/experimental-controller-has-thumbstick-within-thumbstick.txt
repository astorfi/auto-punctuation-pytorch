  Just when you thought slingshots were the future, here comes a whole new way to enjoy baddie deletion in Uncharted 7. Each thumbstick on the prototype controller above has a secondary force feedback-enabled nub at its center, which moves independently and creates different sensations by stretching the skin on the pad of your opposable digit. In the video after the break, the designers at the University of Utah show how they've created effects for crawling, collisions, explosions and even fishing. They're apparently hoping to push their technology into next-gen games consoles, but they'll have to join the queue.
