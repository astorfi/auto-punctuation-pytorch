Word on the playground says Creative won't even be invited to Apple's birthday party. But as much of a tantrum as it looks like, leveraging their considerable IP on interface design might be Apple's best shot at getting through their legal woes, and they sure seem to be taking it. The new suit refers to three patents regarding icon use, and displaying and editing data. Apple is also asking for cash damages, a court order to stop Creative from further infringement and a block on imports of Creative's current players. We're pretty sure the prior meaning of "Zen" got lost somewhere along the way.[Via iLounge]
