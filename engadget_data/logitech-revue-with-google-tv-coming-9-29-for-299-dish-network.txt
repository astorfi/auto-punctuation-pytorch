According to our industrious tipster, the Revue is slated to launch on September 29, just two weeks from now, with an MSRP of $299. But, if you happen to be a Dish subscriber, you can get one (and only one) for the heavily discounted price of $179. Our noble tipster also got some pictures of the keyboard, which match perfectly those captured earlier this month by good 'ol Mr. Blurrycam and, while we can't be 100% sure about these details, this deal certainly would go a long way toward explaining why attendees to Google's Zeitgeist event recently walked away with six free months of Dish service.
