 
Hot on the heels of the Engadget iPhone headcount (12, if you didn't know), the very first Engadget iReturn has taken place. After ten and a half hours of waiting in line -- but less than 24 hours of actual ownership -- iPhone number one has been taken back to the store, citing "janky keyboard" and "no money for rent" as reasons behind the return. Note the look of utter shock, confusion, and hurt on the face of the Apple employee as she notified us of their 10% restocking fee (after the break).
