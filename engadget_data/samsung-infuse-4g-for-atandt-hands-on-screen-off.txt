When it launches on AT&T it'll be the thinnest smartphone in the inventory. Heck, it's profile makes our iPhone look downright husky -- of course, with that size, the trade-off we'll be interested to see is how the battery performs. Unfortunately, Samsung wouldn't let us fire it up for a look under the hood but with CES just barely started, we've plenty of time to work our way into their hearts for a real tour. Have a peek below.
