The Disney BD-Live Network demo highlights Movie Chat instant messaging, Movie Mail for sharing video content and online interactive gaming that can be used to collect Disney Reward points. It's pretty good-looking stuff, and definitely leaves us with a better impression than, say, Yakuza Fighter. The Movie Mail demo came off as a little creepy to us, but that has to do with the content rather than the tech. The big question is, how many profile 2.0 players (besides the PS3) will be on the market when the title ships on October 7? The marketing folks from Disney had something to say about that -- hit the video after the jump to check it out.[Via HollywoodInHighDef]
