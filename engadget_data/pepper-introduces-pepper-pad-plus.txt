 Pepper an updated version of too-cutely named Pepper Pad tablet device, the Pepper Pad Plus. This new padpromises 60 percent greater battery capacity, as well as WiFi 802.11g, a 30GB hard disk and Bluetooth 2.0. The rest ofthe specs seem about on par with the previous version, including a 624MHz processor, 256MB of RAM, and 800x600 8.4-inchLCD touchscreen.Â  Price comes in at just under $800 after a $50 mail-in rebate.[Via I4U]
