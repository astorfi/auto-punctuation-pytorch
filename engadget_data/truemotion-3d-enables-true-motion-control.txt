Rather than relying solely on an accelerometer, this controller uses a magnetic field to track both your hands' positions in 3D space. With a refresh rate of ten milliseconds and accuracy up to a millimeter, and interest from developers including Activision and EA, this guy could someday relegate your Sixaxis to the back of your junk drawer -- right next to your old Atari's paddle controller. Not convinced? Scope the tell-all demo after the break.READ - video at Engineering TVREAD - Sixense website
