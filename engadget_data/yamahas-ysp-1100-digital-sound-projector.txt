Like the YSP-1000 it replaces, the YSP-1100 is said to do a decent job of creating the illusion of surround-sound by bouncing sound off the walls via 40 built-in beam drivers and 2 built-in woofers with 42 corresponding digital amplifiers. However, the YSP-1100 brings a larger sweet-spot than its predecessor, an RS-232 port, IR in/out, component-video in/out, and an improved version of Yamaha's IntelliBeam automated system calibration to adjust the sound for best effect. Yours for $1,699 starting September, if you dare. [Thanks, Mike P]
