Destined for HDTVs, receivers, Blu-ray players and the like, the new port processor and transmitter have the extremely specific sample delivery date of "second half of 2009" so while we certainly don't expect to see any actual hardware until well into next year, keep an ear to the ground if you're considering an upgrade before then.
