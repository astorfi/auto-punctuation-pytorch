If you're still on the fence about committing $20 a month to Sling TV's "Best of Live TV," the streaming option is adding a few more channels. Before the end of March, A&E, History, H2 and Lifetime will be available on the service that's hoping you'll ditch cable. That handful of channels will be part of the core live TV package, which will tally 20 networks once those arrive. Of course, this means shows like Vikings, Bates Motel, Duck Dynasty and Project Runway are all joining the streaming lineup. In addition to the new channels, Sling TV is adding two new add-on packs that expand the basic channel library. "Lifestyle Extra" includes things like truTV, Cooking Channel and DIY, while the new "World News Extra" provides access to Bloomberg, HLN, and other news networks around the world. If you'll recall, the additional bundles cost $5 per month, and will be offered alongside the "Sports Extra," "Hollywood Extra" and "Kids Extra" packages, bringing the total "Extras" to five.
