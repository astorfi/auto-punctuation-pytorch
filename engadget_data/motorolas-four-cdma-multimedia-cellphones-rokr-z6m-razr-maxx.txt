First up, the RAZR maxx Ve king headed to Verizon which Moto has been teasing us with for a few months. It's what we expected: ultra-thin, EVDO, and 2 megapixel camera with integrated music player and touch-sensitive controls. The Z6m slider (which looks like a CDMA RIZR Z3) hopes to shake the original (E1) ROKR's fumbled hype. The Z6m multi-modal slider packs a 2 megapixel camera, stereo Bluetooth or 3.5-mm headphone jack to get tethered, and up to 2GB of removable memory. The W385 and W355 bring multimedia on a budget with a mix of GPS location services, Bluetooth, and FM radio. Now go ahead, check the gallery for all the pics -- don't cost nothin'.
