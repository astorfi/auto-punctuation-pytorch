Now, Nokia Maps will officially be ported to non-Finish-manufactured Microsoft handsets, but when exactly it might land in the Marketplace is anyone's guess. If you've jailbroken your WP7 device, then there's no need to wait any longer. Simply head on over the XDA forums (at the source link) and sideload it. While you're there, you might as well grab Drive too -- after all, what good is a map app without voice-guided navigation.
