Thankfully, Jill Fehrenbacher of Inhabitat (disclaimer: as many of you know, Jill is wife to Engadget co-founder and editor-at-large Peter Rojas) and Marc Alt of Marc Alt and Partners have stepped up to the plate, and are launching the Greener Gadgets conference. We'll be there participating in the discussion, as well as execs and environmental technologists from OLPC, HP, Nokia, and Sony. It all goes down on February 1st in New York, hopefully we'll see you there!
