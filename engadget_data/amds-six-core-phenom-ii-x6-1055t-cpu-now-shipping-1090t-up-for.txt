Just a month after unearthing clock speeds and proposed release quarters for AMD's gaggle of six-core Phenom II X6 processors, two of 'em have already popped up on Amazon. The 2.8GHz Phenom II X6 1055T is actually shipping as we speak for $222.29, while the 3.2GHz Phenom II X6 1090T is up for pre-order at $324.65. The lower-end 2.6GHz 1035T and 3.0GHz 1075T are both nowhere to be found (yet, anyway), and the mysterious 1095T isn't even supposed to pop up anywhere until Q4. So, who's getting themselves a new slab of silicon? Don't be bashful.
