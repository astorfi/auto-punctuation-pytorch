So youcan imagine why we're feeling the square 3.3-inch wide Skwarim external USB 2.0 drive designed by Karim Rashid (whodone work for Issei Miyake and Prada, and is the creator of an Engadget fav, the Umbra Oh Chair). Available in 60 or30GB sizes and his n' hers colors with a distinctive "bulging" pattern for $200 and $150, respectively.
