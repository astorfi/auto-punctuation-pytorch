They're claiming full 2560 x 1600 resolution gaming (that'd be native res on Apple's 30-inchCinema Display and Dell's 3007WFP) on the dual-core AMD Athlon64 FX-60-based box, which also features (surprise, surprise) a liquid cooling system. How much? Well, uh, it starts at$6,929, but we configured one online to just shy of $8,800 (without monitor and peripherals). So, just howmuch do you love gaming?
