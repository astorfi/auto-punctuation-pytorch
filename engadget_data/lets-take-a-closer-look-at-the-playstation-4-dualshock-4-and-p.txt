After getting a deeper hands-on with the PlayStation 4 and its very thorough tech demo today, The Playroom, we wanted to show you all the bells and whistles of the new console, its new controller and the new PlayStation 4 Eye. So we shot a video with Sony Japan's Nicolas Doucet and walked through the game's various demos. If you're looking for a thorough walkthrough of the various new PlayStation hardware, look no further. It's just below the break.
