What some didn't expect is for Blu-ray to continue to outsell HD DVD overall, despite the fact Blu-ray didn't have any notable titles that week. But wait you ask, didn't Transformers sell more copies than any other movie? Well, that's where it gets interesting, while Paramount claims they sold 190k copies, Nielsen only counted 115k. Some might say that's because they don't count Wal-Mart, and while that could be the case, the Wal-Mart near our house still doesn't carry either format. Judging by the titles in the list and how the list compares to last week's, we'd say that Blu-ray's buy one get one free deal went pretty well and we really can't wait to see what the HD DVD camp is willing to do to offset Spiderman 3 in a few weeks -- but we'd bet no matter what they do, it'll be good for the consumer.
