Can't find any specs for this one anywhere, but check out these shots of the E910, LG's latest cellphone with a
QWERTY keyboard. This takes after
Motorola's A630 (at least, more than
it takes after LG's own F9100),
and apparently might also be known as the VX9800 outside of Asia. Anyone know any more about this phone?
