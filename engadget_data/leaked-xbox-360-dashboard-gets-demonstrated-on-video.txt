We've already gotten a brief look at the new Xbox 360 Dashboard that's leaked out courtesy of the Kinect beta program, but now that it's well and truly leaked across the internet, we're getting a much better picture of what's in store for the rest of us later this fall. As you can see above and in the pair of videos after the break, the new Dashboard is decidedly squarer than the current one, and contains few elements that haven't gone untouched. You can also now even try out the new Dashboard yourself relatively easily, though you may run into a bit of trouble if you actually want to do thing like play games online.
