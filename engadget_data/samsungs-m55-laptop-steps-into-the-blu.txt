Otherwise, it's still the same ol' 17-inch laptop with 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution, up to 120GB of disk and 2GB memory, 256MB of GeForce Go 7600 graphics, Bluetooth 2.0 and 802.11a/b/g WiFi, and HDMI out for sharing the HD love with your XXL flat panel at home. Only this time, it's Blu-ray discs you'll be spinning to the bemusement of Toshiba. Yeah, "into the blue" Sammy... yuk yuk, we get it.
