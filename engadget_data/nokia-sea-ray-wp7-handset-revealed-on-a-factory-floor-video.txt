Now we have a whole new puddle of legumes lying on what sounds like a Chinese factory floor, courtesy of the authentic-looking video above. The clip reveals the N9-like device removed from what appears to be a stealth case, followed by a speedy boot-up into the Windows Phone OS. We're also treated to a quick look at the camera in action -- triggered by a dedicated shutter button that's missing on the N9 -- before a hurried "goodbye." There's not much else to see here, but could that reddish theme be a hint that this particular example is destined for Vodafone? Only time will tell.
