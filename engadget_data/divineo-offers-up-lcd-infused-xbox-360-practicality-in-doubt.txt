 No, we don't think this Xbox 360 case mod oddity takes the cake, but it ranks fairly high up there in the long list of mods that are impressive from a technical standpoint, but next to useless from a practicality stance. While we're sure just about anyone could find a plethora of utility in Ben Heck's LCD-equipped Xbox 360, the latest offering from Divineo (the same company which Sony loathes) slaps a 5.8-inch widescreen LCD onto the side of Microsoft's console, which actually enables gameplay right on the side of your machine. Of course, with such a wee screen, all hopes of multi-player battles are next to hopeless, and even single-player action just might put an unhealthy strain on your retinas. Nevertheless, the mod-happy firm is offering it up to anyone interested, and while we doubt these folks are actually selling US units, you can hit the read link for all the foreign details if you're so inclined. For those fairly confident that you won't be taking Divineo up on this questionably useful mod, you should still click on through for a live action video of this thing rocking out, but be very sure that you adore Metallica first, and don't say we didn't warn you.[Via Xbox 360 Fanboy]
