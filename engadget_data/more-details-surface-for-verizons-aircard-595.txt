A network is officially launching today, more details emerge for one of its supporting players in the role, the Sierra Wireless AirCard 595. The Roc was able to squeeze out some documents for the launch which according to the marketing sheet, is set for Friday, December 15th (hey, that's today!). It looks like the device is supposed to launch with an EV-DO Rev. 0 radio, will support Microsoft Vista, and is going to be upgradeable to Rev. A in a download via VZ Access Manager down the road, suggesting that folks may not be able to get their ultra-fast upstream on today after all. The device is going to cost you speed junkies $270 with no commitment, $150 on a one year, and $100 on a two year contract.Update: The 595 has just popped on Verizon's retail site -- click through to check it out!
