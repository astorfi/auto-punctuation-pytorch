Aiding rumors, for instance, are a collection of screenshots showing the phone running on both Verizon and Ma Bell's networks. A BriefMobile source says that the AT&T version of the oversized handset is being tested, as are T-Mobile, Bell Canada and Sprint variations. The AT&T version is said to be a dead ringer for the international model, retaining its quad-core Exynos processor while snubbing the network's branding. Much like Sammy itself, the source didn't have much to say about availability -- just "soon." Can't wait? Skip on down to the source link below to tease yourself with leaked screenshots.
