Amazon's been busy tweaking Prime and planning delivery drones these past months, but by the looks of it, it hasn't entirely forgotten its lesser-known services. Today, the company has updated the Cloud Drive Photos app for Android with a brand new interface and a navigation bar to make it easier to access your oft-used features. While the refreshed UI retains the older version's dark color scheme, it comes with new buttons and a new layout. The app now also automatically sorts all videos into one album and arranges photos and albums by date and name. Finally, other than the usual bucket of bug fixes, the new version adds an upload status indicator that shows how long you have to wait until you're done backing up your files. If these new features make you want to give the app a second chance despite being married to Google Drive or Dropbox, hit the Play link below.
