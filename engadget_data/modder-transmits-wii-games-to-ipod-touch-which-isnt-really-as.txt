For his next trick, our man has done the same thing on an iPod touch. But wait, you ask -- is there a LocationFree client for iPhone / iPod touch? We don't think so, so we've pinged him for an explanation. He's being extremely tight-lipped about it all, saying only that 1) this is not fake, 2) he got rid of the five second lag, and 3) all will be revealed "soon enough" (that is, once we've been tortured enough). If anything, we can certainly respect a man with a flair for showmanship! In the meantime, check out the video after the break. We'll let you know as soon as we hear back from the dude.
