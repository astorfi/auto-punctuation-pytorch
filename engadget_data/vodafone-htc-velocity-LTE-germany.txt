   HTC has confirmed plans to bring its very first LTE handset to Germany, with the launch of the Velocity. The phone, known Stateside as the Vivid and in South Korea as the Raider, features a 4.5-inch qHD touchscreen and is fueled by a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU. The Gingerbread-laced device also boasts 1GB of RAM, 16GB of flash memory and an eight-megapixel camera, along with your standard 1.3-megapixel front facing sensor. As far as networking goes, you'll find support for quadband GSM/GPRS/EDGE, dualband UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA at 900/2100 MHz and, most compelling, dualband LTE at 800/2600 MHz. Vodafone confirmed the news to Germany's Computer Woche, though it has yet to offer a price or release date.
