Have you invited a pal over to see the wonders of BD? Have you lobbied the benefits of 1080p films in an effort to get your best bud off of DVD and onto the real deal? Or are all your so-called "friends" just using you for your home theater? Bottom line: we're interested in knowing just how much the Blu-ray Disc Association owes you in sales royalties.
