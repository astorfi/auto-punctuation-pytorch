 Speed freaks rejoice! NTT DoCoMo has set a newrecord in its latest test of 4G mobile throughput. Using no fewer than six MIMO antennas, the company was able tosuccessfully transmit data at 2.5 Gbps while traveling at 12.5 miles per hour. In a similar test last May, DoCoMo wasable to achieve just 1 Gbps. Of course, it'll be a while before you can try this at home, since 4G standards have yetto be finalized. But, hey, at least we've got HSDPA.
