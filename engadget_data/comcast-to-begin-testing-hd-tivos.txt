       Oh how people love to hate Comcast's current HD DVR box - the Motorola 6412. Things are in the works to give their customers another option though. Comcast is about to start beta testing their own high-def TiVos. There aren't many details about the equipment as they are still in their early stages. There are some details about pricing over at this thread at AVS Forum and it seems that the TiVo service is going to be an extra charge on top of the DVR service fee. Hopefully Comcast gets these things out quick though as we know many of you would love to get rid of your Motorola 6412 even if it costs a few more bucks.
