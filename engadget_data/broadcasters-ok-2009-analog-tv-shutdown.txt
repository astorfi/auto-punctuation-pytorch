American broadcasters
have agreed to get out of the analog TV business on
January 1, 2009, paving the way for an auction of the analog spectrum that may raise as much as $30 billion. Meanwhile,
lawmakers continue to battle over plans to subsidize analog-to-digital converters for consumers. Up to 15% of
households continue to get their TV signal via over-the-air broadcast signals, and they will need to either upgrade to
cable, get digital TVs or buy converter boxes — estimated to cost $50 — to continue watching television after analog
signals are shut down.
