Now we can possibly start looking forward to a release date for such a teasing device since it's been passed fit for human consumption by the boys at the FCC. The test documents revealed it's got CDMA and GSM radios, will slurp down Verizon's LTE and pack an NFC chip -- but alas, no hint of whether we should be waiting for a version with a bigger battery.
