It doesn't seem fair to call the MSI Primo 81 a KIRF iPad mini. Sure, it looks a helluva like Apple's smaller tablet, but it wouldn't be accurate to call it an imposter either. What we have here is a 7.85-inch Android slate that actually uses the same IPS, 1,024 x 768, LG-made display as the mini, putting it a step above a knockoff, if you ask us. In addition to those shared viewing angles, the Primo 81 has nearly identical dimensions, and it's almost as thin too (7.8mm thick vs. 7.2 on the mini). Even the matte finish is similar to the iPad's, and the build quality isn't bad either, even if it isn't quite on par with what Apple has to offer. As it happens, the Primo 81 isn't headed to the US, so the specs might be irrelevant to you, but in case you're tuning in from overseas, this thing runs Android 4.2, powered by a quad-core Allwinner A315 processor, 1GB of RAM and a 3,500mAh battery. No word yet on price or an on-sale date, unfortunately. In the meantime, we've got hands-on shots of that below, along with the 7-inch Primo 73 and the Primo 93, which takes after the iPad 4 with a 9.7-inch screen. With rubber accents on that one, though, you'd hardly mistake it for an Apple product.
