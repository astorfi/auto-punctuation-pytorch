Microsoft seems intent on sanding away the Xbox brand's rough edges before launching the One this November. Following the recent switch from its arcane points system to local currency for digital purchases, Redmond has subtly changed up where you'll spend that money. What we used to know as the Xbox Live Marketplace is now the Xbox Game Store. It's clean, simple and we're pretty sure Sean Parker would approve. Oddly, in the US the web storefront reads "Xbox Games," but it says "Xbox Game Store" in the UK. Whatever -- as long as we can buy real-world presidents for Saint's Row 4, we're not too worried about the name of the store.
