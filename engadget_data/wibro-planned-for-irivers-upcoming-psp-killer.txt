Nothing like slapping a bit of bleeding edge technology into your forthcoming portable gaming handheld to grab a bit
of attention, and iRiver is doing just that with their announced plans for sticking
WiBro (that longer range, but slower tower
hander off-er) into their 2006 device. WiBro is looking to be Korea's Wi of choice, and iRiver is planning this device
for rollout along with the planned WiBro networks for South Korea. That's about all we know so far, other than their
aim to compete with the PSP with this guy. We'll keep you
posted, alright?
