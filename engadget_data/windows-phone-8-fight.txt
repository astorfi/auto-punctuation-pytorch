HTC's unveiled a pair of Windows Phone 8 devices that seem destined to square off against Nokia's similarly polycarbonated handsets. You may not be able to easily pick 'em out of a crowd, but there's plenty of differences on the inside, and let's be frank, that's where it counts. We've pitted the Windows Phone 8 flagships from HTC, Samsung and Nokia against each other to see which one's going to be getting your cash when it comes to renewal time, and Round One begins just as soon as you jump past the break... ding, ding, ding.
