Come early 2011, Netflix will appear on "select Android devices," according to the company's official blog, which also promises a "standard, platform-wide solution" for Android in the unspecified future. What took so long, and why will Netflix be limited to particular handsets when it first rolls out? "The hurdle has been the lack of a generic and complete platform security and content protection mechanism available for Android," says the blog, stating piracy concerns. Apparently content holders aren't too keen on making movies available unless devices have DRM baked right in, so the solution is equip new phones with padlocks one at a time. Expect next year's high-end Android devices to have "Netflix" as a nice big bullet point.
