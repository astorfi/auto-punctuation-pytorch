  The PlayStation Vita launches this week in the form of a "First Edition" bundle. The for-real hardware launch will take place on February 22. We'll be covering the hardware and its games continuously through that period, and rounding it up here for ease of reference.
      

 

 Hardware  PlayStation Vita review: "It offers the most power, the widest variety of input methods, and the most convenient method of getting new games, of any handheld system in history." Games   Uncharted: Golden Abyss: "... though Uncharted: Golden Abyss brings a little too much reality to Drake's day-to-day by making him polish artifacts in gimmicky touchscreen nonsense, there's still a good, if formulaic, adventure to be had." ★★★ 1/2   Little Deviants: "So ... you get a virtual house filled with square-headed cats. You can't do anything with them. They just sit there. " ★★   Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3: "Even with the trouble I had pulling off combos, and the frustration of feeling lost and alone in the lobby, I still think this is an amazing port in many respects. Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is a game I would consider far too flashy to fit on a handheld, and Capcom accomplished it." (no score given) Other features  Ultimate Controller mode: Vita and PS3 team up to play Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3  Welcome Park: Vita's built-in tutorial minigame collection
