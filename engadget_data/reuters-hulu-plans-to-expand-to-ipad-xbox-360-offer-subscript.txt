According to Reuters, two sources and "another with knowledge of the matter" say that Hulu will be rolling out to "multiple devices" in the next month or two -- only the iPad and Xbox 360 are mentioned by name -- and that it will indeed be offering a subscription service. As we had heard, the subscription service would apparently only be for older episodes of TV shows and other content -- you'd still be able to watch new episodes of shows for free -- and it sounds like it will apply to Hulu as a whole, not just those aforementioned devices. Not many more details than that, unfortunately, but this does certainly seem to be taking on a feeling of inevitability.
