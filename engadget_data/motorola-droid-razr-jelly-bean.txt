 Today is the day for Jelly Bean updates on older carrier-branded devices, apparently. In this round, it's the Verizon-branded Motorola Droid RAZR and RAZR Maxx that have the honor of being bestowed with Google Now, expanded notifications and the rest of everything Android 4.1 has to offer. The rollout will take place in phases, so don't be terribly concerned if you don't see the update showing up on your device right away. We haven't had the chance to play with it yet, but soak tests seemed to indicate that much of the Droid-related bloatware has been removed in favor of several stock Google apps; if you get the update, let us know in the comments if this is the case.
