If, however, you want that with WiMAX data and a talk show name, you'll want Sprint's special flavor, the EVO View 4G. At CTIA we were told that it was, of course, Android, but now Sprint's confirming that it'll come right out the door with Android 3.0, aka Honeycomb. That's the tablet taste that makes everybody come a runnin', and that this sucker will have it at launch (sometime "this summer") might just be good news for those pining for the WiFi-only Flyer, which as of last report would not be getting its own sweet taste until sometime after launch.

Update: Well, that didn't last long. Sprint has now tweaked the page to simply read the "latest version of Android," and a spokesman tells Android Central that while the "plan is to offer Honeycomb," it's still "too early to determine whether or not Honeycomb will be available at launch."
