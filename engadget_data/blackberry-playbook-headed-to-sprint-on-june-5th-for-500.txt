While the post has since been removed, Sprint Marketing Director Gerald Evans revealed on his personal blog earlier today that the WiFi-only, 16GB version of the tablet will be hitting Sprint stores on Sunday, June 5th for the usual $499.99. Unfortunately, there was no mention of the carrier's 4G version which, last we heard, was still on track for a summer release.

Update: And RIM's just made it official, also confirming that Sprint will support BlackBerry Bridge with no additional data charges. As for that 4G PlayBook, RIM is just saying that it and Sprint are still "working together" on it. Head on past the break for the full press release.
