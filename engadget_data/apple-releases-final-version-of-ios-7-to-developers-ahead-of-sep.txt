The general public has to wait until September 18th to get their hands on the final, non-beta version of iOS 7, but developers can get look at what's in store for that release starting today. Apple has just released the final version, or golden master, of iOS 7 though the usual dev channels. Expectedly, it's compatible with the iPhone 4 and later, as well as the iPad mini, iPad 2 and up, and the 5th-generation iPod touch.
