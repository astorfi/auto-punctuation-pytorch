The New York Times has a very interesting piece on newspapers going e-paper -- and we aren't talking Interneteditions. Besides the obvious discussion of dynamic ads, how much e-papers will cost, and the when, where, and how,we're presented with something interesting: De Tijd, a Belgian financial newspaper, has already put theirpaper on iLiad e-inkeBook readers; Les Echos in Paris, the IFRA group in Germany, The New York Times, as well as theInternational Herald Tribune are all in discussions to roll out e-newspaper subscriptions for devices like Sony's Reader laterthis year. Sure, for now it's still in monochrome, but that won't be for long; besides, it was Earth Day thisweekend, people, time to make some sacrifices. Think of the trees, won't you?
