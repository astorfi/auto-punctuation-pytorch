This isn't the first time we've seen leaked images of the Bionic in the wild, but these shots are certainly a lot clearer than any others we've come across. Still, there aren't too many surprises here, with the global-capable handset boasting a TI OMAP 4430 1GHz dual-core CPU, 1GB of RAM, 4.5-inch display, an 8 megapixel rear camera, and microUSB / HDMI ports.

The real intrigue, however, lies with the Droid HD. Judging from the photos, this device seems to be running Gingerbread, and rocks a 4.5-inch display (presumably with qHD or even 1280x720 resolution, considering the device's name), an 8 megapixel 1080p rear-facing camera, a front-facing shooter and the usual set of microUSB / HDMI ports. There's also a pair of side loading SIM and microSD slots on the left side of the device, a volume rocker and what looks like a power button on the right, a slight bump for the camera pod around back (which sports an LED flash and speaker, as well), along with a large, thin battery that appears to be removable. Perhaps most notable about the HD is its seemingly super thin design -- we're estimating it's between 8.5 and 9mm, which would put it in the same league as Samsung's Galaxy S II, which measures 8.49mm. We'll have to wait for more detailed information on this mystery phone, but you can get a closer look right now in the gallery, below.
