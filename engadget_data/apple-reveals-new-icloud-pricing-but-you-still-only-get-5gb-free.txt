It used to be that if you compared iCloud pricing to other online storage services, Apple didn't look so hot. (Twenty bucks a year for 10GB?! Bye, Felicia.) Now, in a bid to better compete with bigwigs like Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, Apple is revising its iCloud plans so that they're a little more affordable. Now, 20GB costs 99 cents a month; 200GB costs $4; 500GB is $10; and 1TB is $20 a month. All told, that's an improvement -- at least compared to the Apple of years past. It must be noted, though, that the free storage plan still only includes 5GB of space -- a bit stingy considering Google and Microsoft both offer 15GB gratis. Also, as low as Apple's prices are compared to the olden days, Google's are still better: Google charges $10 a month for 1TB, not $20, and it also offers a more inexpensive 100GB option, which Apple doesn't do.
