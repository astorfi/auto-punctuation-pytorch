We always figured that somehow Kaleidescape, which makes those DVD jukeboxes we can't afford, was in the clear, but
the DVD Copy Control Association is suing the company, saying that it's not legal for them to sell a home server which
copies DVDs to a hard drive and then streams them around a home network. Kaleidescape says they're totally
flabbergasted by the suit, and they'd been working with the DVD CCA for over a year to make sure that their products
were 100% compliant with all the licenses and all that. The DVD CCA counters that while Kaleidescape did have a license
to use CSS (Content Scramble System, the relatively weak copy protection used for DVDs), but that the license doesn't
mean they can help people make copies of their DVDs (and it sounds like for them there are absolutely no circumstances
in which it should be legal to copy a DVD).
