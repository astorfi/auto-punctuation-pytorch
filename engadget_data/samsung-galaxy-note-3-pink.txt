We've already given full hands-on treatment to the white and black Samsung Galaxy Note 3, but there's one other color that didn't get its fair share of attention: pink. Thankfully, we had the chance to see this particular hue after Samsung's Unpacked event, and while we didn't feel a need to add thousands of words to simply describe one color, it's worth at least giving a small bit of attention to it for the interested parties out there. Take a quick peek below at our gallery of images and comparison shots.
