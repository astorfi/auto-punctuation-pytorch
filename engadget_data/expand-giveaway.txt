We're excited to crown the winner of our Gogo "High Above" sweepstakes, and his name is David Simkins. He will be heading out to Chicago first, where he'll hop aboard "Gogo One," the private laboratory that Gogo uses to test out the latest inflight wireless technology. We'll be with him on this journey to Engadget Expand in New York City.


Bummed out that you didn't win? We're still ready to give out a treasure trove of tickets to Engadget Expand, being held at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on November 9th and 10th. We'll be giving away 50 passes to the event (valued at $30). For a chance to be one of those 50 lucky people heading to Expand for free, enter our giveaway using the widget below.
