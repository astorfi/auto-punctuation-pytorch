 There wasn't even so much as a press release announcing this one, but The New York Times has confirmed with Intel that the chip maker recently formed a new business unit dubbed simply the "netbook and tablet group." That's apparently been tasked with fending off competition in the netbook and tablet space, and ensuring Intel remains as successful as it has been with its Atom processors -- it will be led by the the current head of Intel's embedded and communications group, Douglas L. Davis. Intel spokesman Bill Kircos further explained that "it makes sense for us to sharpen our focus on these friends of the PC, and Doug's experience running a similar and very successful embedded division makes him the right guy to lead the group."
