Looks like Instagram is one-upping Vine with the addition of a brand new feature. Available today, the 4.1 version of the social imaging app brings the ability to import videos from your media library -- meaning that you don't have to shoot that video directly in Instagram. Once imported, you can trim it down to fit within its 15-second parameters. Also new is the ability to instantly straighten crooked photos in iOS -- tap the Straighten icon and the app will do the rest. There's something for Android users, as well: the update brings video functionality to those of you sporting Ice Cream Sandwich. More details on the upgrade in the source link below.
