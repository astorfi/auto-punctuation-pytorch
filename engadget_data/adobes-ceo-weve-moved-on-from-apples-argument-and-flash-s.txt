Just three months after publishing a new ad campaign that sought to ease the tension between the two mega-corps, Adobe's CEO has been quoted as saying that his company has "moved on" from the whole ordeal. On one hand, we're glad to see Adobe focusing its resources on optimizing Flash for the myriad Android 2.2 devices that'll support its mobile player in the months to come, but on the other, it's a bit depressing to see Shantanu Narayen essentially give up hope that Jobs and Company will ever come to their senses. For example, have a listen at this, with "they" most certainly referring to Apple: 

"They've chosen to keep their system closed and we'd rather work with partners who are interested in working with us. We believe in open systems. We believe in the power of the internet and in customers making choices and I think a lot of the controversy was about their decision at that point. They've made their choice. We've made ours and we've moved on."
 Something tells us the FTC won't be so quick to follow suit. Oh, and if you're wondering how Adobe could just turn the other cheek here, the company's Anup Murarka just said at the Flash / Android event ongoing in San Francisco that Adobe has "relationships with 19 of the top 20 mobile manufacturers in the world." One is the loneliest number, or so we hear.
