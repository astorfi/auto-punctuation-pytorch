 
This year's iteration of VIZIO's top of the line XVT LCDs (at least until the XVT3D -- née XVT Pro -- series hits in Q4) are finally ready to ship and, as we've come to expect, pack a long list of features to go along with their price tags. The 240Hz 42-, 47-, and 55-inch versions all feature LED backlighting, which may be ready to beat criticisms of light black levels with a claimed 10,000,000:1 contrast ratio. Whether or not you believe any TV manufacturer's contrast measurements, an increased 120 zones of backlighting (up from 80 last year, up to 160 from 120 on the 47-inch) and a profile that's 2 inches slimmer (down to just 3 inches deep) this time around should be easily noticeable. The 37- and 32-inch XVT models rely on the company's edge lit Razor LED lighting tech and are less than 2 inches this, with stated 1,000,000:1 contrast ratios. 

Other than arbitrary and easily fudged specs, VIZIO's fighting the competition with its VIA suite of features -- widget based app platform with Netflix, Pandora & others, built-in WiFi and QWERTY Bluetooth remote -- and they're all here, along with plenty of HDMI inputs and SRS audio technology. The 32-inch isn't the cheapest model that size you'll find at $699 and neither is the top of the line XVT553SV with its $2,199 MSRP, but after perusing the list of specs in the press release after the break, it's hard to imagine finding many with a similar resumé at those prices.

VIZIO, a leading seller of LED LCD TVs in the U.S. with 500,000 units sold in the second quarter, offers its premium XVT line with picture quality improvements that elevate the performance standard for LED backlit LCD HDTVs and produce the best possible viewer experience.With added zones of Smart Dimming, unmatched 10,000,000:1 contrast ratios and 240Hz SPS (scenes per second) refresh rates, the 55" XVT553SV, 47" XVT473SV" and 42" XVT423SV models outperform competitive HDTVs that use Edge Lit LED technology. In smaller screen sizes, XVT Series performance has also been improved. The 32" XVT323SV and the 37" XVT373SV Edge Lit Razor LED LCD HDTVs with local dimming produce a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio with full HD 1080p resolution and a 120 Hz refresh rate."VIZIO is solidifying its position as a technology and performance leader with the introduction of the new generation of XVT HDTVs," said John Schindler, VIZIO VP New Products. "Our dedication to high performance drives us to use the best commercially available technology. Each of our XVT TruLED sets uses a Full Array with local dimming that produces an unquestioned superior picture. Many competitive manufacturers have decided to use only Edge Lit technology in their flagship products, but edge lighting results in an inevitable compromise in performance."All of these new XVT televisions feature a sleek and slimmer new profile. Depths have been reduced from 5" to less than 3" in the 55", 47" and 42" models, and to less than 2" in the 37" and 32" sets.XVT553SV, XVT473SV and XVT423SVAs other leading HDTV makers have elected to use Edge Lit technology, even in their most expensive models, VIZIO remains firmly committed to performance through the use of Full Array TruLED technology with Smart Dimming to deliver superior picture quality. Edge Lit designs exhibit variations in both light and dark from screen edge to center. TruLED designs present uniform brightness across the entire screen area. TruLED sets also provide much better off angle viewing and vastly superior black reproduction.VIZIO's new Full Array TruLED sets feature additional zones of Smart Dimming, which improve performance and provide the highest contrast ratios yet. Additional zones of Smart Dimming allows for the ability to turn off individual zones of LEDs for the absolute blackest blacks. The 55" XVT553SV and 42" XVT423SV models have 120 zones, compared to 80 zones in their predecessor models, and the 47" XVT473SV model steps up to 160 zones from 120 zones. These sets reach a 10,000,000:1 contrast ratio, a major improvement over the previous generation XVT series, which had a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio. Additionally, VIZIO's 240 Hz SPS (Scenes per second) Smooth Motion technology provides sharp, blur-free images with less judder, even in fast action scenes.XVT373SV and XVT323SVThe new 37" XVT373SV and 32" XVT323SV 120 Hz Edge Lit Razor LED LCD models bring the major improvement of local dimming for the first time to these screen sizes, improving contrast ratios to 1,000,000:1, an enormous increase over the 50,000:1 contrast ratio seen in the previous generation products. Another new addition to these screen sizes is VIZIO's complete VIA platform, with integral Dual Band 802.11n Wi-Fi and VIZIO's unique Bluetooth remote control with QWERTY keyboard. Like the larger sets, a stylish redesign makes these models even more attractive, with slimmed cabinets that are less than two inches deep.VIZIO Internet AppsEach of these VIZIO XVT series HDTVs brings the best of the web to the home through VIZIO Internet Applications, the industry leader with over 75,000 movie and TV show options and 10 Million songs. Unlike competitive sets that require the purchase of external adaptors, VIZIO provides seamless state-of-the-art wireless Internet access through integral Dual Band 802.11n Wi-Fi. The user experience is vastly improved through the industry's only remote control with dual Bluetooth/Infrared functionality and a slide-out QWERTY keyboard.Class-leading Sound ExperienceHigh definition audio is an important element in each XVT Series set, enabled through the use of quality speakers and SRS TruSurround™ HD premium audio processing, which creates an immersive virtual surround sound from stereo and surround sources. In addition, SRS TruVolume™ eliminates sharp jumps in volume that may be heard when switching from channel to channel or coming in and out of commercial breaks.All the Right ConnectionsProviding great flexibility for multiple sources including disc players, portable devices and gaming, the 55" XVT553SV, 47" XVT473SV and 42" XVT423SV have 5 HDMI 1.3 inputs, the 37" XVT373SV and 32" XVT323SV have 4 each. All sets are available and shipping now.The Best LED TV Choice for Everyone"VIZIO's 2010 XVT lineup offers our customers a choice.
