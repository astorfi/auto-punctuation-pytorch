 SiPix (a division of our old friend AU Optronics) has announced that it will bring "a small number" of color e-ink displays to market by the end of 2010. Apparently, a breakthrough in thin-film-transistor panels has put the company on the fast-track to making this technology commercially viable. If so, it could beat rivals like PrimeView (the manufacturer of both the Kindle and Sony's Reader) to the punch by a year or two. "Making colored electronic paper displays is our top priority," said SiPix president Andrew Tseng. "We are in talks with customers to supply colored displays ... as [color] would encourage advertisers to place ads on [electronic] publications, which then would be able to provide more content [to readers] for free." While PrimeView is currently scrambling to buy up US-based E Ink, AU Optronics is scheduled to ship its first e-paper display modules to customers this quarter. The ball's in your court, Fujitsu.
