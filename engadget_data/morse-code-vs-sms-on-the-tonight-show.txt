They didn't mention that the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia held
an almost identical contest earlier this month, but the
other night the Tonight Show held a showdown between a Morse coder and "the fastest text messager in the country" to
see who could transmit the message "I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance" in the shortest amount of time.
You could really feel the tension in the room as each competitor raced to tap out the message first, but in the end the
prize went to the dude dressed like an old school Vegas card dealer.
