It's been available to Facebook's Android beta testers for a few weeks now, but as of today all Android users can get their hands on the latest update to the company's OS-overhauling app, Home. As you may recall, the big addition with this update is a number of new options that can now be integrated into your lock screen -- namely, Instagram, Tumblr, Flickr, and Pinterest. Once those are added and authenticated, you can start browsing posts from the respective services without actually opening the dedicated app. And... that's about it. You can get a quick look at how the new features work in the video after the break.
