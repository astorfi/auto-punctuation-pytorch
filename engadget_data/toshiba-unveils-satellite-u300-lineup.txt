The Satellite U300 and Satellite Pro U300 don't differ too awfully much, but the two do sport differing color schemes and arrive with varying levels of RAM, hard drive space, and battery capacity. Regardless, both machines come stocked with Intel Core 2 Duo processors, at least 1GB of DDR2 RAM, 120GB to 200GB of HDD space, a dual-layer DVD burner, a 13.3-inch WXGA display, Intel's GMA X3100 graphics accelerator, and the usual array of ports including VGA, USB 2.0, audio in / out, and a multicard reader. Prices look to start around Â£595 ($1,177), and all signs point to these things being ready to ship out as we speak.[Via TechDigest]Read - Toshiba Satellite U300Read - Toshiba Satellite Pro U300
