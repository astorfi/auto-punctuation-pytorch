As you can see above, the caps will not-so-subtly house your shiny new nano in a specially-designed pouch on the side, with two bendable polyurethane plastic spools included to wrap your headphone cord around. If you think you can pull this look off, you'll be able to get the cap in your choice of blue, green, red, black or white this November for $20.
