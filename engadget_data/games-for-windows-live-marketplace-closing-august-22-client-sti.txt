Microsoft notes that Games for Windows Live users will still be able to access previously-purchased content via the GFWL client. Downloadable content for Games for Windows Live-supported games will remain available for purchase after the closure, though future availability "will vary based on the particular game."

"Microsoft continues to support the Games for Windows Live platform," a Microsoft spokesperson said. "You can continue to enjoy previously purchased games and downloadable content in your catalogue by downloading them through the Games for Windows Live client. Although purchase functionality will be discontinued through this marketplace, the Games for Windows Live service will continue to operate as usual."

The closure comes as a result of a forthcoming Xbox 360 update that will convert Microsoft points into local currency. Microsoft urges Games for Windows Live customers to spend their Microsoft point balances before the change, as converted cash will only apply to the Xbox Live Marketplace and the Windows Phone Store.
