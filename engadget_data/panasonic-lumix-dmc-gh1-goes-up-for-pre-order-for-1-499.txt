It's smaller than a DSLR, boasts some interchangeable lenses, and it's apparently more than up to the task when it comes to shooting video. Unfortunately, all of that doesn't come cheap, with the camera now up for pre-order from J&R for the not so low price of $1,499.99, which puts it well above a number of more-than-capable DSLRs. Of course, that price does include a 14-140mm lens, and it could come down slightly once some other retailers get in on the discounting action, but it's pretty clear that anyone simply looking for a low-cost alternative to a DSLR (or a low-cost DSLR, for that matter) will want to look elsewhere.[Via Crave]
