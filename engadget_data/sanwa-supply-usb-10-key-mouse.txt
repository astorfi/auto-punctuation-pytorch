It's a mouse! It's a keypad! It's a mouse! It's a keypad!  No, friends, it's both. Will the wonders never
cease? We don't know anyone who's been anxiously waiting for such a device, but Sanwa Supply's released one anyway. The
USB 10-Key Mouse is exactly what you expect, a combination mouse and numeric keypad. And, yes, it does have a switch to
turn the keypad on and off, so it's not quite as dumb an idea as it looks. Retail price is ¥6,298 (we'll let you
convert that).
