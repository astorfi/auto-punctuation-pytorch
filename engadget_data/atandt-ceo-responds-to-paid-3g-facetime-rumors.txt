Speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm conference, he's quoted as saying that he "heard the same rumor," but that it was "too early to talk about pricing." Of course, given that response, it looks like the company has at least been mulling an additional levy for the feature. At present, he says his primary focus is to work with Apple on ensuring the video calling technology works smoothly across his company's data network, with iOS 6 due to arrive later this year.
