2.1-channel self-contained home theater speaker system 
Wall-mountable home theater sound bar with piano black design
Integrated progressive-scan, 1080p upconverting DVD player 
280-watt, 2.1-channel simulated surround sound with wireless subwoofer 
HDMI-CEC
USB 2.0 port for connecting cameras, PMPs, etc.
Bluetooth 2.1 for wireless integration with BT-enabled devices

Trust us, you haven't even seen the half of this one. Click on through for lots, lots more.
