Reports of a potential recall for Nintendo's 8GB Wii U Basic starting cropping up yesterday morning, with sources indicating GameStop would no longer be selling the unit come mid-month. Now, CNET has just confirmed with the retailer that this is indeed taking place. On June 18th, all GameStop locations are expected to begin returns of any unsold Wii U Basic inventory. We've reached out to Nintendo for comment on the matter, but have yet to hear back. We'll update this should more official details come to light.


Update: Nintendo offered Kotaku the following statement, attributable to Nintendo of America director of corporate communications Charlie Scibetta: 



"There is a current misperception about Wii U hardware. To clarify: Nintendo is working with its retail partners to simply rebalance the stock of the White 8GB and the Black 32GB Wii U models in the market. Consumers looking for either model will continue to find them available."
