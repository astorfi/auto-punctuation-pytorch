The company today announced that it will be offering its Watson real-time speech-to-text software to developers as APIs aimed at a number of different application types -- things like web search, question and answer apps and anything that uses AT&T's U-Verse TV services. A number of additional varieties are also in the works, including gaming and social media. Check out a cheery informational video after the break.
