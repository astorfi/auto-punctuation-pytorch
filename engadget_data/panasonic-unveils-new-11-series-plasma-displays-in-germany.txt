Announced today over in Deutschland, the line gets going with the 42-inch TH-42PH11EK/ES and 50-inch TH-50PH11EK/ES, which check in with a 1,024 x 768 and 1,366 x 768 resolution, respectively. Moving on to bigger (or similarly sized) and (mostly) better things, we've got the TH-42PF11EK (42-inch), TH-50PF11EK (50-inch), TH-58PF11EK (58-inch) and the TH-65PF11EK (65-inch), all of which offer a Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) resolution and a 30,000:1 contrast ratio. As for pricing and availability, everything smaller than 58-inches can be acquired now for undisclosed amounts, while the big daddies should follow in December.[Via Macrush]
