The 15.4 and 17-inch iterations of HP's consumer-centric Pavilion line of laptops have gotten another update from two less-than jaw dropping, at least performance-wise, machines. Both the DV6000 and DV9000 come out of the box with an ExpressCard slot, Altec Lansing speakers, an optional webcam, a 5-in-1 media readers and your choice of an AMD Turion 64 X2 dual-core or a plain old AMD Sempron processor. The 7.8-pound DV9000 (replacing the DV8000) sports a 17-inch WXGA (yuck) or WSXGA screen, a dual hard disk configuration and NVIDIA GeForce Go 7600 graphics. The 6.5-pound DV6000 (replacing the DV5000) rocks a 15.4-inch WXGA screen, as well as the NVIDIA GeForce Go 7200 card, for a starting price around $850. Things get slightly more impressive on the outside, with same piano black, Zen rock garden-inspired design as the smaller DV2000. The DV6000 is available on HP's website right now for a starting price of $879, but you'll have to sit and meditate a little longer while they prepare the DV9000.
