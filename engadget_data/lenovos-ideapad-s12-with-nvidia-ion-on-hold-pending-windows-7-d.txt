Gizmodo reports the company has decided to delay the portable until the end of October, just after Windows 7's launch on the 22nd. By then it'll have to face competition from Samsung, whose $599 N510 will launch first in September, and possibly a rumored HP device coming in the next few weeks. We can take solace in the fact that the ION upgrade will only add $50 to the current $499 tag, but having to wait
