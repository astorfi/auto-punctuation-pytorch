Grand Theft Auto 5 is almost here -- just another month and a half until launch -- and we're just now seeing our first real look at the gameplay therein. Rockstar released a lengthy gameplay trailer this morning, featuring everything from yoga to skydiving; there's of course a generous heaping of fast driving and third-person gunplay. Come to think of it, of all the verbs on display in the trailer, "carjacking" isn't one we saw in action. Which is a little weird considering the game's name, no? Anyway, we expect there'll be plenty of grand theft auto to perform when GTA5 launches on September 17th. For now, enjoy the madness below.
