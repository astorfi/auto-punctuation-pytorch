 Just becauseAT&T's Lightspeed and the late SBC and BellSouth's nascent FTTH rollout (which they nowown, in a mannerof speaking) aren't yet ready to provide prime time IPTV to themasses doesn't mean they will be stopped from taking on cable companies every which way they can; enter their newHomezone service. Since the DSL they currently serve up wouldn't be quite broad enough to give AT&T what they needfor a true live-IPTV experience, they're bundling it with live TV from DISH, movie downloads from MovieLink, older programming from Akimbo, and DVR functionality in a single 2Wire-built box. It mayseem a little piecemeal, but we're a little surprised this kind ofÂ  home entertainment hodgepodge angle hasn'talready been explored -- our only real fear here is whether AT&T and 2Wire will nail it when bringing so many kindsof user experiences into a single livingroom box.
