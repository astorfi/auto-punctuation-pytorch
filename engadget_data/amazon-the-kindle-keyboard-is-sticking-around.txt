The reader formerly known as the Kindle 3 is still available on Amazon's page in its 3G form and will continue to be so, at least for the time being, at $139 for the Special Offers version and $189 without. An Amazon spokesperson told us that part of the justification for continuing the offering is the device's accessibility features.
