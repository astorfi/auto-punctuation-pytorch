The web-based app will apparently be tightly integrated with the OS-bound iWork app, and let you easily share documents with contacts who can add notes and make edits, again, much like Google Docs, albeit in an environment that closely resembles the standard iWork apps. What's more, while the beta will be free to those interested in trying it out, the final product will eventually be a pay service, though there's no word on a price just yet.
