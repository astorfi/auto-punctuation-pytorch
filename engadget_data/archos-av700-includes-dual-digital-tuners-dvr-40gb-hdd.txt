Archos also claims that the inclusion of twoantennas and "diversity reception" technology allows for better TV tuning on the go. If that's not enough, itcan operate in USB host mode to pull pics directly from memory card readers or digicams, allows you to pre-program up to100 TV channels per location for up to 5 locations, and supports downloadable games. It's expected to be available inEurope in May for about â‚¬700 (about $950 830), and will probably never be available in the US.
