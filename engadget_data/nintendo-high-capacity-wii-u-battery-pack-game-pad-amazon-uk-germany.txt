If you spend your days tutting at the Wii U GamePad's underwhelming battery life, then you were probably annoyed to see Nintendo launch a 2,550mAh power pack in Japan. Thankfully, however, that same spare part has now made its way over to Europe, where both UK and German gamers (let's call 'em WiiUsers) can now snag the unit. It'll set you back £25 in Blighty and €37 over in Germany, and should let you play for between five-to-eight hours between charges. Happy gaming!
