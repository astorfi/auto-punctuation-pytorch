 Samsung & Cox aren't the only ones working together with OCAP, LG and Zodiac Interactive are demoing two-way interactive digital cable services on LG's OCAP-compliant HDTV. The user interface is running on Zodiac's PowerUp OCAP Framework, which the companies have created as industry's first HD, widescreen format UI with enhanced capabilities allowing users to download HD OCAP TV applications. We're still trying to figure out when OCAP will finally become available and how much choice the local cable provider is willing to provide in terms of applications but so far limited demos are the only way we'll see this in action.
