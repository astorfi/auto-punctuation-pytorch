The Google Offers app just went live in the Android Market, bringing deals near your current (select) location into an easy-to-digest piece of mobile software. No, NFC's not required, and yes, you can redeem it straight from the phone -- so long as the store you're visiting has someone with intellect and eyes. Hit the source link (or the Market on your handset) to get your download on, and feel free to chuckle as you realize that it'll remain up way longer than Gmail did for iOS.
