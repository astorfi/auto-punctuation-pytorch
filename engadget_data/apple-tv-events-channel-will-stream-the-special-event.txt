Appearing alongside a new events channel on Apple TV, we get a brief mention of today's conference in San Jose. But until it kicks off at 10AM PT, you can kill some time by watching Apple's back-catalog of events, which are ready to view on the new channel.

 Update: Better still, you can also hit up Apple's events site to stream it in your browser of choice Safari on OS X 10.6 or later.
