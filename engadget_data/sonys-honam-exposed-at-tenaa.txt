Thought the leaks of Sony's Honami, aka the Xperia Z1, might slow down with yesterday's teaser of a September 4th launch? Not even close. This time, it was China's Telecommunication Equipment Certification Center (TENAA) betraying the newly-passed handset with a display of four perp-like shots. Though there's no specs listed, and we've already seen a lot of leaked blurrygrams, it's nice to see clear, finished photos of the device -- even with a bit of bench dust on it.
