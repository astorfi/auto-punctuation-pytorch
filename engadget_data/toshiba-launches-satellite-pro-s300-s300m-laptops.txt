Aimed squarely at business users, the 15.4-inch Satellite Pro S300 and the 14-inch Satellite Pro S300M (shown after the break) both include a 2-year warranty, support for docking, a business card reader, a USB Sleep-and-Charge / eSATA combo port and face recognition software. As for the S300, you can snag it with your choice of a Core 2 Duo CPU, up to 3GB of DDR2 RAM, a 160GB 5,400 RPM hard drive, dual-layer DVD burner, WiFi / Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, Intel's GMA4500MHD graphics, a built-in webcam / microphone and a 9-cell battery pack; the S300M gives you pretty much the same options but with a smaller screen and chassis. Take your pick, as they're both available to order right now starting at $899 / $829 in order of mention.[Via Notebooks]
