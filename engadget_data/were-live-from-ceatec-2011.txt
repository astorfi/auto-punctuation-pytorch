The big news this week is obviously that mysterious smartphone we're expecting to see in Cupertino on Tuesday, but CEATEC is the highlight here in Tokyo, providing Japanese companies with an opportunity to shine on home soil, and giving us a sneak peek at what we can expect in the months and even years to come. We'll be bringing you hands-ons throughout the week, so use this link to stay on top of everything CEATEC.
