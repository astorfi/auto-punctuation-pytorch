 
3D gaming has been around on the PC for a while, and has become more prevalent on recent and upcoming releases for the PlayStation 3 since it's system update and Sony's overall 3D push, but now Call of Duty:Black Ops is adding to those lists and the significantly shorter list of 3D games for the Xbox 360. Our friends at Joystiq were among the outlets that got a chance to go hands on with the Xbox 360 version, which joins other 3D titles like last year's Avatar game and the upcoming Crysis from EA on the system, so check them out for first hand impressions. As far as the technical specs, 3D is only for HDMI-equipped Xbox 360s, and Activision's 3D FAQ points out that using the dashboard in 3D won't work properly since it hasn't been updated for that yet. Curiously, the Xbox 360 version uses side-by-side compressed frames for its 3D while the PS3 version is top-bottom like ESPN 3D. So far developer Treyarch hasn't shown off any other 3D editions so we'll have to wait until release to see if there's any noticeable difference but the only thing that's certain when it comes to Call of Duty is seeing Editor Emeritus Ryan Block stalking the Team Hardcore rooms round the clock.
