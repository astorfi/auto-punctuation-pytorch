The new model boasts a long, Schneider Kreuznach Variogon 10x optical zoom lens, 7.1 megapixel sensor, and 2-inch LCD. And to keep things as easy as possible, the cam comes packed with Kodak's Color Science image processing chip and a wide range of features and presets allowing you to keep your eye on the action and not the controls. Thing is, without any image stabilization like that found on the P712, you'll find it a challenge to take advantage of the impressive zoom. Still, with a price of only $299, you can afford not to care... much. Watch for the Z710 to drop sometime this month or November 1st according to Amazon.[Via Photography Blog]
