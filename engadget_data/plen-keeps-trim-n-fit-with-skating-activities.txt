Even in his time off, PLEN takes to a bit of roller skating, and we already know about his penchant for the dance. Sounds like PLEN is on a mission to set an example for today's young robots in physical fitness, but the $2,200 price tag is still a bit hefty. Still, at 9-inches and 1.54 pounds, PLEN is putting the hurt on most consumer-ish humanoids in the mobility department.[Via MobileWhack]
