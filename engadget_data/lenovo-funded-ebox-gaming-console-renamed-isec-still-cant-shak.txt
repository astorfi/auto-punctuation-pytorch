Perhaps seeking to shift in perception, the system this week was reintroduced to the world as the Apple-esque iSec -- that's short for "Sports Entertainment Center," highlighting its exercise-centric approach to gaming, with martial arts, skateboarding, and good old-fashioned monster fighting titles having already been demoed. The console will also support wireless controllers of some sort, for those sick of all of that pesky exercise. After an initial delay, the iSec is set to hit China at some point in the second half of this year, though the company has no international sales plan -- at least until they move one million units domestically. At the moment, the iSec doesn't have much official competition, since the Wii, Xbox, and PS3 aren't legally available in China, though we're told that they're also not too hard to get your hands on -- for those who are still using their hands for stuff.
