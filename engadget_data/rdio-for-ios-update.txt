Music streamers on Rdio for iOS are used to getting novel features quite often -- but hey, as they say, the more the merrier, right? Keeping up with that tradition, Rdio announced earlier today it's introducing a few new tidbits to the application with version 2.2. Most notably, the app will now allow users to quickly find friends and artists via a new feature dubbed -- appropriately, no less -- Find People. Building up on the search improvements, Rdio's also added an option to easily discover a record label's top musicians and albums, which is, in part, made possible by a number of UI enhancements (like a revamped navigation menu) that were also included in this release. All that sound good? Then you shall wait no more; the goods can be found at our source, or you could always download straight from your iOS device.
