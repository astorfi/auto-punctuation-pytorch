It's easy to get cynical about game franchises that release every year, but from the looks of it, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is shaking things up quite a bit. For starters, developer Sledgehammer Games' first effort brings jetpacks and frickin' lasers to the online battlefield. Joystiq recently got some hands-on time with the title's multiplayer suite, and, based on the video below, came away pretty impressed. One of editor-in-chief Ludwig Kietzmann's biggest takeaways is that the aforementioned jetpack, specifically, makes it a little easier to live longer and thus dole out more pain. And no, don't worry, you're forgiven if you come away thinking that Advanced Warfare looks more than a little like Titanfall. Well, without the titans, that is -- there's a sort of Volcano / Dante's Peak thing going on here.
