 Having already brought its in-flight cellphone and internet service to Europe and Australia, Swiss-based OnAir is now giving passengers in China some added in-flight convenience/annoyance of their own, with it finding a partner in the country's Shenzhen Airlines. Much like Boeing's recent ill-fated Connexion experiment, OnAir's service will let you use your own cellphone to make calls or send text messages, with in-flight internet thrown in for good measure (and an added price, no doubt). Those heading to or from China won't be able to whip out their phones and laptops just yet though, with the company saying they only expect the service to be up and running by mid-2009, although they hope to have three demonstration aircraft ready in time for the Beijing Olympics next year.
