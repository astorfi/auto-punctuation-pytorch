The former is reporting (via the latter) that ASUS will launch its second generation ultra-thin Eee PC in April as followup to the Eee PC S101. The Eee PC Shell, as it's supposedly called would mark a welcome departure from ASUS' staid alphanumeric naming convention and is said to be easier to carry than the S101 while bringing higher specs and a longer battery life for just NT$17,000 - 20,000 ($486 - $571) -- that's well below the S101's $699 suggested retail price. The name Shell, of course, would seem to imply a curved, clamshell design. Now, with one of ASUS' favorite events, CeBIT, starting next week, we'd expect an announcement to be days away if the rumor is true -- a high probability what with the launch of yesterday's Eee PC firesale and Intel's new CULV processors for ultra-slim laptops prepped for a March launch.
