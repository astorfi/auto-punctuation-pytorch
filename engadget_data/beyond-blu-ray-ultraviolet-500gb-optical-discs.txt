Pioneer has developed a technology that they say will
allow them to create optical data storage devices that can store up to 500GB of data, 20 times that of soon-to-come
Blu-ray technology.Â  Ultraviolet lasers emit shorter wavelengths than those of blue lasers, so the data can be
packed tighter on the optical disc. No one knows when Pioneer will have this technology ready to know, but we'll go out
on a limb and guess that it's just a few years away.
