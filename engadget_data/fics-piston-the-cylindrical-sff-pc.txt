We know there are going to be a lot of people who are into FIC's latest SFF
(small-form-factor) PC, the Piston,
which they're showing off at CeBIT. The P4-based barebones pico-BTX machine isn't much different from the rest in its
classâ€”carryable size with integrated handle, DDR SDRAM, PCI-Express, Ethernet, four USB 2.0 ports, drive bay, S-Video,
7.1 surround, and even a mini-PCI card slot; but we gotta admit, $400 is a little too steep, especially for something
that might be easily confused with Bazooka subwoofer. Then again, it does actually have a subwoofer built into
the chassis (better buy some EMI shielding for that hard drive) as well as two small speakers, so it all kind of makes
sense in the end.
