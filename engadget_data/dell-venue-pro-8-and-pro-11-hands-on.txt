Ever since Dell dropped the surprise announcement that it would revive its Venue brand, we've been looking forward to getting our hands on the company's new line of Windows 8.1 tablets. That time has come with today's launch of two devices: the Dell Venue 8 Pro and the Venue 11 Pro. Their arrival confirms the end of Dell's dabble with Windows RT -- and the discontinuation of its XPS 10 tablet -- heralding a new "portfolio" of mobile devices that the company believes will meet the needs of enterprise customers. Do Dell's buttoned-down tablets offer more than the competition? Join us after the break for a closer look.



With Acer and Toshiba currently holding up the sub-10-inch Windows 8 tablet category, Dell's Venue 8 Pro arrives with minimal competition. Similar to its rivals, it's an 8-inch device with a 1,280 x 800 display IPS display that supports pen input, thanks to a Synaptics digitizer. The good news is that, unlike Acer's Iconia W3, Dell has worked to ensure that the pocketable tablet maintains its color balance and pixel density at wider viewing angles and can adequately capture reduced touch inputs on its smaller screen. Underneath its sleek but uninspired chassis lies Intel's new quad-core Bay Trail chip, pushing better performance with improved battery life -- which is rated at around 10 hours -- alongside 2GB of RAM and 32GB of on-board storage.
