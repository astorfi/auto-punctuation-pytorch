Yesterday, it passed through the swing-doors of the FCC's Washington bunker for the obligatory prodding: it's packing the same AT&T-ready 850 / 1900MHz bands as the original, but has a different model number (GT-N7000B). Either it's a reference to a change in the internals, or the B equals Black and the White version will follow soon. Either way, we'll be keeping our eyes on the domestic launch just to make sure we aren't missing out. Heck, maybe Sammy's gonna throw in a few cute extras to apologize for making us wait this long.
