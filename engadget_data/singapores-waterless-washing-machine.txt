Kind of feels almost disingenuous to call it a "washing machine" when it doesn't use any water, but apparently two
industrial design students at the National University of Singapore developed a device that uses
negative-ions, compressed air, and
deodorants to power out those tough stains — detergent free. Will this forever change the dry cleaning industry as we
know it? Well, don't mind us for being skeptical (as usual), but we're not holding out breath. Say, speaking of dry
cleaning, our intern's been sick this week — would someone mind picking ours up?
