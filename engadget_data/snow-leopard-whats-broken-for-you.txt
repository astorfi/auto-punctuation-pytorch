Remember how your AGP video card would only display a maximum resolution of 800 x 600 and your audio card would only emit bleeps and bloops? Ah, those were the days. Quite a bit has happened since XP landed to wash away the awful stain that was Windows ME, though it's still no shock to hear that new operating systems leave more than a few applications broken. Over the past few days, we've seen oodles of gripes from across the web from loyal Mac users who just can't believe Snow Leopard has borked their favorite software, but we're wondering how things have been on your machine. Have you realized that your Optimus Maximus no longer boogies with OS X 10.6? Are you bummed that iStat pro isn't giving you the details it used to? What kind of hell has broken loose since you threw caution in the garbage and updated your machine?
