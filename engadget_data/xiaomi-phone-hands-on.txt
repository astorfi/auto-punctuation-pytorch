While the 1.2GHz or 1.5GHz dual-core phone is a tad thicker and heavier than many other flagship smartphones these days, the soft back felt nice in our hands -- a bit like the HTC Sensation but smaller. The overall build quality was surprisingly solid, though we won't comment much on the software since it was a non-final build (we had a little crash while filming, and the three touch buttons didn't light up). Leaving those issues aside, we're definitely looking forward to this nicely priced, feature-packed Android in October. Hands-on video after the break.
