 According to a report from AppleInsider, the Cupertino giant is issuing "advisement bulletins" to some of its channel partners suggesting they get their hands on iPods and MacBooks / MacBook Pros while the gettin's good. It seems that Apple is telling resellers to place orders for a four-week block's worth of top-selling iPods, saying that within the next seven days supplies will become extremely limited, while recommending a three-week supply of MacBooks and MacBook Pros. The article claims that this practice is familiar to third-party sellers, and indicates Apple is ramping up for its holiday season (and new iPods and MacBooks / Pros, presumably). Of course, right now this is just whispers in high school hallways, but we can promise you this: Apple will be selling something this holiday season. You have our word.
