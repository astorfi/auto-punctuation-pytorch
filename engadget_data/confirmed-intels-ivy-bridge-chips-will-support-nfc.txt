We're reporting live from a keynote on Ultrabooks starring Intel's Mooly Eden, where the star exec just revealed that the company's forthcoming Ivy Bridge chips will support NFC, demoing a transaction involving a laptop and PayPass-enabled MasterCard. Suffice to say, we haven't really seen this technology incorporated into laptops, though it is reminiscent of the older TransferJet standard (not that that ever took off). Unfortunately, Chipzilla's otherwise being mum on details: it's too early to know which credit card companies, software developers and laptop makers are on board, but hopefully Intel's backing is enough to spur some innovation here.
