After all, we've been lusting after this monstrosity guy for nearly eight months now, so is all of this building up to be a major disappointment? We're just as eager to find out as the next person, but here are some new images of the real deal to (hopefully) tie you over a bit longer. We've seen shots of the Motorola XT875 up close and personal before, but this is the first time it's been spotted snuggled up next to another phone. Hanging out next to the Samsung Droid Charge, the Bionic's slightly larger appearance lends credence to reports that it has a 4.5-inch display. A few other cosmetic features that stick out -- quite literally, we might add -- are the tapered back that bulges halfway up the phone to accommodate the camera, and the beveled edge around the perimeter. As already expected, the microUSB / HDMI port on the bottom right side for Webtop access can easily be discerned. Will this be enough to whet your whistle for another few weeks? If not, we hear there's another Verizon device inbound that you might be interested in.
