While Hisense's Sero 7 LT and Sero 7 Pro tablets were good deals when they first shipped, the competition  hasn't stood still. The company clearly wants to stay ahead of the value curve, as it just knocked $20 off the prices of both Android slates. The basic Sero 7 LT now costs $79 and the Tegra 3-packing Sero 7 Pro has dropped to $129. Both price cuts are already in effect at Walmart, so there's no reason to hesitate if you were looking for a better bargain in Hisense's tablet line.
