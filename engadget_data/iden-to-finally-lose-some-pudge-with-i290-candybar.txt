 
i880 series aside (maybe), Motorola's iDEN lineup really doesn't have a track record of wowing the fashion conscious among us. Granted, the network has always been targeted at heavy-duty industries where impressing those around you with your face candy isn't necessarily a priority, but it'd still be nice to have the option of getting in on the most ubiquitous PTT service without carrying a phone that looks like a brightly-colored rock (and no, we're not talking about a PEBL, either). Enter the i290, a phone outed by Motorola that displays Telus branding -- Canada, here we come -- and will almost certainly find its way to Sprint, too. Little is known about the slim candybar, but the lack of a "c" in the model number likely means that it's straight iDEN, not an iDEN / CDMA hybrid. High end? No, but unlike most of its stablemates, you might get away without anyone knowing you're using iDEN here. We'll throw out more details as we get 'em.
