I mean, we knew this was coming sooner or later. Still, it's nice to see a major teamup come out of that Google / Waze marriage that happened back in June (who doesn't love a summer wedding?). Google Maps mobile users in the US, UK and a slew of other countries are getting Waze-submitted real time accident, construction, road closure and other reports on Android and iOS. It's a two-way street here, of course, meaning that Waze users on the aforementioned mobile operating systems will be getting Google Search, Street View and satellite images baked directly into their app. More information on the partnerships can be found in the source link below.
