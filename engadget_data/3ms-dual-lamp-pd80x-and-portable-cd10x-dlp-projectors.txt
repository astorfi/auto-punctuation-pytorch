First up is the business-minded PD80X DLP which delivers a 1024x768 (XGA) resolution, 4000 ANSI lumen brightness, 1000:1 contrast ratio, a wide range of ports including HDCP enabled DVI, HDMI, component, and Ethernet for displaying multiples sources simultaneously with a sweet dual-lamp safety net in case of burn-out mid-way through your presentation. Next is the CD10X which brings the same XGA resolution in 1.1-kg portable DLP jobbie with 2000:1 contrast ratio, 1600 ANSI lumens brightness, and just a few inputs including DVI, S-Video, composite video, and USB. It also features a special "off to go" function which manages to the cool the unit lickity-split for tearing down that underground light show on the quick as the po-po roll onto the scene. No pricing or ship dates but it's good to know that 3M's got our six with these. read -- CD10Xread -- PD80X
