Both should have 30GB of storage to work with in their 0.6-inches thick frames, and support a video-capturing DVR-Station and travel DVR adapter, camera add-on (on the 404), and play back MP3, WMA, WAV, MPEG-4, XviD, DivX 4/5, and WMV9 (don't rule out PlaysForSure capabilities at all). We should know more any time now, since it seemed like they were on target for a July / August launch, last we heard about this new series. Oh, and for what it's worth the 404 is listed to be going for about €350 (about $450 US), and the 604 for about €400 ($510 US)
