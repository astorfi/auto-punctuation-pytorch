Multichannel News reports it doesn't plan to roll out streaming to as many platforms as Netflix, so we'll have to wait and see where this initial venture into IPTV stops. Think big cable is scared of over the top services? Maybe not yet, since Comcast claims Netflix subscribers tend to be the most voracious users of its VOD. Also in Comcast's future is its completely revamped Xcalibur guide software with internet and social media tie-ins (check out our early sneak peek here), which Schwartz reiterated would be available nationwide at some point next year.
