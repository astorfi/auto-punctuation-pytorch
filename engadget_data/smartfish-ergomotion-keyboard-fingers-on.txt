We got to lay our overworked, underfed fingers on a prototype on display at Digital Experience, and although it's certainly nifty, we can't say we're rushing to buy one. Our key presses felt somewhat shallow, but we'll cut the crew a little slack because it's still a prototype. The selling point here is the fact that the keyboard itself is segmented in two, and is programmed to reconfigure itself periodically -- a phenomenon that definitely takes some getting used to. The movements, although subtle, are definitely noticeable, but see for yourself in the videos after the break.
