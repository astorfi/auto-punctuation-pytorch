He notes that there's no additional bulge, and a test video shows that the new screen is as responsive as one could hope. If you're the owner of a Eee PC 900 and want to get your hands or stylus on your screen (or you're just a curious little bugger), check the glorious video of the Fido-Dido in action after the break.
