This second generation builds upon last year's release, focusing heavily on adding social media into the mix with app support like Twitter, Facebook and Yelp via a smartphone interconnect -- much in the vein of BMW Apps and Ford SYNC AppLink.

Stay tuned for a hands-on from the show floor in a few.
