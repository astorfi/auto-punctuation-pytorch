According to the folks at 4/3 Rumors, the miniature shooter is pegged to debut (alongside the E-PL3 and E-P3) with a 12 megapixel sensor and TruePic VI engine. Not making the jump however, are its brother's OLED screens, leaving the emaciated light-box to make do with just a regular LCD. Interest piqued? Start pinching those pennies now -- we hear tomorrow isn't far away.
