Fancy a new iPhone, but don't want to be locked in with a specific carrier? Good news: Apple today started selling SIM-free versions of its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Prior to this, you had to choose a two-year contract or buy one of them unlocked with T-Mobile. Thankfully, that's no longer a problem. The SIM-free versions start at $649 for the 16GB iPhone 6, climbing up to $949 for the 128GB iPhone 6 Plus. Apple has taken a tad longer than usual to offer the unlocked versions, both online and in-store. Of course, you'll still need to sidle up with a carrier, but at least now you'll have more control over the contract you choose.
