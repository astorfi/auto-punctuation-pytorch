As of now, anyone with a CableCARD can roll over to Amazon and lay down $799.99 for the company's subscription-less MR-1500T3 HD Digital Video Recorder, which can hold over 75 hours of high-def programming or over 300 hours of SD material. So, are you taking the plunge?Update: Moxi pinged us to say these have indeed been shipping beyond the limited first run.[Thanks, ganjagadget]Read - Moxi's websiteRead - Amazon order page
