And so it goes... meet the 8GB Nokia N95, all in black and all official. Feels good eh? We're still talking N95 specs -- 2.8-inch display, 5 megapixel camera, WiFi, GPS, microSD, and such -- only now with a hefty slab of hot, hot flash for all your media. Sure, slim is in but we can love a fatty too. Europe-first and ready for action in October for â‚¬560/$761.
