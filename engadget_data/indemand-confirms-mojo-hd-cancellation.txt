More specifically, it states that MOJO HD was "originally conceived as a way to satisfy consumers' thirst for pure true high-definition programming," and while the channel "accomplished this goal, there is a wealth of HD programming now available and thus we have chosen to discontinue the service." To be frank, we're not exactly sure what to make of this comment. Is it saying it'd rather bow out than engineer new, unique programming to boost ratings now that HD content is more accessible? Or is this just some canned response used to appease the masses? Whatever the case, we'll miss you MOJO, and here's hoping Zane Lamprey and Three Sheets finds another television home (and fast).Update: iNDEMAND pinged us with an official response (and to reaffirm the dissolution of MOJO HD), most of which you already read above. For the full thing, head on past the break.Update 2: We've heard back from iN DEMAND about the future of MOJO's programming. Check it out here.
      

 

 "The MOJO HD channel was originally conceived as a way to satisfy consumers' thirst for pure true high definition programming. While MOJO HD accomplished this goal, there is a wealth of HD programming now available and thus we have chosen to discontinue the service."  The shutdown is scheduled for Dec. 1, but the exact date will be determined by individual systems.
