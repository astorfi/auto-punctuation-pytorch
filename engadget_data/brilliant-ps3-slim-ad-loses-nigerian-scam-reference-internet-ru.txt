The line in question, "you can't believe everything you read on the internet, otherwise I'd be a Nigerian millionaire by now," apparently caused a bit of a stir, and the local authorities demanded the company pull the commercial. It's now been replaced in the company's Viddler account with a slightly altered version that claims online FUD is "how World War One got started." Someone should tell Sony Director of Rumor Confirmation Kevin Butler that there's a certain assassinated Austrian Archduke who would beg to differ. Revised video after the break, and just for kicks, we found the old video on YouTube for comparison.
