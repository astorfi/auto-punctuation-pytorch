The VPL-FE40 and FX40 3LCD models deliver up to 4000 ANSI lumens off that ¥50,400 (about $424) 275W bulb, a 1.3x optical zoom, and fattastic selection of in and outs including HDMI, component, S-Video, D-sub 15, and Ethernet for projecting images from networked sources. The only real difference betwen the two is resolution, price, and ship date with the FE40 delivering a 1400×1050 (SXGA+) resolution for ¥600,000 (about $5,045) starting January 2007 while the FX40 goes 1024×768 (XGA) for ¥470,000 (about $3,952) one month later. For that big-a wad, let's hope they are invisible to radar too, you know, just in case. Check the caboose after the flip. [Via Impress]
