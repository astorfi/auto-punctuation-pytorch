Yeah, we were totally bored with the whole
MP3 watch genre until this came along.
50 Cent expands his oeuvre with this G-Unit MP3 watch in 256/512MB capacities, which'll hit jewelry stores near you
this month. Be prepared to part with the requisite bling to have this unit livin' large on your wrist â€” $486 for the
256MB model.
