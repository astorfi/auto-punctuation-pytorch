Everything seems to be in working order, it's just a little disconcerting when a console lands on your doorstep looking like it was actually in the hands and mouths of undead killing machines. Regardless, the new system is pretty spiffy in red (unless you hate the color red, in which case it looks horrible), and having a Jasper unit in-house is probably more exciting than it should be. You can be sure that we'll figure out if everything is shipshape by playing hours and hours and hours of Resident Evil 5. But for now, let's all enjoy the unboxing!
