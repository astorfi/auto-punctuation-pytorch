  While the supposed HTC One series variant destined for Sprint only just broke cover in a leaked PR photo yesterday, now there's more concrete evidence of its existence in a few pics posted by Android Life. Still being referred to as the HTC EVO One, the specs listed are the same, with a 4.7-inch 720p screen, 8MP camera, Android 4.0.3 with the Sense 4.0 UI that we've already become accustomed to and that oh-so-familiar kickstand around back. According to the description, the hardware is up to the standards of HTC's other One phones, and the software is predictably running "buttery smooth". All that's left now would appear to be the official unveiling (which may only be hours away now), hit the source link for a few more close up shots.Update: It's official, and branded the HTC EVO 4G LTE. Check out our impressions here.
