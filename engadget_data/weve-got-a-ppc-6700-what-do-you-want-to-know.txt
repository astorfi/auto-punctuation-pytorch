In the fine tradition of our question and answer sessions for the
HTC Universal and the
Motorola ROKR E1, we figured we'd open the floor and ask
y'all what you wanted to know about the
PPC-6700 (aka the
HTC Apache), Sprint's new EV-DO
capable Pocket PC Phone with WiFi, Bluetooth, a 1.3 megapixel digital camera, and a slide-out QWERTY keyboard. Post
your questions in the comments below and we'll do our best to answer as many of them as we can by next week.Â  If
you can, please try to limit yourself to just a couple of questions, we want to try and respond to as many of these as
possible.
