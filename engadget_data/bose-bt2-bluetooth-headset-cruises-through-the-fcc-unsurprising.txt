The BT2 just passed through the FCC's database, showcasing a left ear placement and letting us know that it'll be "powered by a rechargeable, non-replaceable lithium-ion polymer battery." We're guessing it'll be priced accordingly (read: incomprehensibly out of reach for most), and will have precisely zero specifications printed on the box. But hey -- would you really expect anything else? Stay tuned.
