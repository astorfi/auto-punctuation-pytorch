That's all changed today (at least a little) with the Blazepro Wii Classic Controller, an alternative to Nintendo's own dual-stick pad for your Nintendo 64 gaming goodness. Meanwhile, some snoops at Spong found an honest-to-goodness Nintendo patent for what looks to be an official classic controller attachment that combines motion control with the Wii's iconic infrared motion control. As far as availability, the Blazepro can be had now for just $14, but the official Nintendo attachment is still in fantasy patent land.
