That surprising and slightly hard to believe word comes from Doug Friedman of American Technology Research, who says that the "Intel/AMD roadmap of integration of the CPU/GPU could pose a risk to NVIDIA," and that buying AMD would propel NVIDIA into a "formidable competitor for Intel." As X-bit Labs points out, however, there is the little matter of a cross-licensing agreement between Intel and AMD, which would prevent AMD from transferring any of Intel's technologies to a third party, effectively making it impossible for the new company to produce its own x86 CPUs, to say nothing of the potential antitrust issues involved.
