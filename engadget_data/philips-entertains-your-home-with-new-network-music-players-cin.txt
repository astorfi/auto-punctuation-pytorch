They're color-screened followups to January's monochrome NP1100, and the NP2500 does audio out (including coaxial digital audio) just like is forebear, while the NP2900 (pictured) includes built-in speakers. The players work with internet radio, your PC's music library and some online music services like Rhapsody. No word on price or release date.
