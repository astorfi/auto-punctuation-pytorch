       So Dell picked the rather unfortunate time of 9:00am for its keynote here at CES, so we've got a feeling a few eyeballs might be distracted while it announces displays, SideShow device and whatever else Dell might have up its sleeve. However, it does look like Dell has finally wised up to all its display leaks over the past week or so, and shared a few specs with us to chew on while we wait for the keynote to begin. Most notably, it looks like that 2707WFP Dell UltraSharp 27-inch LCD will feature a 1920 x 1200 resolution, 1,000:1 contrast ratio and 6ms response time. With Dell's TrueColor technology the display can pull off 92% of the NTSC color space -- a "first" for the 27-inch display, though there really isn't much competition to speak of. Dell is also breaking out its E228WFP 22-incher, along with the XPS 710 H2C supa' PC.
