 It's no secret: songs about gadgets are a scourge upon the earth. And that's why they're awesome. The latest of these little ditties that'll have you humming in the shower tomorrow morning -- and raving like a lunatic the day after -- is "The Pleo Song," courtesy of RobotsRule. The song was written to celebrate Ugobe's announcement of 30 day shipping notices for Pleo, which we suppose is as good an excuse as any to write a gratingly bad song about a robotic dinosaur. "Remember the heart of a child knows that love goes with Pleo." If you still think you can stomach it after that little teaser, the YouTube version is after the break.
