It's a necessarily delicate task, but they're making progress as we speak, and here are the first things that jump out to us: there is much less open space inside the iPad 2 than the original model, and the battery is very large. There aren't any huge surprises in here internally yet, but it's got the 1GHz A5 CPU, 512MB of RAM, and 16GB of Toshiba TH58NVG7D2FLA89 NAND Flash. Like we said, they're still at it with this one, and we'll update as they do. Until then, hit up the source for all the photos.

Update: And they're done! Head over to check out all the shots of the iPad 2 in its exposed form, but don't try it out on your own. The new glass adhesion makes it practically impossible to open this thing without shattering the screen, so the crew will be working hard for a better solution. Vid's after the break, though.
