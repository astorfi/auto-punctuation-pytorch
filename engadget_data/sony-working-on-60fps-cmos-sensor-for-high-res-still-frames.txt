 In a move that promises to minimize the trade-offbetween digital still and video cameras, Sony announced today that it is working on a CMOS chip capable of capturingimages from every pixel at a blazing 60fps. The problem with current imaging devices is that consumers must sacrificeimage quality when they are recording video, but risk missing important shots due to shutter lag and the generalnon-continuous nature of still photography. Along with a new digital signal processing chip also being developed bySony's engineers, the sensor should allow cameras to be used strictly in video mode, with high-res stills capable ofbeing extracted later. No word on when we'll see actual products sporting the new tech (regular CMOS sensors are onlystarting to replace CCDs in consumer devices), but it's nice to know that camera manufacturers are finally throttlingback on the megapixel race and instead focusing on improving the imaging experience.[Via DigitalCamera Info]
