Sure, the cert may not mean as much as thatgolden FCC blessing, but it allows the box to be sold as compliant with various cable standards, including CableCARD.Meanwhile, the dual-tuner, 180-hourTCD649180 and 80-hour TCD64908 Series 2 boxes appear to havevanished, after initially appearing for pre-order on Amazon. We'll leave the rationale behind that to theconspiracy-minded among you. We're gonna keep waiting for Series 3, and hope that the dual-tuner, big-drive model staysin place for those units.
