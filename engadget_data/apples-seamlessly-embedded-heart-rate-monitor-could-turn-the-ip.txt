Imagine the possibilities if the iPhone could not only track your running stride but also monitor your heart rate while doing it. That's one of a suite of potential uses for this patent app from Apple, a Seamlessly Embedded Heart Rate Monitor. The design is for a series of electrodes that are, well, seamlessly embedded into the shell of a given device in such a way that they are "not visibly or haptically distinguishable on the device." The device could then, with a touch, measure heart-rate, uniquely identify a user, and even "determine the user's mood from the cardiac signals." Just imagine the new flood of EKG-related apps: iPalpitate, Murmur Maker, Cardiac Arrest... the possibilities are endless.
