And just like that, 2K screens are old news. While other companies announce laptops with 2,560 x 1,440 screens, Toshiba is doing the competition one better: the outfit is showing off a notebook with a 15.6-inch, 3,840 x 2,160 display. Dubbed the Satellite P50t, the laptop has a screen density of 282 pixels per inch, which, as you can imagine, means some onscreen objects are going to be very, very small (check out that still photo of Windows Media Player in our gallery to see what we're talking about). Other than that lack of optimized apps -- a problem for every high-res notebook -- the screen is quite nice, with good color reproduction and decent viewing angles. As for the rest of the specs, we don't know much, expect that it will have a mix of Core i5/i7 processors (whether that means Haswell or Intel's fifth-generation chips is a question for another day). We suppose all will be revealed when this finally goes on sale -- sometime "mid-year," says Toshiba. For now, enjoy the hands-on photos.
