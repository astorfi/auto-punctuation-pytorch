Sure, the Droid RAZR may not actually be out yet, but when it does hit, the handset will have plenty of things to hold it, dock it, charge it and stream stuff from it. In fact, Motorola devoted a full room to the things at today's event. First and foremost are two additions to the Lapdock family. The docking station comes in new flavors: the Lapdock 500 ($300) and the Lapdock 100 ($200), measuring 14 and 10.1 inches, respectively. The 500 ($300) features a front-facing camera (a first on a Lapdock), as well as Ethernet and VGA sockets. As with its successors, the handset rests in the rear of the Lapdock, utilizing Webtop to turn your smartphone into a laptop. Also on display was the Droid RAZR car dock ($40), from which you can access your music from the company's new cloud-based Motocast service and play it through your car stereo. Lots 'o photos below, along with a brief walk-through video after the break.
