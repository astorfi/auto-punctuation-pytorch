Wanna know just how micro the screen on Nintendo's new
Game Boy Micro really is?
Reader "gameduck" just sent in this graphic he created comparing the size of the Micro's screen with that of the Game
Boy Advance SP (he based it on the size of the GBM's cartridge slotâ€”turns out paying attention in math class has its
advantages). Let's just say that if you've got beef with the screen on the Game Boy Advance SP then you're probably not
going to be happy with what you're getting with the Micro. Otherwise, you're cool.
