We got up close and personal with the Xbox One's incredibly expensive Elite controller at E3, but how do all those modular bits and bobs work? A new video from Microsoft out of Gamescom sheds some light on just that. The Elite's customization goes much deeper than just swapping out different lengths of thumbsticks: you can adjust trigger deadzone, download custom button-binding profiles for certain games, tweak haptic feedback intensity on a motor-by-motor basis and even completely remap button functions. Long story short: if standard gamepads regularly fall short for your high-level needs, this is the paddle for you.



The key to all this is an app that grants the aforementioned customizations, and a Redmond spokesperson breaks it al down in nitty-gritty detail around the 30 minutes mark in the video below. If this is enough to prep your bank account for a sudden $150 departure, let us know in the comments.

We're live all week from Cologne, Germany for Gamescom 2015. Click here to catch up on all the news from the show.
