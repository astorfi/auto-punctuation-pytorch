The online mega-retailer is doing an press conference on Thursday September 6th, and while there's not a lot in the way of info for the California-based event, we're guessing the word "Kindle" might come up once or twice... What can we expect? A Fire sequel? Some illuminated e-ink readers? Time will tell -- but no matter what it is, you can bet we'll be there to cover it.
