A new model called the Studio 1555 was added yesterday to the Dell download site and included there is a driver for ATI's Mobility Radeon HD 4570 GPU. The Studio 15's current Intel 4500MHD is also listed, meaning the faster 4570 will likely be an option, and a desirable one at that. No further information about this update or new model is available, but if you were looking for a new Studio you might just want to hold off until we can figure out what's up. If, on the other hand, you were looking for a new studio apartment then go for it -- we've heard that now is an excellent time to buy.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
