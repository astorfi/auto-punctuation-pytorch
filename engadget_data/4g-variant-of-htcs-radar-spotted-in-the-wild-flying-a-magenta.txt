But if a batch of spy shots sent to TmoNews is to be believed, then this mid-specced 3.8-inch Windows Phone could be about to get some much needed 4G pep on T-Mobile's network. The photos also reveal plenty of magenta branding, Tango video calling and of course Mango running under the hood. Further corroboration probably won't come til we detect an HSPA+ Radar at the FCC, but with some decent 6/7Mbps real-world download speeds and hopefully some mobile hotspot action this could well be a device worth having.
