 
After a few years of teasing and smoke blowing, the HomePlug Powerline Alliance has finally released the skinny on major enhancements we can expect to see integrated into the HomePlug AV2 powerline networking specification that's scheduled for finalization in Q1 of 2011. Chief among them is MIMO (Multiple-Inputs Multiple-Outputs), which will expand home coverage by increasing the throughput speeds, and transmission ranges, without additional signal power or requiring more spectrum -- but you knew already that didn't you, MacGyver? Compounding this efficiency gain will be the expansion of the operating spectrum by an order of magnitude. Tallied together with other upgrades, the end result for consumers will be a "reported" 5x increase in performance, not to mention support for bigger, more reliable networks. Oh, and it'll also play nicely with original HomePlug AV technology, too. Frankly, that's jolly good news for our dreams of pushing 1080p HD video streams to every room in our house with an outlet -- including the pantry. Doing the same thing for 3D and 4K HD content... well, that's just brilliant! For more details peep the PR below the break.

The AV2 specification will be fully interoperable with current HomePlug AV and future HomePlug Green PHY and IEEE 1901 products."The TWG made significant progress toward our goal of deploying a truly next-generation HomePlug powerline specification to address future market demands, and that is built on the excellent powerline products readily available and in use""Powerline networking between modems and set-top boxes is being used today by many broadband service providers to reduce capital expenses and support costs associated with delivering new triple play and IPTV services," said Kurt Scherf, vice president, principal analyst, Parks Associates. "More than 50 operator/service providers have deployed HomePlug AV powerline networking solutions as a means to expand services. These providers require a migration path to a much higher performance powerline technology to meet future bandwidth demands while maintaining interoperability with their current HomePlug AV installations and future IEEE1901 products."Major powerline enhancements the TWG selected for inclusion in the developing HomePlug AV2 specification include:MIMO (Multiple-Inputs Multiple-Outputs) offers significant increases in link throughput and range without requiring additional spectrum or transmit power. MIMO allows the data signal to propagate from multiple outputs to multiple inputs implementing advanced transmission coding schemes which will increase capacity and enable more reliable and expanded home coverage. This is similar to the 802.11n and 802.16e which use MIMO solutions with wireless products to extend performance.Increased MAC (Medium Access Control) efficiencies that lower overhead and expand throughputIncreased operating spectrum: the specification will expand operations into an additional spectrum, up to an order of magnitude beyond current powerline technology. This increased bandwidth will further improve performance.Extending coverage via repeating and routing technology in networks of three or more nodesThe HomePlug AV2 specification is expected to deliver a 5x increase in performance over current HomePlug AV solutions at the application layer to offer significant improvements in whole home coverage to guarantee reliable delivery of throughput intensive applications such as multiple streams of 1080p HD video (and emerging 3D and 4K HD) broadband Internet, Internet gaming and security camera video over existing electrical wiring. These advancements are necessary to meet the increasingly demanding Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements of service providers and consumer electronics companies.HomePlug's Technical Working Group made these important selections based on extensive international field testing and channel characterization, technical evaluations, simulations and experience with the widely deployed base of HomePlug AV products. The goal is to deliver a comprehensive and technically detailed specification using proven technology validated by careful technical scrutiny and rigorous testing. HomePlug plans to finalize the specification in the first quarter of 2011."The TWG made significant progress toward our goal of deploying a truly next-generation HomePlug powerline specification to address future market demands, and that is built on the excellent powerline products readily available and in use," said Rob Ranck, president of the HomePlug Powerline Alliance. "Consumers are increasingly interested in the large, growing volumes of video, gaming and other media content available via the Internet, and they need an easy way to connect entertainment devices that allow them to move multiple streams of content to any room in the home. HomePlug AV has been the powerline technology of choice, and AV2 provides an aggressive migration path to support greater network capacity and distribution of ultra-high quality content throughout the home."HomePlug devices account for more than 80 percent of the world's broadband powerline communications market and over 45 million devices have shipped to date. The alliance works with key stakeholders to ensure all of its specifications are designed to meet the requirements of IPTV service providers, power utilities, equipment and appliance manufacturers, consumer electronics and other important stakeholders. HomePlug operates the powerline networking industry's largest Compliance and Interoperability Certification Program to ensure true multi-vendor co-existence and interoperability. The program has certified more than 200 products and will also begin certifying IEEE 1901 products in 2010.Please visit www.HomePlug.org for more information on the HomePlug Powerline Alliance.About the HomePlug® Powerline AllianceFounded in 2000, the HomePlug Powerline Alliance, Inc. is an industry-led initiative with 70 member companies that creates specifications and certification logo programs for using the power lines for reliable home networking and Smart Grid applications.
