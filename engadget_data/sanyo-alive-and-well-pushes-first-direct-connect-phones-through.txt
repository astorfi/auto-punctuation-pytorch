As the names and ID label renderings imply, these will likely be ruggedized models targeted squarely at the same audience that currently snaps up iDEN equipment, so go ahead and get ready to drop these things, splash them with mud, and generally treat them like poo. Both are equipped with Bluetooth and EV-DO, so they'll be able to hold their own with the remainder of Sprint's midrange whenever they get around to launching.[Via Phone Scoop]Read - Sanyo SCP-PRO200Read - Sanyo SCP-PRO700
