Now, just forget everything you thought was important when measuring the value of a good LCD panel -- you know: brightness, contrast ratio, response, pixel resolution, and so on -- those measurements are for fools, boy. As any self-righteous heiress knows, a good TV must feature a white gold plating and at least 160 diamonds totaling to a minimum of 20 carats. Think differently and you might just end up dodging Blackberries with the rest of the help.
