Sure, it's just a concept for now, but don't say we didn't warn you when this thing takes the world by storm and revolutionizes the entire toast industry forever. Designed by Jaren Goh of Singapore, and winner of the 2006 Red Dot Award, the ROLLERtoaster is pretty self explanatory: stick bread in one side, and watched it get rolled into toast by the compact little unit. We're not so sure how well this is guarded from little probing fingers, or the exact mechanism for rolling the toast through, but do details like that really matter when faced with such exquisite design beauty? We didn't think so.
