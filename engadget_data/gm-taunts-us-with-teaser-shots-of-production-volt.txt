While it's not much, the more interesting of the two (above) at least gives us a good look at the Volt's headlights, as well as what appears to be an LED fog lamp or daytime running light. Hit up the link below for the second, even less-revealing shot, as well as a few more pics that offer a glimpse of the Volt's design process. [Via DailyTech]
