The tour, which reportedly aims to "educate consumers... about the amazing capabilities of Blu-ray," kicked back off on January 25th in Toronto, Canada, and will hit six more North American cities before it goes back into hiatus. Consumers who meander on out to one of the show dates will get to see previews of upcoming titles (Finding Nemo and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe in particular) and presumably get blasted with loads of marketing hoopla all the while. Nevertheless, be sure to hit the read link and scroll down for exact dates of when the tour will be rolling through Hartford, Raleigh-Durham, Nashville, Dallas, Denver and Chicago areas if you're so inclined.[Image courtesy of USAToday]
