 Verizon's got VCAST, Sprint's got Sprint TV, so where's Cingular's offering? Why, it's here: the nation's largest carrier launchedtheir first two 3G handsets yesterday, the LG CU320 and Samsung's ZX10, is also officiallyconcurrently launching Cingular Video. It'll take the shape of a 3-5 minute clip service with video streams from 18channels, including the likes of NBC and ESPN. Did we mention it's free to customers of their unlimited BroadbandConnect data package? Because it is, and it's a good thing, too -- if you're gonna go walled-garden-mobile-TV, at leastmake make it free to your customers, right? And for those who want yet another feature to pay for monthly can plunkdown the extra $5 and pick up access tothose HBO clips. Guess this'll be a great experiment to determine whether or notpeople really do want towatch short-form video programming on their mobiles.
