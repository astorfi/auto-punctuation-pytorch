We've got to hand it to Sonyâ€”they've really been pretty well with others as of late. Well, that or they see a hole
gone unfilled in their broad spectrum of consumer electronics, and fill it as quickly as possible. Their latest is no
big surprise: DSLRs. While Sony has some of the nicest digital cameras around, they've got nothin' in the way of
single-lens reflex, so they've worked a partnership on DSLRs with
Konica Minolta (who just released their
latest Maxxum 5D last week). Their new devices will use
lens mounts compatible with KM's Maxxum/Dynax
system, but no word on who's taking over the bodies (and whether they'll be using
MemoryStick), or whether it'll be a Sony
Konica Minolta device.
