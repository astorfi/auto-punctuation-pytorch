"We do not think 99 cents is the right price point for our content," said CEO Jeff Zucker at an investor conference earlier this week, noting that NBC shows are indeed present on iTunes for those willing to shell out $1.99. That's not the only bad news for video-on-demand enthusiasts, as News Corporation is apparently reconsidering its stance -- though subsidiary Fox is presently dishing out 99-cent shows, president Chase Carey called its involvement a "short-term test." Guess that brave new world of cheap streaming is still a ways off, eh?
