 Seems like every distant vision ofthe future has man jacking into his gear via some crazy head gear or a plug on the back ofthe neck or head. We just take it for granted that yeah, that's the fastest way to get to the brain: through the stemor straight into the cortex. Well, think again, because the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition's 30-yearneural interface project is yielding fruit -- the kind you can taste. Their Brain Port machine / sensory interface uses144 microelectrodes to transmit information through sensitive nerve fibers in your lingua, enabling devices tosupplement your own sensory perception. The system, which is getting shown off to Navy and Marine Corps divers nextmonth will supposedly have sonar integration for sub-aqueous orientation, but has already apparently given somelandlubber blind people the ability to catch balls, "notice" others walking in front of them, and find doors.With IR, radar, sonar, and other forms of detection, the researchers believe this device will obsolete night vision --even our own eyes -- soonerthan later.
