That includes a more public role for its Chief Privacy Officer, Erin Egan, who will both be at the center of a new "Ask the Chief Privacy Officer" feature that's said to be launching in the coming weeks, as well as a new series of live events where she'll address "comments and questions about privacy, safety and security." It's also proposing changes to its site governance process, including a shift away from its current voting method for feedback on policy changes, which it says "incentivized the quantity of comments over their quality." The new method, it suggests, will lead to "more meaningful feedback and engagement."

 What's more, the company is also proposing some changes to its data use policy, including new filters that will replace the "Who can send you Facebook messages" setting in Messenger, and changes to how it refers to certain products like "instant personalization." It's also proposing some new reminders to inform people what's visible to others on Facebook, and various tips for managing your timeline. Of course, these are still just proposed changes, and it's giving users until November 28th to offer their feedback on them (Egan will then host one of the aforementioned live events to address the comments). You can find all of the proposed changes and details on how to have your say on them at the source link.
