The company has lost its way (and its market share) since then, but is trying to trump the competition again with the Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium HD soundcard. It's a PCIe powerhouse, an upgrade from the previous Fatal1ty-branded model thanks to its golden connectors and better onboard circuitry. What kind of circuitry? There's a NJM4556A dual op-amp, the same used by Grado's headphone amps, two National LME49710 op-amps, and a Burr-Brown PCM1794 DAC. If that's all a meaningless stream of letters and brands to you, don't worry: your on-board audio outputs will continue to do just fine. For those looking for a little more, all that remains to be seen is how Creative's HD offering will stack up against other audiophile-grade soundcards. We hope to be hearing about that very soon.
