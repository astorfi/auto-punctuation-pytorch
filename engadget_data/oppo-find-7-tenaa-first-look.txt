Remember when Chinese smartphone outfit Oppo promised two versions of its Find 7 handset? The first of the pair has just passed through China's telecoms regulator, spec list in tow. Sadly, this isn't the Quad-HD (aka: 2K) version of the device, but the 5.5-inch 1080p screen shouldn't be sniffed at. Inside, you'll find a 2.26GHz quad-core CPU, 2GB RAM, microSD card slot, a 2,700mAh removable battery, TD-LTE and Android 4.3. Weighing in at just 165 grams and only 9.2mm thick, we're looking forward to putting this thing through its paces on March 19th.
