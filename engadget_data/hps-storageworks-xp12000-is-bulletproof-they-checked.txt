See, they grew tired of just tossing around the term "bulletproof" for their half-milliondollar StorageWorks XP12000, and decided they'd pop a .308 caliber bullet through it to prove their point. They firedup the server and got it pumping out a few video streams, and then shot it clean through while the server kept onstreaming, thanks to a little bit of server redundancy. The bullet made it through the array and shattered a fish tankon the other side, but HP assures us in their must-see video of the incident that no animals or humans were harmed inthe making of this film, so it looks like the goldfish made it out ok -- though we're sure he would've droppeda few frames if they put a bullet through him, the slacker.[Via The Inquirer]
