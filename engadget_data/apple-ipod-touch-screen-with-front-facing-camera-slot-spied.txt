With just over four weeks to go before the most likely (but nigh confirmed) press event week is upon us, expect the rumor mill to ratchet up appropriately. Here's one care of Mac Rumors; the gang's been sent some pictures from parts supplier iPhonerevivers that allegedly show a new iPod touch LCD screen And sure enough, in place of an earpiece is a slot perfectly suited for that oft-rumored (and possibly email-based) front-facing camera. It's not the first time we've seen this piece -- the resemblance to early July's leak doesn't escape us -- but these photos are decidedly fresh and from a different source. Mounting evidence... or are we all just being had? Wouldn't surprise us if we found out for sure before ides of September.
