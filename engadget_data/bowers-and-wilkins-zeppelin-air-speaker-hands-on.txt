An addition to its existing Zeppelin line, the Air adds in AirPlay functionality for effortless streaming from iTunes or an iOS device. Stainless steel accents complement the oblong shaped boombox, and it can connect to your home network using either WiFi or Ethernet. We couldn't objectively judge sound quality in the acoustics of this massive Caesar's Palace conference room, but we'd expect nothing less than the best considering the price tag -- a steep $600. Feel free to feast your eyes on some speaker porn in the gallery below, that doesn't cost a thing.
