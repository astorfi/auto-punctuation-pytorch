 The Gefen wireless USB hub that we reported on back in the lazy, carefree days of May is finally hitting your block. According to a press release, the hub will be making an appearance at Infocomm 07 as well as going on sale "by show time", which means right now. The hub, if you'll recall, de-clutters workspaces by connecting a "sender/dongle" to your computer and a small receiver to a USB device, allowing for wireless operation up to 60 feet away. For those of us whose homes are starting to look like the ship from The Matrix, this may come as a welcome relief -- as long as you can swing the $399 price-tag.
