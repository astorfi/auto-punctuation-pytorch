Stacked to the gills with features like EV-DO, VCAST TV, a 2 megapixel camera with autofocus, expandable memory via a microSD slot, an exterior display which touchsrceen capability and another interior display that reveals a full QWERTY keypad, it's certainly designed to please almost anyone. Even though some of the features appear a little quirky -- like only being able to rotate the phone clockwise while snapping pics -- we're sure that you'll find great info in the quick start guide while you wait ever so patiently for its release.
