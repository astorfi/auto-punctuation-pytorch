In addition to Netflix, the console's streaming video options will include Hulu Plus, YouTube and Amazon Video. Unfortunately, the company didn't delve much into specifics beyond that, but it did confirm in a press release that it's working with those companies on video services that will "take advantage of the integrated second-screen experience." It's also clear that Nintendo is putting a much bigger emphasis on video and entertainment on the Wii U than it did on the original Wii -- "Games, Social, Entertainment" are the key words, as it puts it.
