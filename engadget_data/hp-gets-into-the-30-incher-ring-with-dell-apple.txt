 HP announced today the debut of its first 30-inch diagonal monitor, the LP3065, making us feel like our favorite 30-inch Dell monitors were yesterday's news. The web is sparse on details at this point, but you can bet it'll require a DVI-D dual link graphics card and will support 2560 x 1600 pixels. VARBusiness also pipes in, fresh from an HP event today in New York that the monitor will sport an 8-ms response time. PC World also adds in a blog post today the monitor will go for an estimated $2000 on November 1 that unlike HP's rivals Dell and Apple, HP is going goth on this one, sans metallic accents. Plus as a cherry on top, the monitor's LED will turn off after 15 seconds, allowing you to bask yourself in incandescent glory and not be asthetically distracted by soft lime green ugliness.
