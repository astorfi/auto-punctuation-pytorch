Latest on the block is So-net distributed highdefinition video on demand service, which plays back MPEG-2, VC-1, and h.264 videoÂ  on a Sentivision set top boxwith a 600MHz CPU and a 40GB internal drive; you pay for the privilege instantly with your FeliCa card, phone, implant,etc. We know, we know, it hurts; but one of these days when a large swath of this ginormous nation gets fiber to thehome, we'll probably ourselves likely see similar VOD / IPTV systems.[Via Impress]
