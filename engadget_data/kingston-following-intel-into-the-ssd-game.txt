This is a bold move for Kingston, which is usually known to stick to mature markets; clearly, the company sees the technology's potential. The effort "almost flies in the face of the usual Kingston model," said spokesman Dave Leong. "We are large and in charge!" (OK, so we made that last part up.) This is all set to pop off in Q4 2008 -- Samsung, you've been warned.
