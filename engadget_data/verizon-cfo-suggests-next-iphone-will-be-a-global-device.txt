The fluctuation, I believe, will come when a new device from Apple is launched, whenever that may be, and that we will be, on the first time, on equal footing with our competitors on a new phone hitting the market, which will also be a global device.
 That pretty clearly suggests that the next iPhone -- supposedly coming in September -- will be a world phone, which just so happens to coincide with rumors to same effect we've heard as recently as this week. Of course, there's been talk of a dual-mode GSM / CDMA iPhone even before that, considering that the Qualcomm baseband chip used in the Verizon iPhone is technically capable of supporting both CDMA and GSM networks -- Apple simply chose not to or wasn't able to take advantage of that particular functionality at the time.
