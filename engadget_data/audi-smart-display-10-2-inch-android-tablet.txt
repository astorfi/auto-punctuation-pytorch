German car manufacturer Audi just pulled the curtains back on its Audi Smart Display, a 10.2-inch Android tablet wrapped in brushed aluminum that lives in your auto. The slate is powered by an NVIDIA Tegra 4 chip, boasts crash resistance and the chops to survive temperatures as high as 80 degrees Celsius (176 degrees Fahrenheit). Of course, drivers aren't the target users for the device; passengers are. The hardware hooks up to vehicles over in-car WiFi and provides folks along for the ride with access to the web, media and navigation systems, and control over the radio, to boot. It's not clear what version of Google's OS it runs or if and when it'll find its way into autos on the road, but expect more details -- and a hands-on -- as CES continues.
