We weren't prepared to see anything you could plug into a USB port that's hotter than
USB sushi, but this is it. Available in several Chinese
and Japanese flavors including tempura, the flash drive devices pictured above are a dish called takoyaki which, being
a delicately prepared dish made out of octopus's (ahem) delicates, we'd just as soon plug it into a USB port as eat it.
Apparently these are complete rip-offs pricewise, but that's not really the point, here, is it?
