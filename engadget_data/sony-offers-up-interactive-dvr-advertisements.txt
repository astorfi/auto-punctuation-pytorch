 Since advertisers -- and broadcasting companies -- aren't exactly fond of folks cruising through those ads while watching a recorded show through their DVR, and can't seem to get legislation to make it illegal passed just yet, a few companies have resorted to clever tactics to get those spots viewed. KFC offered up a "secret message" that could only be seen if witnessed in slo-mo, and TiVo has been testing fast-forward-proof banner ads to get the idea across even when blasting through the commercial breaks. Now Sony is getting in the act, by teasing viewers with an interactive plug for its Bravia TVs that shows "alternate endings" tailored to both men and women. It should be noted that only viewers watching through a DVR / TiVo will have the, um, luxury, of being able to pick and choose which endings to see. Sony apparently hopes to draw more attention to that fresh new LCD lineup by making stagnant ads a bit more lively, but we think they should be focusing on ramping up production on those sure-to-be-sold-out-everywhere PlayStation 3s.[Via PVRWire]
