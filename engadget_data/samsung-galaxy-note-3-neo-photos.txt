Remember that talk of a lower-cost Galaxy Note 3? You may be looking at the phone right now. SamMobile claims to have photos of the rumored Galaxy Note 3 Neo (aka Lite), and they show what you'd expect -- a slightly smaller, less advanced version of Samsung's pen-toting flagship. The leak also includes benchmarks that back up rumors of an 8-megapixel camera, a 720p screen and a hexa-core processor with performance between that of the Galaxy S 4 and the full-size Note 3. There's no guarantee that the photos or the specs reflect a shipping product, but there are murmurs of a possible Neo launch at Mobile World Congress in late February; we may not have to wait long to learn more.
