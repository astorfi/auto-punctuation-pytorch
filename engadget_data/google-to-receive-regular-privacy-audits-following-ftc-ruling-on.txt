In a blog post today, Google also says that it will now "ask users to give us affirmative consent" before it makes any changes in how it shares their personal information, and it adds that it would like to "apologize again for the mistakes we made with Buzz." As for the FTC, chairman Jon Leibowitz describes the settlement as a "tough" one, and says simply that "when companies make privacy pledges, they need to honor them."
