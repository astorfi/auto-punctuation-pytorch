 We already knew the Tesla Model S was fast, but not this fast. After dropping a 12.371 quarter mile this past weekend at the Palm Beach International Raceway in Florida (@ 110.84 MPH), the National Electric Drag Racing Association awarded the Tesla Model S its stamp of officiation for being "the quickest production vehicle" in quarter mile tests. That's not just on a single pass, mind you, but several quarter mile runs over the course of a day at the track. Each pass reaffirmed a 12-second average from the 416HP electric beast -- more than proficient for a 4,700-lb hulk of metal, and more than competitive against much lighter and more expensive beasts. And that's all without internal combustion, lest you forget -- the thing even gets 350 miles per charge. Drag Times attended the event and promises video in the coming days, but for now you can peep the quarter mile timeslips and read their rundown.
