 Jolla had already mentioned that it would show its MeeGo-derived Sailfish OS in November, but the startup now has exact dates to mark on the calendar. Come November 21st and 22nd, we'll get a peek at Jolla's take on the open platform's interface, apps and SDK at the Slush conference in Helsinki. There won't be much hardware to see, however. Jolla plans to provide the first phone details and launch window before Christmas, which doesn't give much if any time for initial partners like D.Phone to get moving. We'd expect a more formal launch in the new year.
