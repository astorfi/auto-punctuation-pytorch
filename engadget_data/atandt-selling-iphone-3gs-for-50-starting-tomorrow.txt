 
You know what that is, don't you? That's right: AT&T's new $50 smartphone. In an aggressive move targeted at tweenagers still taking mirror-based MySpace profile pics with their Motorola RAZRs, both new and upgrade-eligible existing AT&T customers will be able to get the cut-rate iPhone 3GS starting tomorrow, January 7. According to the PR, the price for phones sold in Apple channels will be determined by -- you guessed it -- Apple, so bargain shoppers should stick to the AT&T retail outlets. And there you have it -- do with the information what you will. PR after the break.
