 Since Sony,et al.Â hammered out the Blu-ray Disc spec, there's beenspeculation, theorization, and discussionof an 8-layer 200GB disc. Sony even supposedly had some working 200GB BRD demos way back in2004. Well, now those mammoth coasters are in the works over at TDK, who apparently hope to commercialize the first presumablyquad-layered dual-sided discs (or possibly octo-layered single-sided discs -- yeah, right). They're not giving itup as to when these discs could come out or how much they'll cost, but right now we're more worried about just gettingour hands on some players, you know?[Via TechDigest]
