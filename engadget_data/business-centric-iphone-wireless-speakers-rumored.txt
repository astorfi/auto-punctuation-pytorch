 No sooner than JP Morgan squashes the iPhone nano rumor and gives legs to the 3G hunch, here we have more "Taiwanese sources" shooting off about future Apple and iPhone-related products. Granted, the vast majority of these propositions are bordering on laughable, but the suggestion of an "iPhone for business" isn't too far fetched -- especially considering that Apple has already hinted at appeasing the suits in due time. Additionally, these anonymous voices insinuated that Apple was working on a wireless audio system "that would allow music to be played directly from an iPod, iPhone, or range of Apple computers." We're not saying we believe any of it (yet), but feel free to affix your skepticism filter and hit the read link for the full report.[Thanks, Steven]
