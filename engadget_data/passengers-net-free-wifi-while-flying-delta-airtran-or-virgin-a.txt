For goodhearted, family-minded individuals who plan on jumping ship and heading to greener pastures for the holidays, you'll be elated to know that Delta, AirTran and Virgin America are all offering gratis in-flight Wi-Fi for the holidays. And shockingly enough, there's no catch. Despite being sponsored by Google's Chrome browser, you won't actually need it to access the respective services. Oh, and for those curious, the deal is active from November 20th, 2010 to January 2nd, 2011. You know, right before every nerd in the universe flies into LAS for CES. Nice cutoff date, guys.
