Last month we reported on how automakers are outfitting
new vehicles with black boxes without notifying consumers. In a rare case of having something positive to report in
the political realm, the North Dakota legislature is the first to set a precedent by making the black box data sole
property of the vehicle owner. The legislature overwhelmingly approved the bill, which also aims at requiring auto
manufacturers to notify owners of the presence of black boxes in their vehicles. It would require a court order before
any of the information recorded by the box can be used in court, and prohibits insurance companies from making access
to the box a condition of obtaining coverage. State Senator Ray Holmberg introduces the bill after discovering black
boxes were being put in cars without notice. Hey Ray â€” you reading? Nice job.
