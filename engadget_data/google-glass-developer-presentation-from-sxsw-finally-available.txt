If you're still thirsting over details about life with Google Glass, you can now sit back and experience the presentation (though not filmed in first person with one of the units -- opportunity missed) from SXSW last month. We covered it in our liveblog and dug up news on various apps already working with Google's Mirror API to present their information in ways that are designed for the wearable units, don't get in the way, and don't pop up at bad times. These are relatively new and unique issues to deal with since the information is being presented on a device that's in your face, so it will be interesting to see if developers are up to the challenge. Check after the break for 50 minutes of Googler Timothy Jordan showing the people what the Glass team has learned and implemented so far.
