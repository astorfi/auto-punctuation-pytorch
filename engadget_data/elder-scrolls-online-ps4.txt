In case you haven't already lost enough sleep (and probably a few girlfriends) to the Elder Scrolls Saga, Bethesda is turning the world into a next-gen MMO. The title appears to have many of the same, non-traditional (for an RPG) elements that made titles like Skyrim so successful but brings them to a massively multiplayer world in the vein of WoW. And, if any franchise has the ability to unseat the current king on online RPGs, it's the Elder Scrolls. There will be a beta period kicking off, starting with the PS4, before the title will officially hit shelves in the Spring of 2014. It's probably best to start stocking up on Red Bull and Cliff Bars now.
