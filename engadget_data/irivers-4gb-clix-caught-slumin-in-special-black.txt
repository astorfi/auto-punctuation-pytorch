Well, that's what Swedish site Min Hembio is reporting and if true, makes for a notable bump to that hotly reviewed Clix (U10). Expected in Sweden at the end of this month for 2,499 Swedish Kronas or right around 338 of that mean US green. Come on iriver, go ahead and prove us wrong. [Via dapreview]
