Dell is shipping its XPS M1330 laptop with a DVD-playing version of Ubuntu 7.10 pre-installed in the States now, exactly as promised. Everybody else got this about a week ago, but we're not bitter: the $954 US starting price sure beats the 799 Euros those suckers over there have to drop.[Thanks, Nigel]
