Philips, more known for its TVs and home appliances isn't entirely new to the DJ game, but it's certainly not the first brand that trips off the tongue when talking all things spin. Still, it's IFA, and Philips is having a product releasing spree, which includes a renewed venture into this space with the M1X-DJ system. Essentially, the M1X-Dj is an iPad and iPhone dock (via lightning connection) with DJ platters and a mini mixer built-in. It's compatible with Algoriddim's ubiquitous Djay app, and supports Bluetooth streaming also. The speakers pumps out your mixes at 80 watts, and can run on regular D-size batteries should you want to take the fun outside. There appears to be a shoulder strap, too, perhaps making this the accordion for the iOS generation? We'll find out in November when it comes out, costing 399 euros.
