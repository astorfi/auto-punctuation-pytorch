That's an image of the latest version of HTC's TouchFlo 3D, destined for inclusion on the company's next Windows Mobile smartphone -- likely the fabled Leo we've been hearing about oh so much over the past few days. pocketnow.com has posted a walkthrough of the UI, which looks lovely and clean and is a solid step up over previous revisions. It even runs quite well on this Touch Diamond2 it's been installed to, meaning performance should be incredibly snappy on the Leo if its hardware is as solid as is rumored. There's still no confirmation from HTC about any new hardware, but until that comes (it shouldn't be long, now) you can enjoy the enthusiastic video after the break.
