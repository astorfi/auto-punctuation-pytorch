 CERN's latest update to its elementary particle project states the new particle that it was able to pick up is behaving "more and more like a Higgs boson." The team isn't being particularly specific here, as its not certain just yet whether it's detected a 'standard model' particle or the lightest of several possible bosons predicted in other spin-off theories. Researchers are referencing the interactions of the particle (particularly its spin, or lack off) as the main reason why they reckon they're dealing with a genuine Higgs boson and work will now focus on exactly what kind of boson they've managed to snag.
