 It was just a few days ago that Evernote proudly teased us by saying it's fifth major release on Cupertino's mobile platform would be "coming soon," but the good news is the revamped note-taking application didn't take too long to officially arrive on iOS. Starting today, Evernote 5 will be available for folks using an iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, bringing with it a completely redesigned experience, a more accessible home screen (with quick access to notes, notebooks and more), as well as new features tailored specifically for Apple's slate and Premium users. Evernote 5 is up for download now, so those of you looking to try the new app should give the App Store link below a quick tap or download it straight from your device.
