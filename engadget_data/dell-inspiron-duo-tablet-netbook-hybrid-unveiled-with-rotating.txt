What started as a tablet device converted to a netbook just by opening to the keyboard and literally swiveling the screen from within the frame. This hybrid's got a 10-inch screen, houses a dual-core Atom N550 and runs Windows 7 Premium. And if it looks at all familiar, that's because we saw something eerily similar in a leak from April (hello, Sparta). No price given and Dell isn't providing us any more details, but it should be released by the end of this year.

Update: It ain't pretty, but we managed to bum rush the stage and get some footage of the Inspiron Duo during as it made its transformations to and from a keyboard-equipped existence. It's after the break... along with a press photo!

Update 2: And now we've got a much clearer video for your enjoyment. Check it out!

Update 3: Dell sent over a pretty hefty press photo, so we decided to break it down piece-by-piece. To the gallery!
