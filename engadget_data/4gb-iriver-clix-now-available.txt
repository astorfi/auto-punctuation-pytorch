The specs, in case you missed them, include a 2.2-inch QVGA display, built-in FM tuner, voice recorder, a promised 25 hours of battery life, and support for MP3, WMA, ASF, and OGG music files, as well as 	     MPEG-4 "simple profile" QVGA video -- not to mention the inclusion of a variety of Flash games. Also available are a couple of clix accessories, including a cradle (you'll need it if you want line in/out) and an FM transmitter and car charger. The accessory sure to see the most use, however, is the screen cleaner iriver's seen fit to throw in free of charge.[Thanks, Dan C.]
