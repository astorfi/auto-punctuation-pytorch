After getting some quality hands-on time with the FCC this week, the T-Mobile myTouch 4G Slide had a brief photo shoot showing off a few of its assets. The images, provided by one of BGR's sources, give us a brief look at the device's keyboard and some of its software specs. The myTouch 4G Slide appears to be running Android 2.3.4 -- the same version of Gingerbread found on the Nexus S -- and the latest iteration of HTC Sense UI. This source also confirmed an 8 megapixel camera and teased that the phone runs "as smoothly as the HTC Sensation" and the screen "isn't much to write home about." We hear that the myTouch 4G Slide is penciled in for the first half of July, and looks to be a mighty fine QWERTY-slide option within T-Mobile's Android stable. Or, as good as one can look given the circumstances.
