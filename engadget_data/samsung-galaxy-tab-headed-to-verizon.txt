That certainly sounds like it could be the Samsung i800 tablet we've seen on Verizon's well-leaked roadmap, and we can also say that we've heard (but not confirmed) that the Tab will have 512MB of RAM, that the interface is quite smooth but still stuttery in areas, and that battery life is about six hours -- but we'd take all that with a grain of salt, since anything can change before release. We're definitely poking around for more, we'll let you know.
