Yeah, it's not even remotely legal here in the US of FCC-A but who amongst us hasn't jonesed forsomething this discrete to bring a satisfying end to the inane prattle nearby? This device is specially tuned tocontinuously jam the popular Japanese carrier frequencies for 70 seconds and even allows you to politely fade-out acall you'd rather not be taking "with natural atmosphere" rather than attempting a throaty fake all MichaelWinslow like. Just $71 buys you a taste of moral grayness.[Via The Red Ferret Jounal]
