Internet Explorer 9 Beta has been in the wild (and thus, on your PC) for a few months now, and seeing that the browser wars are raging harder than ever these days, we felt it prudent to ask how you'd change things in the world of IE. After all, being that this is a beta, there's still plenty of time for Microsoft to actually heed your wisdom and implement changes prior to the full, final, non-beta release. So, have you been pleased with performance? Tab layout? Any tweaks you'd make to the user interface? Compatibility? Go on and get sophisticated down in comments below, won'tcha?
