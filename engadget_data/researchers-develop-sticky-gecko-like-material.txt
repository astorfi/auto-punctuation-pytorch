 Researchers at BAE Systems' Advanced Technology Centre in Bristol seem to have take a cue from Q's play book, developing a new synthetic material that could be used to create special wall-climbing suits for soldiers and spies. The material is designed to mimic a gecko's foot, which is covered with hairs so small that they form a bond with just about anything they touch, but can still be easily peeled off. In addition to human super-hero antics, the researchers say the material could also be used for wall-climbing robots. But the Brits aren't the only geeks that have turned to geckos for inspiration. As you may remember, some peeps at Stanford recently managed to not only replicate a gecko's sticky feet, but create a full-fledged geckobot.
