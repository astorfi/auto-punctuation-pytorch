  By now, you're well aware of the Lumia 900, the LTE-wielding Windows Phone that's set to do battle with the Titan II on AT&T. While we're still looking to a March arrival, if you happen to live close to a Microsoft retail store, you can pre-order one of these fine handsets for yourself today. We reached out to the folks in Redmond to confirm the news, who tell us that a Lumia 900 -- which has yet to be blessed with an official price -- can be secured for just $25. Of course, if you're nowhere within reach of a Microsoft outlet, well, it appears you've got a long drive ahead of you. Anyone road tripping it for this one?
