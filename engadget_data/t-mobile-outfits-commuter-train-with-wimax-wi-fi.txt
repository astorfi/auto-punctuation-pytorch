British commuters taking the train from Brighton to London can now while away the time on their WiFi-enabled devices
thanks to a new WiFi-and-WiMax
service set up by Nomad Digital and offered for free (for now) by T-Mobile.  This is the first time broadband WiFi
service has been offered on trains in the UK.  The system is not based on the proposed 802.16e mobile version of
WiMax, instead it uses an early implementation of 802.16d.  Of course, you won't be able to get a free ride for
long.  Starting in June, T-Mobile will begin to charge its normal rate for Wi-Fi hotspots, which is £5 per hour,
or £13 for a one day pass (athough it can also be used at other T-Mobile hotspots like Starbucks).
