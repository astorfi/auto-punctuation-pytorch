These snaps of productrenderings were grabbed by Digital Expert during a supposed interview with an iRiver authorized agent in China.Naturally, we have no way to validate if they are indeed, the real deal, but we do know that last month the SouthKorean RRL (the FCC's equivalent over there) approved an iRiver "6GB HDD Jukebox" which goes by the E10moniker. The pics show black and white models, and that's it -- no specs. So get to it, is this some suped-up mediaplayin' iRiver remote control or what?
