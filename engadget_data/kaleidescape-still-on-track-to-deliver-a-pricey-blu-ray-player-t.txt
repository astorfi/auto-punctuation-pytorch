We always suspected claims that the Mini Player's DVD upscaling "rivals Blu-ray" was a bit of a reach, even given the $3,000 price. Sadly, when the "doesn't have to rival Blu-ray, because it is Blu-ray" deck comes out, though, the ripped-for-whole-home-use joy you might expect from Kaleidescape will have to wait -- on deck for initial delivery is CD and DVD importing, but Blu-ray discs will be playback only for now (with Kaleidescape remaining "optimistic" that Blu-ray import gets support somewhere down the road). Then again, it's probably safe to assume that if you can afford to get into a Kaleidescape setup, you can afford a few extra copies of every title to sprinkle around the compound.
