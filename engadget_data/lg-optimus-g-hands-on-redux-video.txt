 By now, you should be well acquainted with LG's glass-clad Optimus G -- the Android device so nice the company introduced it twice. And while today's stateside splash narrows the focus on its US availability and Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro SoC, there are still some software nuggets worth exploring. To help illustrate the powers of this quad-core Krait beast, we dug through the company's take on ICS with its colorful icons and heaping helpings of convenient shortcuts. Users can take advantage of a multi-tasking feature called QSlide which displays two full-sized apps on the same screen, enjoy up to five levels of zoom during streaming video playback or even wirelessly mirror their smartphone's content with Dual Screen Dual Play.

 Like other members of the LG mobile family (such as the Vu and Intuition) you'll also be able to take advantage of QuickMemo, which places a shortcut in the notification shade for quickly capturing a screenshot and marking it up with various drawing tools. For the self portrait-obsessed there's also Cheese Shutter, which lets you trigger the image capture simply by saying "cheese" instead of fumbling blindly for the virtual shutter button on screen. While the UI can be a little bit busy, even by Android skin standards, everything hums a long pretty smoothly thanks to the almost excessive power of the quad-core 1.5GHz chip and 2GB of RAM. But don't just take our word for it. Skip on past the break for a surface-level peek of the G in action.
