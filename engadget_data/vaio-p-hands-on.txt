At first glance, the screen is bright and ultrasharp -- certainly stretching the limits of our eyesight. We'd say the keys are a little bit light and shallow for our taste, but good as far as most "netbooks" go, and the "nipple," like all like pointers, will take getting used to and careful calibration, though it's definitely sensitive. It's certainly not hefty, but we'd say there's the standard amount of Sony build quality, and while high for a netbook, $900 doesn't "feel" too far off. We love lightweight, but this netbook almost feels like it lacks innards, the real deal seems almost like it's a mock-up device. Videos of all its best sides after the break.
