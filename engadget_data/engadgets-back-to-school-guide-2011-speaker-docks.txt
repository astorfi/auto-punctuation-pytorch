 Welcome to Engadget's Back to School guide! We know that this time of year can be pretty annoying and stressful for everyone, so we're here to help out with the heartbreaking process of gadget buying for the school-aged crowd. Today, we have speaker docks in our sights -- and you can head to the Back to School hub to see the rest of the product guides as they're added throughout the month. Be sure to keep checking back -- at the end of the month we'll be giving away a ton of the gear featured in our guides -- and hit up the hub page right here.    Yeah, studying's the hip thing to do, but waking up for class is arguably where success begins. Rather than relying on some ear-piercing tone emitted from one's cellphone, we prefer something more... substantial. Here, we'll be covering the best and brightest in speaker docks, also known as the alarm clock that your grandkids will eventually point at and laugh, mockingly. Jump past the break for our recommendations, and another opportunity to enter our back to school giveaway. Simply leave a comment below to be entered to win, and head over to our giveaway page for more details.

 

 On the cheap Logitech Rechargeable Speaker S315i 
 She ain't the newest nor the flashiest, but Logitech's $60 S315i packs an awful lot of functionality into a reasonably cheap package. For one, Logi's sound quality at the low end is tough to beat, and furthermore, the rechargeable nature ensures that this one will pass muster in the dorm room and whilst tailgating.

 Key specs: Rechargeable, 20 hours of life, 3.5mm aux jack, iPod support, weighs 1.47 pounds

 Price: $60 on Amazon

      JBL On Stage Micro   Deadly simple, but then again, who would bother stealing it?

  Price: $53 on Amazon
  Mid-range Altec Lansing Octiv 650 
 Graduating up, you say? Altec's Octiv 650 adds a minor twist the common iPod sound system formula by throwing in a video output port, and for those wild and crazy Friday Thursday nights, the Music Mood app should provide all the hallucinogenic visualizations a studious boy / girl can handle.

 Key specs: Nested subwoofer, glorious remote, aux input, iPod support, video output, Music Mood app

 Price: $189 on Amazon
  You might also like...    Soundfreaq SFQ-1   Hello, beautiful! It's sexy on a (relative) budget, and who's not down with that?

     JBL OnBeat Dock   It's about as cheap as you'll find a worthwhile speaker dock that's hefty enough to hold your iPad.

  Price: $150 on Amazon
  Money's no object Bowers & Wilkins Zeppelin Air 
 Upgraded to your very own apartment? Kudos. Now, grab yourself the most oversized, awkwardly-shaped dock on the market. In all seriousness, the Zeppelin Air does indeed pack world-class audio quality, built-in AirPlay support and an unforgettable (for better or worse) design.

 Key specs: Dual 1-inch tweeters, 3-inch mids and a single 5-inch subwoofer, AirPlay support, USB connectivity, iPod compatibility, composite video output

 Price: $600 on Amazon
  You might also like...    Yamaha TSX-140   It ain't old, but it sure looks the part. And hey, no one ever said well-placed retro was cheap.

  Price: $370 on Amazon
     JBL On Air Wireless AirPlay speaker dock   It looks like something you'd find in a beauty parlor, but it'll stream your iPod / iPhone jams wirelessly via iTunes.

  Price: $350 on Amazon
