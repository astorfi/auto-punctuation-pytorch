Panasonic will become the largest shareholder of the scandal-ridden camera maker, reeling from a $1.7 billion accounting fraud uncovered last year, with an eye on getting a foothold in Olympus' profitable medical imaging business. It gives us hope that the current range of blockbuster shooters including the OM-D won't be sacrificed in a last-ditch attempt to make the books balance.

 Update: Outgoing Panasonic president Fumio Ohtsubo has strongly denied the reports, saying that there's no company plan to invest. That clears that up, then.
