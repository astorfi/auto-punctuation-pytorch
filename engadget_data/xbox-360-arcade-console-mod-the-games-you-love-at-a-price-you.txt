We just spoke with our man Justin at Solomods, and he has a custom-built Xbox 360 arcade machine that he's willing to part with for a mere $2,250. This original Midway arcade cabinet was once home to The Simpsons game, and aside from the addition of the Microsoft game console it's been repainted and fitted with a new monitor and front-loading disk tray, two joysticks, a 60GB hard drive, WiFi, and display and volume control. Additionally, your favorite wireless controller is supported, and if you order now he'll throw in an illustrated owners manual. How awesome is that? Available for pick-up somewhere in the badlands south of Cleveland, Ohio -- hit the read link to get in on some of that action. More pics after the break.[Via Technabob]
