"And here's my 'one more thing,'" Bre Prettis said with a smile, wrapping up tonight's MakerBot press conference at CES. Adding onto the company's much-loved Thingiverse database, MakerBot is offering up a way to purchase high-quality models for printing. The store features a number of collections, which you can either buy together or one piece at a time. The collections feature people, trucks, rocket ships, dragons, aircrafts and animals -- all solid choices. All of the sets are available now, with prices starting at $1 for single models and $10 for full collections. If you've got a MakerBot Replicator 2 at home, you can print one out today.
