 It's been quite a while since Samsung announced the first actual memory device to result from its 30nm manufacturing process, but it's now back with an announcement for another pair of memory products that should both be hitting the market relatively soon. The larger of those is a new 64GB moviNAND embedded memory device, which joins the company's existing 32GB, 16GB, 8GB and 4GB options, and measures just 1.4mm thick while still packing 16 30nm-class 32Gb MLC NAND chips and a controller. That's joined by a new 32GB microSD card, which fully doubles the capacity of the highest capacity microSD cards currently on the market, and is apparently now being sampled by OEMs with mass production slated to begin sometime next month.
