 Australia's Digital Photography Blog is reporting that an anonymous source has emailed them detailed specs of Sony's upcoming DSLR, which -- if accurate -- show that the company's first foray into this product category will sport a 10.2 megapixel CCD and go by the name Alpha 100. As we already knew, this model will be compatible with existing Konica Minolta lenses as well as some 20 new lenses that Sony plans to release over the next year, but the information revealed today would seem to flesh out all of the remaining details concerning features, pricing, and availability that had previously been unknown. DPB's tipster claims that the 100 will rock an anti-reflective 2.5-inch, 230,000 pixel LCD, in-body Super SteadyShot image stabilization, maximum ISO of 1600, nine-point auto focus, CompactFlash support (but oddly enough, your MemoryStick Duo cards will only work with the included adapter), a reported 750-shot battery, and about a million different shooting modes and scene settings. If we are to believe what this mystery "insider" says, you'll be able to pick up your very own Alpha next month for around $1,000, sans lens.[Via Let's Go Digital, thanks Pascal V.]
