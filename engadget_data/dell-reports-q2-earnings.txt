Well, it's probably not as glowing a quarter as the company was hoping for, but a slight rebound in profits from last quarter should give it something to smile about. Revenue was up roughly $100 million sequentially, which translated into an equal amount of additional profit. After netting just $635 million in income during Q1, Dell banked $732 million in Q2 of 2013. Year-over-year, however, things are a little less rosy. Revenue was down eight percent and net income a worrisome 18 percent. Still, while its consumer arm continues to struggle (where revenue is down 22 percent), its enterprise services division continues to grow, raking in $4.9 billion this quarter -- up six percent from the same time last year and matching its previous record. The company expects revenue to continue to fall next quarter, but expects good things from it Enterprise Solutions, Services and Software division going forward.

 Update: Dell's slide deck -- partially shown above -- unsurprisingly points out that Windows 8-based Ultrabooks, all-in-one desktops and tablets are on deck, but it also mentions a mysterious "converged device" segment as well. Hmm.
