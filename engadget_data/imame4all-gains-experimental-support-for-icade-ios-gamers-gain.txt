 Guess what, emulation junkies? iMAME4All, a staple amongst retro iOS gamers, can now support iCade. Thanks to one Todd Laney, there's now a 3.5MB download that'll bring the joys of iCade to a relatively commonplace MAME application (and vice-versa). We're told that the best way to use these two is in fullscreen portrait mode, and after tapping the option button (and selecting "Options), the onscreen controls will fade out and the iCade buttons will appear. Looks like that Benjamin you just saved up now has yet another reason to be spent.

[Thanks, Jim]
