 
Word from Multichannel News is that -- particularly in light of DISH's SlingLoaded DVR -- Comcast, Time Warner and Cox are all looking to include place-shifting rights in their latest carriage negotiations, promising subscriber access to their TV content even away from home. Unfortunately it appears their idea is to provide the TV feed over the Internet -- think Fancast and Starz Play -- instead of direct (and likely bandwidth consuming) DVR access. No word on which, if any, networks have agreed to such an arrangement but it does raise the question: would streaming access via PC or cellphone be enough to keep you from switching to satellite?
