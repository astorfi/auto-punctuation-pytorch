Surely, right? Instead, rather than finishing with his usual "one more thing" flourish today, Steve Jobs just left a stunned audience with the terse statement that Apple will be "bringing OS 4 to the iPad this fall." That's like... a whole different season from the new operating system's release. Why Steve, why?
