 Along with its new smaller (and cheaper) 4K TVs, Sony has announced its FMP-X1 4K media player and 4K video distribution service. Plans for both were first revealed at CES, however the official press release (included after the break) provides the full details, that it will be $699 and arrive preloaded with 10 4K films and shorts when it ships this summer. Starting in the fall, the video service will launch, with "fee-based" access to Sony's library of movies. Sony also revealed that it has started adding to the 4K movie collections for the buyers of its $25k 84-inch Ultra HDTV, delivering Lawrence of Arabia. Those buyers will be able to swap their current player for the FMP-X1 when the 4K distribution network launches in the fall. The "mastered in 4K" (but delivered in 1080p) Blu-ray discs are still part of the plan as well, and buyers of the new TVs can expect Spiderman, Ghostbusters and Angels & Demons as pack-ins.

   Bringing Enhanced Video, Superior Sound and a Variety of Content Options to TV Fans

   LAS VEGAS, April 7, 2013– Sony Electronics is announcing prices and availability for its new 4K Ultra High Definition TV sets unveiled at CES in January. The new XBR-55X900A (55-inch) and XBR-65X900A (65-inch) 4K Ultra HD LED TVs will cost $4,999 and $6,999 respectively and are available for order online and at retail beginning April 21, 2013.

   Sony is also announcing its 4K Media Player, the FMP-X1, and video distribution service – both industry firsts.

   "These new models will be arriving in homes just before the summer and are sure to bring the enhanced viewing experience of 4K TV to a whole new audience," said Mike Lucas, senior vice president, Sony Electronics Home Division. "Our TVs deliver a vibrant and natural picture that is four-times clearer than high definition. As for content, these new sets enhance all of the video people are watching today, and this summer our 4K media player, followed in fall by the video distribution service will demonstrate how Sony continues to lead in bringing the 4K entertainment experience to viewers."

   Starting today, six Sony Store locations (Century City, Calif.; Costa Mesa, Calif.; Houston; Las Vegas; New York and Palo Alto, Calif.) will be the first to feature the XBR-55 & 65X900A 4K TVs, offering consumers in-store demonstrations of true 4K and enhanced (upscaled) video.

   This summer, consumers of Sony's 4K UHD TVs can purchase the FMP-X1 4K Media Player bundled with 10 feature films and video shorts in true 4K resolution for $699. In the fall of 2013, users of the same 4K Media Player will be given access to a fee-based video distribution service offering a library of 4K titles from Sony Pictures Entertainment and other notable production houses. The feature films included with purchase of the 4K Media Player are Bad Teacher, Battle: Los Angeles, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Karate Kid (2010), Salt, Taxi Driver, That's My Boy, The Amazing Spider-Man, The Other Guys and Total Recall (2012).

   With a variety of options already available for the home theater, only Sony can bring true 4K content to consumers. Last November, in another first, Sony gave native 4K movies and video to consumers who purchased the XBR-84X900, Sony's first and biggest 4K Ultra HD TV. Making good on its promise to periodically update and add content to the system, Sony recently began delivering new 4K content to 84-inch XBR owners with the home server. Along with a slew of new 4K video shorts, the classic film Lawrence of Arabia has been added to their libraries, which was recently remastered in 4K resolution by Sony Pictures Colorworks. Owners of the first generation video server will be able to exchange that device for the FMP-X1 4K Media Player, once the distribution service launches in the fall.

   To coincide with the availability of Sony's new 4K Ultra HD TVs, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is also bringing to market a lineup of "Mastered in 4K" Blu-ray™ Discs. With 1080p high definition picture that's derived from the highest quality 4K source materials with new expanded color, consumers will enjoy a dynamic and vibrant picture that's both optimized for the 4K Ultra HD TVs and plays back on all existing Blu-ray™ players and HDTVs. As an added bonus, consumers who purchase the XBR-55X900A or XBR-65X900A 4K Ultra HD TV will also receive Spider-Man (2002), Ghostbusters and Angels & Demons "Mastered in 4K" Blu-ray Discs (while supplies last).
