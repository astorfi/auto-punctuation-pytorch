Overall, they found performance to be quite good, clocking in at 3.05 Mbps down and 2.4 Mbps up. That compares very favorably to Verizon's EV-DO network, which delivered 1.43 Mbps down and 0.54 Mbps up in the same locations. Sprint's network also beats Clearwire's WiMAX down in Reno both in speed and in connectivity; testers in the Biggest Little City in the World couldn't get a signal while in a car, but those in Baltimore could, albeit at half the speed as when stationary. So, it certainly sounds like a good solution for those who need a high-speed connection on the go -- so long as they're only going to places within Baltimore, of course.
