Jesse Sullivan lost both arms after touching live wires as a Tennessee utility lineman. Researchers have been able
to fit him with artificial limbs he can actually control merely by thinking, moving them by will just as if they were
real limbs. He also reportedly feels sensation in the bionic arms and, eventually, tiny sensors in the fingertips will
allow him to feel texture and temperature as well.
