Besting the specs of most UMPCs while combining a 77-key keyboard, the SA1F00 might just be what the aspiring UMPC fan boy has been waiting for. Ok it's not a true UMPC, but this ultra-portable Windows XP device features AMD's 500MHz Geode LX800 CPU, a 7-inch 800x480 touch-sensitive display, up to 1GB of memory and 80GB of disk, 802.11b/g WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, 3-in-1 memory card and CF card slots, and respectable 5-hour battery with a 2.2-hour full recharge or 1.5-hours for 85% juice. Oh, and it measures just 218 x 163 x 25.4-mm / 8.6 x 6.4 x 1-inches while tipping the scales at 960-grams / 2.1-pounds. And get this, it all starts at a mere ¥89,000 (about $754) with a 40GB disk on up to ¥109,800 (about $930) for 80GB of disk and MS Office pre-installed. Compare that to the $1,178 Raon Vega, $2,000 Vaio UX290P, or $800 ASUS R2H and you'll understand the fuss. [Via Akihabara News]
