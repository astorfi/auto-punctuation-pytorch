As expected, the new rig is basically a non-glam version of the Digital Clutch, and specs appear to be right in line with what we've seen: 10-inch screen, sub-1-inch thickness, and 2.25-pound starting weight -- and we're guessing the Mini 1000 also gets the upgrade to an Intel Atom over the 2133's VIA C7-M. Not bad at all for a starting price tag of $399 -- hopefully we'll find out a lot more soon.[Via jkOnTheRun]
