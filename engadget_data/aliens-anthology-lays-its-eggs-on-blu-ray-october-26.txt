 
Rumors have been floating around for some time that Fox would provide a boxed set of all four Alien films this year, and today IGN blew out the details of the release, and promotional tie ins that will show up at Comic-Con. sporting a $139.99 RRP (it's already up on Amazon for preordering at a more reasonable $98) it will fill six discs with more than 12,000 images and 60 hours of special footage including everything from the earlier Quadrilogy and LaserDisc releases. Beyond the four movie discs, which include a "MU-TH-UR Mode" for interactive access to special content, disc five is all about the making of each flick, while disc six holds a wealth of production info and featurettes from each movie. Fans can dig in to the list of special features after the break or check IGN for all the info, but expect to be quite busy this Halloween one way or another.
