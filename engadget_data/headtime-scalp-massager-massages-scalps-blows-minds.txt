And, since human slavery was outlawed a good while ago, our only choice left is modern technology. Enter the Headtime scalp massager, produced by Kinatech. This outsized helmet has an array of 29 silicone balls for acupressure and 34 ceramic ones for... well, we don't actually know. There's an internal speaker with the soothing sounds of nature, as well as a temperature controller, which suggests this bad boy could serve as a pretty awesome cranium heater as well. Do yourself a favor and check out the rather threatening looking inside of the helmet after the break.
