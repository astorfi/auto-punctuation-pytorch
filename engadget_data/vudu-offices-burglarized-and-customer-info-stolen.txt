 Usually when customer info is snatched up by a ne'er-do-well, it's done digitally. Video streaming service Vudu, however, was the victim of an old fashioned burglary on March 24th of this year when someone broke into its offices and stole hard drives with customer data on them. According to an e-mail sent out to users today, those HDDs "contained customer information, including names, email addresses, postal addresses, phone numbers, account activity, dates of birth and the last four digits of some credit card numbers." Thankfully, the full CC numbers aren't kept by Vudu, but all the same, the service is giving affected accounts AllClear ID protection for free for one year. Vudu's also requiring users to reset their passwords today -- despite the fact that the passwords on the stolen drives are encrypted -- to ensure that everything will be safe and sound moving forward.
