 
 Nikon clearly wants to make amends for its unspectacular J2 launch late last summer: it's launching not one but two 1 series models that provide a stronger incentive to go Nikon among lower-end mirrorless cameras. The 14.2-megapixel J3 and 10.1-megapixel S1 mostly receive hand-me-down features from the semi-pro V2, although that's not necessarily a bad thing. The leftovers give them uncommonly accurate 73-point autofocusing and an upgraded Expeed 3A processor that can handle 15FPS burst photography with continuous focus -- three times the frame rate of the J2 in the same conditions. Apart from their resolution, the main separators between the J3 and S1 are the J3's inclusion of a simple panorama mode and a slightly wider ISO range for the S1, which starts at ISO 100 versus the J3's 160.

 Both new bodies ship in February, when the S1 will lower the 1 system's entry price to $500 with an 11-27.5mm lens, and the J3 will have a suitably in-between price of $600 with 10-30mm optics. The shooters will soon be joined by new lenses and accessories, as well. A 6.7-13mm (18-35mm equivalent), f/3.5-5.6 wide-angle lens and a 10-100mm (27-270mm equivalent) f/4-5.6 telephoto zoom don't have definitive release dates, but should respectively cost $500 and $550. Scuba divers who want a J3 or S1 for their excursions will also get a WP-N2 underwater case in February, albeit at a $750 price that's more expensive than the cameras themselves.

  New Nikon 1 System Cameras and Lenses Demonstrate Nikon's Commitment to Providing Shooters with New Ways to be Creative, Expressive and Connected through Images and Video
  Las Vegas, CES Booth #8643 (January 7, 2013) – Today, Nikon Inc. announced the new Nikon 1 J3 and Nikon 1 S1, the latest additions to the ever growing Nikon 1 Advanced Camera with Interchangeable Lens System. Designed for consumers looking for a camera that offers the compact size and portability of a point-and-shoot camera along with advanced controls and features found in high-end digital cameras, the new J3 and S1 cameras offer enhanced speed and performance, high image quality and new easy-to-use creative shooting modes. Furthermore, users will be able to easily share and transfer images to smart devices instantly when connected to the optional WU-1b Wireless Mobile Adapter1.
  Nikon also announced new accessories for the Nikon 1 System, including two new additions to the 1 NIKKOR lenses lineup, the VR 6.7-13mm f/3.5-5.6 and the VR 10-100mm f/4-5.6, ideal lenses for capturing amazing images and HD video with incredible detail. The 6.7-13mm is the first 1 NIKKOR lens to offer a wide, 100-degree angle of view, and the compact and lightweight 10-100mm is a 10x zoom lens that is ultra-portable, perfect for taking on any type of trip or excursion. Nikon has also announced the new WP-N2 underwater case, specifically designed for the adventurous user looking to take their photography on water-based excursions like snorkeling or surfing without the fear of water damaging their camera.
  "With today's announcement of the Nikon 1 J3, Nikon 1 S1, 1 NIKKOR VR 6.7-13mm lens and 1 NIKKOR VR 10-100mm lens, Nikon continues to demonstrate our commitment to developing and expanding the Nikon 1 System for creative shooters looking to step up from their compact digital cameras," said Bo Kajiwara, Vice President of Marketing, Planning and Customer Experience, Nikon Inc. "Similar to previous Nikon 1 System cameras, the compact yet powerful J3 and S1 offer stunning image quality, quick performance, incredibly fast shooting speeds, user-friendly modes and controls, as well as the ability to wirelessly share and transfer images when paired with the WU-1b Wireless Mobile Adapter."
  Built to Capture and Deliver Stunning Results: The New Nikon 1 J3 and Nikon 1 S1
  Though new additions to the Nikon 1 System, both the J3 and S1 feature many proven and trusted Nikon technologies commonly found in other Nikon camera models. The Nikon 1 J3 features a 14.2-megapixel CX-format CMOS sensor, while the Nikon 1 S1 sports a 10.1-megapixel CX-format CMOS sensor. Paired together with Nikon's powerful EXPEED 3A image processing engine, these CMOS sensors deliver stunning high-quality images and HD video even in challenging lighting situations with rich detail. For complete shooting versatility, both cameras feature a wide ISO range, from 160 to 6400 in the J3 and 100 to 6400 in the S1, allowing users even more freedom and capabilities when capturing content in low-light situations. Both cameras offer wide and bright 3-inch LCD screens as well as a new integrated flash that can be setup to go off automatically or can be manually popped up based on a shooter's desired results.
  Additionally, the Nikon 1 J3 and Nikon 1 S1 offer Nikon's Advanced Hybrid Autofocus (AF) system, which is lightning fast and highly responsive, ideal for capturing life's split second moments. With this rapid AF system, users can take advantage of incredibly fast shooting speeds, allowing them to capture fast action that is sharp and in clear focus. The cameras also feature a 73-point AF array that helps ensure accuracy and super precise focus even when capturing fast moving subjects throughout the frame. Further, the Nikon 1 J3 and Nikon 1 S1 include the world's shortest release time at approximately 80 milliseconds*, and the world's fastest high-speed continuous shooting** at 15 frames-per-second with continuous AF.
  Creativity Unleashed: User-Friendly Shooting Modes and Controls
  Designed to take creative freedom to new heights, the Nikon 1 J3 and Nikon 1 S1 offer user-friendly shooting modes and controls that photographers can take advantage of whether capturing a family portrait or recording a video of the big hit at a ballgame. For easier control and quick access to camera features, the J3 utilizes improved menu navigation while the S1 features a graphic user interface (GUI) based mode selection, both designed to be easy-to-use and make menu navigation effortless and direct.
  The new Nikon 1 System cameras both feature unique shooting modes like Auto Mode, Creative Mode, Advanced Movie, Motion Snapshot and Best Moment Capture, all of which are easily accessible and applied. When in Auto Mode, both cameras will automatically select the optimal settings for the scene, so that the shooter can concentrate on framing the photo. When in Creative Mode, shooters can utilize full manual exposure controls (P,S,A,M) as well as Selective Color, Miniature, Soft, Night Landscape, Backlighting and Night Portrait modes to help achieve the desired results that they seek. The Nikon 1 J3 also provides access to Easy Panorama Mode to provide a wide perspective for vast landscapes or interiors.
  The Advanced Movie Mode is integrated into both new cameras to bolster video capabilities. When in Advanced Movie Mode, the simultaneous shooting of Full HD video and high-resolution stills of a subject or scene is achievable. Furthermore, full manual exposure controls (P,S,A,M) can be used and slow motion movies at both 400 fps and 1200 fps can also be captured when in this mode. Both cameras share the Enhanced Motion Snapshot Mode to provide users with the option of capturing a quick passing moment with a short, slow-motion movie sequence in addition to a single defining still image. When using Motion Snapshot, in-camera electronic Vibration Reduction (eVR) can be applied to assist in removing blur from images.
  With Best Moment Capture Mode, Nikon 1 J3 and Nikon 1 S1 shooters can explore the benefits of two dynamic features, Slow View and Smart Photo Selector. In Slow View, the pressing of the shutter button halfway down once focus is achieved will allow users to capture live action (approx. 1.33 seconds), while the view of the subject is displayed at five times slower than normal speed (approx. 6.66 seconds) on the camera's LCD screen. Furthermore, the slowed-down view is looped over and over until a full-press of the shutter is made. By viewing action slowed down, users have more opportunities to capture the perfect moment. When Smart Photo Selector is used, shooters can capture up to 20 shots with the J3 and 15 shots with the S1 with one press of the shutter button. The cameras will then automatically identify the five best images to keep based on exposure, focus and facial recognition factors.
  Instantly and Easily Share Creative Content: Nikon 1 System Connectivity
  Like the Nikon 1 V2, the Nikon 1 J3 and Nikon 1 S1 were designed to work with Nikon's optional WU-1b Wireless Mobile Adapter. When the WU-1b is connected to the J3 or S1, users have the ability to capture high-quality images and can then easily transfer them wirelessly to a smart device. Once transferred, images can be shared with family and friends or posted to status pages on social media networks. If using the free Wireless Mobile Adapter Utility application for Android™2 platform smart devices as well as iPhone® and iPad®3 mobile digital devices, J3 and S1 users will have the ability to remotely take photos with the camera from a smartphone or tablet.
  Expansion of the 1 NIKKOR Lens Lineup: The New 1 NIKKOR VR 6.7-13mm and VR 10-100mm Lenses
  Alongside the new Nikon 1 System cameras, Nikon also announced the addition of two new 1 NIKKOR lenses, the 6.7-13mm f/3.5-5.6 and 10-100mm f/4-5.6. With these two lenses, Nikon 1 shooters have even more options when building a camera system that fits their shooting needs and creativity. The new compact, ultra wide-angle zoom 6.7-13mm lens (equivalent to a focal length of 18mm to 35mm in FX/35mm format) will provide photographers with new avenues to explore their creativity and expressivity in photos and videos. The lens includes Vibration Reduction (VR) and has a wide 100-degree angle of view, which makes it ideal for capturing photos and HD video of landscapes, cityscapes, interiors, and architecture. Photographers looking for some more range with their Nikon 1 System cameras will enjoy the new 10-100mm telephoto zoom lens (equivalent to a focal length of 27mm to 270mm in FX/35mm format), which also incorporates Vibration Reduction (VR). The compact and lightweight telephoto lens is portable and convenient enough to take everywhere, while providing a long focal range perfect for various types of photography including group shots and action sports.
  Capturing Images Underwater: The New WP-N2 Underwater Case
  Perfectly paired with the new Underwater White Balance setting found in both the Nikon 1 J3 and Nikon 1 S1, Nikon has introduced the new WP-N2 underwater case. This new underwater case can house either the J3 or the S1 in addition to the 1 NIKKOR 10-30mm lens. Moreover, the WP-N2 underwater case will allow users to zoom in and out when using the 10-30mm lens. Designed to complement the versatility of the Nikon 1 System cameras, the WP-N2 gives shooters the creative freedom to capture images and videos at the beach, the lake or during aquatic adventures such as snorkeling. The underwater case is submergible and waterproof up to approximately 131 feet (40 meters). Additionally, the new J3 and S1 feature an Underwater White Balance setting which makes adjusting white balance easy when capturing photos underwater.
