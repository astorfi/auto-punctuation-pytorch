Not only ready to help users find and watch regular TV shows, it's built for pulling in content from the Internet or locally connected PCs. Of course, among the nice features like Smart Recommendations and rich program descriptors / cover art of TV shows are bits like space for ad graphics loaded at the whim of the manufacturer. Check out the gallery for a preview and hope that gray box on the side isn't too annoying.
