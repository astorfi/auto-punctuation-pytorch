As expected, the color screen reader being hooked up with some upgrades of its own -- there will be 100 enhancements in all, according to Barnes & Noble. Central to the upgrade is content from top-tier content streaming sites like Hulu, Pandora, Grooveshark and MOG. Looks like it's not time to count the Nook Color out just yet.
