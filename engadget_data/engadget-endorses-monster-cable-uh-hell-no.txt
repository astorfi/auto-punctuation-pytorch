It's ironic, really, given that we currently have a blacklist in place for the overpriced cable-maker because of their rotten business practices (like regularly going after other companies that happen to use the word monster in their name, faking performance tests, and generally bilking customers out of their hard-earned dough). Regardless, if Monster wants to use a quote from Engadget, that's no problem. We suggest this one:
Monster Cable sucks.
Update: Monster has removed the quote from the site. Now that was fast. Power to the people!  [Thanks, Michael K.]
