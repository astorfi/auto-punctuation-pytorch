It's still not muchto look at, but the Star Trek measures in just 1.9-mm fatter than the RAZR, yet throws-down Windows Mobile 5.0, 64MBRAM, a 1.3 (not 2) megapixel camera, a 2.2-inch, 320 x 240 Transflective LCD, and quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support.Alas, the model reviewed only featured 64MB of ROM, not the 128MB we heard about earlier --however, that might be rectified with an updated model release in Q4. Still, if you're hungry for storage, it offers-upMicroSD expansion albeit, beneath the SIM card making quick access a pain. We're willing to overlook the fact that itsports a non-standard flat, mini-USB connector since the review calls it the "fastest Windows Mobile powereddevice" they have seen to date thanks to a nimble 200MHz OMAP processor. While we don't have any pricing or datesfor US availability yet, you can expect these to drop in Europe sometime next month. More pics after the break.
