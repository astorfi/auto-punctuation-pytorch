 Well, lookie here: it's not up on Palm's support site yet, but Sprint is showing a release date of December 28 -- that's today, by the way -- for webOS 1.3.5 on the Pre. This is a pretty nifty little upgrade, you might recall -- nifty enough to get none other than CEO Jon Rubinstein to name-drop it during the company's most recent earnings call -- thanks to the removal of the platform's troublesome app storage limit, better performance, better battery life (particularly in weak cell coverage), and a host of bugfixes sure to put a smile on your pretty face. Let us know how those updates go, alright?

[Thanks, Gon Kim]
