And the industrial design is straight-up Cold War. Still, it delivers 3D without special glasses and does so with surprisingly realistic detail -- it really does work. Yeah, you have to position yourself oh so carefully just in front of FujiFilm's €349 FinePix 3D Viewer or printed photos courtesy of a FujiFilm web service, but the novelty might be worthwhile for those with money to burn. It begins shipping to Europe and likely beyond in late September. Check the video demonstration from IFA and let Germania wash over you.
