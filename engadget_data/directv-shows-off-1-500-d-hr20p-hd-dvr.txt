 
As much aswe'd like to find out more information about DirecTV's D-HR20PHD DVR, pretty much everything we know, we've already said. The box, which the satellite broadcaster showed off at EHXlast week, apparently has 750GB capacity, an integrated HD receiver, and will sell for between $1,500 and $2,000. Ifit's ever released, that is. Since DirecTV insists this isn't a "consumer device" (and it certainly does havea sort of retro-industrial, rack-mount look to it), it may just be a prototype box designed to show that the company iscommitted to rolling out bigger and better HD solutions.
