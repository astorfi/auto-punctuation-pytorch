 Ok, so Apple mockups seem to surface every other week or so, and while some renditions are utterly believable, there are a few that take the cake when it comes to eliciting a grin. The latest iPhone forgery (vid after the break) is brought to us courtesy of an (unsurprisingly) anonymous individual and YouTube, where an Apple Remote is apparently (and magically, no less) transformed into a cellphone. Aside from the awfully rendered fonts, "2D" appearance, and out-of-sync "clicks," we highly doubt Apple would create a mobile based on a Front Row controller. Regardless, we thank the dear creator for giving us such a hearty laugh, but this unfortunately won't quite make the cut for FCC Fridays.[Via TUAW]
