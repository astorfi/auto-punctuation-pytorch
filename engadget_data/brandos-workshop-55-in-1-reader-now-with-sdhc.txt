We're not going to run down the whole list for you, but you should know that the reader supports not only the new SDHC (SD 2.0) card format, but also the unannounced and likely fictitious (for now anyway) "SDHC 2.0" format. Looks like they're taking their product cues from AData who have been mislabeling their SDHC cards since day 1. It's products like this which remind us just how fractured the consumer electronics business can be. Yours at the end of November for $28.
