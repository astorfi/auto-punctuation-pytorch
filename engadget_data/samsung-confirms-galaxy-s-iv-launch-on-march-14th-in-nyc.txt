 
 It was true. And then it wasn't. Now, here at MWC in Barcelona, Samsung has finally confirmed its rumored March 14th launch event for the much-anticipated Galaxy S IV. The smartphone giant's latest flagship is set to debut in New York City, apparently by popular demand. "We introduced the Galaxy S III in London last year," Samsung Electronics' mobile division chief JK Shin told Edaily news. "This time we changed the Venue (to New York)... as we were bombarded with requests from US mobile carriers to unveil the Galaxy S IV in the country." As with any such announcement, details are sparse at best, so we'll need to wait a few more weeks before confirming specs and appearance for the Galaxy S III successor. But, as always, you're welcome to shout out your best guesses in the comments.
