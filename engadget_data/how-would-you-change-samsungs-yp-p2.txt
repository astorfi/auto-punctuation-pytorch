 
Considering that Samsung's YP-P2 just might be the most updated PMP of all time, we're guessing that a lot of things that users would have changed just months ago have already been done by the powers that be. That being said, we critical gadget owners are never truly satisfied at heart, so we're curious to know how you'd spin the forthcoming firmware update(s). Or would you focus your attention on external matters, instead? We know you've had ample time to fool around with one of Sammy's most prized media players ever, so don't be shy down there in comments, alright? Who knows -- your recommendations could be front and center in the next Blue Wave.
