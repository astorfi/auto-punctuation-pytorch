The future of Motorola's smartphones are now falling into place, and we couldn't be more excited. Following the FCC certification of the XT1058 for AT&T, a similar test report for the XT1056 has just crossed our desk. This time around, the smartphone carries certification for LTE Band 25, which puts it as a dead ringer for a Sprint device. Regardless of whether this handset turns out to be the purported "X phone" is almost beside the point, because we already know that cross-carrier availability and stock Android are key to Motorola's future in the smartphone realm. There are a few worthwhile points to take away from the FCC certification of the XT1056, which suggest that this will be a very capable handset.


First and foremost, we're looking at a device that'll offer NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 LE+EDR and 802.11ac. In addition to support for Sprint's network, the phone also carries certification for HSPA+ 21 Mbps over the 2100, 1900 and 850MHz bands, although the documentation specifically states that it'll be SIM-locked for all US carriers. All in all, these are good signs of what's to come. Now, if only Motorola could get on with the reveal.
