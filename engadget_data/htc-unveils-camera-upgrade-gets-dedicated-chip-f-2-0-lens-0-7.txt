  We've not even seen the devices yet, but HTC CEO Peter Chou is very excited about the camera sensor inside his mysterious new phones. The module packs a f/2.0 camera lens, while the company's been busy crafting its own image sensor put behind it, called the HTC, er, "ImageChip." It'll help to clarify low-lit pictures and ensure a capture speed of under a second -- 0.7 seconds from starting up the camera app, in fact. It also has the tantalizing ability to shoot pictures while recording continuous-focus 1080p video. Add in a new LED flash that has five different levels of brightness control and as you might be able to guess, we really want to see these phones -- now.
