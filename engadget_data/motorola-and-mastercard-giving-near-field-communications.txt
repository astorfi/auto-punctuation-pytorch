In an upcoming field trial, Motorola will be testing Near Field
Communications (NFC) technologies with MasterCard, allowing users to make payments quickly and securely by simply using
their cellphones and MasterCard PayPass technology, turning cellphones into virtual wallets. While Motorola is
promising deep security measures, it seems to us that this will make getting one's cellphone an even more painful
process. The convenience factor could be huge, though: potential uses, aside from purchases, include concert
tickets, ID checks, and even a contactless reader. What's a contactless reader?  Well, it means that you
could get McSpammed by simply walking by a McDonalds, we we can only hope Motorola's spending as much testing that
security as they probably are finding new advertising channels.
