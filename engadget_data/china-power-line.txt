The record-breaking cable stretches from the power rich Hami Prefecture in Xinjiang to the industrial Zhengzhou in its east -- part of an area that's been suffering from power shortages since March 2011, according to China Daily. Costing a twitch-inducing $3.7 billion, when it's completed in 2014, it'll be the most capacious link in the world. Rather than rest on that particular laurel, the company is commencing work on a second, slightly smaller line that'll be used to transmit wind and solar power from Hami to the rest of the country -- here we were thinking that skipping our lie-in was an impressive feat.
