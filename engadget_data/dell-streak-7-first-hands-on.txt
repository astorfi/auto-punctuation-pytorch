That's not necessarily a bad thing considering that the Streak was a little too big to be a great phone and a little too small to be a great tablet; the glossy, curved design elements have never been the problem, and they look just as good here. The screen seems a bit washed-out -- it might not be the highest-quality thing in the world -- nor did it seem unusually speedy, though we're hoping Tegra 2 ends up kicking butt once the software's optimized.

Update: Check out two hands-on videos. After the break, of course.
