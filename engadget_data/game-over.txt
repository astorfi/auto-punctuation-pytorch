Let this be a lesson to us all to get outside everyonce in awhile:



A computer-game addict in western China collapsed and died at his screen after playing the popular online game,
 Saga, non-stop for 20 hours. The 31-year-old began playing the game regularly at an internet cafe in Chengdu, Sichuan
 province, three months before his death, according to the South China Morning Post. An employee at the cafe said he
 would play for more than 10 hours a day and was found dead at the weekend after a marathon 20-hour session.



We hope that he was at least winning when he expired.
