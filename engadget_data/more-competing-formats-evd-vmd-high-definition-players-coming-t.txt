 Who needs blue lasers? Not New Medium Enterprises or Beijing e-world, as theyhave announced they will be showing off a combo EVD/VMD player at next year's CeBit in germany. Amazingly, whileBlu-ray and HD-DVD continue to fight in the streets over who has the birthright to the high definition throne, a littlecollaboration could be a big boost to two other formats.EVD(Enhanced versatile disc) is a Chinese backed format that has produced verylittle since being originally announced in 2003, but promised high definition DVD's with standard red lasertechnology.VMD (Versatile Multilayer disc) is a new formatpushed by NME, where they say they can increase the storage of a standard red-laser DVD, by adding additional layers,all the way up to 100GB storage (theoretically).Could all this Blu-ray/HD-DVD posturing be for naught? Ifthese companies can get any studio support and cheap but high quality (MPEG-2 apparently) high definition DVD's onstore shelves before the big guys get traction.......2006 will be an interestingyear.Â  Read on for the full press release.
