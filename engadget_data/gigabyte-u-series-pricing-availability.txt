Since not everybody wants to lug an eight pound gaming machine or settle for a lightweight but graphics-challenged notebook, Gigabyte unveiled its U-series at Computex: two notebooks and an ultrabook with discreet NVIDIA graphics and 4th-generation Intel CPUs. The models build on the company's last-gen 14-inch U2442 Ultrabook, which unlike most models in that category, carried GeForce GT640M graphics and a generous supply of ports while still maintaining a respectable 3.3 pound heft. Gigabyte's looking to continue in that vein with the new models, which will all arrive by early August. To see a breakdown on all the pricing and specs, head after the break. 



 

The power entry in the trio is the 15.6-inch U35F, with a 1,920 x 1,080 LED screen, Intel core i5-4200U / i7-4500U 4th-gen CPU, 8GB RAM (upgradeable to 16GB), NVIDIA GeForce GT750M 4GB graphics, support for two 512GB SSDs and two 1TB HDDs, a 21mm profile and five pound curb weight. You'll be paying between $1,100 and $1,700 depending on your choice of processor and drive configuration.

Next up is the Gigabyte U24F, which fits the Ultrabook form factor but doesn't get the name since it has a non-capacitive, 14-inch 1,600 x 900 display. It'll come with a Core i5-4200U processor, 8GB of RAM (16GB max) GeForce GT750M DDR3 2GB graphics, support for a 256GB mSATA SSD and a 1TB HDD. It tips the scales at 3.5 pounds, very respectable for a discreet-graphics equipped machine, and has a reasonably slim 18.5 mm profile. It's also the most reasonably priced, starting at $1,000 and going up from there depending on your storage needs.

Last is the one true Ultrabook in the series, the U24T, which is identically equipped to the U24F except for the Intel-mandated 14-inch multi-touch 1,366 x 768 LCD and an optional Core i7-4500U CPU. The touchscreen also pushes the weight and profile up to 3.75 pounds and 20.5mm, respectively, along with the price -- it'll run between $1,100 and $1,600, depending on options. Need more info?
