It's basically a system of bezel-free devices that can all wirelessly connect and share information, not at all unlike Microsoft's Mobile Device Collaboration patent application we took a gander at last year. The concept video below shows both a sort of tiny mobile PC joining forces with an eminently breakable looking cellphone to share information cross-screens. But, it goes further, with talk of the larger of the two acting as a sort of alarm clock that, when you swat at it in the morning, checks your body temperature to determine how well you slept before barraging you with e-mails and financial reports. Just what you need first-thing in the morning.
