The photo application has been updated to accommodate the Jelly Bean slate with version 1.1.7. While the software's primary function is viewing the post-filter photography, you'll be able to employ the front-facing shooter for self-portraits and the like. Also included in the update, the option of posting your tablet and smartphone creations to Flickr via the app's share menu. Hit the source link to snag the current version for your 7-inch slate.
