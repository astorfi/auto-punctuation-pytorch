By way of our trusted sources we now know the device is currently dubbed Zune -- though we don't know whether that name will stick -- and we've got ourselves a product logo (shown above). We also understand that Zune to Zune wireless song transfer -- a PlaysForSure feature currently highlighted in the MusicGremlin -- is said to be a prominent aspect of the device's development, and in addition to the white shade we saw yesterday, we can expect a complement of colors to be available at or near launch. Oh, and apparently the Zune will have a brushed metal back with an engraved logo, not unlike the you-know-what. More to come, folks.
