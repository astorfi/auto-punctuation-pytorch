You sorta always figured they were going to have to do this sooner or later, but TiVo says they're going to cut out
the middleman and start offering direct downloads of TV shows, movies, and music over the Internet. So what'll you be
able to download? The article is curiously thin on details, but our best guess is that it won't be anything you're
catching on cable right now.
