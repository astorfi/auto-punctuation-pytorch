While we've already got the means to control Apple's media-playing gem in nearly every manner imaginable, Zegna's iJacket rocks a stylish, red shell with a subtle control pad on the left sleeve. There's nothing atypical aside the usual volume, track, and play / pause controls, but this "luxury sport jacket" requires no special handling when all dirtied up and ready for the washing machine. The oh-so-versatile coat presumably plays nice with any 'Pod sporting a dock connector, and while the $750 pricetag might be asking a bit much, we must admit Apple's newly-released (PRODUCT) RED nano would fit the part quite well here.[Via BookOfJoe]
