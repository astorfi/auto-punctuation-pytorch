The resulting panel is perfect for those times when you need to get some work done on the computer but your toddler is clamoring to watch the latest download of CSI. Or mount the LCD in the car allowing you to navigate GPS maps while the family chills with a film... or freakin' puppies and plants, whatever just as long as they shut the hell up. No idea where or when these might be available, Sharp's apparently just being a little boastful about their accomplishment. Proud you should be Sharp, now come, we've got a cookie for ya.[Via Impress]
