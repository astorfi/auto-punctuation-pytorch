  Could it be that a trio of LTE-powered Superfriends are ready for a throwdown on the same exact day at your local Verizon outlet? According to a leaked internal doc courtesy of Droid-Life, signs point to November 10th as a probable launch date for what could be this year's top three holiday gadget gifts: the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, Motorola Droid RAZR and HTC Rezound (formerly known as the Vigor). We're a tad confused, however, because Motorola's hero device is referred to as the Droid HD -- which, as we've recently discovered, is certainly not the phone's real name. Also interesting to note is the introduction of a "SMS Sync for Tablets" feature on November 13th, which may refer to some type of cloud backup service or a bridge between your tablet and phone. Either way, color us intrigued. Let's cross our fingers that we'll have a few more details to lean on tonight.
