Wii U owners wanting more exercise are about to get their fix, as Nintendo is releasing its long-promised Wii Fit U and companion Fit Meter in the US tomorrow, November 1st. Balance Board owners can pick up the pedometer by itself for $20, and they can download the game trial from the eShop for free. Don't be too quick to buy the full $50 game and sensor combo -- anyone who picks up the Fit Meter by January 31st and syncs it with the Wii Fit U trial can keep using the fitness app indefinitely. Newcomers who'd like the Balance Board and Fit Meter in the same box will have to wait until they're united in a bundle shipping on December 13th for $90. If you're curious as to how the hardware and software work together -- or you're just feeling nostalgic for your Pokewalker -- Nintendo will show you the basics in a short video after the break.
