Maybe it's a generational thing (or maybe it speaks to the difference between the temperaments of Ms. Ono and Ms. Love) but while the former members of Nirvana are not amused by their treatment at the hands of videogame consoles 'round the world, it's nearly unanimous in the Beatles camp: Beatles Rock Band is awesome. If you're looking to indulge your Fab Four fixation -- and if money's no object -- you might want to head on over to eBay and peep the first of fifty Xbox 360s being auctioned off for by Harmonix. Bidding started off at $780, but as of Sunday afternoon it's over $17,000 -- with over four days left to go! Designed by Passion Pictures (the kids responsible for animating Gorillaz), proceeds go to Doctors without Borders. Please insert your own Courtney Love joke here.
