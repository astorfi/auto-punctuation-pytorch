The unit will feature HDMI 1.3a connections, support for Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD audio, 24p capability, the HQV Reon VX video processing chipset (which handles upscaling), and an Ethernet port to download firmware updates and utilize any internet-enabled content from flicks. Look for it to take holiday shoppers by storm sometime this fall, but do be mindful of the relatively steep $899 pricetag.[Thanks, Michael]
