Tragically, swallow a microSD card whole (or otherwise) is not one of them, which is kind of unfortunate considering that only 7.4GB of the integrated 8GB will be available to the user -- but it turns out that tethering, thankfully, is. Newly-published tech specs on Sprint's site reveal that you'll be able to use your little EV-DO Rev. A monster as a modem both over Bluetooth and USB cable -- something the Pre's arch nemesis cannot so far (at least, not in any official capacity). Whether this helps push AT&T and Apple over the edge remains to be seen, but in the meantime, we'll be pushing close to a megabit per second upstream, thank you very much.[Via PreCentral]
