In fact, they're touting their BD-P1000 Blu-Ray player here at the big show eventhough we don't have any Blu-Raymovies with us. We're not sure if the model number was meant to match the price, but the unit will listfor around $1,000. HDMI output is included at no extra charge as is backwards compatibility with most of today'sstandard DVD formats (DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD-R, DVD RW, and DVD R). The BD-1000 should bloom in the springtime here inthe US, so we're saving up the grand now; and looking for some of those Blu-Ray movie discs, natch.
