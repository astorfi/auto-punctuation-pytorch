[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]

Update: We've got our first queue pictures popping up and are adding them in after the break. Keep them coming, guys!

Update 2: We've heard direct from Best Buy that the iPad is today on sale in its Thurrock branch, and also in the brand new Hedge End outlet, which opened today in Southampton.
