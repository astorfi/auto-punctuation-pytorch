 
Right on cue, Eurosport HD has gone live. The high-definition sports network is currently airing in Poland on Cyfra+, Cyfrowy Polsat and N, Sweden on Com Hem and Denmark on YouSee. It's also slated to show up soon on a smattering of other European cable / satellite providers, though no specifics have been detailed just yet. Hit up the gallery to see a couple of comparison shots between the SD and HD variants -- looks good from here![Thanks, Arsenal and AreKK]
