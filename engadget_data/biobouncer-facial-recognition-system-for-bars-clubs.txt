 While we're aware of theoccasional incident "in da club" featuring a firearm-bearing-celebrity, we've been blissfully ignorant of thefact that clubbing these days has apparently gotten so dangerous that a market has sprung up for nightlife-specificbiometric security solutions. Well Wired is reporting that besides the fingerprint recognition system that a companycalled Food Service Solutions is pitching to alcohol retailers, an even more ambitious facial recognition system isabout to be deployed in U.S. bars and clubs by a 24-year-old entrepreneur named Jeff Dussich. Dussich's company, JADCommunications and Security, is promoting its BioBouncer package as a way for communities to identify habitualtroublemakers by using a Vegas-like database of blacklisted individuals that is shared among local establishments.BioBouncer costs $7,500 for the initial hardware, software, and setup, and $6000 per year for support, which presumablymeans access to the networked "rogue's gallery." Not surprisingly, privacy groups such as the EFF are opposedto BioBouncer and similar systems,citing both their questionable accuracy and potential for misuse.
