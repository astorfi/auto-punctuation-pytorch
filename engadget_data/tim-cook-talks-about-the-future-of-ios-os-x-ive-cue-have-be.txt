During an interview tonight at the D11 conference, Apple CEO Tim Cook made a few references to what we can expect at his company's WWDC 2013 event in a few weeks. As expected, he mentioned we'll see the future of iOS and OS X revealed there, and directly referenced the recent management shakeup. Craig Federighi is running both teams, and Cook mentioned designer Jony Ive has been "really key" to this version of iOS. He left it up to interviewer Kara Swisher to decide if the changes made are as dramatic as have been reported, stating only that collaboration has been enhanced, with an "amped up" intersection of hardware, software and services.


Another name dropped is that of Eddy Cue, who is busy heading up work on services since Scott Forstall's departure. We'll have to wait until WWDC to find out the fruits of the various executives' labor but Cook did leave us with this to chew on: "The whole concept was to tighten the groups even more, so we could spend more time finding magic in intersections. Seven months later, give or take, I think it has been an incredibly great change."
