As a refresher, the V6 MAXX takes the reigns as king of the RAZR hill, rocking some mighty speedy HSDPA, a 2 megapixel external and VGA internal cam, 50MB of user memory, QVGA main display and touch-sensitive external controls. The launch of the MAXX down under dovetails nicely with Telstra's recent launch of their nationwide "Next G" HSDPA network; best of all, it sounds like you should be able to march into your local shop before too long and pick 'er up. We're beet red with jealousy, but if anyone has the chance to check it out, drop us a line in comments and let us know the verdict![Thanks, Jewburg]
