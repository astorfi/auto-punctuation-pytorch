Thanks to a prematurely posted trailer, we now know that Capcom's Street Fighter V is heading to PlayStation 4 and PC exclusively. The video (which has been pulled) is more of the teaser sort, so it doesn't delve into whether is this is a timed exclusive or a permanent one, and it fails to mention a projected release date. Bummer. The current effort, Ultra Street Fighter IV, continued the tournament with a handful of new characters when it debuted back in August for Xbox 360, PS3 and PC, so this is certainly something for fans of the franchise to look forward to. While details are scarce at the moment, we'll likely hear more about Street Fighter V during this weekend's PlayStation Experience in Las Vegas.
