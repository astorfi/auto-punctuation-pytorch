In a move that's sure to bring up many a fond memory of the
Microsoft antitrust battles from a few years back, AMD is suing Intel under the premise that the chip giant uses
coercive tactics to stop customers from buying AMD processors. Uh, AMD's just now getting clued into this? According to
the complaint, most of the major PC players — including Dell, Compaq and Sony — have been victims of Intel's coercion
(we assume they didn't twist Steve Jobs' arm, though).
Some of the specific charges include claims that after Sony was paid off, AMD's share of Sony's processor business
dropped from 23% in 2002 to zero today. How this will play out is anybody's guess; Microsoft, we recall, got a slap on
the wrist from the U.S. Department of Justice. But a judge sympathetic to AMD's case could theoretically hit Intel
hard.
