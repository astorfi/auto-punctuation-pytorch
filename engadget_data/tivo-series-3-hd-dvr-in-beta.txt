The good news is that it's apparently undergoing aprivate beta, at least according to a non-denial from TiVo Director of Service Operations E. Stephen Mack. The badnews? There's still no news on a ship date. Mack's answer when asked by Thomas Hawk: a cryptic "when it'sready." We hope it's ready soon; if not, fans may begin jumping ship to other HD options, no matter how goodTiVo's offering sounds. [Via HD Beat]
