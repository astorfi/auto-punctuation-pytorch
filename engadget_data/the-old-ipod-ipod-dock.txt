 Remember how yesterday when we posted about the iPod nano dock fashioned from its own hollow husk, and we said what we really wanted to see was an iPod dock made from an old iPod? You can imagine our surprise when reader Andrew Monks did just that, and emailed in to give us photographic evidence of him tearing open his existing iPod dock, jamming it through the top end of his 3G iPod (which we really hope wasn't still functional), pushing it through a slot he fashioned in the glass of his defunct screen, and properly securing it to make an iPod dock out of his old freaking iPod. We're still a little dumbfounded, but we think this could be the start of a very wonderful, very cannibalistic trend in consumer electronics.
