Late last night / very early this morning, Sony's PlayStation team finally unveiled a release date for the PlayStation 4 in Japan: February 22, 2014. That's just short of 100 days after the company's new game console launches in the US, and nearly as far away from the console's arrival on European shores -- a far cry from the PlayStation 3's launch strategy, which put the console in Japanese gamers' hands first.


Instead, Sony's got another idea for Japanese gamers this holiday in the PlayStation Vita TV. The $100 set-top Vita hooks up to televisions and functions as a Vita does, albeit with a DualShock 3 paired for control. It'll even act as a Remote Play device for the PlayStation 4 when that console eventually launches in Japan. Unlike some Japan-only PlayStation hardware from Sony's past (PS3's Torne DVR device, for instance), Vita TV seems bound for an international release.


In Sony's official PR, the company says, "PS Vita TV will be available first in Japan prior to any other regions, on November 14, 2013." Prior to any other regions, eh? PlayStation's US counterparts are keeping coy. We asked if the console was being considered for release in North America and were told, "We are considering every opportunity, but have nothing to announce at this time," by an SCEA rep.






Of course, it seems a no-brainer that PS Vita TV will launch in North America and Europe (and elsewhere, for that matter). It's exactly the game console concept that's been rumored for years from the likes of Apple, Google and Amazon: inexpensive, small, media-capable and ready to run media-streaming apps. There's also the convenience of it employing DualShock controllers, a standard known to hardcore and mainstream gamers alike. Sure, it's got some Japan-centric quirks at the moment -- Remote Play won't likely see wide use outside of Japan, nor will the Nasne connectivity -- but it's otherwise ready for international consumption.
