Veteran Uber members will remember last year's Uber Ice Cream: for one day only, they could use the company's mobile app to hail an ice cream truck and beat the heat. The program is thankfully coming back on July 19th, and this time on a much larger scale. Customers in 18 US cities and 16 international cities can order group-sized batches of ice cream that should arrive within minutes; the most common US pricing offers five desserts for $25. You'll need to both sign up and download Uber's Android or iOS apps if you want to take part, but those small hassles could lead to some big relief from the summer swelter.
