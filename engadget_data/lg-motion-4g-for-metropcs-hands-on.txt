The recent unveiling of that LTE-loaded Galaxy S Lightray doesn't appear to have slowed down MetroPCS, as the Texas-born carrier's quickly following up with yet another 4G handset to bring to its growing smartphone portfolio. Enter the economical 3.5-incher LG Motion 4G. Unlike the aforementioned offering from Samsung, however, the wallet-friendly network's now betting high on selling this new handset on the cheap and, naturally, is flaunting the "4G LTE For All" unlimited access as one of the device's biggest traits. But how exactly does it stack up in the real world? Well, the good news is we were amongst a select group of folks gathered at Manhattan's Andaz, and were lucky enough to take it for a quick spin. So head on past the break to get a better feel for our first, early-on impressions of MetroPCS' newest Android slab.
