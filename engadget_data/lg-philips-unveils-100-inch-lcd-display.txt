 
The battlebetween LCD and plasma for domination of your media room may have just ended. LG.Philips has unveiled what they'rebilling as the world's largest LCD display, a 100-inch panel with a 5ms refresh, 3000:1 contrast ratio and 180 degreeviewing angle. The new display bests the previous size leader, Samsung's 82-incher, and is just three inches smallerthan the largest plasma display, Panasonic's 103-inch prototype. While none of these megascreens are going to show upin stores any time soon, they're going to continue to put the squeeze on plasma displays, which are already hurtingfrom a price perspective, as LCD prices continue to decline.
