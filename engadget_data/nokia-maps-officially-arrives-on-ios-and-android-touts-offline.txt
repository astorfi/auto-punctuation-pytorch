Nokia Maps is still getting development love, despite the Finnish manufacturer pinning its smartphone hopes and dreams on Windows Phone. The HTML5-powered maps are now willing to play ball with iOS and Android devices. Previously one of Nokia's strongest built-in functions on its own phones, the maps perform well on rival hardware -- although pinch-to-zoom isn't working on our Google devices. With Microsoft's Windows Phones touting some impressive HTML5 credentials, it wouldn't shock us to see something very similar running on Nokia's incoming WinPho. There's a smattering of online settings, including transport directions, but the best part is a new offline mode that will download neighborhood maps from your WiFi connection.
