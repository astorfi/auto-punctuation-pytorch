 Details are admittedly scant at the moment, but it appears that Panasonic and T-Mobile are collaborating on some front to develop the first ever wireless Lumix digital camera. If you couldn't guess, the cam will feature integrated access to T-Mobile HotSpot and will give owners the ability to beam images directly to Picasa Web Albums. The elusive Lumix -- which still sports no model number -- will apparently come bundled with a full year of complimentary HotSpot access, but we're told absolutely nothing else specs wise. On that note, we're not even given a clue as to when said camera will launch nor how much it'll run, but at least we've got something to keep an eye out for, right?
