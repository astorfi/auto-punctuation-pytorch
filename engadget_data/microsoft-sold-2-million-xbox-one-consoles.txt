After crossing the one million mark in 24 hours, it took 18 days for Microsoft to sell another million of its shiny new console. The folks in Redmond have announced that the Xbox One has officially eclipsed sales of two million with an average of over 111,000 units being sold per day since its November 22nd launch. Just over a week ago, Sony posted news of a 2.1 million unit sales tally for the PS4 in November while Microsoft informed us of some zombie-killing stats. Even still, both consoles are pretty hard to come by this holiday season.
