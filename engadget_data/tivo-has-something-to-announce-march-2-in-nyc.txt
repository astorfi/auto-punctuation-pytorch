From the locked down nature of the company's CES presence there's definitely something in the works, but save for some leaked TiVo Premiere manuals and a curious shortage at its own store our imaginations are left wide open to assume how far we can go. While our DVRs will only reveal the final answers at the end of May, TiVo will only have us on the hook until March 2 at 6 p.m., consider our calendars marked.
