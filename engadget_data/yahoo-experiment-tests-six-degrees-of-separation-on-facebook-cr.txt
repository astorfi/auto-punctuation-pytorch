If the age-old theory holds water, we should all be no more than six degrees away from cuttin' Footloose with Hollywood's bygone golden boy -- or anyone else for that matter. Well, Yahoo's determined to put any six-degree doubts to rest with its Small World Experiment, and what better way to do so than on Facebook? Participating users are given a "target person," and asked to "get a message to this person in as few steps as possible." They are then prompted to select a single friend to pass the message on to, who will then be prompted to do the same, and so on. The idea is that if each subsequent recipient of the message continues to send it along, it will eventually reach its desired destination. No word yet on whether or not Mr. Bacon has given his blessing, but you can still sign up at the source link to get in on the action.
