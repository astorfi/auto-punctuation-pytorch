Well, it's got a stylish bigbrother now, in the form of the aXbo, a sleek alarm clock that communicates wirelessly with a wristband that doesbasically the same thing as the Sleeptracker: it keeps track of your movements throughout the night, gauging how deeplyyou're sleeping by how much you're thrashing. You set a window during which it can wake you, and it waits for the rightmoment within that space. Of course, the aXbo won't help you sleep better, but it could help you wake up feeling alittle more refreshed -- if you don't mind shelling out â‚¬200 ($241) for the privilege.[Via I4U]
