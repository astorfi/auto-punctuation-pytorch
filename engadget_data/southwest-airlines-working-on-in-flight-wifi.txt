Rather predictably for an airline, this is mentioned on a slide discussing future revenue opportunities -- hey, dems airlines gotta get paid! -- but at least they're thinking about it, right? As such, we can probably expect the in-flight rates for said "wireless internet connectivity" to be equivalent to the altitude of the plane. We'll know more as soon as SouthWest starts getting specific on the deets: when they do, we know which airline we'll be booking the next time we have to fly internal.
