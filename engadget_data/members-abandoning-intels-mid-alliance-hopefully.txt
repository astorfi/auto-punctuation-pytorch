 
Bad, but entirely expected news on the MID front. You remember the Mobile Internet Device right? UMPCs by another name usually running Linux-variants in that middling ground between smartphones and netbooks that nobody seems capable of making an attractive use-case for beyond the living room sofa? According to DigiTimes, "several members" of Intel's Mobile Internet Devices Innovation Alliance (MIDIA) have quit development of MID devices due to very weak shipments. Even the promise of Intel's Moorestown platform has lured "only a limited number of vendors" to launch related products in 2010. Sources claim that vendors will instead refocus on other areas of possible growth. Imagine that.
