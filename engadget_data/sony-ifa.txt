We're here in Berlin, and we're ready to kick things off right. Sony's leading tomorrow's press conference charge with an event starting at 10AM ET tomorrow, and this being a Sony event, we're expecting big things -- and lots of them. For starters, there's the Homani handset we've been hearing about and a number of cameras, like the Alpha A4000 and NEX-5T. And then there are the Vaios and even a few gadgets you can wear on your person. So join us right here for all the action.
