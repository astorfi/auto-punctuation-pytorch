 Looks like Creative isn't the only Asian component manufacturer trying to get away selling the analog hole: Asus is set to horn in on the X-Fi's territory by pimping its new Xonar D2X and D2 sound boards, which feature a secondary audio processor for Analogue Loopback Transformation -- basically it takes your high quality DRM audio output and redirects that to DRM tracks. Oh, did we mention the 118dB / 115dB playback and recording SNR, and Dolby Digital, Dolby Live, DTS Connect, and DTS 5.1 support? Yeah, we're kind of excited, too.
