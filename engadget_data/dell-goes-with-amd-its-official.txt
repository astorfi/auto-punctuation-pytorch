Guess there's not much more to say than that, except that the prices will probably be lower than Intel-equipped Dell boxes, power consumption will go down a bit for the AMD users used to the higher wattage, and clock-for-clock they may actually have faster boxes for doing their Excel sheets. More news specifically regarding the models as we get it -- and don't you be surprised if some Turion powered laptops are right around the corner, y'hear?
