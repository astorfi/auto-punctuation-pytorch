Mitsubishi has announced that it's developed theworld's first rear-projection TV powered by a laser instead of the mercury lamps typically used in other projector TVs.According to the company, the laser projector offers higher picture quality and a greater color range than plasma or LCDsets. No word on when these will be out or how much you'll have to shell out to get one.
