 It's been a long time coming, but it looks like Asus has finally settled down on pricing and release details for the US launch of its low-cost Eee PC. According to NotebookReview, a sales kit sent out to retailers by Asus confirms the $300 to $400 prices we heard about recently, with a $350 model squeezed in there as well. The same sales kit also reveals that the top-end $400 model, dubbed the Eee PC 4G, will be the first one available, with it set to drop on November 1st. While there's no firm details on the other two models, they'll apparently both also be available sometime before the end of the year. Conspicuously absent, however, is the much-touted $199 model, which we're guessing will be released around the same time as the $100 OLPC.[Via Electronista]
