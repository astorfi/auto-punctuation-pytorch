These cables are equipped with an in-line video processor that claims to "restore details", provide "greater image depth," and "increase contrast." Thankfully, the unit provides an on and off button, along with a convenient split screen option, that made reviewing these 'cables' a snap. Click on for screenshots (big pics so slow load times for dial-up) that will let you come to your own conclusion on whether these are something you need to add to your high-def gear.
      

 

We do apologize up front that these pics are by way of a digital camera but there currently isn't any effective way to get screen captures via HDMI. Something about copy protection crap but these pictures do give you a good indication that the cables do provide a different picture. We are having a hard time calling it a better picture cause the video processor does produce a lot of noise, especially on standard definition programming. Some of the time though, the colors are deeper and more rich but for the most part we have found these cables to mess up the over all image by increasing the contrast to an unbearable level. Maybe this is what the engineers where shooting for but it sure doesn't improve our calibrated HDTV. We do have to say that once in a while, when the on-screen conditions are right, the blue's are more blue, the reds are deeper and the greens are vibrant, but it isn't at all consistent. We honestly have to say that these $249 cables are not for those looking to get the most accurate picture. The do produce a brighter, more vivid experience but by no means is it a technical better image. Take a look at the images below though and maybe the 'enhanced' picture is just what you are looking for.Normal on the left and enhanced on the rightNormal on the left and enhanced on the rightEnhancedNormalNormal on the left and enhanced on the rightNormal on the left and enhanced on the rightEnhancedNormalBoxedUnboxed
