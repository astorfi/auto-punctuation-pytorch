Well, Apple hears you too, and it just busted out an 8GB (PRODUCT) RED Special Edition iPod nano to appease your storage lust. The new version costs $249, just like its black 8GB counterpart, and Apple will be donating the same $10 of each sale to the Global Fund that it's currently forking over for 4GB versions. Not too bad for a bit of iPod hawterness you were planning on nabbing anyways, right?[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
