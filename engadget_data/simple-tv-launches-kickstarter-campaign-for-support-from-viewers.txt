Simple.TV is ready to bring its mobile TV / DVR device to market, but it needs the help of some enthusiastic supporters with a little pocket money to spare. The company's been working to make the device a reality and is "close enough that we need to start ordering parts and getting the production pipeline turned on," which, naturally, in where people like you come in. To help achieve its $125k goal, Simple.TV is offering up a unit for a $125 pledge (down from its "already super low price of $149"). Higher pledges will get you fun things like a Roku XD. More info can be had in the video after the break.
