 
Of Sony Ericsson's three handsets launches today, the Walkman-branded W760 holds the most promise of landing over here thanks to its healthy dose of HSDPA in all the flavors we love. This slider is definitely well put together and felt rather hefty -- in an altogether pleasant way -- while we played with it during our brief visit this afternoon, though we could definitely find some room for improvement for the keys on the front. Nothing mind blowing, but we like the addition of GPS, the slider keypad is top notch, and being able to control the preloaded racing game by just rocking the phone, well, rawked. We're hoping we'll have some provider news in the near future, but until then, enjoy the gallery.
