 Hey you over there inthe UK! The BBC has confirmed that they are starting trial HD broadcastsin June. They're going to run the signal for a 12 month period on three different broadcast mediums. The first isthrough SkyHD and the second via Telewest cable. The last part is for afew hundred over-the-air users in London.Â  This is a closed trial for a select few. So viewers can expect to watchRome and Bleak House in HD real soon. BBC just might have coverage of the World Cup as what would an EuropeanHD announcement be with out the World Cup sneaking in heresomeplace!
