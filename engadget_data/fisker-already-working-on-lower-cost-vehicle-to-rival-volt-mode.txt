'Course, it should probably look to get its Karma onto US streets before it starts looking too far ahead, but you won't find us kvetching about the promise of a lower cost plug-in hybrid. Company spokesman Russell Datz insinuated that the outfit was jonesing to release a model that would be priced somewhere below its Karma ($87,900) and above the Volt (around $40,000) and Model S (somewhere in the $50,000s), though it wasn't close enough to production to hit the show floor of any expos in 2009. Oh, what a tease.[Via AutoblogGreen]
