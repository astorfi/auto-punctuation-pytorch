In his message he shared a photo he took while cruising through Montana thanks to a mode it's testing that snaps a picture every 10 seconds, no intervention needed. Unfortunately, if you're not in that exclusive pre-ordering group you'll have to wait for details like these to leak out secondhand since private updates, special events, Google+ Hangouts, secret handshakes and Little Orphan Annie decoder rings (perhaps not the last two) are reserved for a "unique, trusted community." Hey, it's not like the rest of us wanted some silly visor or etched glass blocks anyway.
