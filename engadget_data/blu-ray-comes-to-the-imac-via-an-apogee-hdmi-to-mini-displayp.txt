That's about to change thanks to Apogee, which just posted up a video demo of an as-yet-unnamed HDMI-to-DisplayPort adapter being used to play Xbox 360, PS3, and -- yes, it's true -- Blu-ray movies on Apple's latest all-in-one. Never thought you'd see the day, did you? Apogee hasn't disclosed pricing or availability yet, but we're told more info is coming soon --we'd guess sometime around CES. Video after the break.
