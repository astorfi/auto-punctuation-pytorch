More or less run of the mill SXGA (1280 x 1024) heads, but the four Diamondcrysta17-inch (RDT1713S, RDT1713V) and 19-inchers (RDT197S, RDT197V) do have an impressive pixel response as fast as 2ms, 300and 400cd/m2 brightness (depending on the model), 1000:1 contrast ratio, and DVI. No stated price or intention toexport, but when it comes to monitors like these, you've already got plenty of options on the market.[ViaImpress]
