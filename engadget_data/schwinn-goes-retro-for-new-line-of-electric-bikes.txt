Schwinn's new line of electric bikes, based on the "Plug'n Drive" system, are looking rather slick with their retro digs, but the tucked-away internals are the real story for out-of-shape or long-distance pedal pushers who don't want to give anything away. The bikes feature a roughly 40-mile range lithium polymer battery, tucked under the cargo rack, and weigh 40-45 pounds total, with about 10 pounds of that being the power components. You can get a full charge in about 4 hours, and the in-hub motor is about as inconspicuous as you can get. No word on price, or when exactly this 2007 lineup is going to hit the market, but we're definite fans so far.[Via Treehugger]
