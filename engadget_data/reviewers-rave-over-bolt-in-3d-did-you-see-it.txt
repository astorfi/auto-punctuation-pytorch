The film is far from being the first to see a widespread 3D release, but it is one of the first to be marketed as such. Unlike any time that we can remember before, Walt Disney pushed the third-dimension version of this flick hard, and we're interested to see if you felt it was worth sitting through with 3D glasses (and in some cases, paying more for). Like it or not, 3D is here to stay (at least for awhile) -- can you see yourself catching another film in 3D after seeing Bolt?Read - BigPictureBigSoundRead - Eclipse MagazineRead - Financial TimesRead - Independent MallRead - The Detroit News
