 Although home theater PCs are great for watching and listening to your digital content from the comfort of your couch, most lack the graphics horsepower for playing your favorite games on your 60-inch plasma and eight speaker setup. Not so with Okoro's new OMS-GX300, which besides sporting a dual-core Athlon64 FX-60 processor from AMD, also packs in that tasty SLI goodness in the form of nVidia's GeForce 7950 GX2 card featuring a full gig of video RAM. As if that weren't enough to get you excited, the GX300 also comes with 1TB of storage standard -- upgradable to a whopping 3TB thanks to four open SATA bays -- three TV tuners (2 analog and one OTA digital), an HDA Digital X-Mystique 7.1 sound card, and just about every input and output that you could ask for -- except, curiously, HDMI. Best of all, this model features a 7-inch front panel touchscreen for displaying tons of infoswag, at a price that's at least four hundred bucks less than the $5,000-and-up screen-less Denali series from Niveus.
