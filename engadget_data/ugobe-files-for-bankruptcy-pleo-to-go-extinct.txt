Looks like Pleo couldn't dodge that meteor -- everyone's favorite lovable robot dinosaur company Ugobe has laid off all its employees and filed for bankruptcy. That confirms a month of speculation that things were on the brink -- Ugobe's website has been up and down for a while, and a major supplier filed suit a couple weeks ago for nonpayment. There's a chance that some other toymaker will swoop in and pick up the pieces during the liquidation, but we wouldn't hold our breath -- Pleo owners, feel free to commiserate in the comments.

Painful bonus: Link your pics of the Pleo going extinct on our comment form here and we'll make a gallery. C'mon. You know you want to do it.
