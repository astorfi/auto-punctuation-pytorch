We're not entirely sure what the ROBO-ONE GP 2005 contest was for (we're thinking most lifelike robot movement), but
it was held on the last day of IREX 2005, the winner apparently receiving about $9,000. We don't know who won, but one
of the ten finalists was this little kid and his Kondo that he outfitted to look likeâ€¦ Mazinger? And the kid even
looked like an anime character himself, and appeared to be wearing a
prototype HAL suit or something. Man, when we
were little we had to animate our crappy Japanese action figures our damn selves (up hill, both ways).
