The oStyle was designed and hand crafted by Andrew Goss, a jeweler, for drawing on large capacitive touchscreens like, oh say, the JooJoo. While the benefit of the ringed-shape stylus over an opaque finger, foam-tipped pen, or meat-injected tube might not be immediately obvious, the video embedded after the break is convincing enough. Sorry no price or availability yet, all we know is that a limited production run is planned.
