Reuters is citing an unnamed LG official who has categorically written off the possibility of his company producing an Android 2.2 tablet. The LG informer has said that his company wants "the most suitable version [of Android] for our tablet and that is not Froyo 2.2." This mirrors Motorola's strategy of holding out until at least the next iteration of Google's mobile OS before diving into the tablet pool. Still, it'll be disappointing to those who took LG's words at face value when it promised its tablet will be an iPad killer -- that may still happen, mind you, just not this year.
