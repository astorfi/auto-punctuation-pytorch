Over a year after the acquisition was first announced, Microsoft is officially replacing the Nokia Lumia brand. In a blog post today, the software giant revealed its upcoming smartphones will now be known as Microsoft Lumia. The new Microsoft branding will appear on future phones from the company, with a plain black version of the company's four-squared logo also set to make an appearance.



Tuula Rytilä, Microsoft's SVP of Marketing for Phones, says the company is looking to unveil its first own-brand Lumia phone "soon." Rytilä is also keen to note that the change in nomenclature will not affect the support of current Nokia devices. Although the Nokia name will no longer be used for smartphones, low-end phones -- the company calls out the Nokia 130 -- will still be sold under the banner. Nokia still has brand cachet in Europe and developing markets, and it's likely that Microsoft will continue to exploit that fact for years to come.
