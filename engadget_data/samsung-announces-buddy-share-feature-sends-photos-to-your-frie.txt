Good thing Samsung's rolled out a new buddy photo share feature on its new Galaxy S III to save us those precious post-photo seconds. It works using facial recognition tech to identify each of your subjects, then shoots the picture to them automatically via email or text message. Fantastic, now our mother won't be pestering us for weeks to get copies of all those family reunion photos next year.
