Droid Life reports that one such expectant customer was asking Dropbox, via its forums, where their storage was. The cloud-space provider informed them that not all carriers are offering the deal, with those two big hitters being among them. This is further confirmed elsewhere on its support pages (check the source). So, just as we thought operators were loosening their grip, it seems some old habits don't die so easily.
