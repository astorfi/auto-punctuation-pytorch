We've already got some pretty raging cases of Tetris eye, tennis elbow, Space Invaders index finger, and runner's
knee 'round the office, but iPod thumb? Not to be
confused with BlackBerry thumb or PlayStation thumb, your little white friend could very well be the cause of discrete
repetitive stress injury according to Carl Irwin of the British Chiropractic Association. He set the record straight
for the Scotsman on Apple MP3 player inflicted pains: "The action needed to move the wheel on an iPod is totally
unnatural and effectively separates the joint in the thumb every time you use it." His patients apparently have had
iPod-related RIS issues not only in their thumbs and fingers, but as far up as their elbows and necks. Well, it makes
sense really; we have been saying for years that the circular motion of the scroll wheel is at best mildly
uncomfortable. Ok, so who's spearheading the next round of Apple lawsuits. Any takers?
