According to the Wall Street Journal, it appears quite likely that Big Red won't be involved in Samsung's anticipated launch event this coming Monday. The publication cites people familiar with the plans, who also mentioned that we should still expect to see the Galaxy S II make its way to Sprint, T-Mobile and AT&T at the very least. Now here's some possible relief to the sting you may have just felt: BGR is now reporting that while this is all true, Verizon has a Samsung phone in the works that will have "nearly identical specs" to that of the GSII. We're still awaiting official confirmation from Verizon on the matter and will update when we receive word.

Update: We just heard from a Verizon spokesperson who confirmed the carrier will not be carrying the device, and offered the following quote: "We have a robust portfolio of devices that offer customers exciting options including the Droid Charge by Samsung which runs on Verizon Wireless' 4G LTE network."
