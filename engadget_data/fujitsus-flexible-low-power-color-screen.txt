Okay, so everyone and
their grandma seems to be prototyping some sort of
flexible display these days, and Fujitsu's rolling in with their offering, which features low power consumption and, in
fact, requires no power whatsoever to display the last image before power is cut (and if anyone can tell us why that's
supposed to be really useful, by all means). Yeah, don't get too excited, neither, 'cuz it still won't be
commercialized anytime soon.
