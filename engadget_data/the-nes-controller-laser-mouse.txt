Old school is new school, fool. It's time to take that retired NES controller of yours that you broke so mercilessly
smashing it on the carpet in frustration at never ever ever being able to beat Ikari Warriors, and recycle
that biz. Be good to the environment and turn that thing into a laser mouse, why don't you? And yes, the A button is
left click, and the B is your right, and your raging case of carpal tunnel is about to get a whole lot more fun.
