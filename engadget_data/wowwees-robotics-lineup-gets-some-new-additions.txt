On tap for the 2008 lineup are the Tribot, a three-wheeled robot which sports "distinct expressions" and "animated eyebrows," and can be controlled via a tilt sensor remote. Also on tap is the Femisapien, the female counterpart to the company's terrifically popular Robosapien line. Other inclusions are Wrex the Dog, a (you guessed it) dog robot with "desires and distinct moods" (happy, angry, and... er, crazy), as well as the Chatterbot, robo-figurines that connect to your PC via USB and can interact with email, IM, and web browsing apps (annoyingly, we suspect). WowWee is also introducing a new IR controller, the RoboRemote, which lets you program and assign individual buttons for elicit activities with your Robosapien, Robosapien V2, and Roboreptile, amongst others. Seem like a lot? That's just the Robotics gang -- stay tuned for another batch of bots from the company's other lines.
