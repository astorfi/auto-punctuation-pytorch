We've seen plenty of small portables, but the1.3-inch OLED screen coupled with the 4GB hard drive really packs a punch. Not that we did a hands on for 20 hours, butaccording to Cowon, we could have because that's how long the batts will last. It's clear that the iAudio6 won't feel asthin in the pocket as an iPod nano, but we actually liked the thicker feel to the unit. What can we say: we like alittle meat on our MP3 players? We wouldn't watch videos on the pretty screen for any length of time, but for the fewminutes that we did, the OLED really shined while the audio rocked the house.
