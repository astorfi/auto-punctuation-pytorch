 Set those DVRs now for Planet Earth, Sunday night on Discovery HD Theater. Seriously, go; we'll wait... We know that you probably won't want to miss Desperate Housewives live and whatever other random stuff comes on Sunday night, but you are not going to want to miss the three hours of Planet Earth. This is a five-week special that is going to attempt to teach you almost everything Terra Firma has to offer. Sunday's first hour is going to take viewers "Pole to Pole" showing almost everything in between. Now like we said, this might be one of those programs that you save for a rainy day, but your HDTV will appreciate the amazing eye candy.
