Chrome for Android just turned 28! Version 28, which today moved out of beta to the stable channel, includes a pair of notable additions, along with the typical variety of bug fixes and performance improvements. The first new feature is Google Translate integration. When you come across a website in a foreign language, the browser will offer to translate the text into your language. Additionally, tablet users are now able to take advantage of the fullscreen mode already available on smartphones. After updating to 28, you should be able to scroll down the page and see the toolbar disappear. Finally, there's a new interface option for right-to-left languages, which include Arabic, Farsi and Hebrew. Snag the update at the source link below.
