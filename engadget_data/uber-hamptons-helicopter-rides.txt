Too good for the Jitney? Uber has a special one-time offer that might be up your diamond-strewn alley. From 12PM to 8PM this Wednesday, Uber will be providing $3,000 helicopter rides to the Hamptons to promote its new summertime service in the exclusive Long Island enclave. If you're located in New York City, an SUV will whisk you to the most conveniently located helipad, where your flying chariot will await. Once you land, another SUV will be at the ready to complete your journey. If you miss out on the extremely limited-time offer, fear not. Uber's new service, also launching on Wednesday, will provide $300 one way trips between NYC and the Hamptons. And when you get there, don't forget to send Jay Gatsby our regards.
