       
Welcome to CES 2010, where we're currently enjoying the 'year of the slates.' Dell's just teased us by talking about its "upcoming slates," and from the looks of it, the one shown off is the Streak we've been hearing about for a few months now, though of course we can't be sure yet. Sure, there was perilously little detail given out -- all we know so far is that it's a 5-incher and it's running Android, and there appears to be a camera around back. This also is only the first of the slates, so hopefully we'll get to see more of Dell's offering soon. We'll keep you posted as we find out more detail, but check out some other angles of this mystery device after the break.
