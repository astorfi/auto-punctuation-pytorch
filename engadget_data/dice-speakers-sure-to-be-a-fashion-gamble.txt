With an output of one hot watt, the Dice speaker series is sure to turn your morning commute into a tiny, slightly louder micro-party in an instant -- or, at the very least, it'll cool up your look a few notches. They'd make a perfect gift for the gambling addict in your life, too, but sadly, they're going to be a Japan-only release when they come out sometime next month for Â¥ 2,814 (about $33). Check out another shot after the break.
