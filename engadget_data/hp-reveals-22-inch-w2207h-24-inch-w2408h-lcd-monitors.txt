First up is the 22-inch w2207h (pictured above), which rocks a 1,680 x 1,050 resolution BrightView panel, 1,000:1 contrast ratio, 300 nits of brightness, a five-millisecond response time, VESA mount support, HDMI (HDCP-compliant) / VGA inputs, a double-hinged base and My Display technology which enables "one-touch OSD adjustment for brightness, color and contrast." Next in line is the 24-inch w2408h (shown after the jump), which ups the ante with a 1,920 x 1,200 resolution, 400 cd/m2 brightness, an ambient light sensor, and an integrated four-port USB hub. Catch 'em both next month for $349 and $499, respectively.
