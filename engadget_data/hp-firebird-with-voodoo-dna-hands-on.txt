The side panels are actually a cool translucent smoke finish, and the blue LED lighting might be the first classy gaming PC light kit we've ever seen. HP was demoing the Firebird with Left 4 Dead and Crysis, and the gamers on hand seemed pretty pleased -- we'll have see how the $1,799 machine's 2.83GHz Core 2 Quad and dual NVIDIA GeForce 9800S graphics cards benchmark out when it's released on February 1st. Check it all in the gallery!
