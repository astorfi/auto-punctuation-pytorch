Pretty clever, and after spending a few minutes with the small PMP, we have reason to believe that Archos may just have better luck than ever before. The 3-inch touchscreen on the Vision A30VC is responsive and the interface easy to navigate, and though the 640Ã—480-resolution camera won't capture award-winning footage, you can tap to record video and snap some stills. Sure, the plastic body feels much cheaper than the iPod's anodized aluminum back, but at under $100 we're not complaining. Check out some hands-on pics of the gadget below, and look for the little guy to hit retailers in late summer.
