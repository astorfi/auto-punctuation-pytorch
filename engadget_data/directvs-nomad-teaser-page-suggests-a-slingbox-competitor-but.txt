The tiny pic isn't incredibly revealing, but other than "coming soon" the page also displays a laptop, phone and tablet -- likely targets for viewers to watch their TV broadcasts away from the satellite box. That MDR1R0-01 remains scarce, but hit the source link and keep your eye peeled on that URL for more information about DirecTV's competitor to the Slingbox / iPad apps being offered by other TV providers.
