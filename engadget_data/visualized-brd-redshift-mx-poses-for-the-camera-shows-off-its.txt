   Remember our testdrive of the RedShift SM through the hills near San Francisco? Well, if that didn't get you revved up for BRD's electric duo, perhaps these new studio shots of the MX can help. The folks in Northern California have passed on a few shots of the upcoming RedShift MX motocrosser that is expected to pull into garages later this year. If you recall, BRD says this electric motorcycle performs just as well as any race-ready four-stroke 250-cc gas-powered machine and splurging for one will set you back around $15,000 -- for a base model. Go on, hop in the gallery below and take a closer look.
