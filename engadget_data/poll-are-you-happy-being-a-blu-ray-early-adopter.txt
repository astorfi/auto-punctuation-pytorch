All things considered, are you happy with your decision to step up and support Blu? Do you now think upscaled DVD would've been enough? Do you wish you had jumped earlier? We reckon future success has a lot to do with how jovial existing supporters are, so we'll be interested to hear your opinions. Fire away!
