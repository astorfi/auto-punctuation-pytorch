The 4.8-inch NV-U93T (pictured) and NV-U83 in particular are getting the new Bluetooth functionality. The U93T bests its peer with a broad selection of Europe maps, and live traffic info, the latter of which is optional with the U83. You can control either device with "Gesture Command," which allows you to scribble symbols on the screen and be presented with directions home or to the nearest gas station. If you're not quite ready to take the Bluetooth plunge, Sony also has the 4.3-inch NV-U73T and NV-U53, which both do Gesture Command, and hold the same traffic info and Europe map differentiations of big brother 4.8-inchers. All four models will be out in Europe this November, ranging from 249 to 379 Euro ($340 to $517 US).
