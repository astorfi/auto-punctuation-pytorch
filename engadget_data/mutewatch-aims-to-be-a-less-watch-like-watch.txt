Described as a "silent alarm in the shape of a vibrating wristband," the watch features a hidden screen that activates on touch and lets you swipe to scroll between the timer, clock and alarm -- the latter of which simply vibrates rather than making a sound, and can be dismissed by pinching the watch. Best of all, this isn't simply a concept -- you can secure a pre-order for your choice of a white, gray or red watch now for €19, which will be deducted from the full €199 (or about $260) price when it eventually ships.
