Vuzix's M100 Smart Glasses may be Android-powered, but that doesn't mean you have to use its hands-free features with other Android devices. The company has rolled out an OS 2.0 update that lets you use the wearable with most iOS gear. So long as you have the companion app (due very shortly), you can take full advantage of the M100's augmented reality apps, hands-free calling and other features that keep your hands free. If you've been looking for a head-mounted computer that will play nicely with your iPhone (and isn't as pricey as Google Glass), your search might be over.
