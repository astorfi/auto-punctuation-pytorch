This budget box is heading to DOSPARA shops in Japan courtesy of Third Wave Corp targeting the low-end gaming market, uh, if there is such a thing. As such, you get the yawntastic specs of a 1.3MHz Celeron M 350 proc, 40GB 5400RPM UltraATA disk, and DVD multi-drive coupled with a WXGA (1280x728) resolution on a glossy screen, up to 2GB of DDR2 RAM, and built-in ATI RADEON Xpress 200M graphics. Hell, it might just pull-off duty as your low-end, 5.3-pound portable gaming machine after all. And that low (for Japan) pre-order price of Â¥87,580 or about $733 (sans OS) certainly helps the cause.[Via Impress]
