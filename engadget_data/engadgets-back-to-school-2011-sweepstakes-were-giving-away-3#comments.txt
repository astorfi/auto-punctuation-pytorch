 Back when many of us were gearing up to go back to school, the shopping list was filled with notebooks (the kind without a battery), pens (read: not a stylus), and a few dozen pencils (old-school #2s that required manual sharpening). Maybe, just maybe, we would have a new graphing calculator to look forward to, but if we ever saw 'smart' and 'phone' in the same sentence, it was probably in a handwritten note from mom begging us to stop making long-distance calls on the landline. Now, back to school means picking up extra shifts at work to pay for new computers, cameras, smartphones, e-readers, and tablets -- not to mention those still-sky-high prices publishers are commanding for textbooks at the college store. We want to relieve some of that burden -- for a few of you, at least. This year, we've partnered with top manufacturers in nearly every category to bring you one epic giveaway, complete with all of the products we mentioned above, plus a whole lot more! Lucky winners will receive an Engadget-branded messenger bag, overflowing with the latest tech gear. Jump past the break for the full rundown of prizes, along with instructions for entering our back to school giveaway.
      

 

Oh, and one more thing: We won't be giving away just one of these loaded messenger bags -- we have 15! All of the giveaways will be identical, so feel free to enter by leaving a comment at each of our back to school posts (not including the back to school hub), including yesterday's digital cameras guide (note: you'll only be allowed to win once and multiple comments on a single post will not increase your chances of winning). Laptop            HP Pavilion dm1-3020us  Sure, Apple's 11.6-inch MacBook Air is sleek, sexy and powerful, but it starts at $999, and, well, you'd probably rather spend that money on ramen. The HP Pavilion dm1 gets the job done for less than $500, offering great performance, over five hours of battery life, and a compact design to boot.  Key specs: 1.6GHz Dual-Core AMD processor, 11.6-inch, 1366 x 768 display, 3GB RAM, 3.5 lbs.  Price: $430     Digital Camera      Sony NEX-C3  You'd be hard-pressed to find an interchangeable lens camera that offers more bang for your buck than the Sony NEX-C3. With the same size sensor found in many full-size DSLRs, this compact sports excellent image quality, 720p video, and a slick tilt-enabled high-res display.  Key specs: 16 megapixel stills, 720p video, 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens, 3-inch articulating display.  Price: $650 on Amazon              Tablet           Samsung 7-inch Galaxy Tab  Samsung's Android 2.2 Froyo-powered 7-inch Galaxy Tab lets you stay connected when you don't want to haul around a laptop. This WiFi-only model won't be hopping on T-Mobile or Verizon, but you can use your university's wireless network to check exam scores, poke cute girls on Facebook, or fire off an email to your professor -- assuming you go to school anywhere but here.  Key specs: Seven-inch, 600 x 1024 display, front and rear cameras, 16GB storage, 1GHz processor.  Price: $350 on Amazon     Smartphone        Motorola Photon 4G (Sprint)  What sports a 1GHz dual-core NVIDIA Tegra 2 processor, HDMI connectivity, and a 540 x 960-pixel display? Well, it's not a tablet. Motorola's Photon 4G is the first Sprint smartphone to include both WiMAX and GSM connectivity, letting you make calls and surf the web while studying in the US, and during your semester abroad.  Key specs: 4.3-inch qHD display, 1GB RAM, 16GB built-in memory, Android 2.3 Gingerbread  Price: $200 on Amazon               Speaker dock              Altec Lansing Octiv 650  Your HP notebook can do a fine job of pumping out quality tunes when you consider its size, but it won't be filling your dorm room with crisp, distortion-free sound. For that, you'll need Altec Lansing's new Octiv 650, which also lets you output video from a connected iPhone or iPod touch, or connect any other musical device using the auxiliary input.  Key specs: iPhone and iPod touch connectivity, aux input, built-in subwoofer, video output.  Price: $200 on Amazon     Headphones      Bowers & Wilkins C5  Perhaps best known for its football-shaped Zeppelin series of speaker docks, Bowers & Wilkins' C5 in-ear headphones will come in handy when you need to listen to music as your roommate sleeps in the dorm room, or when you want to tune out in the lecture hall. These bullet-shaped 'buds also include an inline mic, letting you chat on your Photon without skipping a beat.  Key specs: Aluminum construction, built in mic and remote, noise-isolating design.  Price: $180             E-reader           All-New Nook by Barnes & Noble  We can't force all of your professors to ditch those $200 hardcover textbooks, but at least you'll save some money by purchasing the rest of your required reading materials in digital form on your All-New Nook by Barnes & Noble. You can also send book quotes and recommendations to Facebook and Twitter using the e-reader's built-in WiFi.  Key specs: Six-inch, 800 x 600 display, 16-level grayscale, 2GB storage, 800MHz processor.  Price: $139     Laptop bag      Timbuk2 Command Messenger  You can't have an overstuffed messenger bag without the bag itself, and Timbuk2's durable, airport-friendly Command Messenger fits the bill. Your bag will arrive custom-embroidered with the Engadget logo, and will have plenty of pockets to contain all of your new tech toys as you trek around campus.  Price: $130 on Amazon                   Accessories              Elgato HDHomeRun  We tried to squeeze an HDTV into the bag, but to no avail. This dual-network TV tuner is the next best thing, streaming HD content to your PC or Mac over WiFi.   $180 on Amazon         Kingston Wi-Drive This 16GB portable media streamer is a good solution for expanding storage on your iOS device, or sharing content with friends.   $130 on Amazon             Spotify Premium (1-Year)  Spotify's streaming music service has finally landed in the US. Use this subscription to stream music to your laptop, tablet, or a variety of other connected devices for a full year.   $120         Scosche: goBAT II You'll be good to go for hours of computing on your Galaxy Tab, but then what? If you can't get any sleep during an all-nighter, neither should your gadgets.   $80            iMainGo: X  It may look like a cassette, but it's definitely not. This Walkman-like portable speaker doubles as a case, and may just be the star of the show at your next power hour.   $70 on Amazon        G-Form 13-inch Extreme Sleeve  Want to protect your HP notebook? This should do the trick. Just... keep it away from six-foot bowling ball drops. Because we said so.   $80             Canon X Mark I Mouse Lite  Canon may be best known for its cameras, but the Japanese company also makes calculators, including this new hybrid mouse.   $60           Skype  Do you make calls to phones in the US and Canada? This 12-month Skype Premium subscription will let you do it for free, along with free group video calls and screen sharing for Mac.   $54          Sonic Bomb Alarm Clock Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.   $40 on ThinkGeek          Red Swingline Stapler  We can't help you get a job with Milton at Initech, but you can have his stapler, thanks to our friends at ThinkGeek.   $23 on ThinkGeek           Toddy Smart Cloth Is that a smudge we see on your laptop? And tablet? And e-reader? And smartphone? You get the idea, and you need three of these.   $20          Pogo Sketch   Want to sketch with precision on your tablet's touchscreen display? The Pogo Sketch can make it happen.   $15 on Amazon  Do we have your attention?
