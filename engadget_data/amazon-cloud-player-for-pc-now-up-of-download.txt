Amazon's Cloud Player may have been accessible on PCs through browsers since its launch, but today Bezos & Co. have given the service a desktop app of its own. Once installed, the free program will detect and add music from iTunes and Windows Media Player to its library, and continue doing so as new songs are purchased from other storefronts. Naturally, tunes bought from the firm can be streamed and downloaded through the application, and even exported to iTunes. While there's no sign of Linux support, the company says it's working on a version just for Mac users. If you count yourself in Microsoft's camp, hit the neighboring source link for the download.
