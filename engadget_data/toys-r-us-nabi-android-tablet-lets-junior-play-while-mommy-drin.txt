Designed to distract kids aged six years and up, this tot-sized Android slate boasts a seven-inch, 800 x 480 capacitive touchscreen display, 4GB of onboard storage, and a 533MHz dual-core Cortex-A9 CPU. These certainly aren't the most scintillating specs we've ever come across (even by kiddo tablet standards), but keep in mind that we're talking about six-year-olds, here. They don't know anything. Plus, they'll probably be distracted by the Nabi's customized UI, tailored for so-called "kiddified" browsing, reading and TV watching. If you ever get a hankering to get in on the action yourself, you can always send the beast to time out and play with the tablet yourself, thanks to a built-in "Mommy Mode" that provides a more mature Android experience. No word yet on whether Toys R Us plans to introduce a "Daddy Mode" (or, for that matter, a "Postman Mode"), but that's probably a conversation for another day. Hands-off parents can pre-order the Nabi for $200, at the source link below.
