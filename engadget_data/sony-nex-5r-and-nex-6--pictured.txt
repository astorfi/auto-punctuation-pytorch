Now VR-Zone seems to have come across certification photos of the two cameras, each modeling -- you guessed it -- its very own WiFi logo. As expected, this puts Sony's ILC range inline with the wireless smorgasbord it laid out at CES, eschewing less native, accessory-based solutions. VR-Zone wagers that the NEX-5R will sell for about $700, and pegs the NEX-6 somewhere around $1000.

 Update: Sony Alpha Rumors has thrown in some more images of the NEX-5R, this time of the press shot kind. We've embedded a handful after the break.
