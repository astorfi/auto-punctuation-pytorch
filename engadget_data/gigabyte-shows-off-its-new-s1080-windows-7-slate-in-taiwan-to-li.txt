The S1080 is the slate you never asked for, in that it runs Windows 7 on a dual core Atom N550 processor underneath a 10.1-inch capacitive touchscreen with 1024 x 600 resolution. If multitouch navigation isn't your thing (an odd preference for those buying tablets), there are a couple of tactile mouse buttons on one edge and an optical mouse on the opposite side for thumbs-only operation. The device has a massive (for a tablet) 320GB hard drive, SD card reader, ethernet port, and USB 3.0 connectivity to sate your computing needs. Also included is a 1.3 megapixel webcam, 802.11b/g/n WiFi, and Bluetooth 3.0. Lastly, in what can only be considered an odd design choice, our Taiwanese friends elected to give the S1080 a VGA port instead of an HDMI connection. Word on the street is that the device will be less than $300 $699 when it goes on sale next month, so if you are a member of the (presumably small) group of people who aren't interested in an Android, Apple, Blackberry, or HP slate, the S1080 may be the tablet for you.

Update: Thanks to the readers for pointing out the new price. It looks to have changed from the original translation, but you never know with these machine-mangled numbers.
