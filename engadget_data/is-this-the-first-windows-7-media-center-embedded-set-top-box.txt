The Reycom Entertainment Solution is marketed to content providers in Switzerland and Germany, is powered by an Atom processor and is small and slick. All the user interface images on the site should look familiar to Windows 7 Media Center fans, but the newly announced embedded version of Windows 7 isn't mentioned by name -- even the image on the about page has a women holding a Media Center remote. Of course this doesn't mean much for those of us State side, but this is exactly the type of box we had in mind when we first heard of an embedded version of Windows Media Center.
