 This may not have been a huge mobile show for most companies (what with MWC just over the horizon), but Huawei certainly has lots to talk about. The CEO of the company's consumer business group Richard Yu will be hitting the stage today and bringing along some goods to show off, too.

 Update: Unfortunately Yu had to pull out at the last minute, so instead we will be meeting Huawei Device CMO Shao Yang at the same time slot. Stay tuned!

 Update 2: False alarm! Richard Yu will be joining us, after all!
