Google today launched a standalone, unlimited photo and video service called Google Photos. Google Photos is a free -- and, again, unlimited -- storage, sharing and editing service, and it should be available today on Android, iOS and the web. However, do note that the unlimited storage only counts if you're okay with a little compression -- your photos will be downsized to 16-megapixels and your videos will have to be 1080p or worse. You can certainly upload original resolution photos and videos too, but they'll count against your Google Drive storage limits.


Update: The Photos app is out, and we've given it a test run, check out our impressions right here.







Google Photos also automatically backs up all of your content and it offers editing and sharing tools. We're not just talking about sharing to Google+ here: Send your images to a range of hubs, including Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and WhatsApp. Director of Google Photos Anil Sabharwal announced the service today at Google I/O and he offers more details on the Google blog: "With this launch we've made a lot of progress towards eliminating many of the frustrations involved in storing, editing and sharing your memories."
