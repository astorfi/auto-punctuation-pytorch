Are you a Cablevision subscriber with a Galaxy S III (T-Mobile, US Cellular or unlocked), Galaxy S IV or Galaxy Express (AT&T) handset? Awesome, because now you can watch live and on-demand TV from your phone via the company's Optimum app. More than that, Optimum can do double duty as a clicker for your screen as well as manage recording schedules and content. The cable provider also announced that its cloud-based Multi-Room DVR would triple the storage capacity for recorded video -- jumping to 300 hours of standard-def, 75 hours of high-def or some combination of the two. Maybe what's most exciting is that now you can record 10 shows or movies at once. This should give even the most avid time-shifted TV-watcher a ton of freedom and eliminate a potential Sophie's Choice between Law & Order: SVU, 2 Broke Girls and Antiques Roadshow. Yeah, our tastes are what you might call "diverse."
