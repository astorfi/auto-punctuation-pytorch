 Ah, exclusivity. Typically the domain of movie theaters and premium cable subscriptions, now everyone's giving it a go. Microsoft's Xbox 360 is also joining the fray and has launched Pulp, a British indie comedy. The movie has already been shortlisted at several respectable film festivals but creator Adam Hamdy, citing the high costs of marketing lesser-known films, said that a different approach was needed to get Pulp in front of audiences -- something that those 77 million Xbox 360 owners should be able to help with. Microsoft added that this won't be the only movie to debut on the Xbox Live's Video app, although it hasn't detailed how many more exclusives its salt-and-pepper console is likely to see.
