There have been so many 3D displays that work without special
glasses announced over the past several months (from Sharp, NEC, Toshiba, LG, etc) that it's almost as
if they're becoming - gasp! - commonplace. The latest to pop up is the Fraunhofer Institute's Free2C, which is
mainly meant to be used in kiosks at museums and tradeshows and has an optional hand-gesture recognition
device so you can press virtual buttons just by pointing at them.
