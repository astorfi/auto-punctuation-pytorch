Apple knows we want it, and we know they're working on it. Hell, at this point the only mystery is why they're bothering to keep it such a secret, but so long as they're withholding it from the general public, we're going to be invariably baited into running possibly-photoshopped images of what could be ads depicting the device everyone's been waiting for. According to this particular rendition it's going to be called iChat Mobile (clever, right?), and looks a little something like the Apple Remote, playback buttons front and center -- obviously intended for a proper cellphone-iTunes experience. Alright then, we've filed, now you decide. (Click on for a larger picture.)[Thanks, Harlan]
