The IFT00 and IFT01 each sport a 14.1-inch display, up to 4GB of DDR2 RAM, an option for an HD DVD player, gigabit Ethernet, an ExpressCard slot, four USB 2.0 ports, FireWire, WiFi, a biometric scanner, and a SATA hard drive to boot. The IFT00, however, ups the ante on its lesser-spec'd sibling by throwing in a 512MB NVIDIA GeForce Go 8600, while the IFT01sports Intel's integrated GMA X3100 graphics set. The IFL00 and IFL01 maintain most of the same specifications, but offer up a 15.4-inch WXGA+ or WXGA display and the option for a nine-cell battery. All four units should drop in Europe sometime soon, with pricing details to disclosed at a later time.[Via PCLaunches]
