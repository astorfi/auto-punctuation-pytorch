A 5-inch LCD puts the Android 4.0 smartphone fully in phablet territory, but the inside is reasonable enough that those in the company's native India won't break the bank: an 854 x 480 resolution, 5-megapixel rear and VGA front cameras, a dual-core 1GHz processor, 4GB of built-in space and a microSD slot keep the dual-SIM phone down to Earth. Micromax also has us covered if we want a slightly more hand-portable size. The Superfone Pixel A90 touts a 4.3-inch, 800 x 480 Super AMOLED screen and brings in the added punch of an 8-megapixel rear camera on top of the A100's baseline hardware. Either comes with the designer's Siri-alike, AISHA, and should already be on Indian shelves with a slight twist in pricing -- the bigger Canvas A100 is the more affordable of the two at a modest 9,999 rupees ($180) off-contract, while the A90's slightly more exotic technology carries a 12,990-rupee ($234) price.
