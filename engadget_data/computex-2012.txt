We expect to see our fair share of laptops and tablets on the show floor, with plenty of local wares sprinkled in for good measure. Several teasers have come to light over the past few days, with ASUS hinting at dual-OS (Android/Windows) devices, Intel set to demo a barrage of third-gen Ultrabooks and Viewsonic abandoning tradition with its 22-inch Ice Cream Sandwich "tablet," so it's definitely shaping up to be a busy week. As always, you can stay on top of all the Computex news as it happens right here!
