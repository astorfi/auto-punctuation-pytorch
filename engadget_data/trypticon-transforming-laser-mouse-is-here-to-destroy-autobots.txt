In disguise he looks like a particularly non-ergonomic way to control your computer, but in just a few seconds he transforms into... well, a pretty sad, skinny looking rendition of the Decepticon command base. He may have lost weight, but he certainly hasn't dropped any perceived value, available now on pre-order for a somewhat pricey $59.99. He also ships in September, and despite his cost we wouldn't be surprised if that "Add To Cart" button transforms into a "Sold Out" button right quick. When oh when will the Autobots show up to save us from these evil USB gadgets exploiting our childhood memories?Update: We got a comment from awa64 that there are a few other devices in disguise available for pre-order, including a few Autobots. Go get clicking if you want one, but we're holding out for an Optimus Prime uninterruptible power supply. [Via GadgetReview]
