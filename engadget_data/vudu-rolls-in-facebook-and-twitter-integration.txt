The update this week will be of particular interest with those who love to flood their social feeds with their every movement, as now VUDU will update your Facebook or Twitter status with the your impressions of the movie you're watching. In addition your friends with VUDU will also be able to see those particular updates, but also join in on the fun by watching the same movie. A pretty neat way to promote and discover content, but we're not sure we'd want to follow anyone with such mundane updates and wonder if baking the social features in makes more sense, you know, the way Boxee does it.
