Galaxy S Blaze Q, a QWERTY slider for T-Mobile that's been leaked before. Beyond the terrible name, the August 15th mention on the screen appears to confirm the previous launch date rumors. Spec-wise, the phone is expected to pack a 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 with 1GB of RAM and 16GB of built-in storage. There's also mention of 1080p video capture and a 720p display -- the latter being unlikely in light of the large amount of bezel surrounding the screen (Samsung's smallest HD Super AMOLED display is 4.65-inches across). Our guess is that T-Mobile's just complementing Samsung's existing Galaxy S Blaze 4G with a mid-range QWERTY slider, but we'll find out soon enough.
