It's your kids, Marty! Something has got to be done about your kids! They get to October 21st, 2015, and they don't have any flying cars, hoverboards and, even worse, Jaws 19 still hasn't started production! That's why ZBoard has decided to take our destiny into its own hands to create a limited-edition Back To The Future Part II-inspired version of its electric, weight-sensing skateboard. The ZBoard Hoverboard comes in a delightful shade of Mattel-inspired pink and will travel 20 miles on land, as long as you've got enough jiggawatts. A limited run of 25 boards is being produced, with the profits going to the Michael J. Fox foundation for Parkinson's Research, with each one setting you back $1,500 on Indiegogo -- while 50 more can just pick up the custom deck for a regular ZBoard for $200. There's a video or two after the break, but be warned -- some people may drop the odd expletive when they get their hands on a hoverboard.
