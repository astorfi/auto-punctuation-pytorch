Power and Associates' "Highest in Customer Satisfaction with HDTVs" ranking*, announced today a new, sleek and slim line-up of large-size HDTVs. Highlighted by the E-Series 60" Class Razor LED™ Smart TV (E601i), which is priced at $999.99 and available now, the large collection also includes a stunning E-Series 70" Class unit and M-Series 55" and 65" Class (2D and 3D) units. The newly designed E-Series 60" Razor LED Smart TV gives consumers an ultra-thin, slim-frame design, brilliant 1080p Full HD LED quality, and VIZIO Internet Apps® at an unbeatable sub-$1000 value. In advance of the holiday season, the 60" is currently available online and on select shelves at Costco Wholesale, Sam's Club, Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, BJ's Wholesale, ebay.com, VIZIO.com and other retailers.

   "The new E-Series units, which are the first of many large-size VIZIO models, give consumers access to great technology on an even bigger scale," said Matt McRae, Chief Technology Officer, VIZIO. "The larger units provide more screen space with a narrower border around the picture, allowing consumers to get the most out of the crystal-clear Razor LED picture for a more immersive, WIFI enabled experience."

   Perfect for the sports fan, movie enthusiast or family looking to upgrade their entertainment centerpiece for the holidays, the E-Series 60" Razor LED HDTV is packed with the latest technologies like VIZIO Internet Apps® with WIFI, giving consumers instant access to apps like Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, VUDU™, Hulu Plus, YouTube®, Pandora®, Facebook® and Twitter®, all with the push of a button on the smart remote with keyboard.** The bigger picture of the large-size HDTVs is enhanced by crisp, high-quality LED, 1080p Full HD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate for remarkable detail and clarity, ideal when watching a fast moving sporting event or action movie. The large 60" and 70" units also auto-adjust the picture to room lighting, feature SRS StudioSound HD™*** for an immersive surround sound experience and use less energy than conventional LCD HDTVs.****

   "VIZIO's 60" (E601i) is a Smart TV with the thin LED design that consumers prefer, at a price that would have only bought you a 42" CCFL TV in October 2009," said Tamaryn Pratt, Principal, Quixel Research. "VIZIO has been able to drive the price down for consumers, allowing them to enjoy the latest features and a slim design on a larger screen, at a great value. With a 60" TV offering more than twice the screen viewing area of a 42" TV, now is the perfect time for consumers to trade up."
