Looking for an excuse to try out BlackBerry's latest flagship? Here's one: now it's cheap. Folks willing to sign up for a usual two year agreement can score the BlackBerry Z10 for $99 at both AT&T and Verizon or a mere $49 at Amazon. The price drop is most likely designed to spur sales in the wake of the Canadian company's $84 million loss last quarter. "Now is the right time to adjust the price," a BlackBerry spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal. "It's part of life cycle management to tier the pricing for current devices to make room for the next ones." In other words, BlackBerry needs to move its existing stock before it can sell the public on a second-generation device. Either way, the Z10 is a steal at $49 -- unless you're in one of the regions that's simply giving them away.
