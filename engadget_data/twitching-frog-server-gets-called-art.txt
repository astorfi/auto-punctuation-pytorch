This time it's "Experiments in Galvanism", a tiny server embedded in a dead frog, submerged in mineral oil, which is remotely made to twitch via Galvanism (the contraction of a muscle when stimulated by electric current). Of course, the piece's creator Garnet Hertz has a little more going for him than the Text-o-possum's architect. Firstly, besides the fact that the frog is dead, it actually does have a kind of server inside of it, and secondly, Garnet has managed to convince other people that he's put together something legitimately special -- which is half the trick of art, really. If you've been looking for something to wax philosophical over, hit the read link.[Via Wired]
