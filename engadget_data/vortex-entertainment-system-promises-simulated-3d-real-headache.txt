 Australia's 3D Visual is looking to bring the wonders of 3D a little closer to home with its Vortex home entertainment system, providing an ample supply of hype to go along with it. So what exactly does this " portal into the future" consist of? Well, at the core is a fairly decent Windows XP-based PC, packing a 3.2GHz Pentium 4 processor, 2GB RAM, NVIDIA 6800 GTOC graphics card, and two generous 300GB hard drives spinning at 7,200 rpm; a projector provides the display. The 3D part of the equation comes in the form of some apparently standard issue shutter glasses -- the very same technology that's been kicking around since the days of the Sega Master System. To round out the set , 3D Visual's also seen fit to include a couple of wireless controllers and a ton pre-loaded PC games (either 90 or 150 depending on the paragraph you read), which either means that you can look at paying quite a premium for that convience (they haven't announced a price yet) or 3D Visual's going to be hearing from some dissapointed customers when they discover they've got a hard drive filled with demos.
