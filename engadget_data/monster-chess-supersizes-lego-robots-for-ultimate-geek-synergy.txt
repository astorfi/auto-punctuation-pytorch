Composed of more than 100,000 Lego Mindstorms parts, the above chess set occupies a 156-square foot playing area and took a four-person team "about a year" to create. Total retail cost is tallied up at $30,000, though you won't be surprised to hear there are no plans to make it available for purchase -- presumably because of its priceless awesomeness. See a game played out on video after the break.
