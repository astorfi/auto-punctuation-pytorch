Planned for release in Q3 this year -- no pricing info available, for either -- the 1606 is low-end character packing 8MB of memory, flashlight -- with dedicated button, ooh-la-la -- 1.8-inch internal 262k color and external monochromatic display, and 3.5 hours / 10 days talk and standby time. The Nokia 3606 holds more tech joy under its hood -- but is still a lower-end device -- sporting a 1.3 megapixel camera, Bluetooth, 15MB internal memory with expansion via microSD, and up to 5 hours of continuous music playback. We've not heard who the lucky carrier will be for either of these, but we expect an announcement can't be too far off.
