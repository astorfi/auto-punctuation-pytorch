So far as we know we're still slated for that June 11 launch of the "Polar White" DS Lite in the states, but unless they're gonna surprise us with some additional colors it looks like Europe will be getting black first come June 23rd. And don't be fooled by Nintendo's press shots above, we don't think there's a muddy gray / brown shade en route as well, just black and white due Europe for about £99 or €149.99 ($185 or $191, depending on your region).[Thanks, Ant]
