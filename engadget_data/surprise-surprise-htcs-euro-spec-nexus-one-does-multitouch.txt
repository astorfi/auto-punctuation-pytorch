 Alright, Google, we get it: you hate America. That's the only conclusion we can reach for why the company's last two Android version hero devices -- the Droid for 2.0 and the Nexus One for 2.1 -- have mysteriously opted to exclude multitouch support in the phone's in-built apps (despite retaining support in third-party downloads). As we all know, the European Milestone adds that functionality back in, and it seems that the European version of the Nexus One (which'll be offered by Vodafone) is getting the same boost. We say this because a phone being passed around to Germany's Heise has pinch zooming enabled -- very likely the same stuff Voda will have on offer when it starts selling the phone in the coming weeks. That's fine, Google, whatever, we hate gestures anyway. Hate 'em.

Update: According to a Google employee on a Google Mobile help page, the phone shipping to European markets will be no different than the one here in the US. We're not sure we entirely buy that, but we'll get to the bottom of this before long.

[Thanks, Philipp, John]
