It's not just PS4 news from Sony at its Gamescom keynote today, the company has also just confirmed a big bit of PlayStation Vita news: it's dropping the MSRP to $199. That price goes into effect tomorrow. Sony also says that it's dropping the cost of the memory cards for the device, although it's not offering specific prices for those just yet. What's more, the company has also confirmed that a slate of indie games are heading to the handheld console this year, including Fez, which will also be making its way to the PlayStation 4 -- again, further specifics will have to wait, but we'll bring you those as soon as we know them.


Update: We've just received specifics about those memory card price drops. The 4GB unit is falling from $19.99 to $14.99; the 8GB from $29.99 to $19.99; the 16GB from $59.99 to $39.99; and the 32GB from $99.99 to $79.99.
