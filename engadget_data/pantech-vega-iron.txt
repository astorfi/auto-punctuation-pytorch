 We've got to admit that we saw some rumors about a "zero bezel" Pantech a few days ago, but ignored them because we had no idea what that meant. Now we do, however, as Pantech has made the 5-inch 1080p 720p phone official, under the solid-sounding name of the Vega Iron. The bezels aren't quite zero, but they are small: just 2.4mm across on each side, which -- for reference -- is roughly half the width on an iPhone 5. This results in a viewable-to-total area ratio of 75.5 percent, which Pantech claims is a world beater. Other specs include a quad-core 1.7GHz Snapdragon 600 processor, in-cell LCD display and Gigabit WiFi. We have no idea if Pantech has penciled the United States into the Vega Iron's release schedule, but the company is certainly trying to make an impression in this hemisphere and a phone like this couldn't hurt.

 Update: The rumors were right about everything except the resolution, which now looks to be 720p rather than the big ten-eighty. Thanks to commenters who spotted the error.
