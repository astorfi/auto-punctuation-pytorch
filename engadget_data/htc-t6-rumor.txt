If the HTC One is just too small for your needs, perhaps the latest rumor will perk you up: a 5.9-inch HTC device code-named the T6 is purportedly in development. Notable leakster @evleaks has dug up a few details about this handset, and -- if true -- this is going to be one heck of a refresh to the company's premier lineup. Here's what we've heard so far: it's consistent with the One's general look, sports a 1080p display, a 2.3GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 chipset (MSM8974), BoomSound, an OIS-equipped UltraPixel camera, 2GB RAM and a 3,300mAh battery. The T6 will supposedly feature a dedicated pen / stylus as well as a biometric fingerprint scanner around the back. Curiously, it's also reported that the T6 will have a microSD slot -- an addition that would be inconsistent with HTC's current design strategy -- and will run on Android Key Lime Pie. The latter rumor seems unlikely, given the high chance that 4.3 will be a Jelly Bean release, but we suppose anything can happen between now and late summer / early fall (the T6's supposed launch timeframe). That said, all of the above rumors are making us very excited -- and hopeful -- for what HTC is cooking up, provided it still fits comfortably in our hands.
