The new flagship model, 3 Vision, comes with a 3-inch touchscreen, 8GB of storage, microSDHC card slot, video playback, and a few extras like a voice recorder, calendar, stopwatch and an FM transmitter for streaming music to your Hi-Fi. Positioned as a direct competitor to the iPod Touch, the new Archos will cost nearly half as much at £90 ($148). Other models detailed today include the 2 Vision -- a 1.8-inch "credit card sized" player that loses video playback but gains a 16GB option, with prices likely to start at £50 ($82) -- and the Archos Clipper, a 2GB no-frills player priced at £20 ($32).
