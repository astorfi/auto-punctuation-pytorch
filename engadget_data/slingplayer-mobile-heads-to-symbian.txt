If we had cash riding on it, we'd guess this means an S60 version of SlingPlayer Mobile is getting ready to roll. Don't get us wrong, a UIQ client would be cool too, but seeing how S60 handsets outnumber their UIQ counterparts by, like, a bazillion to one, we don't want to get our M600 pals too fired up until we get the full scoop.
