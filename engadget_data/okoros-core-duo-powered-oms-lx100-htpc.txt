 Okoro Media Systems has just released a low-profile,reasonably priced home theater PC based on Intel's Core Duo processor that has also received the coveted VIIV seal of approval, which we're still not exactly sure about, butwhose very existence makes us scared of buying any products without this enigmatic certification. Besides the 1.73GHzYonah T2300, the OMS-LX100 features one gig of 677MHz DDR2 RAM, a Nvidia GeForce 7300 GS PCI Express video card with256MB of memory, an ATI Theater Pro 550 PCI TV/FM tuner with MPEG-2 encoding (OTA HDTV tuner optional), 250GB harddrive, 16x dual-layer DVD burner, IR or RF remote, Dolby Digital Live support, your choice of operating system andbundled multimedia software, and a host of ports: component, S-Video, composite, DVI, VGA, optical and coax digitalaudio, plus the usual complement of USB, FireWire, and PS/2 hookups. Available immediately, Okoro's dual core HTPC willset you back just $1,400.
