Yep, even though it's packing the same 1.6GHz Atom internals as every other XP netbook out there, it's apparently a step above, with a tight design, kickin' keyboard, and 8.5 hours of battery life for $399. Of course, that's in contrast to some other reviews of the Dynabook UX we've seen, which called the keyboard "cramped," but it certainly seems like the NB205 is at least worth a look for potential netbook shoppers not put off by the upcoming CULV explosion.
