The six megapixel i6 (pictured)features anti-shake technology, a 3x optical zoom, 2.5-inch LCD and something we haven't seen for awhile, an integratedMP3 player all a swank 0.72-inch slim shell. They even go so far as to call this the "world's first PMP slimcamera" since it can also playback (unspecified) video files. Samsung is also launching their budget S-seriesfeaturing 5, 6 or 8 megapixels with 3x optical zoom, 2.4-inch LCD, MPEG-4 video recording, and PictBridge support. Allthe new digicams are expected to hit the market in "early 2006." Pics of the S-600 and S-800 after the break.
