And well, if they're smart they get leading industrial designer Yves Behar and his FuseProject team to dream up something incredibly groundbreaking and head-turning. Having birthed the designs of the OLPC XOs and Jawbone headsets we've always been incredibly fascinated by Behar and his knack for coming up with eye-pleasing technology, so naturally we caught up with him when he was in NYC last month and shot some footage of his studio. Uh, so what are you still doing here? Watch it now! Hit up the video after the break!
