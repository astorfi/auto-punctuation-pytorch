It's about time, considering competitor LaCie has offered integrated drives in its LaCinema line for more than a year, though we wish WD would have included the Netflix streaming capabilities of the WD TV Live Plus here -- or any streaming at all, for that matter. If an unconnected box with 1080p playback via HDMI and fabulous codec support (including Monkey's Audio!) is appealing to you though, then this latest offering might be worth your while -- especially if it's priced in line with its "value conscious" featureset, a fact we haven't been able to verify. To be competitive, it'll have to cost below LaCie's LaCinema Classic HD, which throws in UPnP / DLNA server support on top of similar features for as little as $229. If you're curious, find the user's manual (including a full codec list) at our more coverage link.
