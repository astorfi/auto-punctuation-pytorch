Napster formally launched today that flat-rate all-you-can download
Napster To Go service they've been testing for the past
few months. For $15 a month you can download as much music as you want—and transfer it to a portable device—but the
catch is that once you stop paying the monthly fee you can't listen to any of the music anymore (you can still pay per
track for stuff you want to keep). The whole thing uses Microsoft's new Janus digital rights management system, and the
Creative Zen Micro,
Dell Pocket DJ, and
iRiver H10 are three of the first compatible players.
Obviously they're going after the iTunes Music Store (Napster's CEO even disses the iTMS in the press release), but to
be honest, there is something mighty tempting about the service. $180 a year seems totally reasonable to have easy
access to almost unlimited amounts of music, especially since we can take it with us (that is, if we owned one of those
players, which we don't) and if we hear something we want to keep we can still get our un-DRM'd downloads through the
"usual channels." The big questions are whether the whole thing will be easy enough for the average person to use and
whether Napster will market this properly. Apparently they've dropped a lot of cash on a Super Bowl commercial, which
is already a bad sign.
