We're not sure what kind of abuse you're putting your earbuds through that would require such exotic materials (and we might remind you to better mind the abuse you're subjecting your eardrums to on the daily), but if you're over Japan way they can be had for ¥17,325 and ¥12,600, respectively (about $155 and $113 US)
