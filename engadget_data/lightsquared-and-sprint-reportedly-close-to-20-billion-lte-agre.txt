 Well, we already know that a certain tractor manufacturer isn't particularly fond of LightSquared and its GPS-bustin' LTE technology, but other companies with yellow logos apparently harbor a much different sentiment. Really, though, who wouldn't be smiling when there's a supposed $20 billion in it for you? According to the ever-familiar "people familiar" with the story, as quoted by Businessweek, LightSquared is getting closer to a long-rumored 15-year deal that would pay Sprint $20 billion in exchange for piggy-backing on its aggressive network expansion. This would help LightSquared get up to speed much more quickly, get Sprint access to some lovely LTE, and together completely revitalize the paper maps industry.
