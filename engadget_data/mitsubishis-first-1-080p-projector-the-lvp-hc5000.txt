But when it comes to 1,080p front projectors, we've been wanting to call up Mitsubishi on our Boost Mobile phone and ask them "Where you at?" Well the venerable rear-projection TV manufacturer has apparently been biding its time in order to release its first full HD unit, but the pricetag on this 3LCD model may convince you that it was worth the wait, as the LVP-HC5000 will cost "just" 450,000 yen (about $3,890) when it hits Japanese shores on October 12th. Even at this bargain basement price, you're still getting a very respectable set of specs, most notably a dynamic contrast ratio of 10,000:1 (though static is a mere 2,000:1), 1,000 nits of blinding brightness, as well as a full complement of inputs including HDMI, DVI-I, component, composite, S-Video, and even D-sub. Yeah, this all sounds like a pretty good deal; now we're just hoping that they'll ship this puppy overseas and help us finally purge that embarrassing 27-inch CRT from our otherwise kick-ass home theater setup.[Via HDBeat]
