We knew we were out of the loop when we realized we've never come
across what the LA Times calls the must-have party good of the summer, why, the molten chocolate flowing fountain,
of course. At only 3 feet tall, it looks like an item Willie Wonka might relegate to the oompaloompa
quarters, but the glitterati seem to like it since every premiere, convention and celebration has gotten one in
the past couple of months. For $400-$700 you can have 180-degree molten chocolate continuously cascade from the top,
while 300 of your closest friends cautiously poke pretzels and strawberies into the coco-flow. OK so maybe we're a
little bitter, but somehow this doesn't hold up to the chocolate river.
