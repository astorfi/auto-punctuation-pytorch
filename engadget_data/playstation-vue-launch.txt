Sony's PlayStation-based streaming live TV service won't go live nationwide until sometime later in 2015. If you live in Chicago, Philadelphia or New York City, however, the service lights up "in the next two weeks." That's according to Sony Computer Entertainment head Andrew House -- he's the top PlayStation exec at Sony. House told the Wall Street Journal as much in an interview today, though he stopped short of providing details on pricing or launches in other parts of the US.




We've seen snippets of the service in action, like this piece from GigaOm; PlayStation Vue is available in a private beta in New York City. Reports say that the service is as good or better than what Dish's Sling TV service offers, though it's missing some critical channels that Dish picked up: namely, ESPN, IFC, AMC, and CNN. And it doesn't hurt that Sling TV is available on a variety of devices, whereas PlayStation Vue is used with a PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4 game console.

We previewed Sling TV a few months back, seen here:

Sony's TV streaming service will offer a variety of live channels at launch. Here's what Sony said when it announced the service back in November 2014:

 "CBS – At launch, PlayStation®Vue will offer the live linear signal from CBS Television Network's owned-and-operated TV stations in select leading markets in addition to on-demand prime-time programming. Discovery Communications – Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Science, OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network, Discovery Family Channel and 11 more brands. Fox – Fox Networks Group's portfolio of national entertainment programming services, including - FX, FXX, FXM, National Geographic Channel and Nat Geo WILD. Additionally FOX Sports' national and regional programming services - FOX Sports 1, FOX Sports 2, BTN, Fox's regional sports networks, including YES Network and Prime Ticket. The agreement also covers Fox's owned and operated television stations. NBCUniversal – All local offerings from NBC, Telemundo and regional sports networks as well as Bravo, CNBC, E!, NBCSN, Oxygen, Sprout, Syfy, USA Network and more. Scripps Networks Interactive – HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel, DIY Network and Cooking Channel. Viacom – BET, CMT, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, PALLADIA, Spike, VH1 and more."PlayStation Vue joins PlayStation Music in a revamp of Sony's entertainment offerings on its PlayStation platforms. Sony announced earlier this year that its Music Unlimited service would be shuttered in favor of a Spotify-powered platform now known as "PlayStation Music". The general rebranding is part of Sony's refocusing on PlayStation as a product identity within the electronics giant.

We'll have more coverage of PlayStation Vue in the coming weeks as it rolls out in select cities.
