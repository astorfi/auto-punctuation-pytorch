Rather than make an effort to hide his kids, hide his wife or hide his husband (too), he's celebrating uncontrollably. Why? Because his homeland is preparing to make the shift to plastic cash. You heard right -- Canada is scheduled to introduce a polymer-based $100 bill in November, and in March of 2012, a recyclable $50 bill will follow. From there, smaller notes will be phased in over the next dozen months or so, providing citizens with legal tender that holds up better to Yellowknife's winters.
