Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference will kick off next week, on July 8th, and the company might announce a new music streaming service, a thinner set-top box and OS updates. You know what we might not see at the event, though? That subscription TV service Cupertino's reportedly cooking up. According to Recode, Apple did plan to unveil the new product at WWDC, but it had to postpone as the company's apparently not done negotiating financial terms and finalizing licensing deals with broadcasters yet. Even CBS CEO Les Moonves, who said last week at the Code Conference that his company will "probably" sign a deal with Apple, admitted that they're not finished talking about money. In addition, Apple's still working on the technology needed for broadcasters to deliver local programs to its Web TV service.



Cupertino hasn't revealed any details about this new product yet, but according to earlier reports, that local TV integration is a part of why it's different from the likes of Sling TV, or even PlayStation Vue which has local TV but is only available in a few cities. Apple wants to bundle channels (around 25 or so) for streaming for $30 to $40 a month, according to the WSJ, and to launch the service this fall. However, industry executives say even the launch date might be moved to much later this year, or even to 2016.
