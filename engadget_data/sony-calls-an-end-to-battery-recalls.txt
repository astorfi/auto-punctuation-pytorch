 Far be it from Sony to pre-announce future battery recalls and further dampen its Q3/4 financial woes even further, they're trying to get the word out that Sony's own laptop line won't be affected by the same battery recalls that have pulled back nearly six million Dell and Apple cells. Still, this isn't entirely good news for their business; does this mean that Sony's been keeping all the best manufactured batteries for their own machines, passing off lesser cells -- maybe even those that didn't pass muster -- to their partners? Yeah, we'd really want to get all cozy with a parts OEM that does that kind of stuff, one that might end up possibly endangering our own customers in the process. Cheers!
