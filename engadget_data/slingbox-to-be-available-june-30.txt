CEO of Sling Media Blake Krikorian has confirmed that the
Slingbox Personal Broadcaster will be available from
CompUSA and at least one other national retailer as of June 30. In case your memory has waned since they announced the
product last year, Slingbox is a solution that will allow
you to stream TV content from your cable, satellite or DVR to any computer with a high-speed internet connection. They
expect to make the official announcement on Thursday, with product available in stores the same day. According to the
website, price on this box still comes in at $249.
