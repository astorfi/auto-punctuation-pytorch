Datamancer's incredibly amazing Scrabble keyboard is one of the slickest, most ready-for-market DIY projects we've ever had the pleasure of eying, with each letter key being constructed from an actual pre-owned Scrabble game piece. The USB keyboard itself was built with an aluminum casing for an "industrialized twist," but obviously it's the top that keeps us drooling. Oh, and there are even LEDs hidden beneath the Num Lock, Caps Lock and Scroll Lock keys, suggesting that a completely backlit iteration isn't too far out of the realm of possibility. A few more images are tucked away in the read link -- you owe it to yourself to check 'em out.
