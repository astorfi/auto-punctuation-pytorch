Though it doesn't have as much visibility in the 4G marketplace as Clear and Sprint do, Comcast does actually offer WiMAX service using Clearwire's network and owns about 9 percent of it, but the cable provider's CFO says that the prospects for upping that share aren't good and that its up to Clearwire to "figure this out" -- "this" being its financial pickle. Not exactly a vote of confidence, is it? Obviously, adding (or converting to) LTE is a possible game plan for Clearwire that's going to require some serious cash to pull off, so staying tight with Sprint seems like a stellar idea right about now.
