The phone itself bears a strong resemblance to the C3-00, with a non-touchable screen and QWERTY keyboard, priced, pre-tax, at €60 (about $85). Nokia promises admirable battery-life and a rainbow of color choices.

Up next is the Nokia 300, pairing a 2.4-inch resistive touchscreen with a numbered keypad, with a long narrow frame very similar to last year's Nokia C3, but now toting a 1GHz processor, five megapixel shooter and a €85 (about $120) bounty. Meanwhile, €115 (about $160) will net you the Nokia 303, which brings together both touchscreen and QWERTY input and rocks a 3.2 megapixel camera. While Nokia's first Windows Phones remain the stars of the show, these sub-$200 prices and pre-2012 arrival will tempt residual Series 40 fans still out there. Skip on past the break for a brimful of Asha.
