We just stumbled upon the perfect complement to your LCARS-esque touchscreen, and chances are that you won't have to sell off too many Spock action figures in order to procure it. Created by Dream Cheeky, this VoIP / Skype phone is powered by USB and looks pretty much exactly like one of those classic Star Trek Communicators. Best of all, there's a velcro backing in order to mount it up for everyone to see. Because you will want everyone checking this out, right?[Via OhGizmo]
