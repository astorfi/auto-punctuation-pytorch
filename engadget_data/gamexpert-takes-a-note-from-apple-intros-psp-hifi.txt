It's weird enough when companies rip product designs and preface every product with the letter "i," but "peripheral specialist" Gamexpert has gone to the next level by coating what appears to be an iPod Hi-Fi in a glossy black finish, slapping a PSP dock on top, and having the nerve to price it higher than Apple's (first-party) original. The self-proclaimed "ultimate sound experience" for your handheld Sony, the PSP Hifi houses two midrange drivers, a down-firing subwoofer, an aux input (for your iPod, perhaps?), a uninspiring 23 watts of total amplification, and, of course, a place to rest (and charge) your Sony device. While you even get a wireless remote to control the tunes from across the way, claims like "maximum bass extension" paired with its inability to thump below 50Hz seem a tad suspect. Nevertheless, the Â£199.99 ($376) PSP Hifi will be vying for your accessorizing wallet when it hits stores -- and mostly higher octaves -- soon enough. [Via Tech Digest]
