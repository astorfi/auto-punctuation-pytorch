Samsung's 55-inch Internet@TV widget enabled, LED-backlit 7100 model has a pricetag of $3,799, although we couldn't get any indication when to expect one in our neck of the woods. The 46-inch 6000 series model checks in at $2,799 and is due in early April, with assorted sizes falling in from there, including selections from the older CCFL backlit 6 series line. Checking for a Sony V-Series BRAVIA or the 32-inch XBR9? They're up as well, with a $2,399 pricetag on the 52-inch KDL-52V5100 due in stores March 22, although the Internet enabled sets are nowhere to be found. Take another look at our video of widgets in action before deciding, if the benefits of LED backlighting are cause to upgrade this spring are you ready to chip in $200 extra (the price difference between Samsung's Yahoo! widget packing 7000 series and old school Infolink RSS 6000 series models) to Twitter on your TV?[Thanks, Deen & Best Buy Employee]
