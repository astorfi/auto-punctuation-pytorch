The document that dished those secrets also mentioned an "X Slate," which made us wonder if Lenovo's LePad was finally hitting the states... but This is my next seems to have stumbled across a grander piece of technology than that oft-delayed slate. According to a presumably leaked company presentation, Lenovo's planning to release an Android 3.0 tablet this July with a giant raft of specs -- a 10.1-inch 1280 x 800 IPS capacitive multitouch panel, a Tegra 2 processor, up to 64GB of storage, front and rear cameras, a full-size USB 2.0 port, mini-HDMI out, a genuine SD card reader and up to 8 hours of purported battery life in a package about 14mm thick and weighing 1.6 pounds.

What's more, it will reportedly have an optional dual-digitizer with "true pen support" and an optional keyboard case, possibly aping ASUS's recent Slate and Transformer tablet input mechanisms by allowing for both simultaneously. There's also apparently plenty of software support for the business-minded, including IT integration as well as anti-theft and remote wipe options, and all this will apparently start at the competitive price of $499 -- assuming these documents are legitimate and still valid. You see, they look a little preliminary for a slate supposedly sampling in just a couple of months, and there are contradictions here and there, such as the mention of a 1080p display in one slide, and some watermarks from 2009 in others. Still, Lenovo, if you're indeed producing a tablet today, we're liking its proposed specs -- don't suppose we can get a Tegra T25 chip while you're at it?
