Starting July 31st you'll be able to snag the phone online, and come August 7th you can get it in stores. The price? Not too terrible: $359 without contract, $249 with 1 year, and $199 for two years committed to the carrier. Might be a little more than we'd originally expected, but outside the Q you're not likely to see a sexier EV-DO device on Verizon for a little while yet.[Thanks, V]
