  The theme of CES 2009 for the HD industry was the mass adoption of Yahoo Widgets. Never before have we seen so many manufacturers adopt the same technology, and now that we've had a chance to play, we understand why. For the first time ever we've experienced interactive internet TV in a way that is actually useful. Sure you could get the weather or a stock quote on your TiVo for years, but it's always been like six clicks away. And now since everyone decided to use Yahoo's widgets, no matter what kind of TV you have, you'll have the same access to the same great widgets. And best of all they'll be available at the touch of a button. So if you aren't sold on the idea yet, spend a few minutes watching and then tell us it isn't cool.
