Samsung has over $4 million up for grabs to entice would-be developers toward its Tizen mobile OS. If you're feeling crafty -- and who isn't futzing in the garage these days? -- you have until November 1st to submit an app based on the South Korean giant's upstart ecosystem. Games take the lion's share of the prize, with the top title walking away with $200K out of the category's $340K. The winning non-game application (music, social networking, et cetera) takes home $120K, and the 10 best HTML 5-based apps each net $50K. While we've seen this sort of stunt before, the end results typically speak for themselves.
