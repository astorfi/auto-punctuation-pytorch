 
Double Fine's Broken Age will launch on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on the same "day and date" that the second half of Broken Age's PC version launches, studio founder Tim Schafer announced during the PlayStation Experience keynote.

Additionally, Double Fine will be bringing its classic adventure game, Day of the Tentacle, to PS4 and Vita at some unannounced point in the future. There's no additional information on Day of the Tentacle: Special Edition just yet, but we imagine that's secondary to the excitement all the '90s kids in the audience feel right now.

If you're in the mindset for something a little more modern, Double Fine will also be bringing Gang Beasts to PlayStation 4. Similar to games like Surgeon Simulator, Gang Beasts is a purposefully-difficult-to-control brawler that recently rose to prominence thanks to popular YouTube celebrities. If you want to see it in action, we've got a trailer after the break.
