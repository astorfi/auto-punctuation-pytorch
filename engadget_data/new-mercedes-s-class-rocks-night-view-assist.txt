Now in addition to a PCMCIA slot,Mercedes-Benz is premiering their “Night view assist” system on their new, 2007 S-Class series which issaid to increase nighttime visibility by up to 125 percent -- without blinding on-coming motorists. It uses infraredlight to cast a broad beam ahead of the vehicle and then displays the 8-inch grayscale image onthe dashboard LCD. Yeah, we know, what’s the big deal, other cage manufactures have offered these options in thepast. But check out the vid over at AutoSpies though, we think it's worth your while.[Thanks, Donald]
