Here's one we kinda expected at this point: a new BlackBerry previously spotted via a shady eBay auction, once thought to be a member of the upcoming 9000 series but identified here as an "8XXX" -- in other words, either RIM or Voda hasn't quite decided yet how to shoehorn it into the 8000 series lineup. Projected launch (on Voda, anyway -- other carriers may vary) is May of this year, bringing quadband EDGE, triband 3.6Mbps HSDPA, a 480 x 320 display, 2 megapixel cam, GPS, WiFi, and a whoppin' 624MHz core to "senior executives" across the land (Vodafone's words, not ours). These guys are getting better at making slick looking devices with every iteration, are they not?
