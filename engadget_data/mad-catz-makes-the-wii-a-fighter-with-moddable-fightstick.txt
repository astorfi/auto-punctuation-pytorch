Capcom and, just as importantly Mad Catz's new Arcade FightStick to go along with it. The best news, however, is that like Mad Catz's fightsticks for other consoles, this one is moddable for those that prefer some arcade authentic parts, and it even packs a few features not found its Xbox 360 and PS3 counterparts. Most notably, that includes a toggle switch that will let the arcade stick control either the d-pad of the classic controller or the left or right analog stick, meaning you'll also be able to use it with an array of Virtual Console titles. Look for this one to set you back $80.
