 
Sure, it's a bit short on surprises, thanks to a couple of detailed leaks in recent months, but the Dell XPS 420 is now prepped for your ordering pleasure on Dell's online store. Prices start at $1,499, which will get you a fairly specced system and a 20-inch LCD. Other perks in the base system include a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, a 13-in-1 card reader, SideShow and an option for an "Xcelerator" to speed up video encoding, but on the traditional specs it's pretty firmly middle of the road: Vista Home Premium, 2GB of RAM, Intel Core 2 Duo E6750 processor and 256MB Radeon ATI HD 2600 XT for graphics. But hey, who needs muscle when you've got SideShow?[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
