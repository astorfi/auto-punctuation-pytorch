The world is full of annoying fake pets, so why gift another
robotic canine when you could bestow a humanoid
Nuvo upon that lucky member of your shopping list?
And we're not just saying lucky because of the hefty change you'll be dropping on them ($7,000 for the English
version), but for all the sweet moves Nuvo has â€” on the dance floor and in the tech specs. He responds to verbal
commands, can serve up MP3s at request, can be controlled over a web browser or through your phone with his WiFi and
Bluetooth skillz, and can shoot video of all the goings on for posterity sake. There are
other options this year for robot gifting,
but past sneaking a QRIO out from under the watchful
eye of Sony, you're not going to find a better humanoid than the Nuvo this holiday season.
