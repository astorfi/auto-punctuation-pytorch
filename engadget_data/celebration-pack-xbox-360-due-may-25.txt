The Celebration Pack Xbox 360 is a plain-jane 4GB Kinect bundle underneath, but it slathers the console, the wireless gamepad and the Kinect sensor in a tattered Union Jack to remind everyone you're not from Canada. Gamers also get copies of Kinect Adventures and Kinect Sports to help them train for the 500-meter relay. Showing your patriotism with an Xbox will cost you £250 ($406) when the console is ready on May 25, while Microsoft will gladly sell you a just-as-British Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for £30 ($49).
