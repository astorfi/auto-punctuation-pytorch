  ASUS took a few OTA stabs at fixing the Transformer Prime's satellite blindness, sure, but now the outfit is taking a more direct approach at fixing its GPS reception woes: hardware. New Prime owners registering their slab on ASUS' member site are now being greeted with an application for a GPS Extension Kit, a free dongle that "may help improve signal reception and optimize the user experience." According to a series of emails posted by an XDA forums user, the kit is due to ship in mid-April, and will "be a flush fit on the bottom of the unit if held in landscape, matching the color of your Prime Chassis." ASUS says the dongle will be available to all customers who picked up the tablet, and carefully notes that the accessory does not "replace, alter or amend any existing warranties." Fair enough. Now, what if we want to type while we find our way around the world?
