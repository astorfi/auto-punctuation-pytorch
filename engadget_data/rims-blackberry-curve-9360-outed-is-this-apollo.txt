No matter the case, OneMobileRing got a hands-on with the Curve 9360, and it looks like this portrait QWERTY could be following in its brethren's OS 7 footsteps. Shots of the device reveal a Tour-like chrome trim, optical trackpad and the requisite micro-USB port for your charging / connectivity needs. A pic of the device's open battery door also shows off a SIM card slot, leading us to believe that this may very well be the ever-elusive Apollo. Could we see this mid-end, GSM workhorse in T-Mobile's near future? Our in-house Ms. Cleo predicts a yes.
