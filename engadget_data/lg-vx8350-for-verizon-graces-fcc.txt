Anyhow, this one will hit with EV-DO and Bluetooth, but we don't know much else; the back of the phone doesn't do much in the way of revealing a form factor -- it could realistically be a slider, flip or a rather wide candybar. Any way you look at it, though, we're going to guess that this one isn't going to bear the same level of chic as its VX8500, 8600, and 8700 cousins.
