In that spirit, Netflix is introducing a feature to its Android app that'll keep unknowing viewers from chewing up their mobile data plan. New to the settings menu, users will discover an option that restricts video playback to WiFi networks. Netflix has left the setting to user discretion, however, meaning that it must be manually enabled. Once the switch is flipped, you'll retain the ability to search and browse Netflix over a mobile connection, but you'll need to scramble for a WiFi connection when it's time to watch Walter White cook up his latest batch. If you're unsure of where your usage sits, the WiFi restriction is probably worth imposing -- unless you're with Sprint or T-Mobile, that is.
