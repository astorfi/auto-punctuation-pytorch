Sony's own PlayStation 3 just happens to be the most used Netflix-streaming device in the word, but that doesn't mean the outfit isn't offering a diverse array of streaming options. Today at its E3 press event, the company announced that the all three of its consoles -- PS3, PS4 and Vita -- will support a Sony live viewer service, Redbox Instant and Flixter, as well. Sony didn't say when support for these services would arrive, but made sure to mention that its own Music and Video Unlimited apps would be available on the PlayStation 4 at launch.
