This time we've got all we could ask for out of this common snafu, since friendly tipster AJ managed to track down a rebate form for the much-rumored Sidekick ID on T-Mobile's site that not only promises a handy $50 to whoever can navigate its tricksy questions, but also gives us a likely sounding April 18 launch date to mull over, along with our first full-on "press shots" of the phone. The cute, pared down exterior is further complemented by a selection of primary colors, as seen above, making this a likely pick for the budget-minded "I don't need no stinkin' EDGE data" fashionphone set. In fact, with prices like these ($99.99 after a $50 rebate), why not just buy 'em all to mix and match with your outfits? You know you want to.[Thanks, AJ]
