Don't think that the end of holiday shopping means an end to attempts to swipe your credit card data. The FBI is warning retailers that it expects these intrusion attempts to become more of a problem in the near future, particularly through malware that grabs account info from cash registers and credit card readers. It's not clear if these attackers have any specific stores in their crosshairs, but retail account security is undoubtedly a growing problem -- Neiman Marcus recently confirmed a breach that compromised 1.1 million customer cards, and Reuters hears that other companies have been victims. Paying with cash suddenly doesn't sound like such a bad idea.
