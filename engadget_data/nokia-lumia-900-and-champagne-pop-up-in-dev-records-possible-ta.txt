This tells us nothing of specs, but here's what we learned: both phones are real, and they're not the same exact device. The app also discovered a new build of Windows Phone called 7.10.8725 in its system, a hint that one of these two handsets -- likely the Champagne -- may be running on the next OS update known as Tango. Does this mean the Champagne is destined for emerging markets? We're hoping to find out in Vegas at CES, just a month from now.
