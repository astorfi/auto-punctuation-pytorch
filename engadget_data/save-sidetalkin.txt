Dear Nokia, we have one simple request: bring back the sidetalkin'! We swear we were just kidding the whole time we
were making fun of it, all we were trying to do was get you to notice us. Judging by the
online Save Sidetalkin' petition, there
are at least three other people who agree with us. Well, maybe two, since some guy named Josh signed twice. And think
of poor Sidetalkin.com, which is being forced to close down because you did something as selfish as actually listen to
your customers. It's not like we actually expected you to!
