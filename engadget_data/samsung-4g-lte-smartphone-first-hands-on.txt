This Verizon LTE-ready beast touts a Super AMOLED Plus display, runs Android 2.2 with TouchWiz and features a front-facing cam. On the rear it's got an 8 megapixel auto-focus shooter and mini HDMI on the hip. We're busy sorting out details and grabbing more pics. Stay tuned!

Update: We've added the gallery with hands-on shots for your viewing pleasure!

Update 2: Samsung nor Verizon were willing to talk labels, but it's a pretty safe bet this phone is the same as the SCH-i520 we peeked earlier in the week.
