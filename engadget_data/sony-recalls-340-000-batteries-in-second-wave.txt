 Sorry to kick y'all laptop owners when you're down, but Sony announced that it's initiating another recall of 340,000 batteries, this time adding Gateway to the list of the affected, in addition to already-affected Fujitsu, Toshiba, and its own batteries. (It's not immediately apparent if this also includes the 300,000 batteries of their own that they recalled earlier this month.) There are a ton of models being recalled for each company, so we'd ask you visit the Consumer Product Safety Commission for full details; also, if you haven't already checked your battery, please note the following companies are now initiating recalls:

Apple
Dell
Fujitsu
Gateway
Hitachi
IBM / Lenovo
Panasonic
Sharp
Sony
Toshiba

Kind of scary, but at this rate it's probably just safest to assume that no matter what your notebook, your battery is or will be recalled -- so be wary, and keep an eye out for battery recall pages.
