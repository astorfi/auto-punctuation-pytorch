Macles reports that Acer will refresh its Aspire One Happy line with a quartet of edible colors: Blueberry Shake, Banana Cream, Papaya Milk and Strawberry Yogurt. Those vibrant shells will have the innards of the still-unreleased Acer One D257, including a 1.66 GHz Intel Atom N570 dual-core processor, along with the usual 10.1-inch display, 2GB memory, 250GB hard drive, and a six-cell battery. And yes, there will be 802.11n WiFi, Bluetooth, and Windows 7 Starter. No word yet on availability and pricing, but it's probably smarter to wait rather than try to make your own with a dye tab and a sink full of vinegar.
