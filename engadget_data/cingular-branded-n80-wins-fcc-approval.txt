Our friends at the FCC have blessed the Nokia N80. And
in doing so, also provided some non-blurry shots of this
Cingular-branded quad-band/WCDMA/EDGE slider sporting WiFi, Bluetooth, 3 megapixel camera, and 40MB built-in memory
with miniSD expansion. With the FCC out of the way, hopefully this will drop Stateside closer to the January side of
that Q1 2006 announced release.
