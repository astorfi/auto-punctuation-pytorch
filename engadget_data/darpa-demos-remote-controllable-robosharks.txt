 We'll avoid the obvious jokes, but we don'tsee much reason for sharks with frickin' laser beams on their heads to in any way trump sharks with neural implants that allow them to be remotelycontrolled -- even monitored so granularly as to detect what they're feeling -- unless said robosharks also have bespoke lasers. Why do we mention suchsharks? Well, it could have something to do with the fact that Boston University and DARPA presented such a projectlast week, showing their control over fish by remotely electronically stimulating their brains to simulate their senseof scent, causing them to turn and move at the reasearchers' will. So the next time you're being followed by a coupleof sharks, don't think "We're gonna need a bigger boat," think "I shoulda paid my taxes."
