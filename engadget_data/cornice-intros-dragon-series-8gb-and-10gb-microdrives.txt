 Annoying though it may be that few 8 or10GB 1-inch drive-based audio players made it to market last year, there's certainly some big opportunities forambitious device manufacturers to steal in where the mini retreated and nano dare not go. The advantages are numerous,of course, and Cornice's latest Dragon Series 1-inch drivesoffer not only what they illustrate to be excellent shock-protection (which they call, cleverly enough, Crash Guard)and a 40% smaller component size than previous 1-inch drive devices, but also come in at $85 per unit for OEMs (whichis actually ain't too bad).
