 
Archos fan-site Archos Lounge lived up to its name this week and threw down a 300,000 page review on the new Archos 5 Internet Media Tablet. We won't tear down the whole thing here, but the primary takeaway seems to be mixed. Apparently the new processor on board really souped up the thing, but Archos skimped on the software, shipping what basically amounts to a buggy beta. That's no small criticism for Archos from its number one fans, so let's hope the company gets its act together fast. The review is in French, but there's an unboxing vid after the break, in that universal language of nerdery.
