Other than the shocking revelation that the two SKUs would allow users to record, pause and rewind live TV and pack in HDMI cables, they went on to mention pricing information and ship dates not seen in this screen grab pegging the new Premiere at $299 and THX Certified XL edition at $499 with an expected arrival of March 27. No word on any subscription fees, features or hard drive sizes, we guess there's a few secrets left to be revealed next week in New York.
