While they are the handiest of things to use, it can be a chore to keep track of them, keep them charged, and just plain not lose 'em while out running around. Samsung's patent application should sort all those troubles in one hop by having the headset actually merge with the phone to keep it charged, have it all fit in your pocket / carrying case, and help keep you from forgetting it at home. This is a fine idea, we just need the specs bumped to stereo and we're good to go. Thanks Samsung, top shelf bit of thinking.[Via Unwired View]
