        We didn't think Sprint would have the spotlight with the latest CDMA Treo for long, and it turns out we were right. Our pal HTC Kid over at Verizon tells us that the new #1 is planning to release its own Treo 755p variant shortly. Feature lineup appears to be similar (except possibly some LBS), but for the forgetful among us, we'll give them to you again -- dual-band CDMA with EV-DO Rev. A, a 1.3 megapixel shooter, and what appears to be a sleeker, refined look a la Treo 680. Make sure you stay tuned for more details.[Thanks, HTC Kid]
