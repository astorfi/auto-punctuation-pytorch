Amidst talk of its 2014 financials, Ubisoft hid a sliver of information that will please fans of open-world, first-person shooters: Far Cry 4 exists, and it's coming out this year. Ubisoft Montreal -- with the help of developers at Red Storm and the company's other dev shops in Toronto, Kiev and Shanghai -- is bringing the title to PC, PS4, Xbox One, PS3 and Xbox 360 on November 18th in the US, and on November 20th in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In the fourth installment of the franchise, players will roam the mountainous terrain of Kyrat, a region of the Himalayas with a "despotic self-appointed king."



Folks who pre-order the shooter will snag a free upgrade to its Limited Edition, which packs a set of three single-player missions dubbed Hurk's Redemption, along with Hurk's harpoon gun. Ubisoft says its goal is for Far Cry 4 to become one of the top 10 best-selling games of 2014. While other details on the game are slim, the firm promises we'll hear more about it during E3.
