  So, Belkin pulled a bit of a switcharoo on us with its Thunderbolt Express Dock. The device we saw back at IDF was very different from what made it out on the CES floor here in Vegas. But you know what? We're not mad because they managed to slim the dock down in the process. The outfit was also able to fit a single HDMI port into the peripheral while adding a nice cable channel to hide that unsightly Thunderbolt cable that connects the device to your PC of choice. If you'll recall, the dock also packs a trio of USB ports, Ethernet, 3.5mm audio, FireWire and an additional Thunderbolt port for all your connectivity needs. Head on past the break and we'll give you a quick tour.
