 
Woah, Acer just dropped news on a new Iconia device, except this one is all tablet. The Iconia Tab A500 has Android (no version specified) with the "Acer UI 4.5" on top, and Verizon 4G LTE inside. There's a 10.1-inch "10 point multitouch" screen, Tegra 2, and a gyroscope, which Acer claims should position the tablet perfectly for games. You can also output 1080p video over the built-in HDMI port, but there's no word on the screen's actual resolution. We also don't have any word on a price or a release date, and Acer hasn't even supplied any photos of the device yet, but we played with a 10.1-inch Android tablet from Acer back in November (pictured), and we have to assume this is the same one.

Updated: Confirmed. This is the same 10-inch tablet we saw in November. We hear it will be displayed at Verizon's booth so we'll be scouting it out and bringing you impressions sometime soon.
