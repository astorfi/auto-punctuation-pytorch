At issue is Motorola's European Patent 1010336 (B1), which covers a "method for performing a countdown function during a mobile-originated transfer for a packet radio system." According to Foss Patents, the court's injunction encompasses the iPhone (3G, 3GS and 4), iPad 3G and iPad2 3G. The ruling also states that Apple can avoid the injunction if it removes the patent-infringing elements from its devices, though it's more likely that Cupertino will appeal to the Karlsruhe Higher Regional Court, in the hopes of obtaining a stay. We've already reached out to Apple for comment, and will update this post as soon as we get more information.

Update: And as expected, Apple intends to appeal the ruling which, if enforced, would only apply to future shipments. So grab that existing stock while you can.
