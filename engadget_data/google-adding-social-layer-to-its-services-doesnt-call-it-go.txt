Rather than attempting to conquer the social sphere with one flagship product, Google will start rolling out more social networking features in an effort to enhance and enrich its present offerings. This will be done by keeping up a steady flow of acquisitions, says Schmidt. Hey, it might not be the big gun we expected El Goog to bring to this fight, but then a Zerg rush of small additions might be just what the Facebook-hating doctor would recommend here.
