To be honest, many have scoffed at AT&T's U-verse service due to the inability to watch one high-def channel while recording another (even though you could record an SD channel while watching an HD telecast), but now a swarm of St. Louis, Missouri based customers are joining in celebration as 2HD / 2SD service has been activated. In short, this enables four total streams to be accessed at once, but unlike the previous 1HD / 3SD setup, users can now get their fingers on dual high-definition broadcasts. Unfortunately, we've heard nothing official about this rolling out elsewhere, but we can't imagine AT&T only letting STL have all the fun here.[Thanks, Andrew]
