   About Brave

   Set in the rugged and mysterious Highlands of Scotland, Disney•Pixar's Brave follows the heroic journey of Merida (voice of Kelly Macdonald), a skilled archer and headstrong daughter of King Fergus (voice of Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (voice of Emma Thompson). Determined to change her fate, Merida defies an age-old custom sacred to the unruly and uproarious lords of the land-massive Lord MacGuffin (voice of Kevin McKidd), surly Lord Macintosh (voice of Craig Ferguson), and cantankerous Lord Dingwall (voice of Robbie Coltrane)-unleashing chaos in the kingdom. When she turns to an eccentric Witch (voice of Julie Walters), she is granted an ill-fated wish, and the ensuing peril forces Merida to harness all of her resources-including her mischievous triplet brothers-to undo a beastly curse and discover the meaning of true bravery. Directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman, and produced by Katherine Sarafian, Brave is a grand adventure full of heart, memorable characters, and signature Pixar humor. Opens on June 22, 2012, in 3D in select theatres.
