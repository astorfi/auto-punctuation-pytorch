Whatever tests the set had to pass to earn that THX badge, it was well deserved, too, with color that was spot-on and performance that ousted even the Pioneer Pro 141FD in brightness uniformity, ultimate brightness and motion resolution. Even fans of apline skiing should find the maximum brightness of 92 ft-lamberts more than adequate to make reaching for the ski goggles worthwhile. While there isn't a 72Hz mode, Panasonic seems to have addressed that deficiency with a solid performance of the new 3:2 pulldown mode. We recommend checking your credit card to see if it can survive a $1,800 bump before hitting the link for the glowing review.
