The Australian retail is already taking your hard-earned change, while we just saw first-hand the UK variant go down, go up with an iPad pre-order icon on the front page, then subsequently hidden again behind a yellow sticky note within minutes of this writing. We imagine the rest of the stores will be following suit (if they haven't already). Ladies and gentlemen of the pro-Apple persuasion, better double check your bank accounts -- in case you forgot, the full launch is May 28th.
