The 8300 Curve packs QWERTY usability and Pearl style into a case that measures only 4.2 x 2.4 x 0.6 inches. Features AT&T's touting include a lovely QVGA display with automatic light sensor, integrated spell checker (a BlackBerry first), noise cancellation, Bluetooth 2.0, push-to-talk support, comprehensive media support including a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a 2 megapixel cam. Look for it on AT&T starting tomorrow for $199.99 on a two-year agreement.[Via Boy Genius Report]
