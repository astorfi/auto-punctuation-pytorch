According to DigiTimes, however, the device's future now looks to be even more uncertain, with it supposedly set for release this September "at the earliest." Some unspecified "industry sources" further go on to say that the T101 (and other future ASUS netbook tablets) could either be pushed back further or scaled back on shipments if the company's current Eee PC T91 doesn't meet expectations, or possibly even canceled altogether.[Via Electronista]Update: Looks like the T101 and T101H are one in the same. Sorry for any confusion. Post has been corrected to reflect this.
