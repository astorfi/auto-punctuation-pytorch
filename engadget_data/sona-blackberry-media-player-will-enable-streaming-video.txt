 RIM's effort to position certainBlackBerries as more consumer-oriented products received a big shot in the arm today, as Sona Mobile Holdings -- whichmay or may not be the same company that's supposedly developing a StarTrek-themed cellphone -- announced the first-ever dedicated multimedia player for the company's "latest generationof devices." Although very little will be known about the software until it's unveiled at the Wireless EnterpriseSymposium in Orlando next month, we do know that the so-called Sona BlackBerry Media Player will be able to handlestreaming video, and that the first content provider will be CanWest Media Works. CanWest's offering will come in theform of a daily Sona Mobile BerryCast (their term for a wirelessly-updated podcast), which will deliver downloadablenews clips to a user's device. Not even a screenshot is available yet to show you, unfortunately, but rest assured thatwe'll be all over this come May 16th.[Via BBHUB]
