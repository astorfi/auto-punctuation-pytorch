 
N93 owners, you may want to avert your eyes here -- especially those of you still paying off your credit card balances (you know who you are) who get that sick feeling in the pit of your stomach at the mere suggestion that a successor to your hard-earned "multimedia computer" is already around the corner. The evidence that the N93i is real gets stronger seemingly by the day, and here we have our best evidence yet: a pair of somewhat clear pictures depicting a superphone that has been slightly retooled from its predecessor, exchanging a somewhat ordinary-looking exterior for a mirrored finish. The interior shot also clearly identifies this as an N93i, something we couldn't confirm from our last glance. Unfortunately, the details stop there, though it'd been previously suggested that A2DP and S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 are logical inclusions for an upgraded model. Between this and the utterly mind-boggling N95, 2007 looks to be an interesting year for the S60 fanboys and fangirls among us, eh?[Via Slashphone]
