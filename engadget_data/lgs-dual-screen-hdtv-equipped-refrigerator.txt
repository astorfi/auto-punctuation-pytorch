The main display is a 15-inch 1,024 x 768 number -- able to connect to a DVD player if you choose -- while its smaller counterpart takes things down to a wee 4-inches for use with LG's "weather and info center." Other non-traditional refrigerating capabilities include an FM radio, recipe bank, calendar, and digital photo album, as well as a "CustomCube" ice maker -- though we're guessing there's probably a strict limit to its customization (meaning we'll have to keep carving out our Engadget "e" ice cubes by hand). While the folks at Electronic House are sayin' that this $3,600 appliance won't be available until next year, it looks like there's plenty of retailers listing it as in stock.[Via CE Pro]
