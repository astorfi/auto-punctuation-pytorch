Naturally, there's a trial with the same 30-day restriction in place as on the internet giant's native soil -- after that, Kylie Minogue's home team will need to cough up $9.99 in local currency each month for unlimited streaming. That $10 deal only applies if you sign up before August, after that it takes a cue from kangaroos and, ahem, jumps to $11.99.
