 Remember those five teenage girls fromRavenna, Ohio, who on the eve of April first placed seventeen Mario Bros. inspired question cubes around town? Well,after HAZMAT, the Fire Dept. and the five-O were called in and the dust settled it looked like those little ladies werein for some serious trouble. Though it turns out the town of 12,000's dropping the case against them, the caseprosecutor stating of the squeaky-clean teens he does "not believe that they had any bad or maliciousintentions." Gee, ya think? Sure, we can understand a little why some people who didn't ever play Mario (unlikeEngadget or our readers) might have gotten concerned at the sight of these boxes, but we're just glad that a slightcase of Midwest terrorist hysteria didn't ultimately result in some crazed teenage witch hunt.[Via Joystiq]
