 
Outside of confirming the phone's existence and predicting pre-orders this month, T-Mobile hasn't put out its own official price tag and launch date for the G2 yet, but that's apparently not stopping Best Buy from publishing its own version of upcoming events. Best Buy and Best Buy Mobile are accepting pre-orders for the phone as of today, and will launch the device in stores on October 6th for $199 with a two year contract. That doesn't rule out a higher price or some rebate shenanigans from T-Mobile's own retailing efforts (though $199 is the rumored official pricetag), but it's comforting to know that this phone, the great gray / white / black hope for QWERTY sliders running stock Android, will retail for the industry standard $199 at least somewhere.
