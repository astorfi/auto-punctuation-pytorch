You remember how excited we got when the Atari
Flashback (right) came out last winter (if it's a little before your time, just watch I Love the 70s and get
yourself in the spirit, why don't you?). It looks like someone did something right over there since Atari apparently
shipped over a half a million units (we're just as jaw-dropped as you), so they're busting out the Flashback 2.0, but
this time with that hot 2600-steez wood grain paneling in addition to being loaded up with Asteroids, Breakout,
Centipede, Lunar Lander, Millipede, Missile Command, and Pong (among 30+ others) for about $30. Coming this summer to a
wood-paneled den near you.
