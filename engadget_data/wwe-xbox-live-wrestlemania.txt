 Just in time for this week's WrestleMania XXIX, that goliath of Wrestling Entertainment is setting up shop on Xbox. The service starts today and is available to any fans with an Xbox Live Gold subscription. There's not a lot of detail on what you'll be getting, although you will be able to watch "all" of WWE's pay-per-view events direct from the Microsoft console. You can also put that folding chair down now. Thank you.
