As you'd expect from the Elite moniker, these units are pretty packed with goodies. They're both THX approved, 7.1 channel receivers rated at 130 and 140 Watts per channel, respectively. These are fully HD-ready by any sensible definition of "HD". For your eyes, they can pass 1080p, 24Hz video along their four HDMI 1.3a ports. Upscaling of analog video is handled by a Faroudja DCDi chip for all your digitally-deficient components. For your ears, these receivers handle Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital Plus and DTS-HD Master Audio audio signals. If you can't get enough THX goodness in your theater, these units also have Neural-THX Surround, the latest in audio trickery to get your ears to suspend disbelief. There's the usual gaggle of inputs on these units, on top of which Pioneer has added iPod, XM and Sirius device support.
