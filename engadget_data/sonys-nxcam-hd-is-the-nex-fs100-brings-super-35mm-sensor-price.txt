The NXCAM HD that Sony teased last November is what you're gawking at right now, which is either the pro alternative to the NEX-VG10 or the far-more-affordable PMW-F3, depending on whether you typically tote camcorders or tend to shoot professional film. Either way, $5,850 buys you a Super 35mm sensor that shoots 1080p60 content at up to 28Mbps to SD, Memory Stick (or an optional 128GB SSD) or output uncompressed 4:2:2 footage over HDMI, monitoring the lot on a swiveling 3.5-inch LCD display. The package doesn't include the 18-200mm F3.5-6.3 lens pictured above -- that's an extra $700 on top of the price -- but Sony will throw in that viewfinder tube and shotgun mic. While we all look forward to online availability and some thorough reviews, why not join us after the break for video? Then, scoot on over to F-Stop Academy for the very first footage shot with the unit.
