 Spring is right around the corner, which means it's time for a new home theater system, or at least that's what Panasonic would have you believe. The electronics giant just unveiled pricing of four of its 2013 home theater systems, some of which were announced at CES 2013. They are the SC-HTB770, the SC-HTB370, the SC-HTB70 and the SC-HTB65, and are priced at $399.99, $299.99, $199.99 and $179.99 respectively. Both the SC-HTB70 and SC-HTB65 are standalone bar models while the decidedly more complicated SC-HTB770 and SC-HTB370 systems come complete with luxe stainless mesh speakers.

 All are equipped with wireless or built-in subwoofers and Bluetooth, are compatible with televisions 42 to 65 inches wide and can be wall-mounted or used with TV stands. Strangely, while we were able to find listings for the first three systems on Panasonic's US online store, we could only find the SC-HTB65 over on the UK side. They're all available for pre-order now with a promise of shipping in March, which happens to be, well, this month. Feel free to take a peek at the source links for more details or check out the press release below.

The SC-HTB70 and SC-HTB65 models offer a unique, sleek solid bar design for free and flexible layouts. The SC-HTB65 provides users with two-way placement- by rotating the bar 90 degrees, users can opt for a wall-mount setup or a TV-sized stand. Similarly, the SC-HTB70 allows for four-way, multi-angle positional placement enabling a user to set the speaker to the most suitable angle regardless if it is placed on a top or middle shelf. A built-in sensor automatically detects the bar direction and switches the directional characteristics to suit the layout. With an Anti-Vibration Integrated Subwoofer inside the speaker unit, the SC-HTB70 provides high-quality, clear sound playback in each of its four layouts.   Both the SC-HTB770, which will be available in both black and silver, and SC-HTB370 models sport a luxurious, stainless mesh design that compliments the decor of any room in the home. With a versatile and stylish design, users can choose a modern horizontal layout for a wall-mount setup or TV-sized stand, or detach to create two separate freestanding vertical speakers for a classic tabletop style. In addition, while providing flexibility in layout, the SC-HTB770 features a 3.1-channel speaker for vivid sound localization and crisp and clear sound sensation.
