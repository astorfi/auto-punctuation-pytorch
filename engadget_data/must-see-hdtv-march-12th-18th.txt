   Community After an all-too-long midseason hiatus, everyone's favorite group of community college misfits returns on Thursday. Community has a significant online following that reacted noisily to its sudden disappearance from NBC's schedule a few months ago, although if so many people are watching it, you gotta wonder why the network seems like it's in such a hurry to press the cancel button. Oh yeah, it's NBC, the people that ruined Heroes. (March 15th, NBC, 8PM)  Frozen Planet The latest series from the Discovery/BBC team up that brought you Planet Earth starts airing Stateside Sunday night so queue up the DVR and prepare to be wowed by nature. As usual, there is a downside -- the British narration by Sir David Attenborough is not in place for the US audiences, swapped out for Alec Baldwin. Check after the break for a quick preview clip featuring the underwater "Icy Finger of Death" and a standard trailer. (March 18th, Discovery, 8PM)  March Madness College hoops will be in effect all week on CBS and various Turner owned networks, with the 68-team tournament kicking off Tuesday night and continuing through three weekends of single elimination ball. Kentucky is the clear favorite to take it all, but with an odd mix of young/talented and older/experienced teams, this could be anyone's year. (All Week, CBS, TNT, TBS, TruTV)
