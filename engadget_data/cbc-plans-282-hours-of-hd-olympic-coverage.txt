 Our friends in the Great White North can expect some great HD coverage of this summer's Olympic games, as the CBC recently laid out its broadcast schedule, planning 282 hours of high definition coverage, while TSN promises 150 hours of HD coverage. CBC will also throw in 400 hours of SD coverage, which, may not equal NBC's numbers, but anyone who's viewed both can tell you without a doubt their presentation has trumped NBC's in its ability to satisfy sports fans (with the exception of their curling obsession during the Winter Olympics) with live action for many years. Online streaming of 1,500 hours of event coverage including live events will also be available, so we don't expect Canadians will miss a minute of the action from Beijing.
