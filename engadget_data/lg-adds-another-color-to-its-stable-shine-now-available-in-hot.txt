 Is it possible that we could have too much of a good thing? LG is gambling that we can't, especially when it comes to their Black Label Shine handsets. With many phones coming in a plethora of colors, why not add another? Hot Pink is the next pigment of choice for LG, and it will be an exclusive for Orange (the carrier, not the color) starting at the end of this month.  Just in case the specs have slipped your mind, we'll give you a quick refresh -- Triband GSM radio, 2 megapixel shooter with autofocus, expandable memory via microSD, Bluetooth, and a MP3 player. The Hot Pink Shine should be free on contracts with plans starting at $60.00 or higher.
