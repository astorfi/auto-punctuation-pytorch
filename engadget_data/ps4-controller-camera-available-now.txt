November 15th is still a ways off, but if you pre-ordered accessories along with your PlayStation 4 you could get a taste of the future right now. NeoGAF's ever-vigilant community noticed that some who've pre-ordered peripherals at Amazon and GameStop are already playing with the DualShock 4 controller and PlayStation 4 camera, posting their spoils to YouTube. While you can't do much with either yet, at least PS3 owners can use the new controller with certain games -- the familiarity might give them a leg up in Killzone Shadow Fall come launch day.
