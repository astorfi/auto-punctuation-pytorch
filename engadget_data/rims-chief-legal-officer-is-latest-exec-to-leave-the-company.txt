 The trickle of departures from RIM may turn into a flood in the coming weeks if recent reports are to be believed, but things aren't staying at a standstill in the interim. The company's Chief Legal Officer Karima Bawa has today become the latest top executive to leave the BlackBerry-maker, ending a career with the company that began way back in 2000. That follows last week's departure of another longtime company vet, global sales head Patrick Spence, although Bawa is said to simply be retiring, not moving to another company. According to RIM, Bawa will also stay on to help with the hiring and training of her replacement.
