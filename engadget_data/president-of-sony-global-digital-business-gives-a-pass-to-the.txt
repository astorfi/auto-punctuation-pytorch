We take issue with NPR's presentation of the latest money quote in the
Sony-DRMed-CD-rootkit drama, but there's no
denying what one Thomas Hesse (President of Sony's Global Digital Business) had to say on the topic: "Most people, I
think, don't even know what a rootkit is, so why should they care about it?" Granted, listening to the NPR clip one
doesn't know how out of context this quote was taken (or how much was lost in translation, as from what we understand
Hesse a native German speaker), but no matter how you cut it, this is a less than desirable sound byte to be floating
around out there right now. C'mon Sony, what's the first thing you do when you find yourself in a hole?
