 Ready to hear about some mid-range Fujifilm point-and-shoots? Let's do this. The FinePix XP200 looks like the more exciting model of the bunch, so we'll start there. Available with red, purple, yellow, green, blue and orange glossy finishes, this ruggedized camera packs a 16-megapixel CMOS sensor with image stabilization, a 28-140mm lens, 3-inch, 920k-dot LCD, a 10-frames-per-second continuous shooting mode, 1080/60i video and built-in WiFi for pushing pics to a companion app. It's a ruggedized cam, so that means it's waterproof to 50 feet, freezeproof to 14 degrees Fahrenheit (-10°C) and shockproof to 6.6-foot drops.

 The other flavor is a superzoom model, or a "bridge camera," as manufacturers are calling them these days. The lens is the focus here, and this one's got a 24-1,056mm, 44x optic with a maximum aperture range of f/2.9 to f/6.5. There's also optical image stabilization and a Super Macro mode that lets you shoot subjects that are just 0.39 inch from the lens. There's a 16-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor, sensitivity through ISO 12,800, 1080/60i video capture, a 10 fps continuous shooting mode and WiFi. You can preview images on the 3-inch, 460k-dot LCD or the 201k-dot electronic viewfinder. This model, the FinePix S8400W, comes in black and ships in May for $350. The XP200 will also ship in May, priced at $300. Read up on both in the PR after the break.
