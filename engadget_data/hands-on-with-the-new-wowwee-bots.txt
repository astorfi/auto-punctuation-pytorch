The RS2 still needs a little polish, as the "head" camera was just a digicam in aseparate box hardwired to the bot, but the chest-mounted display impressed us considering its diminutive size. Evencooler was the new media/programming software, which allows for endless configuration and actually lets you preview ananimated RS2 acting out the commands you want to download to the real deal. Roboreptile felt a little unfinished too,but we liked it's three levels of aggression and the fact that you can satiate it with "food" or by coveringits head with a cowl. Guess we'll have to wait to play with the P-Bot until we see it at T'R'U. More images after thejump...
