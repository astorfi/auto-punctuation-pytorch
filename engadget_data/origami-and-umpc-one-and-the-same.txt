Of interest though, is that Intel has wheeled-out their own teaser campaign over atwww.umpc.com which is equally non-informative but does end with “Ultra Mobile PC March 7,2006” – just prior to CeBIT folks, or two days before Origami is set to roll. Now we already heard thatIntel was ahead of schedule with the UMPC platform with devices from Samsung, Asus andFounder on their way before the end of March. So, put two-and-two together and Origami could well be a gen1 PentiumM-based UMPC sporting XP and integrated EV-DO or HSDPA wireless connectivity, GPS, and up to one week standby. Or not.Hey, we're just speculating like anyone else, and we never were really any good at math. Wait, is that an origami birdin the upper-right quad of that picture?[Via GottaBeMobile, Thanksbradford]Update: Thanks to astute Engadget reader Jason for pointing out that the HTMLsource for the Origami Project site now includes the phrase"Origami Project: the Mobile PC running Windows XP," which  was apparently added as part of the"Week 2" tease. Certainly seems to jibe with everything else we've heard.
