 First Blu-ray chipset to nab the DivX HD Certified stamp of approval? That'd be Panasonic's UniPhier SoC (specifically model #MN2WS0043DA, oddly enough not the MN2WS006 sample that claimed DivX HD support in May, but who's counting?), now thoroughly tested and promised to be compatible with all manner of videos using the codec in resolutions up to 1080p. Expect a renewed flood of DivX HD-compatible devices to hit...any minute now.
