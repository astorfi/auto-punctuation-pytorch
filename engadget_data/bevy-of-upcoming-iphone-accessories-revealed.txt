As we might expect this early in the game, the goodies are strictly standard fare -- cases, FM transmitters, and the like -- though Belkin's Acrylic Case (pictured) looks like a winner thanks to its ability to support the iPhone on it side for more relaxed widescreen video viewing. Another gem is Crystal Film, which'll cover the entire front of the device with a thin, transparent static cling layer; good idea from a protection standpoint, but we can't help but wonder how that's gonna affect the feel of the screen.
