Last we heard, Amazon was gearing up to launch its own set-top box to compete against the likes of Roku and Apple TV. Today, sources told the Wall Street Journal (anonymously, of course) that the company is eying a holiday launch, but the most interesting news concerns the kind of content the box will provide. Instead of being a mere vehicle for Amazon's services, like Prime, the box will feature third-party streaming applications, according to the WSJ's sources. Supposedly, the company has approached developers with the opportunity to design media apps and games specifically for the unnamed device, which, rumor has it, is codenamed Cinnamon. Providing a varied repertoire of content would surely be the smart move to make Amazon's offering competitive, so although the news is fresh, it isn't terribly surprising. While details are still sparse at the moment, we'll be sure to update you once new ones roll in.
