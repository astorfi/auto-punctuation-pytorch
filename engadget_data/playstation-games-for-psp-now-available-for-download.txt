Today, Sony Computer Entertainment America announced five titles that will play nicely on your PSP -- they include "Cool Boarders," "Crash Bandicoot," "Hot Shots Golf 2," "Syphon Filter," and "Tekken 2" -- however, Sony added in a press release that future titles would be made available later this month. These games will set you back a Washington and a Lincoln (that's $6, folks), but have to be purchased through the PlayStation store on the PS3, which probably is a bit frustrating if you already own a PSP but were sensible enough to avoid the PS3 insanity. Now if you'll excuse us, we have a grudge match to settle between Law and Yoshimitsu.
