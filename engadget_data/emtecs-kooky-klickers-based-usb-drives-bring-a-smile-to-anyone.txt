We know, life's a little rough right now, but how on Earth can you look at the bunch pictured above and not crack at least a smidgen of a grin? Based on the insanely popular Kooky Klickers brand, the Kooky USB Drives are modeled after the widely recognized character pens and are being pushed by EMTEC. Curiously, there's no mention at all of a price, and odder still, not a peep on capacity choices; in other words, you should be fully prepared to pay too much for too little when your kid starts to wailing.
