 The third installment of the Fast & the Furious movie franchise is finally on store shelves in HD DVD format so we can stop posting about it right? Not quite, as it's the first 30GB/9GB HD DVD/DVD combo disc, and includes HDi features at level we haven't seen before. The reviewer at High Def Digest has nothing but praise for the 1080p VC-1 transfer, with all the fast moving cars, CGI and loud colors it manages to keep up without any issues. The soundtrack isn't Dolby TrueHD but it also earns kudos for high quality.. The most interesting aspect of this release is the U-Control interface, surpassing any IME features we've seen so far. The viewer can access extras like director commentary, car information, and insurance damage estimates at any time while the movie continues to play. Some might be worried this is all too complicated, when all they want to do is sit back and watch fast cars, but the review says it's got a very simple learning curve. This could be the start of real next generation home theater experiences...or just another menu to skip during a quick rental of a popcorn flick.
