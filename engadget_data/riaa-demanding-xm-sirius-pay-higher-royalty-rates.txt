 In the unceasing feud between the RIAA and satellite radio, the agency has rekindled the fire by encouraging the FCC to "require the merged companies to pay higher royalty rates to the record industry." Reportedly, the RIAA argued that the firms were "no longer new, struggling companies that could get away with paying below-market rates," and further salted the wound by insisting that the FCC "make clear that its approval of a merger was conditioned upon the continued protection of sound recordings from unlawful infringement." Of course, a number of senators have already voiced their concern for more limitations on satellite radio streams, but unsurprisingly, it seems like the RIAA wants these lofty wishes to become reality (and in a hurry).
