First up is what appears to be a DTV-ified LG Lotus clamshell -- a phone first introduced in 2008 but now capable of extracting digital TV from the aether with an assist from that telescoping antenna. Also set for a CES launch is that DP570MH portable DVD player that lets viewers watch up to 4-hours of ATSC-approved Mobile DTV broadcasts before heading back for a charge. LG's also promising more ATSC Mobile DTV devices from Dell (laptops), Kenwood, and others including in-car receivers all using LG's LG2160A ATSC-M/H tuner chip. Still, mobile antennas and DVD players... how can something so new feel so retro?
