Near the end of 2010, a group of telecommunications and commerce businesses joined forces to form a mobile payment venture called Isis. It was a solid brand name: Short, simple and easy to remember. Unfortunately, ISIS is now associated with a militant group based in the Middle East, so the wireless company believes a branding tweak makes sense. In a blog post, CEO Michael Abbott explained: "However coincidental, we have no interest in sharing a name with a group whose name has become synonymous with violence and our hearts go out to those who are suffering. As a company, we have made the decision to rebrand." Abbott didn't announce what the new brand would be -- we imagine that he's working on that as we speak -- but mentioned that he'd have more information to share in the coming months.
