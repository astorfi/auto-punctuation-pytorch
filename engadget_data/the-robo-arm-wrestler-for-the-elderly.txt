The Robo Arm Wrestler is a big step up over
the last version we hit. This wrastlin' bot automatically
adjusts its strength and even considers the "attitude, will, and tenacity" of the pitiful human competition in deciding
who wins this ultimate act of Hawk vs. Bull machismo. And apparently like all robotic projects seeking funds in Asia,
it's designed so the elderly
can "keep up their physical and mental health." We can see grandma now: ball cap turned back, leaning in low fixing her
eyes to the LCD before throwing down expletives in a sinewy explosion of wrist-shattering osteoporotic rage ala
geriatric Over The Top.
