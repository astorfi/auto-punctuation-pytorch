The eDimensional Access Controller enables one-handed gaming in a completely modular design. Each control function module can be rearranged based on the gamer's needs -- even the act of rearranging of modules can be done with one hand. Ben, the nice guy that he is, also includes a custom module-creation guide if you're so inclined. The controller is also designed with a concave back to sit comfortably on either a table or leg and uses 2.4GHz wireless. eDimensional is taking preorders now, and the unit is compatible with PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PC. To top it all off, a portion of the $129.99 you spend will go to Children's Hospital and Veterans Medical centers. We feel all good inside.
