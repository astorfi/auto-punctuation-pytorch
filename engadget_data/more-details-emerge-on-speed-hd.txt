 Those who can already smell the rubber burning are probably antsy to see SPEED finally go HD in February, and while there's still a few weeks left until the channel serves up 100 hours of NASCAR coverage in high-definition, here's a few more details to tide you over. Starting on the 7th of next month, the channel will be covering the Gatorade Duel 150s, the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race, NASCAR RaceDay and loads more surrounding the 50th anniversary of the Daytona 500. Additionally, it's aiming to bring other (read: non-live events) programming to high-definition as well, and according to SPEED's senior VP of production and network operations Rick Miner, the channel will be "transitioning all of its event programming to HD" over the course of the 2008 season. Oh, and just in case that wasn't enough for you gearheads, expect an all new interactive website to launch alongside the HD network, too.
