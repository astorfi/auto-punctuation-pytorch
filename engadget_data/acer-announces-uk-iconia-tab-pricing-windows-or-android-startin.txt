The WiFi-only versions of both the Windows 7-based Iconia Tab W500 and Android-based A500 will demand £449 apiece (or about $720) when they launch in the UK on April 8th, while the 3G-equipped W500 will set you back £529, or roughly $850 -- there's curiously no pricing for the 3G version of the A500 at the moment. Also available at the same time is a keyboard dock that will set you back £90 on its own or £529 in a bundle, and you can look for the smaller 7-inch A100 and W100 models to follow in May, or possibly later -- apparently with €349 price tag, if recent retailer pricing is any indication.
