Kyoto's premiere gaming outfit still isn't present on the TGS show floor, but Capcom has once again seen fit to trot out the firm's latest kit: The Circle Pad Pro for 3DS XL. Just like last year's model, this beefy cradle puts the already large 3DS XL outside the realm of pocket-ability, trading the handheld's slim profile for a luxuriously thick grip. Indeed, the fatty accessory makes the console quite comfortable to hold, adding a smooth, slightly contoured back, larger shoulder buttons and, of course, that all important starboard analog pad.

 The new Circle Pad's bulk is slightly more forgivable for the size of its host device. Yes, the attachment makes the XL a bit more unwieldily, but its supersized form already made it a non-contender for most pants pockets. Sadly, the accessory still sports its predecessor's greatest fault: it blocks the 3DS' cartridge slot. Gamers will have to get used to undocking their console, or else make a habit of buying more downloadable titles. Mum's still the word on pricing and availability, but the accessory was shown with a copy of Monster Hunter 4, which is due out in March of next year. We wouldn't be surprised to see it show up in early spring. Hungry for more? Check out our gallery below for an eyeful, or peek past the break for quick video overview.
