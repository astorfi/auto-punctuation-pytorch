 
 Amazon made its first push into in-house game development this summer with the launch of Amazon Game Studios and its first title, the Facebook-bound Living Classics, and its now made its second big move. The company announced today that its first mobile game, Air Patriots, is now available for iOS, Android and Kindle Fire devices (and free on each, albeit with in-app purchases). Not surprisingly, Amazon has paid particular attention to the Kindle Fire version, taking advantage of GameCircle to track achievements and high scores, as well as Whispersync to let you save your progress on one device and pick up where you left off on another. As for the game itself, Amazon says it's a "new kind of tower defense game," with players drawing a path for the planes to fend off the oncoming tanks. Head on past the break for a quick video.

 Update: As some commenters have pointed out, while the game supports a variety of Android devices, it looks like the Nexus 7 isn't among them.

   SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 1, 2012-- (NASDAQ:AMZN) – Following the release of Amazon's first-ever social game, Living Classics, Amazon Game Studios today announced the availability of "Air Patriots," its first-ever game for mobile devices. The game is available now for Kindle Fire, Android devices, iPhone, iPad, and is free to all customers. Learn more at games.amazon.com.

   Air Patriots is a new kind of tower defense game with fun and unique gameplay requiring strategic positioning of an arsenal of planes to push back an enemy tank invasion. In Air Patriots, players directly control a squadron of military planes by using their finger to draw the paths the planes will follow in order to engage the enemy. Unlike other tower defense games where defense bases are stationary, in Air Patriots players can adjust their strategy on the fly. Simply draw a new flight path for your planes, and you redeploy firepower to where it is needed most.

   "When we created Air Patriots we wanted to make a game that was easy and engaging, and the simplicity of drawing paths for planes was something we thought would appeal to players," said Ernie Ramirez, Executive Producer at Amazon Game Studios. "We think customers will find Air Patriots both familiar and fresh, with a degree of challenge that keeps them engaged and enthused to play more. We are very excited to bring Amazon customers Air Patriots today, and Amazon Game Studios looks forward to bringing our fans even more great games in the future."

   Air Patriots uses Amazon GameCircle on Kindle Fire to track both achievements and high scores, allowing players to compete for strategic superiority. Air Patriots also supports Whispersync for games to ensure that progress is saved in the cloud whether it's played on the Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD. Players can even switch back and forth between multiple Kindle devices as they continue their quest to eliminate the enemy.

   Available today as a free download on Amazon Appstore for Android, Google Play, and Apple's App Store. Air Patriots boasts rich visuals for HD compatible devices, including Kindle Fire HD.
