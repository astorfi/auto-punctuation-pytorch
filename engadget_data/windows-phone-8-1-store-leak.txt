Windows Phone 8.1 may not just add a bevy of software features -- it may improve how you find software, too. WPCentral claims to have leaked details of a Windows Phone Store revamp in the OS that reportedly makes it easier to discover hot apps. Featured titles would take center stage in this new portal, and new sections would help you sift through fast-rising apps or specific categories. Upgrades could soon be less of hassle, for that matter. A new My Apps area would let you check for updates without waiting for notifications, and you could (finally!) tell Windows Phone to update apps automatically. There's no certainty that this storefront will make it into the final WP8.1 release, but you won't have to wait long for confirmation.
