Said firm owns several chains of electronics stores in Japan, and reportedly, it's allowing customers who purchased one of seven HD DVD players to return them for Blu-ray decks. Apparently, it's allowing them to put the purchase price of the HD DVD unit towards the Blu-ray player, and if their player was somehow more expensive than the BD player they're eying, a refund for the difference will actually be doled out. We'll be honest -- this does seem a bit too good to be true, but we are hearing that the courtesy expires at the end of March. 'Tis a shame this will never happen on this side of the world.
