Pebble was one of the first smartwatch makers to find success (it chalked up its millionth sale late last year), but there's no question that it's facing a lot of pressure. Between Android Wear and the impending Apple Watch, it's not clear that inexpensive e-paper watches have a healthy future. However, the fledgling wearable firm thinks it has a couple of aces up its sleeve. The company's Eric Migicovsky tells The Verge that 2015 Pebble watches will use a new interface "framework" (designed by the former webOS TV team) that gets away from the more app-centric models you see from Apple and Google. Apps will still play an important role -- they just won't be the centerpiece.



          
 
 
 As for the watches themselves? You'll have to wait a while to see those, unfortunately, and it's not clear where the company is headed in terms of overall design. Pebble's focus so far has been on simple, long-lasting smartwatches that undercut the competition. However, its biggest rivals are increasingly betting on more expensive models with touchscreens, health sensors and other special tricks -- the question is whether or not Pebble will stay in the budget realm or go upscale to fight these challengers on their own turf.
