It's easy to build your own camera if you're determined to capture images on the cheap; it's another matter if you want something just slightly more refined. If that's the case, Lomography has you covered with its new Konstruktor kit. The pack gives DIY types everything they need to build their own 35mm film SLR, including a removable 50mm f/10 lens and customizable panels. There's no control over aperture or shutter speed, but Lomography's retro-inclined crowd will like the quick toggle for long exposure shots. They'll also like the $35 price -- it's possible to buy 100 Konstructors before matching the cost of just one EOS 5D Mark III. Should that kind of math be too much to resist, you'll be glad to hear that the camera is already on sale at Lomography's shop.
