After a couple years of careful planning, the inaugural Formula E season is set to hit the track this weekend. Tomorrow's race is set for 3:30 AM ET in Beijing on a circuit that's laid out on around the iconic Bird's Nest venue from the 2008 Olympics. Anxious at-home spectators in the US can catch the action on Fox Sports 1 while UK viewers can tune in via ITV4. The Spark-Renault cars carry McLaren 200kW electric motors, systems and transmissions that equate to 0-60 MPH (0-100 km/h) in three seconds with a top speed of 150 MPH (225 km/h). During the first season, the 10-race schedule features stops in the States, Argentina and Monaco before wrapping up with the London ePrix in June 2015.


Update: Qualifying is over, and e.dams-Renault driver Nicolas Prost has snagged the first-ever Formula E pole with a 1.42.200 lap around the Beijing circuit.
