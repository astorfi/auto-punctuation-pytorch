As we suspected might be the case, he claims he'd been referring to the fact that he'd heard rumors of a Dell phone -- you know, the same rumors we've all been hearing -- and was simply commenting on that fact. Either that, or there's a Dell smartphone running some futuristic S60 / Android hybrid in his pocket as we speak... one of the two.
