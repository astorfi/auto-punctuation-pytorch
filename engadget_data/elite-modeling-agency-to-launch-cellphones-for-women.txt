Paris has to be growing tired of that
Sidekick that got her in all
that trouble, right? Yeah, well Elite (as in the modeling agency) is on the job, they've just announced that
they're launching a cellphone line-up designed for "women who live for fashion." It seems that Elite has signed on with
ModeLabs design house for a collection of couture cellphones and accessories sure to hock-up great
pink and
glitter gobs of celebrolust in the likes of Paris
and Jessica. No pics of what the phones'll look like, but expect 'em to be priced like mink in December when they drop
in Q1 naught-six.
