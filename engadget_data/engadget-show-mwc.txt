 That's right, we went to Barcelona, so you don't have to. Join the Engadget team halfway across the world for a very special mini-episode of the Engadget Show, where we take you to center stage for the year's biggest mobile event. Back in January at CES, we bemoaned the lack of smartphone releases -- did those companies make up for lost time this year in Spain? Or will the trend toward single product events continue to rob the bigger shows of their highlights?

 We'll take you around the floor to show off some of our favorite MWC products like the HP Slate 7, ZTE Grand Memo and, of course, that GPS cane. We'll also be speaking to top execs like Nokia's Stephen Elop and Stephen Sneeden of Sony. Join us after the break for all the Mobile World Congress action you could ever possibly need (or at least as much as we could cram into a 16-minute serving).



 
 Hosts: Michael Gorman, Mat Smith, Myriam Joire, Darren Murph, Joseph Volpe, Dana Wollman, Terrence O'Brien, Sean Cooper and Sharif Sakr Guests: Stephen Elop, Stephen Sneeden Producer: Benjamin Ahr Harrison Executive Producer: Brian Heater
