Although we're looking to September 8th as the official launch date of the LTE-equipped wunderphone, Verizon's teaser page just went live, reminding us of the phone's impending arrival. Will we find 1GB of RAM and a 1GHz dual-core TI OMAP 4430 under the hood, or did the company figure out how play nicely with the Tegra 2? Verizon's happy to take your email address and let you know the juicy details in due time, although we're certainly hoping to beat Big Red to the punch.
