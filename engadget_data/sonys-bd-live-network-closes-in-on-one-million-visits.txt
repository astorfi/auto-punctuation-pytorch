According to the Sony VP of new business development Rich Marty, the studio's BD-Live network is just about to reach one million visits worldwide since launching Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story back in April. At first glance, it's easy to assume that one million hits is a lot, but without a real benchmark to go by, it's hard to accurately judge the impressiveness of the milestone. At any rate, we're glad to see that BD-Live isn't being implemented in vain, and we have all ideas the interactive chat with The Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan will likely set the all all-time record for simultaneous BD-Live logins. Speaking of, will you be there?
