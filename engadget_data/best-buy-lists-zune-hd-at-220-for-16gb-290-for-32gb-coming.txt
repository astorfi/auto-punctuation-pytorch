Retailers don't necessarily have the best track record for release dates or pricing, and while Best Buy's inventory pricing is in fact notoriously wrong prior to release, it's usually way high. As for the date, it certainly falls within the Fall 2009 window we've heard before, but if it's really less than a month away, rest assured Microsoft will be flexing some advertising muscle in the not-too-distant future.Update: Looks like Amazon now has its listing up as well, albeit a non-functional one.
