The small and sexy Sirius S50 had so much
going for it: a claimed 50 hours of audio storage, scheduled digital recordings, and some sweet looks. Unfortunately it
seems to have been cut down in the prime of life by an
overbearing RIAA that has limited the player to 20
scheduled recordings, each a maximum length of two hours. They also cut out scheduling for music recordings, which
aren't allowed to be grouped together, i.e. one song per recording. This puts the $360 player's capabilities, as far as
music recordings go, a bit lower than the level of a cassette tape. You of course can load your own MP3s on to it, but
you're going to be hard pressed to get 50 hours of Sirius content on here.
