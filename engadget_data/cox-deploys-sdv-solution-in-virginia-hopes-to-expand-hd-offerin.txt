 Those following the inner workings of Cox Communications ought not be too terribly surprised here, but the company has reportedly selected BigBand Networks to provide a switched digital video solution. Better still, the cable operator also announced that it has "begun to deploy the solution in its Northern Virginia market." James Kelso, vice president of video engineering for Cox, was quoted as saying that "BigBand's SDV solution gives us the ability to dramatically expand programming -- particularly high-definition channels -- at a low cost-per-subscriber." Regrettably, there's no mention of what other locales can look forward to SDV next, and while Cox doesn't exactly say what new HD channels we can expect to see utilizing this newfound bandwidth, we'll be waiting in tense anticipation.[Via MultiChannel]
