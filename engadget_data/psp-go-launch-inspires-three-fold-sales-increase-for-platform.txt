Nevertheless, it has generated a rather sizeable boost in interest for the PSP platform as a whole, with Sony saying that sales for all PSPs are up 300 percent over the week before the console launched. It's easy to see why, given the buzz surrounding the new iteration of the hardware as well as the hugely anticipated Gran Turismo finally coming to fruition. What we don't know is how many of those new sales were of the Go and how many were of the existing PSP-3000, a stat that would have shown whether indeed the "aspirational" new system would inspire some to just go ahead and buy the old system instead. We know which we would choose, how about you?[Via gamesindustry.biz]
