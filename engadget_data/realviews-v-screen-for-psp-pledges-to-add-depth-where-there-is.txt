So, the V-Screen from RealView already has one strike against it, since it looks larger even than the console itself. That it promises to do something impossible is a second strike, saying it can create "a fully 3 dimensional experience from the PSP screen" -- supposedly making all of your 2D games played on a 2D screen appear 3D. To us it looks a high-end version of those magnifying glasses we used to stick on our green, postage stamp Game Boy screens back in the day, and while we expect it to be just as effective, we'll reserve full judgment until the thing releases this fall and some reviews trickle in. That said, it doesn't look to be PSPgo compatible, and that could be the third strike right there. [Via Joystiq]
