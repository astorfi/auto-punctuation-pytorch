pretty ridiculous already, there's just very little reason for using an
8 megapixel CCD to capture the level of image data coming
through those cheap consumer optics, along with a scarcity of light available to each pixel in such a small CCD sensor.
Wait, excuse us, did we say 8 megapixels? We meant to say 10. That's right, megapixel excess moves onward and upward as
Sharp has unveiled a new 10 megapixel CCD for consumer cameras. The linked article has some good analysis as to why
exactly we're seeing this "progress" in resolution, along with this little tidbit: Sharp's new CCD has 38 square
millimeters for sensors, while a full-frame camera like the
Canon 1DS Mark II rocks nearly 864
square millimeters of CCD real estate.
