 
Ah yes, the Engadget Awards! All the glitz and glamor of the Oscars, but without all that Best Acting stuff -- only technical achievements here, people -- the most interesting, innovative, feature-rich gadgets 2005 had to offer. Thousands of readers cast their votes for the Readers' Choice, and we also selected our picks for each of the 26 categories we're giving awards for. As always, we ask the winners to please keep their acceptance speeches brief or they'll be played off, and to keep those Engadget Awards trophies polished to a high shine forever more.Without further ado, click on to see the winners!
