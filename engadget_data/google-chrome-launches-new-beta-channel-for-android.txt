 Google's announced a new Chrome Beta channel for its phone and tablet iteration. Google's desktop browser (on Mac Windows, Linux and Chrome OS) already has early access channels to new (and sometimes unstable) builds and now it's going mobile. Google promises updates, likely just as regular as the big screen version, and it'll be compatible with any Android device running version 4.0 or higher. Point your browser to the second source to sign up to the new dev channel.
