 Yes, that light pink rectangle you're looking at is an official shot of the Pink Zune, in all its magnenta-ish glory. We all knew it was coming -- and we've seen the rather more garish 100-unit hot pink Zune before -- so this isn't exactly the biggest news 'round these parts. No, if Microsoft really wanted to impress us, they'd take their minds off planning a targeted, 100,000 unit production run of pink cases and set their mind to really fixing the Zune. One of the fixes is sorta down already, but there's at least four more things that we think need to change in order for the social to get more members. Last time we checked, a Zune in a lighter shade of pink wasn't one of them, and neither was one in red.
