Don't get us wrong, it looks a little slicker, but the i760's attraction is more likely to lie the hardware itself -- not the ultra-mild update to the Pocket PC Phone Edition guts we've loved (and hated) for the past couple years. We expect this thing to hit Verizon stores before the first half of the year is out, but with Verizon, Samsung, and Microsoft all potentially weak links in the delivery chain, we're having a bugger of a time staying positive. Don't let us down, folks![Thanks, anonymous tipster]
Samsung i760 for Verizon
