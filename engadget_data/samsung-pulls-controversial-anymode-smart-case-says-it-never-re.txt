In a blog post published today, the company responded to allegations that it tried to market a Cupertino rip-off, claiming that the accessory never received official "Designed for Samsung Mobile" certification. Samsung went on to point out that none of the cases have actually been sold, while confirming that it's "working with Anymode to address this oversight." In the meantime, the contentious Smart Case has been removed from Samsung's Anymode's site, meaning we can finally return to leading healthy, productive lives.
