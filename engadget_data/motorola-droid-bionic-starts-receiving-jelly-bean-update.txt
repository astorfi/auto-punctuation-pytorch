 There's no question that the Droid Bionic has had a rough life between long delays, a more popular cousin and slow updates. Both Motorola and Verizon may be making up for lost time, however -- starting today, they're pushing an Android 4.1 Jelly Bean update for the erstwhile flagship. The core updates will be familiar to anyone with a late 2012 Motorola phone, including Google Now and rich notifications. There are a few Droid Bionic-specific tweaks, including better data connectivity as well as removals of the preloaded Sling and (no longer relevant) MOG apps. A software update can't erase any bitter memories, but it does show that the short-lived leader is getting long-term affection.  [Thanks, Jared]
