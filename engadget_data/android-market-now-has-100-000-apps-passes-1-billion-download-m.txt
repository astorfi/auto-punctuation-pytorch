It's also interesting to note that it took just under three months to get from 50,000 to the 100,000 mark. An even more impressive number, however, is the fact that over one billion applications have been downloaded. While it's not clear if this number includes app updates or not, the number is massive either way, and they're growing pretty steeply each month. AndroLib's data also notes that over 14,000 applications became available during the month of June, and over 10,000 have appeared already in July. Hit up the source links for more stats, and a chance to see the numbers update in real time.

Update: By Google's official count, they've only just passed 70,000; this isn't the first time AndroLib and Google have had different numbers, so we're figuring the discrepancy might be thanks to the international Markets. More on this as we get it.
