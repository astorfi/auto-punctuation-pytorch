There's no arguing that bigger is better, so now that projectors are cheaper and brighter than ever there's less of a reason to opt for anything else. But there you sit, staring at your puny 50- or 60-inch plasma, LCD or rear projection unit pretending that it's actually getting the job done. Explain the reasoning to us below because frankly we just don't get it.
