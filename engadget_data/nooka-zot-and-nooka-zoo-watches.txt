In the ongoing effort to further complicate the simple act of telling
time, we bring you the Nooka line of watches (definitely not to be confused with Nokia).  The Nooka Zot uses dots
to show hours and a progress bar to show minutes, while the Nooka Zoo uses a LCD for hours and a progress bar for
minutes.  They're pretty styley with thick wristbands that are all the rage these days.  No release date or
pricing information is available just yet.  In the meantime, just keep chanting, "Nooka Zot, Nooka Zoo; 
Nooka Zot, Nooka Zoo…"
