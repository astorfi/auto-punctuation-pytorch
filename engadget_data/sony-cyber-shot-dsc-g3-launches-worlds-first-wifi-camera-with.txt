Thanks to the all-admitting FCC, we already had a good idea that this was coming, but now that it's finally here, we're still pretty jazzed. Set to rival Panny's Lumix DMC-TZ50, the DLNA-certified Cyber-shot DSC-G3 is the planet's first WiFi camera with a built-in web browser, enabling users to upload images and video directly to popular sharing sites wherever a WiFi connection is available. Of note, the camera comes with complimentary access to Sony's Easy Upload Home Page via AT&T WiFi, which provides easy entrance into Shutterfly, Picasa, YouTube, Photobucket and Dailymotion. Other specs include a 10 megapixel sensor, 4x optical zoom and Face Detection. It's yours to grab right now for around $500.
