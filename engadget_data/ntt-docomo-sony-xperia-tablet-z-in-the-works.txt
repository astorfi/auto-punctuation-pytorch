 Sony had no shortage of devices to show off at CES last week, but there might be more on the way -- before Mobile World Congress has even begun. NTT DoCoMo has let slip that it'll be showing off an "Xperia Tablet Z" alongside the previously announced Xperia Z at a preview event next week. The page in question has already been pulled, and may only be an announcement mishap -- if there was an L in there, we'd reconsider -- however, it's highly likely the phone network knows exactly what's in store from the electronics maker. We've also heard from our sources that Sony's new Exmor RS camera sensor will make its way into a new tablet, although the exact sensor specifications are likely to be different from the 2013 Xperia devices seen at CES. A slightly suspicious spec list has also found its way on to Twitter, suggesting a familiar 10.1-inch form factor and a 1.5GHz quad-core processor, but we're waiting to hear more directly from the Japanese carrier (or perhaps Sony) sometime next week.
