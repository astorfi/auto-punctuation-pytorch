The two pictures of the unsurprisingly white device (one shown after the break) fail to reveal any ports or connections whatsoever, but "sources" over at ThinkSecret are suggesting that a charging port will indeed be included to give iPhone dock purchasers a single base to juice up their mobile and headset. Not too many details beyond that just yet, but don't expect such a useful hunk of plastic to run you cheap when it lands.[Via Think Secret]
