In keeping with its propensity toward acronymed products, Mad Catz today showed off its F.R.E.Q. 4D headphones. The peripherals are notable for a couple of reasons: first is that the company dumped the line's mic arm for an internal version -- without, the company promises, sacrificing sound quality. Even more notable are the included ViviTouch actuators, which bring rumbling feedback directly to your ears, so you can feel those explosions where it really counts.


We tried the headphones on, and while they were pretty comfortable, we can't say that we were particularly impressed with the promised rumbling delivered via a bass test. Perhaps it was the sound being used -- or that the headphones are still in beta -- but ultimately we didn't feel all that much. We're sure Mad Catz will have that figured out for the final version -- if not, however, they may just serve as cool-looking head massagers.
