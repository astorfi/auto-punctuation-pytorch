Based on that illustration above, the 2.62 x 2.62-inch Nike+ SportBand device wedges its way into a bracelet where it communicates with the standard Nike+ shoe adapter. You then insert the USB device into your PC or Mac (presumably) to track your runs. Be sure to peep the actual device in the gallery -- looks like the FCC managed to bust the SportBand's USB connector during their tests. That doesn't bode well for final product now does it?
