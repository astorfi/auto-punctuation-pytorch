 The much-anticipated Batman Begins HD DVD including several HD DVD-exclusive IME (HDi) features will hit store shelves October 10, along with The Polar Express. One consistent complaint about the HD DVD and Blu-ray launches has been the paucity of big, quality titles.This hopefully marks a reversal of that trend and is a sign that studios are also confident in taking advantage of the unique features afforded by the formats. Studios know they have to get things right with their most valuable properties or risk angering millions of fans, now its just up to consumers to show if they're willing to pay the cost for the experience. VideoBusiness expects more details tomorrow including price and features. What this really means is in a month or so we can move on to complaining that Superman and Lord of the Rings aren't out yet but for now, we wait.
