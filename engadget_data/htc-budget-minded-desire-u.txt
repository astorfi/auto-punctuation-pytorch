A price tag is MIA for the Android 4.0-toting and Beats Audio-infused device, but the specs paint a fairly frugal picture for the hardware, which comes in black and white flavors. Behind the handset's 4-inch 800 x 480 (WVGA) display sit a single-core 1GHz processor, 512MB of RAM, 4GB of built-in storage, a microSD slot and a 5-megapixel rear-facing shooter. In terms of connectivity, the device supports 3G, WiFi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0. As of now, there's no word on when it'll hit the streets in China and Taiwan or if a tweaked version with international-friendly radios will make its way to other countries.
