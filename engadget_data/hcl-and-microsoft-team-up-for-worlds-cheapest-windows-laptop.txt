 India's HCL is certainly no stranger to low-cost laptops, and the company is now apparently looking to expand its budget-priced empire even further, with it recently announcing that it's teamed up with Microsoft to roll out what it claims to be the "world's cheapest Windows laptop." While the company isn't exactly saying as much, the new laptop, dubbed the MiLeap H, appears to be a revamped version of the company's MiLeap Y unit, with it boasting the same swiveling 7-inch touchscreen, an unspecified Intel processor and Intel 945 GU Express chipset, 1GB of RAM, a 30GB hard drive, an integrated 1.3 megapixel webcam, built-in WiFi and, of course, Windows XP Home for the OS. No word on a release date just yet, but those in India can expect to pay 17,000 Indian rupees (or about $425) for the laptop.[Via TechWeb/Yahoo! News]
