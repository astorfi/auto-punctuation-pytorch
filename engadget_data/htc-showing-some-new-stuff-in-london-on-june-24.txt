As you might recall, the Touch Diamond was unveiled at a similar event just over a year ago, so it's very likely an important product that's going to be shown; the odds-on favorite would have to be the HTC Hero and its customized Android-based interface, but at this point, it's anybody's guess.Update: Here's an interesting clue -- that's a rose on the dude's chest, as in the Rosie interface. Get it, eh? Eh?
