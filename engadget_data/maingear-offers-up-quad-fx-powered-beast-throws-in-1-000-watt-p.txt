 Aw yeah, just hours (nay, moments) after AMD's Quad FX chip went official, we've already seen one machine ready and willing to satisfy your gaming desires, and now we've found another. Maingear is busting out an Athlon 64 FX-powered BEAST aimed at hardcore (and sufficiently funded) gamers looking for the latest and greatest. The machine is fully customizable (right down to the paintjob), but comes stock with twin FX-70 processors, a 1,000 watt power supply (!), liquid cooling system, 2GB of DDR2 RAM, 250GB SATA hard drive, a paltry 16x DVD-ROM drive, NVIDIA's GeForce 8800GTS 640MB graphics card, 8-channel HD audio, dual gigabit Ethernet, Windows XP Home, and a one-year warranty. While it won't take long to price this bad boy right into the stratosphere, it starts out a hair under $3,900, and should handle just about anything -- at least for the next few months -- without a hitch.
