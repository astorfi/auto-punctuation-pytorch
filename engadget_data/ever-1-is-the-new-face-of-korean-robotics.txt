 If you thought Albert Hubo was the ultimate humanoid robot, wait until you get alook at EveR-1, a new bot making the rounds in Korea. According to reports, the 5-foot, 2-inch EveR-1 was designed toresemble a woman in her early 20s,and is capable of upper-body movement, can distinguish faces via its eye-mountedcameras, and can look into your eyes while conversing through perfectly synced lips. The bot's face can registersimulated emotions, including happiness, anger and sadness, and its skin is made from a silicon gel designed to feellike human skin. She can't walk yet, but we imagine that's only a matter of time. If this is the new face of Korea's army of networked domesticbots, they may just achieve their goal of a bot in every homesooner than we thought.Thanks, HCM
