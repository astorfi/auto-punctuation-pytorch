We'd drone on and on about how the combination of demonstrated motion, trial-and-error, and object motion tracking come together for some "Expectation-Maximization based Reinforcement Learning," but really we just can't stop giggling at all the pancake misses perpetrated by the robot on video, which can be found after the break.
