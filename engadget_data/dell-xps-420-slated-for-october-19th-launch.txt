 
Next up in our week o' Dell scoops, a bit more on the XPS 420. We don't have much more info on specs than before (really, what else could you possibly need know?), but recent Dell docs have the 420 set for release on October 19th. Granted, that shouldn't be considered a final date -- Dell (among other companies) miss their internal launch dates all the time -- so don't be surprise if it's later. Oh, one other new bit: not that it's any surprise, but the 420 will be ready to rumble with DCTs for CableCARD Vista Media Center. A few more shots of the 420 all splayed open after the break.
