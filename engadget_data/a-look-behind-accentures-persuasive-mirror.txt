There's been a lot of buzz on Accenture's "persuasive mirror" — an electronic mirror that digitally
morphs your image to encourage you to make lifestyle changes — but the folks at New Scientist trumped us all and
actually got a look at it. Turns out the mirror builds a lifestyle profile based on feeds from cameras mounted around
your home. Software can tag your habits and feed data to the mirror, allowing it to show you, say, as a dissolute wreck
if you've been hitting the bottle a little too much. Whether the trade-off in privacy (not to mention the inevitable
cost) is worth it to anyone remains to be seen; we can't help but assume that this is one of those "home of the future"
proof-of-concept projects that journalists will groove over for years, but which will never actually make it into any
homes.
