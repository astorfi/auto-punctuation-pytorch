In what seems to now be something of a trend, online music retailer PayPlay.fm is following in the footsteps of Amazon and -- to some extent -- Apple, by retooling its store to only include tracks encoded as DRM-free MP3s. And not just a few MP3s, either, but over 1.3 million individual songs priced at 88 cents apiece; though if you think you'll find your favorite boy band or gangsta rapper here, you're sorely mistaken, as even encryption-hatin' EMI isn't contributing any mainstream acts to this all-indie-fest. Still, if you're down with those obscure, struggling artists whom no one has ever heard of, the new PayPlay may be right up your alley.
