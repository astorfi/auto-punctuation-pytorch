       In yet another installment of "it's about time that went HD", we are kinda excited to announce that for the first time ever, the Indianapolis 500 will be presented in HD this Memorial day. While NASCAR enjoys so much success, -- and HD coverage for almost four years -- the so called greatest spectacle in racing finally gets the HD treatment. The main race as well as shows on qualifing days will use 53 cameras, -- hopefully all HD -- and required a significant financial investment to make it happen.
