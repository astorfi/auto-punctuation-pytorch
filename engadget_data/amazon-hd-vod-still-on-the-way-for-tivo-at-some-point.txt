After Sir Dave Zatz openly questioned where this long awaited addition was, he received confirmation from multiple undisclosed sources that TiVo's implementation was still being honed. He also suspects that the real hang-up may be with Amazon, though we are told that image quality is nothing short of spectacular. Sadly, there are no clues as to when this will all go live, but we're totally kosher on waiting for something to be perfected. Just not for long, is all.
