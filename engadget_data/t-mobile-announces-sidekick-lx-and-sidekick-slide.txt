The Sidekick LX takes over as the new king of the Hiptop hill, boasting a Sidekick-first wide QVGA display -- touted as incorporating technology borrowed from Sharp's AQUOS televisions, no less -- along with configurable mood lighting, 1.3 megapixel camera with flash, and 128MB worth of bundled microSD memory. Meanwhile, the 4.6 x 2.4 x 0.68-inch Sidekick Slide becomes the first Hiptop device to come from Motorola, the first to ditch the trademark swivel display, and the first to go on a serious diet (anyone who's used a Sidekick of old knows that it ain't exactly small) while still packing the same functionality and 1.3 megapixel cam as its big sib. Look for the LX to hit store shelves come October 24 in your choice of "midnight blue" and "espresso brown" for a cool $299 on contract; the Slide slides in (sorry, couldn't help it) two weeks later on November 7 in a black / deep purple combo for a Franklin less at $199.
