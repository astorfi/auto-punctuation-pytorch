Whereas the last version was all about green robots, this update focuses on support for the latest processors and graphics cards, including AMD's Trinity and Radeon HD 7000-series, NVIDIA's Kepler stack, plus the graphical component inside Intel's Medfield mobile chip. As if that wasn't enough, there are plenty more changes at the source link, along with a serene missive from the man himself.
