 While the verdict might be out on an eventual sales winner between the three new-gen consoles, it's hard to argue with one stat: the PS3 is a shoo-in for the coveted "Console Launch Related Crime" award. The latest in crime spree exploits is a trio of UPS employees who were working the night shift around PS3 launch time, and managed to swap shipping labels on $19,000 worth of PS3s -- around 20 systems and 24 SIXAXIS controllers. These three grinches, 25-year-old Sean Weber, 37-year-old Norbert Joseph and 29-year-old Jasel Bolden, working from a New Orleans shipping center, forwarded the PS3s to their day job at Andrews Sport Company Inc., but couldn't escape the long arm of the law. Chalk one more up for justice. Oh, and by the way guys, if you get out of the clink before New Years, would you mind "diverting" a few PS3s our way? We accept Wiis too. You know, in the spirit of giving.[Via Joystiq]
