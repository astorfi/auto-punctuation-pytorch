The EMP-TW2000 starts with a trio of Epson-built, 0.74-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 C2FINE LCD panels with D7 process technology, 12-bit LCD driver, and updated OptiFocus engine with DeepBlack phase compensation technology. They then bust a rated 50,000:1 dynamic contrast at 1,600 lumens off a 170W UHE (E-TORL) bulb while supporting x.v.Color over a pair of HDMI v1.3 inputs -- component, S-Video, and D-Sub 15 PC input sprinkled in for fun. Nicely done Epson. Yours in Japan later this month for about Â¥350,000. That'll be a tax-inclusive $3,020 when it comes Stateside under the PowerLite Cinema branding. Pics of the backside, front and huge-ass, plastic remote control after the break.Update: As expected, this model is coming to the US under the PowerLite Home Cinema 1080 UB name for $2,699 in December. Right, the same price their lesser-spec'd Home Cinema 1080 model sells for now. We bet you'll wait, huh?
