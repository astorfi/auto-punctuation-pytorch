The 9-inch VMB090 and 10-inch VMB100 are among the first to use the new ATSC-M/H standard and ship with an HDMI 1.4 input, while the 7-inch VMB070 holds it down on the low end. The whole trio arrive in enclosures that are less than 1-inch thick, though you'll only really enjoy the integrated antenna if you live in a spot where the broadcasts are available. Speaking of, none of these will be available until "later this year," with prices set for $149.99, $199.99 and $229.99. Moving on, the company's outing 2.1 and 5.1 channel wireless surround home theater systems, wireless headphones and stereo Bluetooth headphones, and if you're super interested in learning more about the bevy of options there, give those source links a tick of your attention.
