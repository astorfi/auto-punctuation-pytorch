Still, despite its inability to power on -- no real word on exactly why -- we were able to get a feel for this low-end phone. For starters, it's got a 3.2-inch HVGA capacitive touchscreen and runs HTC's home-brewed Brew MP platform. There's also a FM tuner built-in, and a specialized FriendStream social networking interface -- no doubt an attempt to appeal to the younger set. For now, all we've got to quell your obviously whetted appetite are the hands-on shots in our gallery below.
