 So it seems that our favorite battle between Red and Blu is all but over, as long as titles are released for each format we'll be here to sum 'em up for you. And of all the weeks for HD DVD to fall like a house of cards, what an interesting one for it to happen, with one of the two remaining hot exclusives for HD DVD hitting the shelves. The number one movie this week is easily Universal's American Gangster with a stifling IMDB score of 8.2 placing it in the IMDB top 250 at number 166 -- that's the first time a movie was released on either format while making the list. Meanwhile on Blu-ray, Warner brings Michael Clayton which is no slump and will be available on HD DVD in about three weeks also. Finally, Warner catches up a title on Red (officially) with The Invasion, but based on how poorly it sold on Blu, we're not expecting it to make much of a dent in the Nielsen numbers. Looking ahead to next week, HD DVD's remaining hot exclusive on the calendar hits the street as Beowulf and while IMDB didn't think much of it, overall we expect it to be a hot commodity for Red.
