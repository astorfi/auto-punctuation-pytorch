Forget that 17-inch widescreen laptop.
Just wait a little while, and you'll be able to pick up a 20-incher, according to one report. The study, from IDC,
points out that LG Philips is already pitching a 20-inch display to laptop manufacturers, and that Samsung already has
a 19-inch laptop (the M70, pictured) on the way.
Widescreen models, now considered niche products, are expected to dominate the laptop market by the end of next year,
according to IDC. And though you'll initially have to lay out a fair bit of coin for a mega-screen, IDC predicts that
pricing on smaller screens should begin to, er, flatten, which means you could end up being able to pick up that
20-inch unit for not much more than you'd pay for a 17-inch today.
