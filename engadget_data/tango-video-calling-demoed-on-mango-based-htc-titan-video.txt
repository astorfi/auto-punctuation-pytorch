Windows Phone Director Aaron Woodman -- the same Aaron that stopped by our own Engadget Show a few months back -- recently paused to show off a Tango video calling application on the aforementioned handset. We knew good and well that the front-facing Titan camera would be put to use by something, and now you know. 'Course, the "demo" looks pretty well scripted -- don't expect an accurate representation of video quality over a crowded 3G network -- but it sure serves to make the wait that much harder. Have a peek yourself just after the break.
