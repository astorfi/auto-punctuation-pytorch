       Pioneer just sent us info about new technology for its line of already well received plasmas that it says will keep plasma display technology ahead of LCDs and SED -- assuming the latter ever actually ships. By redesigning the panel, filter and circuitry, Pioneer has been able to "far exceed" black levels in its earlier plasmas and reduce minimum luminance levels by 80 percent. Pioneer will be displaying the technology side by side with other HDTVs to show off the difference, and even display its plasmas in bright light conditions to show off their ability to maintain deep blacks in any lighting situation. Originally expected to become available in 2008, Pioneer expects to put these PDPs on shelves in the US by summer, but we'll get a look at them later and let you know if it actually works.
