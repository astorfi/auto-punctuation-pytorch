According to Japanese gaming publication Famitsu, the Big N is poised to give the freshly announced 3DS XL a second analog slider. Pricing wasn't covered in the magazine's Nintendo Q&A session, but gamers in the Land of the Rising Sun should have their thumbs on it later this year. Oh, and in case you didn't hear, the colossal clamshell is getting its very own charging cradle too, sold separately for 1,200 yen ($15). Mum's the word on stateside details for the secondary slide pad, but we wouldn't be surprised to see it show up on foreign shores.
