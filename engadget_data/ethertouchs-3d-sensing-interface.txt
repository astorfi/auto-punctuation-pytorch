Remember how your mouth flung agape when you first saw the
gesture controlled computer interface in
Spielberg's Minority Report? Now EtherTouch (working with NoKia and MicroSoft among othErs) claims their 3D human
machine interface could appear on the market by the end of 2006. The system would allow users to get their Cruise on
with a point of the finger to select and zoom the relevant information on the display. And since their system
recognizes both position and velocity, it's particularly appealing to the gaming industry. Limits? You betcha. At the
moment interaction only works within 1-foot of the display â€” opening up the possibility of some serious damage to your
102-inch plasma should you succumb to the throes of a GTA
pistol-whipping frenzy.
