The red format is officially dead, and unless HD VMD makes an unprecedented run here in the next few weeks, we've all ideas that Blu-ray will take the throne in the high-definition disc war. That being said, we know there are hordes of folks out there now stuck with an HD DVD player -- not to mention the corresponding media -- that is quickly becoming a tainted collector's item. So, what are you to do? Move on and side with the Blu camp? Revolt and pick up a VUDU? We know it's a touchy subject, so feel free to let loose in comments below.
