 The murmurs surrounding a 10-inch Nokia tablet are growing louder, and they suggest that the company won't just follow the herd. Tipsters for The Verge claim that the Windows RT slate would center on a Surface-style keyboard cover with its own twists. While the add-on would shelter the screen, it would also include a battery to supplement the 10-hour lifespan of the tablet proper. Not enough? It could carry a pair of USB ports and serve as a kickstand. There may be a chance of a US release, as well: Nokia's tablet would supposedly include cellular access and head to AT&T in the US, much like its Booklet 3G ancestor. We're not surprised that the Finnish firm won't comment on the rumor, but we might not have long to wait for verification if the early 2013 release proves real.
