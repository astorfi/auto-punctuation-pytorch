If that didn't make any sense to the non-suits out there, just remember this bit of number magic is why Apple treats iPhone and iPod touch users differently when it comes to updates -- the iPod doesn't get 3.0 for free because Apple doesn't handle the math this way. At any rate, number crunchers and MAC students can head on down to the read link for lots more invigorating stuff.
