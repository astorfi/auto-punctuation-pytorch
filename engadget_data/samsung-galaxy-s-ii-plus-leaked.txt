Today, however, Sammy's souped-up flavor of that famed S2 is making the rounds on the interwebs once more, and better yet, we've got an idea of what it could look like physically come its official revelation. According to Chilean carrier VTR, Samsung's Galaxy S II Plus will be sporting a 4.5-inch AMOLED display, which is said to be paired alongside a dual-core, 1.5GHz Exynos CPU, 1GB of RAM, 16GB of built-in storage and an 8-megapixel rear camera -- notably, the site's also listing it as an Ice Cream Sandwich device, making it slightly different than what we'd seen previously in earlier benchmark scores. Either way, all signs point toward the Korean outfit being close to legitimately introducing its S II Plus sooner rather than later; while we wait for that to happen, though, the angled shots after the break will have to suffice.
