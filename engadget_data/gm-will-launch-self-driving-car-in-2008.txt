This will totally give new meaning to the term auto-pilot: GM will be launching a vehicle with an actual
self-driving system in its 2008 Opel Vectra. That's right â€” think KITT, people, but without the smarmy voice (well, we
assume, anyway). It will be able to pilot itself even in heavy traffic at up to 60 mph, which is more than we can say
for most of our friends, really. It'll be using lasers, a video camera and a sophisticated computer brain to recognize
signs and detect obstacles. Let's hope the OS it uses is, um, extremely stable.
