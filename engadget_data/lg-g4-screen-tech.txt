LG must consider the G4's display as one of its main attractions, because the company's launching it weeks before the device's debut. The South Korean electronics maker has announced that it's begun mass producing its next flagship device's 5.5-inch QHD LCD panel. LG says the 1,440 x 2,560 resolution screen has 538 pixels per inch and boasts a 120 percent color gamut, which enables it to display more accurate and richer colors compared to other phones. Most devices, including the iPhone 6 Plus, only offer around 100 percent color gamut. The company says it achieved that percentage by combining a blue LED chip with red and green phosphors instead of yellow like in other LCDs.



In addition, LG claims the display offers a contrast ratio that's 50 percent higher than other QHD panels and is 30 percent brighter without consuming more energy. That leads to deeper blacks and sharper images made possible by using UV light while forming the layers of the panel. The process apparently causes liquid crystals to align evenly, thereby preventing light leakage. Finally, the company says it incorporated a technology called Advanced In-Cell Touch (AIT), which makes the screen so sensitive, it can respond to touch commands even if it's wet. We'll know for sure if these claims are true when the G4 launches on April 28th.
