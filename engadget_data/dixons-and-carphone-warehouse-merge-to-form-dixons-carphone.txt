Dixons and Carphone Warehouse have just completed a merger and will now be known as Dixons Carphone. The negotiations began in earnest some three months ago, but merger discussions between the companies have been ongoing since long before that. Dixons has some 950 Currys and PC World outlets, while Carphone Warehouse is England's largest telecom retailer with over 2,000 stores and a 46 percent share of Virgin Mobile France. Dixons Carphone will therefore have nearly 3,000 stores and 35,000 employees, prior to any cost-cutting. However, Carphone Warehouse noted that the deal, which is still subject to shareholder approval, would save up to Â£80 million per year -- meaning some chopping is no doubt in order. No money reportedly changed hands, and each brand will continue to focus on its traditional products.
