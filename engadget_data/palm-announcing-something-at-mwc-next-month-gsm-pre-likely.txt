 Looks like Palm wants to play ball at Mobile World Congress in February, seeing how they've got a mysteriously password-protected site going called palmmwc2009.com -- a domain name that leaves little to the imagination. There's no telling what our new crush has in store, but if we had to guess, it'd probably be an official unveiling of the 3G GSM version of the Pre; MWC's a European show, after all, and the CDMA version isn't doing 'em much good over there. Either that, or they're unveiling a WiMAX Foleo... or maybe webOS was a smokescreen for the real Nova. Do us a big favor and contribute some baseless speculation in comments, alright?[Via Gearlog]Update: Looks like Palm's already killed the site. Oopsie!
