Following up on the latest round of whispers that surfaced last Friday, Redmond proclaimed to GamePro: "As we have stated, we have no plans to introduce a Blu-ray drive for Xbox 360." The statement also noted that "games are what drive consumers to purchase game consoles, and we remain focused on providing the largest library of blockbuster games available." Right -- which totally explains your prior relationship with HD DVD.
