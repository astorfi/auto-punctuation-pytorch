 According to The Hollywood Reporter, Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment is going to announce nine Blu-ray releases today. Four of them are slated for release September 19, with five more to follow October 17th. Several of the movies will feature short films exclusive to the Blu-ray releases called Blu-scape, filmed by cinematographer Louie Schwartzberg. They also indicate all the movies will feature advanced menu and navigational features accessible while the movie is playing, and that most will carry an MSRP of $34.99. This could be kind of cool, or it could be a cheap gimmick to garner attention for the Blu-ray editions of the movies, we may have to wait until they are released to find out.September 19:
