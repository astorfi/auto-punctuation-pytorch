ZDNet is calling it the ultimate MP3 player for athletes: a 256MB model from Philips and Nike called the MP3Run that
comes with a special Bluetooth module that attaches to your shoe and keeps track of your speed and how much ground
you've covered. You can even press a button and a synthesized voice can give an update on how you're doing, and there's
a built-in strobelight to help reduce (but not eliminate) your chances of being struck by a car while running at
night.
