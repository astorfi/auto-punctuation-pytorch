If you had big plans for Nintendo's forthcoming Wii Fit U, which was scheduled to come in the first half of 2013, you'd better put them on hold. The company's president, Satoru Iwata just said during its E3 presentation that the game will be delayed until December of this year in order to "create new features" and bring "as high quality a gaming experience as possible." That includes the game's Fit Meter pedometer, which will eventually track your movements in over 77 game-based activities. Fortunately, if plain old exercise just won't do, there's lots of other options.
