  Sure, Google may have temporarily mothballed the Nexus Q, but some of the caked-on cobwebs are being wiped off thanks to the very first nightly release of CyanogenMod 10.1 for the device. Christened steelhead, the build outfits Mountain View's orb with Android 4.2.1 -- a welcome upgrade if you're still rocking CyanogenMod 9, or worse: its stock configuration. If you'd like to bring your media sphere up to speed with its Nexus-branded brethren, hit the source link for the download.
