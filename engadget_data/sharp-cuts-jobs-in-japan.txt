Following a board meeting today, the company has joined the likes of RIM, Sony and HP, announcing the "voluntary retirement" of around 2,000 staff in Japan before the year's out. The layoffs are part of a wider, textbook reorganization plan, and are expected to cost a sizeable 27 billion yen (approximately $344 million). Neither figure is set in stone, however, so when everything is finalized we could see more jobs impacted and those costs soar. Whether this puts off potential investment from Hon Hai Precision Industry is unknown, but while Sharp's TVs get ever bigger, its wallet continues to get thinner.
