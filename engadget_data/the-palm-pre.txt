 
digg_url = 'http://digg.com/gadgets/The_Palm_pre'; The new-ness is underway, and Palm just debuted its long(est) awaited all-new handset, the Palm Pre. The curvy touchscreen handset has a 3.1-inch 320 x 480 multitouch display, with a silver center button down below and touch sensitivity all down the face -- the lower part is for "gestures." A full QWERTY keyboard slides out from the phone in a portrait orientation, and you can flip the phone on its side for accelerometer-sensed widescreen browsing. The phone is running Palm's all-new webOS platform, with TI's new OMAP CPU under the hood -- which Palm claims provides laptop-style power, and which juices the phones smooth transitions, scrolling and "deck of cards" app-switching. Other internal specs include EV-DO Rev. A, 802.11b/g WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth with A2DP and 8GB of built-in flash storage. There's a 3 megapixel camera with LED flash, mass storage-friendly microUSB plug and a good ol' 3.5mm headphone jack, but most exciting is the wireless charger -- a first for a mainstream phone. More shots are after the break, including a fancy FCC diagram depicting a removable battery. The phone is exclusive at launch for Sprint in the first half of 2009, no word on price just yet.You can check out our other Pre coverage below:Live from Palm's CES press conferencePalm Pre's wireless charger, the TouchstonePalm's Pre gets its own spot on Sprint's websitePalm Pre website now live with official images, videoPalm pre first hands-on with live updates!Palm stock on a rocket to recoveryThere will be a GSM-friendly 3G Palm Pre Palm Pre in-depth impressions, video, and huge hands-on gallery
