 We know you've got questions, and if you're brave enough to ask the world for answers, then here's the outlet to do so. This week's Ask Engadget inquiry is from Philip, who wants to document his son's baseball adventures. If you're looking to ask one of your own, drop us a line at ask [at] engadget [dawt] com.
  I'm looking for a HFR camcorder, as I like to record my son playing baseball and play it back in slow motion. The Kodak PlayFull looked like the solution, offering 120fps at 1,280 x 720 for $200, but then Kodak axed its camera businesses and it never made it to market. What other options, therefore, exist for 120fps video recording around a similar price bracket?

 To be honest, slow-motion recording at such a low price is going to mean you'll only be able to get pictures at dreadful resolutions. If you're happy with footage at 640 x 480, then you could snag a Canon Powershot S100, but even that comes in at $319 from Amazon right now. It's a shame your budget couldn't stretch to $1,000, as we're desperate to find out if JVC's Procision is worth the hype. It's at this point that we should probably turn this over to the Engadget community and get them to share their wisdom -- so join in, HFR fans.
