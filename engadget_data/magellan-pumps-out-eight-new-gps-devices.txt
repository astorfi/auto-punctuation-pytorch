Magellan is also bolstering the low-end RoadMate 1200 series with the new $299 RoadMate 1212 and $329 traffic-enabled 1230, and introducing the similar 1400 series (pictured), which mirrors the 1200 series but ups the screen size to 4.3 inches. The Maestro 3200 series is joined by the Maestro Elite 3270, which completely eliminates the plastic border around the 3.5-inch screen and delivers about what you'd expect for 499: text-to-speech, voice control, Bluetooth, and three month traffic data subscription. The real action, though, is the new Maestro 5300 series, which debuts with two models: the absurdly-priced $699 5-inch 5310, which Magellan's press release openly targets at flush baby boomers (over $2 trillion in annual spending power!), and features a three-month traffic sub and text-to-speech, as well as built-in AAA TourBook travel guide info. The 5310 is joined by the somewhat less crassly-opportunistic 5340+GPRS, which adds in a GPRS cradle for all that live data action. It's not clear what service all those bits are coming down over or how much it'll cost, but we'll hit up the Magellan booth and get some hard answers soon.
