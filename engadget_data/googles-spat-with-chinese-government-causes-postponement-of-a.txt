 You have to love a good clash of legitimate titans, and they don't get much bigger than Google and China. After deciding to stop censoring its Google.cn results, the Mountain View company of evil-non-doers has stepped up its offensive with the announcement that two Android phones -- one from Samsung and one from Motorola -- which were slated to make their arrival on China Unicom on Wednesday have now been postponed. We'll read between the lines and guess that the phones will be "postponed" if China plays nice, or "never gonna happen" if it doesn't. Google seems intent on demonstrating the full impact of its potential withdrawal from China, and this show of its sway with mobile manufacturers will hardly go unnoticed.
