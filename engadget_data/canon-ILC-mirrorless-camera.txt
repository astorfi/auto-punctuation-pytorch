A patent application spotted on Japanese site Egami outlines the type of lens we may see on Canon's first effort. Admittedly, the leaked details aren't particularly thrilling; it looks like a typical kit lens, with an 18-45mm focal length and aperture settings from f/3.5 to f/5.6, but if Canon is getting into the game, the world of ILC is about to get a little more interesting.
