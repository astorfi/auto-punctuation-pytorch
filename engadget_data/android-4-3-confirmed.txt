We've still got about an hour and 20 minutes until the Google I/O keynote begins, but we're already starting to get hints of what's to come. The company just revealed, in an indirect sort of way, that the next-gen version of Android will be Android 4.3 (as opposed to, say, 5.0). The name popped up on one of Google's developer pages, which ended up being cached despite the fact that it wasn't live for very long. Unfortunately, that page didn't reveal much in the way of actual features, so it's unclear whether the jump from 4.2 to 4.3 will be a minor one. In any case, we'll find out in 78 minutes and counting.
