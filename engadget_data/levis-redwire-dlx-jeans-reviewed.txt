 CNET Asia has a review of this fall's geekiest fashion item/iPod accessory, Levi's new RedWire DLX Jeans. You know, the ones with a sidepocket for carrying your iPod and a big white control pad on the pocket that lets the world know you've got some precious cargo on-board (in addition to pausing, skipping tracks, and raising or lowering the volume on your iPod). Anyway, CNET Asia isn't super-enthusiastic in its review of the jeans, but they do dig the control pad, calling it "intuitive" and praising its hardiness. What they weren't so impressed with were the Levi's-branded headphones that are included, but anyone expecting decent sound knows to upgrade those anyway, right?[Thanks, denim dude]
