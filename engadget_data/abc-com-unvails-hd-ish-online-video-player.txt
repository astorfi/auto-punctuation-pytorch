 ABC sure is embracing this whole "Internet" thing with their new online player. They call it HD and while it looks good, we aren't quite sure what resolution it is; kind of neat though. The whole thing has a slick interface that lets you choose what show your going to watch via a scrolling dock gizmo. Once it launches you can choose from four different sizes, including one that's full screen and HD-ish. Even though it might not be the HDTV in your living room, it's still a slick way to catch missed ABC shows. [via B&C]
