 Reporting on the Optimus-103 keyboard is rapidly becoming one of our guilty pleasures -- guilty because the Optimus guys seem averse to giving us anything more than tiny nuggets of information at a time, and pleasure because... well, we shouldn't have to explain why the Optimus-103 is intriguing to us. The latest piece of news from the Optimus project is an announcement that the company will be taking pre-orders for the Optimus-103 on December 12. That will hopefully also mean an unveiling of the price, and if we're lucky, some specifications for the keyboard. We're not getting our hopes up though, because these guys could reveal nothing and still fill their pre-order slots.[Via Slashgear]
