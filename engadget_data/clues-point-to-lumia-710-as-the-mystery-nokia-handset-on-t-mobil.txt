The reason: to announce the release of the Lumia 710 Windows Phone. At least, that's the conclusion we're coming to as more clues continue to filter in. Our first clue was discovered by TmoNews, who dug through the Lumia 700's FCC filings and stumbled across a recently-released user manual complete with diagrams of the phone that showed the US carrier's logo plastered just below the screen. Hint number two, an even stronger indication of the phone's impending arrival, is the above image -- leaked to The Verge -- which shows the accessory lineup for the device along with suggested talk tracks. The mystery: solved.
