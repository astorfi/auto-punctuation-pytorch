Naturally, given E3's all-things-gaming nature, Elgato brought the device to E3 and we got a chance to get our hands on one. In case you forgot, the Game Capture HD's a lightweight, palm-sized device that plugs in between your Xbox or PS3 and your TV to capture footage of you pwning family and friends. It then converts the footage into Elgato's preferred H.264 format and dumps it on your PC or Mac so you can share your gaming exploits with the world. Still not ready to drop $200 on the thing? Perhaps our gallery of pics can persuade you.
