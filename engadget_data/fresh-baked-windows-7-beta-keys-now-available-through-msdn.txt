According to some tips we're receiving, keys are available right now through official channels -- and they even work. Mr. Ballmer was widely expected to announce the release of the (so far quite well-received) OS into public beta at his keynote speech later tonight, so you might say they've let the cat out of the bag a little early on this one. Give it a try, if you would, and let us know what you find. Sadly our subscriptions were revoked for posting silly pictures of a certain CEO. Update: Seems it's gone. We'll just have to wait for the official word. You know where you can find it. [Thanks, Wayne S.]
