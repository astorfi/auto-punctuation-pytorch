The company just announced its very first netbook, the recently spotted 10.2-inch, Atom-powered little wonder. Sadly, there's little of note in the design -- it seems to have more in common with the MSI Wind and the Eee PC than its Lenovo siblings -- but the $399 starting price is certainly pleasing. That model brings 512MB of RAM and a 80GB hard drive, while a $450 version will be available with 1GB of RAM and 160GB of storage, with both being powered by 1.6GHz Atom chipsets. Windows XP will be preloaded initially, but Linpus versions will be available eventually. The display is 1024 x 600 and LED backlit, and the touchpad does multi-touch. Lenovo didn't skimp on the trimmings either, with WiFi, Bluetooth, ExpressCard, 4-in-1 card reader and a 1.3 megapixel webcam. The S10 hits China on September 5th, and will land in the States in early October. A 9-inch version is also in the works for other countries.[Via Laptop Mag]
