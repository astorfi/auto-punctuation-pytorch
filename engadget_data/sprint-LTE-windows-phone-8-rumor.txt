   Get out the salt shaker, because there's a new Windows Phone rumor making its way across the web today. Citing sources "familiar with Sprint's LTE game plan," SprintFeed is reporting that the carrier is looking to launch a new LTE-enabled handset later this year -- one that'll allegedly run Windows Phone 8, commonly known as Apollo. These sources also claimed that the device still has to run through a series of tests, implying that it would likely hit the market this Fall, at the earliest. Beyond that, details run pretty thin, but we'll be sure to keep an eye on it going forward.
