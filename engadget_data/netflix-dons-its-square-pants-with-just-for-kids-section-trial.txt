Good news, the movie rental giant has begun testing a "Just for Kids" section, rolling out the feature to a limited number of subscribers. Eligible users will find a tab just to the right of the Watch Instantly button. At the top of the new page is a series of familiar children's characters, including the likes of Spongebob, Popeye, and, yep, the Jonas Brothers. Each character has its own landing page with easily accessible content. We reached out to Netflix for more information on the matter, and the company would only confirm that the feature is still in testing mode. Given the amount of nostalgia currently available, we suspect that kids of all ages will be pitching in with the trial.
