It's the next project by the same dude, who goes by the appropriate handle "cubie" over at the Digital Photography Review forums. This one requires a bit more work, soldering a couple of IR LEDs to a headphone jack and positioning them to sit atop the camera's IR sensor. Then, by playing the right sound through an audio patch cable, pictures can be taken. Overly complicated? Yes. Love it? Pika!
