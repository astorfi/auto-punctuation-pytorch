OUYA vowed a steady stream of updates to its inaugural console on the road to a June retail launch, and it just released one of the more important examples. Among other fixes, the inconspicuously titled 1.0.193 firmware upgrade lets customers change their credit card info after they've created an account -- rather vital to anyone who has to swap cards in the wake of identity theft, or who just wants to gift an account to a friend. While few owners beyond the earliest adopters will fully appreciate the change, it's good to know that there shouldn't be a payment panic when OUYA units arrive in force.
