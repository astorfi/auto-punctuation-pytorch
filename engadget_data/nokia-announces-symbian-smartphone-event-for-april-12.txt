That is, at least according to the invite posted at Mad For Tech -- and verified ourselves, after a quick call to the company (it seems that some of the invites accidentally went out early, though we've been assured that ours is forthcoming). Will we finally get the inside dope on the next OTA Symbian update? We can't really say, but we assure you that we will be on hand when it all goes down.

Update: Nokia contacted us to clarify that the "event" is actually a "media briefing." Hint: that's journalistic code meant to temper any enthusiasm you might still feel for the platform.
