Now, unlike what we'd previously heard, it appears HTC's Incredible S won't be on the receiving end of said 4.0.x refresh, with Bell Mobility taking to Twitter to reveal that the Taiwanese outfit "will not be updating the Incredible S with ICS." Still, things could potentially take a turn for the best, as the Canadian carrier told a cheerless S owner, "If that changes, I'll let you know." As for us, well, we'll have to hold off on making any changes to our current Ice Cream Sandwich list.
