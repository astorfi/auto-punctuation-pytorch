We'll just leave this link to HotHardware in the source below, in case you want to check out some comparative benchmarks before trading $700 for a two-year contract. Not that it performed poorly mind you, it raced neck-and-neck with Lenovo's IdeaPad K1 -- we just like think charts and tables are cool. Videos too -- hit the break to see the folks at HotHardware give the 10-inch slate a quick hands-on.
