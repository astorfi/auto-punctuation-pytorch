Now equipped with two cameras (claimed to be an industry first) and lowering operational noise to a more bearable 50dB, the RoboKing is back in town and pining for your attention. It's more compact than its previous iteration, stretching up to only 90mm, and it's also said to be 30 percent faster on the job. Nice gains, to be sure, but we'd still like to see how this machine handles before we're convinced. Bonus video after the break.
