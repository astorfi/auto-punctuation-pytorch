That's an AMD Geode NX 1750 processor backed up by a SiS 741GX/966L chipset, to be specific, which is complemented by some mostly ordinary specs otherwise, including a 1GB of RAM, a 320GB hard drive, a 0.3-megapixel webcam, a built-in memory card reader and, somewhat interestingly in light of yesterday's news, Windows XP Home for an OS. No word on pricing or availability just yet, but you can check out the complete spec list and a few more images at the link below.
