 Just when wewere feeling a bit smug about our new dual-core lappies, along comes Intel to remind us that you're never on thecutting edge for long. Intel Chief Technology Officer Justin Rattner recently demoed the company's upcoming Clovertownquad-core processor, which will initially be seen in 2007 servers running two of the chips, for a total of eight coresunder the hood. Rattner says the Clovertown architecture is scalable to 32 or more cores on a single chip, which shouldsatiate our speed jones until quantum computers finally go mainstream. According to Rattner, chips with hundreds ofcores are theoretically possible with this technology, which means we'll probably be able to do some pretty seriousdamage on timed games of Solitaire.
