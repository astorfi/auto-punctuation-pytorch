We've seen other Bluetooth pens
before, but that won't stop us from telling you about the
DP-201 digital pen from Hitachi Maxell. Sure, it's essentially the same product — an optical sensor detects where you
draw lines on a dotted piece of paper and relays the signals back to another device via Bluetooth — but this one is
both smaller and lighter than previous models. Also of note is its support for both Bluetooth and USB for
transferring writing, so those of us who haven't made the jump yet can rest assured that when we do, we won't have to
buy a new digital pen. The pen's internal battery is good for about 2 hours of writing and recharges via USB.
