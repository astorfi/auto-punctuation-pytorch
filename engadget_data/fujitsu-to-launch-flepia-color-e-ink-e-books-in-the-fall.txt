That's the word according to Nikkei, which says that the A4-sized readers won't feature an integrated backlight, but still be able to run for up to 50 hours on a single charge. The WiFi-capable unit is said to cost Â¥100,000 ($941), but other specs are still up in the air -- hopefully they'll be changing the name as well.[Via CrunchGear; warning, read link requires subscription]
