 Not satisfied by the currently available mobile OS options? Tizen could be your next option, and Samsung just took the wraps off of a prototype device (possibly the GT-I9500 we'd heard about) at the currently ongoing developer's conference in San Francisco. As seen above in still photos taken by Tizen Talk, the developer unit running Tizen 1.0 features a 4.3-inch screen and reportedly contains a dual-core 1.2GHz CPU. There are more details revealed in a seven minute video posted by The Handheld Blog (embedded after the break), showing off a very TouchWiz-inspired experience which while plain and without many of the animations and transitions of polished release-quality software, did appear to run smoothly. The HTML5 apps themselves however, tended to lag a bit, although even at this early stage it showed off quite a bit of built-in support for social services like Facebook, Twitter and Gmail. We should find out more about the coalition's plans over the next few days, for now check out the hands-on video and see if this Linux-based software has any more promise than webOS or the same MeeGo platform it dislodged.
