Who doesn't like climbing gorgeous buildings in historic time periods and then leaping from said buildings? Suckers, that's who. Oh, and maybe people who've yet to experience an Assassin's Creed game, now in its seventh iteration with this year's model: Assassin's Creed Unity. Beyond the now usual changes (a new locale, a new main character), ACU adds co-op gameplay, a dedicated stealth button and it's built with current-gen in mind -- ACU is only playable on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC, while Assassin's Creed Rogue was created specifically for last-gen game consoles. The game's gotten some rocky reviews thus far, but we're longtime series fans and want to show you Paris through the eyes of an assassin. Join us below for a day in the life of Assassin's Creed Unity main character Arno Dorian, and bring your sharpest assassin blade just in case.



[For the record, I'm playing Assassin's Creed Unity on an Xbox One, using a retail copy (disc) provided by Ubisoft. I'm streaming the game over wired internet using Open Broadcaster Software and an Elgato Game Capture HD. All that to say, "This game will likely look prettier and run more smoothly on your home equipment. Streaming conditions vary!"]
