Notification Center aggregates your various app alerts and eschews the pop-ups for a decidedly Android-esque list that appears at the top of our your screen when you you get a Facebook message, or a tweet, or when you miss a call. Swiping down brings you to the list, and swiping across any instance takes you to the corresponding app. Feast your eyes on the gallery below for a closer look.
