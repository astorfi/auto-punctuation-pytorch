Unlike the Viosport and DoubleVision Pro, the ATC-2000 comes with mounting hardware to affix the hands-free unit to "helmets, handlebars, and other sports equipment," and although attaching it to a car mirror while cruising in a demolition derby isn't mentioned, we're sure you could pull it off. The self-contained webcam touts a VGA resolution at 30fps, "water and shock-resistance," USB 2.0 connectivity, RCA outputs, 32MB of internal storage, and an SD slot to carry even more zany moments from your everyday life. The perfect tool for capturing those daredevil audition tapes is available now for $129.99.
