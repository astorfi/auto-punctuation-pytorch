It doesn't seem like much has changed in the ensuing months, however, with the dock still boasting the same ability to not only charge two iPods (or iPhones) at the same time, but playback each one through the unit's speakers or have each one go off at two separate times with the tune of your choice. Otherwise, you can rest assured that you'll be getting the usual FM tuner, as well as a standard analog audio input for your non-Apple audio devices and a video output for some larger screen viewing of your iPod's contents. If that sounds like just the dock you've been waiting for, you can snag one now for $150.[Thanks, T.I.]
