Espoo wasted no time after yesterday's announcement in taking out Google ads encouraging disheartened, empty-walleted iPhone owners to check out its new MOSH service -- a collaborative mobile media site run by the phone giant -- to "salvage" their devices. With all due respect, Nokia, no amount of free content is going to put $200 back into our pockets, but we appreciate the thought nonetheless.[Thanks, Roberto M.]
