At this point, the followup to HTC's One flagship is a lock for late March, and we've even been blessed with leaks that show off what the phone, codenamed M8, looks like. Now the device has made its way through the obligatory FCC approval process, and the actual design of the phone -- complete with its soft curved corners -- made it through without the veil of confidentiality attached. There's nothing new here, but it at least confirms earlier leaks. In the way of additional details, it looks like this particular version of the new One will have AT&T-compatible LTE as well as a few extras (it features bands 2, 4, 5, 7 and 17), but we have a feeling that HTC will have regional variants to ensure every corner of the globe is covered with the necessary connectivity. There's also NFC, Bluetooth 4.0, dual-band 802.11ac WiFi, and we'll update you if we come across any other goodies as we dig. Just about a month left until the company fills in all the missing pieces.
