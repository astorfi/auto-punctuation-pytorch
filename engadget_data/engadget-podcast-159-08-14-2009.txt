 

Get ready for a wild one, folks -- we recorded this week's Engadget Podcast with a live (chatroom) studio audience, and things got a little rowdy. Join Josh, Paul and Nilay as they run down the new Zune HD, Windows 7, two new Dell machines and three new Samsung cameras before finally -- at the urging of the crowd -- tackling the Apple tablet rumors. Definitely a fun show -- we'll have to do more like this in the future. Until then, what are you waiting for? Get downloading!

Hosts: Joshua Topolsky, Nilay Patel, Paul Miller
Producer: Trent Wolbe
Song: Powerglove - Tetris
