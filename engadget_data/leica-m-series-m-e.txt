 Do you need a stylish, undoubtedly expensive German camera early in 2013? Perhaps right now? Leica's got you covered on both fronts, announcing today that its Leica M line is finally getting an official followup to the venerable M9 rangefinder in "early 2013." The new M is outfitted with the company's first 24-megapixel (full-frame, naturally) Leica Max CMOS image sensor (Ã  la the A99 and D600) -- what Leica calls "a completely new development in sensor technology." That sensor will snag you a sensitivity range of IS0 200 to 6,400 (expandable to 100). Even more exciting, this latest M can mount Leica's legacy R glass (!) with a new adapter (available separately) and it can also shoot video in 1080p HD with 24 / 25p frame rate. While it retains the classic M-series styling, rear now features a 3-inch 920k-dot display, protected behind a layer of Gorilla glass. Leica's also making special note to highlight that the new M features live view functionality on the embedded screen and with an optional EVF.
