The outstanding sum supposedly relates to customs bills racked up by trucks removing Nokia's equipment from its abandoned Cluj factory. A Nokia spokesperson just confirmed to us that the company is experiencing some kind of problem in that country, but is "engaging with the local authority to ensure it will be resolved satisfactorily."
