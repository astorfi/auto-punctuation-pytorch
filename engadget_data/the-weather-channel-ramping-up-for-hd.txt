       The Weather Channel is investing $50 Million to convert their on-screen graphics to HD and to build a new studio in Atlanta for HD. They will break ground on the new building on May 2nd and it should be completed by January. Interestingly, DirecTV will add the TWC in HD in September, but will upconvert everything until the new studio is complete -- there's another one of those 100 HD channels -- and eventually when all of their programming is HD, they will down-convert the HD feed for those who don't have HD by then. No word on cable carriage yet, but they say they are getting a "positive reaction" from the cable companies.
