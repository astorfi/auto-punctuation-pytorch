 When AT&T announced it was keeping the Lumia 920 for itself, plenty of clothes were rended and teeth were gnashed. However, the ever-reliable @evleaks has shown a picture of a Nokia handset, codenamed Atlas, that's bound for Verizon's, erm, less unpopular network. While there's no official confirmation as to the phone's pedigree, we wouldn't be surprised if it was a customized version of the 820 to follow in the footsteps of T-Mobile's 810. Whatever happens, we don't have that long to find out either way.
