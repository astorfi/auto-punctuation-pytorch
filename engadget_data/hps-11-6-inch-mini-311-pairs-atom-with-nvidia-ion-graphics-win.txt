HP has stuffed NVIDIA ION LE graphics into the new (already leaked) Mini 311 netbook-ish PC, but instead of being forced by Microsoft to go Windows Vista or Windows 7 to get the new chip in there, HP has stood by good ol' Windows XP. It comes with a big caveat, however: "Streaming HD video playback not currently supported," and of course an Atom N270 processor is still an N270, no matter what graphics you pair it with -- stay away from heavy Flash video, dear friend. The 11.6-inch WXGA screen dreams of something more, however, and the ION chip can decode HD video and output over HDMI. Of course, it's hard to complain about the $400 starting pricetag.
