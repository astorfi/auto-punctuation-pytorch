As CNET reports, de la Vega revealed that AT&T has sold 6.4 million smartphones during the first two months of Q4, which he says puts the carrier on a "record pace" for the quarter. It's also caused the carrier to revise its projections for the full year, with it now forecasting smartphone sales of 26 million for all of 2012 (one million more than it had previously expected). De la Vega is also said to be "bullish" on tablets, but didn't go into specific numbers there, noting only that he "can't fathom how many tablets will be under the Christmas tree." He also didn't break down those smartphone sales by specific devices, but he said that AT&T had improved its supply of iPhones, and also remarked that he's "really excited" about Windows Phone sales (again, without getting into specifics).
