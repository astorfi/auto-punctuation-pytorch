 While we've already heard DirecTV's claim to carry 100 HD channels in 2007 (or something like that), we've just found that one of those hundred will be dedicated entirely to the horror genre. NBC Universal has just announced that its first 24/ 7 horror channel, to be dubbed Chiller, will launch in both SD and HD formats on DirecTV. Additionally, NBC plans on offering up Chiller content through video-on-demand, although we don't know if HD VOD plans are in the pipeline. Although long-term programming goals haven't quite been nailed down, users can expect a solid lineup of classic horror content when it launches on March 1st, including Friday the 13th, Twin Peaks, The Shining, Psycho, The Birds, Sphere, The Crew, and quite a bit more. Be sure to hit the read link for the full rundown of initial programming.
