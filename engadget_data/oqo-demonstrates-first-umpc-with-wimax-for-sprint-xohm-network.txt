 OQO demonstrated the first UMPC with embedded Sprint XOHM WiMAX here at CES today and while not earth shattering -- as WiMAX isn't a brand spanking new baby -- it's nice to see the tech trickle into more portable devices. Of course, don't expect to be able to pop out and pick up an OQO model 02 with WiMAX in the near as the press fluff only states it may be available in specific markets at some point in the future -- apparently they're big on vague. Well done OQO and Sprint, have at it.
