Google's made quite the habit out of improving its Gmail offering, and for those relying on the Android app in order to access their email, you'll find a pleasant new update available starting today. The refreshed build ushers in a cleaner conversation view, as well a number of additional design tweaks "such as checkmarks for multiple message selection so you can easily see what messages you are about to move, archive or delete." Oh, and in case you occasionally deal with bouts of disconnectedness, the app now notifies you right from the inbox if account sync is nonfunctional for any reason. Enjoy!
