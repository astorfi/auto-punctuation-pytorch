If the signs of Motorola's upcoming Droid refresh weren't clear enough already, an in-the-flesh photo of what's said to be the Droid Ultra XT1080 has surfaced on the XDA Developers forum, courtesy of xavierk75. Not only do an FCC filing and accompanying rumors peg the XT1080 as a Maxx variant with a beefier battery, but the picture lines up with the kevlar enclosure and trio of capacitive buttons shown in a press shot posted by @evleaks. Thanks to the device's examination by Uncle Sam, we know that it carries radios for Verizon-friendly LTE, EV-DO Rev. A and WCDMA (850/900/1900/2100), in addition to NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 and WiFi 802.11ac, to boot. Once again, specs are still MIA, but they -- or an official reveal -- can't be far off at this point.
