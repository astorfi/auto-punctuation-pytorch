As in the RAZR's CDMA metamorphosis, the SLVR L7c should pack on a little girth when compared to its GSM brethren, but it'll still slot into Sprint's lineup as their thinnest phone. Besides the obviousÂ CDMA innards, the L7c adds GPS and allegedly swaps the L7's VGA camera for a beefier 1.3 megapixel shooter. No word on a release window, but you know we'll have our ear to the ground and keep you posted.
