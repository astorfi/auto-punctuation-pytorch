 It's been quite some time since we've heard any noise from Tranquil, but apparently, the firm's T7-HSA server is finally shipping. Notably, these wee machines not only utilize an energy-efficient, fanless design, but it arrives at your door with Windows Home Server under the hood. Granted, you won't be encoding any movie clips or recording 16 tracks of simultaneous audio with the modest 1.5GHz CPU, but it should handle basic media serving / home automation tasks just fine. Nevertheless, those interested can get their orders in now starting at Â£338 ($686), and you shouldn't have to wait long before having it in your hands.
