As you can see, it's a QWERTY slider, and it's said to pack Android 4.0.4, a 1.5 GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor, front and rear-facing cameras (just 3-megapixels 'round back, though), LTE connectivity, and a 4-inch WVGA display. About the only key details missing are a price and release date, but Android and Me surmises it'll run $99 on-contract with a launch any time now -- both of which seem like safe guesses.
