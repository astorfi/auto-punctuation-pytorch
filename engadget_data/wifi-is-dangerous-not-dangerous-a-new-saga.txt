But apparently, some of them have found time to attackWiFi, and have had their first taste of success at a Canadian university, which has just banned wireless internetaccess. Officials at the school, Lakehead University, have banned WiFi, saying that they want to avoid "potential chronic exposure for our students." The officials point out that the "juryâ€™s out" on the health risks from EMF generated by WiFi transmissions, and liken the risksof WiFi to those of second-hand tobacco smoke, which were not immediately apparent to researchers. Meanwhile, theschool apparently still allows microwave ovens, cellphones, televisions, portable radios and other electricaldevices that may pose some undefined long-term risk, though we assume they'll get around to banning them all soonenough.
