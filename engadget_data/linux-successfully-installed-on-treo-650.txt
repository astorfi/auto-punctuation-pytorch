There are no working apps yet — there's not even a working keyboard driver — but Matthew Mastracci has successfully
installed Linux on a Treo 650, and he's got the pics to prove it. For now all it does is boot, but that's more than was
possible even 24 hours ago. Let's hope this opens the door for dozens of open source Treo 650 apps — or at least a
reliable Treo port version of Doom.
