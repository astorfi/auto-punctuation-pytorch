That's where the personal breathalyzer comes in, and thankfully UK retailerBoys Stuff knows that most people interested in such products probably spend all of their money on hooch and can'tafford one of the nicer models, so they're offering a "budget-conscious" alternative with excellentportability but questionable accuracy ("The place and method of operation may affect the test's result by up to5%," claim the Boys). The Breath Test Pen indicates your sobriety level by flashing the normally-green LED redafter an alcohol-filled puff, letting you know that it's time to "stop" and call a cab (and not to"stop" worrying and get in the car), and is presumably set at the .08 blood-alcohol level threshold common toboth the US and the UK. If you're still not convinced that this $35 device is for you, we'll throw in a UV sunburntester at no extra charge (we're not joking, it really does that- apparently drinking and tanning is more dangerousthan we thought).[Via GadgetReview]
