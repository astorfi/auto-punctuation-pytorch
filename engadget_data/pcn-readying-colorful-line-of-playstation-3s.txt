If you're dead set on forking out $eBay for a fresh new PS3, you might as well get something that hardly anyone else has, right? The same folks who delivered that snow white PS3 console just a few days back have quickly realized the goldmine they've struck, and as Colorware is to iPods, MacBooks, etc., PCN is becoming to PlayStation 3s. The paint-wielding gurus are already gearing up to post a shiny red unit up for sale in the coming days, with a silver edition to follow suit, and while we can't be for certain, it seems they just might keep kicking out colored PS3s until the lucrative market dies down. So if you're interested in picking up one of these uber-limited units, be sure to hit the read link and keep an eye out for sale dates.[Via Engadget Japanese]
