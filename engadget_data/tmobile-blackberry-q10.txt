 More details on the BlackBerry Q10's release in the US are starting to surface. T-Mobile confirmed in an email that its business customers will have the opportunity to register for the device starting next week on April 29th, with availability and pricing details to follow "at a later date." General consumers will likely have to wait a little longer, if T-Mobile follows the same launch strategy that it did with the Z10. Of course, registration doesn't actually equate to pre-orders or actually purchasing the phone yet -- all we've heard from official channels is that it'll be coming towards the end of May -- but it's still a solid confirmation that QWERTY fans will at least be able to get their BB10 on in the very near future.
