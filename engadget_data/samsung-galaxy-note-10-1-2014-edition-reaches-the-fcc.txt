Samsung has already run the Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy Gear through the FCC; the company might as well complete its trifecta with the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition), right? Sure enough, the 10-inch slate has just been approved by the FCC as the SM-P600. This is a WiFi model, so there are few surprises in the filing -- the most exotic feature is the already known support for ANT+ sensors. Nonetheless, those wanting to try Samsung's latest flagship tablet will be glad to know that there's one less hurdle ahead of its American launch.
