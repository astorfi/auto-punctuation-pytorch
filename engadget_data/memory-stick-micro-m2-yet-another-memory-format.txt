Oh god yes, finally, what consumers have been demanding for nigh on years now — another friggin' memory
friggin' format. Sony and SanDisk were showing off the new Memory Stick Micro M2, measuring 15 x 12.5 x 1.2mm (about
1/4 the size of the Memory Stick Duo), designed to compete with MiniSD cards as well as to be increasingly easier to
lose. Yes! Apparently the format has a theoretical maximum of a whopping 32GB of storage capacity which, if true, might
make us momentarily pause from our normal "but whyyyyyy another goldarn format already?" routine and take notice — but
somehow we have a feeling these won't just be popping out during the first days of product rollout, which should be
sometime in the first half of 2006. No word on which sizes will be rolling out, neither, so we safely return you to
your regularly scheduled bitchfest.
