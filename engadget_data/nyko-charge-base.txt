All right, all right, so it's not the sexiest thing in the world, but let's face it, those wireless controllers need to be charged. Nyko's got the jump on the next generation of battery drainers, rolling out out new Charge Bases for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. The two peripherals look fairly similar: strips with two charging ports. The Xbox One version comes packed with two batteries, and the PS4 edition uses a little dongle for charging. In both cases, the systems are just drop and go. Once they're in place, a little display will illuminate an image of the controller to let you know that it's doing its job. No word on pricing on either, but you can treat yourself to a gallery of both below.
