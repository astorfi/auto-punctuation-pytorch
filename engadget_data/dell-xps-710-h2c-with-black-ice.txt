 Dell's been dropping hints about a new XPS 710 gaming PC with super-secret "Black Ice" cooling technology for a couple of weeks now, and while there hasn't been an official announcement yet (we're expecting something soon at CES), we did manage to get the scoop on the new "XPS 710 H2C" courtesy of a well-placed source. Turns out that "Black Ice" is a "two-stage thermoelectric/liquid cooling solution" that is up to "9 degrees celsius cooler than the [regular] XPS 710 air cooling solution." Other specs include a black aluminum casing, an Intel QX6700 Core 2 Extreme processor, 4GB DDR2 RAM, dual 768MB NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTX SLI Enabled graphics cards, and a 320GB RAID 0 array. List price is a hefty $5,499.
