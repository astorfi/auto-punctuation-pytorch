He can probably relax a little, knowing that 321,400 of the things were exchanged for cold, hard cash in the retail outlets of Japan. In comparison, Nintendo's 3DS sold 50,000 more units but sales soon stalled -- only to be rescued with a hefty price cut. Of course, now the company has to ensure that the performance issues that early-adopters have been facing are resolved -- we'd hate to experience the same teething trouble when it arrives over here in February.
