Martin ConaghanÂ  over atthe 'Wire (who may be the only member of the WIN family save for the titular Blogging Baby who doesn't use 802.11) saysthat the initial setup couldn't be easier: simply plug the SL400i into your TV's SCART port (you do have one of those,don't you?) and the USB WiFi adapter into your PC if you're not already rocking a WLAN. From here, the Streamium issupposed to catalog all of your media files using the included software, and provide you with a pain-free way totransfer content back and forth with the mothership. Well it apparently performed the first of these tasks swimmingly,but only allowed Martin a few precious minutes of actual streamiuming before conking out, making a brief revival, andthen going down for the count (oh SL400i review unit, although we hardly knew ye, R.I.P.). PVR Wire's suggestion toSCART-carrying Brits is to save their 180 pounds ($320) and spend their hard-earned quid elsewhere, perhaps on a unitthat even supports DRM and Xvid files.
