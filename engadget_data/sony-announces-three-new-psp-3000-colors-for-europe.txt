Those include the all new "turquoise blue" and "blossom pink" colors, the former of which will come bundled with LittleBigPlanet, as well as the "lilac purple" model that's already made an appearance in the US (which'll also get the same Hannah Montanna Entertainment Pack). Still no word on the new colors getting a release over here, but it looks like folks in Europe will be able to get their hands on them in November.
