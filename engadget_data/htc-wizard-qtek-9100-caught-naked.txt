Well, that's that! Looks like the HTC
Wizard "shot" we had the other day may well be the
real deal, since some Norwegian dudes caught a Qtek 9100 in the buff—and how. While we can't translate Norse, we were
able to pull a few key terms from the copy: 320 x 240 (as in, the screen res), EDGE/UMTS (we're not sure if that's a
request, or the real sitch), Windows Mobile 5.0 for Pocket PC (duh), 1.3 megapixel camera, Bluetooth, and, of course,
WiFi. You know we can't wait for this one—how they tease!
