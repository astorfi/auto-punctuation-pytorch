Granted, these same threads also point out that finding one in-store seems to be a bit more difficult than landing one online, but nevertheless, it looks like Panny's $500 BD30 (also seen as the BD30K) is already available in some form or another. So, dear readers, what gives? Have any of you already had the pleasure of enjoying a few films on a shiny new DMP-BD30, or are all these so-called early adopters just blowing smoke?Update: A number of our readers have successfully snagged this player (even in-store).
