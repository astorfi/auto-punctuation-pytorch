 As the current gen's console wars wind down in preparation for the coming wave, Sony's still playing a wee bit of catch up. The gaming titan may not be the dominant force it once was, but where its streaming video performance is concerned, the PS3 is an undisputed king. That's according to the company's PlayStation Blog which touts the newly super-slimmed down device as the top platform for Netflix Watch Instantly viewing, even outstripping PC usage. Netflix's CEO Reed Hastings credits the console for being an early adopter testing ground, citing the many experimental updates (i.e., full 1080p with Dolby 5.1, second screen controls and subtitles) it's delivered as firsts to users of the PlayStation 3 over the years. And the company will continue to innovate on the platform, pointing to the novel "Max" voice UI that's currently PS3-only. In all, it's surprising, albeit welcome news given the massive install base of Netflix-capable competitors like the Wii and Xbox 360, not to mention a host of other connected devices.
