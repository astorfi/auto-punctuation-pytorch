 Joining Shenzhen Airlines, Qantas, and a whole host of others, Alaska Air is the newest airline to promise us in-flight WiFi when coming onboard. Reportedly, the firm "will test a system from Row 44, a provider of broadband communication for airlines, on a Boeing 737 in spring 2008," and if all goes well, it will then equip its 114-aircraft fleet with the goods. Notably, Alaska Air also stated that it had been working with Row 44 "for two years to bring in-flight broadband to market," so here's to hoping that all that hard work pays off early next year.
