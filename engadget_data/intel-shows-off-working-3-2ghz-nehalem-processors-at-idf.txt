Performance numbers are being closely guarded, but quad-core samples are clocked at 3.2GHz, and it's expected that Nehalem chips will offer up to a 30 percent performance increase at the same clock speeds over Core 2 processors. Of course, the name still sounds like a particularly violent sneeze, but you know Intel's running some hard-core focus groups right now to fix that problem.
