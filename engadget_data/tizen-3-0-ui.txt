Tizen, the progeny of MeeGo, LiMo and Bada, hasn't exactly set the world on fire. But even if manufacturers and consumers aren't clamoring for yet another smartphone platform, that doesn't mean Samsung and Intel are simply going to let the OS wither and die. In fact, version 3.0 of the UI is well on its way, and it appears to be up and running Galaxy S 4 hardware. The new look is flatter, squarer and much more inline with current design trends. Gone are the slightly cartoonish and round elements that have now been adopted by Mozilla for Firefox OS. The bright and varied color palate remains, however, giving Tizen a much more whimsical appearance than Android or Windows Phone. Though the images at the source link are hardly a thorough tour of the new UI, you can see that there are detailed lockscreen alerts and you can get a quick glance at the music player. Now it's just a waiting game to see if Samsung will actually release a high-end Tizen phone based on the S 4 to consumers... but we're not exactly holding our breath.
