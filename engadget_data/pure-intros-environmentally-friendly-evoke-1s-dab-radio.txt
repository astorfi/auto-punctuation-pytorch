This device supports the optional ChargePAK, features an OLED display, and is compatible with textSCAN and Intellitext as well. Furthermore, the 3.5-millimeter auxiliary jack enables your favorite DAP to get some play time through this too, and the built-in FM tuner is always around for backup. Most notable, however, is the uber-green approach Pure took when designing this unit, as it arrives in packaging made from a minimum of 70-percent recycled material, consumes just one-watt of power in standby, is finished with water-based varnish, and includes documentation printed on 100-percent recycled paper. The EVOKE-1S will be available in real maple or cherry veneer, and will only run you Â£99.99 ($202) this September.[Via T3]
