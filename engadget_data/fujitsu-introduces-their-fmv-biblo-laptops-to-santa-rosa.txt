The lithe 13.3-inch MG series (pictured) start at just 1.58-kg (3.48-pounds) and 22.4-mm (0.88-inches) yet come slammed with up to 4GB of memory, 802.11a/b/g WiFi, 120GB 5400rpm SATA disk, and a multi-bay drive for a DL DVD burner or extra battery for up to 9.2-hours of untethered operation. Unfortunately, they don't specify which CPU this lappie is running. The NF series on the other hand, slaps a Santa Rosa generation, T5500 Core 2 Duo processor with 800MHz FSB (Front Side Bus) inside a 15.4-inch rig with additional support for ExpressCard/54. Fujitsu also announced seasonal updates to their AV-centric 17-inch NX series and 10.6-inch LOOX T-series. The NX gets some updated Core 2 Duos (non Santa Rosa editions) to accompany some serious AV expansion-works while the LOOX T welcomes a bump to an ULV Core Duo processor. All available in April for prices ranging from ¥420,000 (about $3,521) for the NX on down to about ¥150,000 ($1,257) for a bare-bones NF model. Pics of 'em all after the break.
