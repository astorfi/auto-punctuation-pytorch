 Cross-platform game compatibility and syncing aren't anything new, but there have been few if any games that truly make us feel at home when we switch devices. Developer 17-Bit's just-launched Skulls of the Shogun bucks that trend in style as the first game with a unified experience across every one of Microsoft's platforms. Start a game on a Windows 8 or RT PC, Windows Phone or Xbox 360, and cloud saves will carry over with nary a hitch in sight. Turn-based multiplayer works the same way: anyone involved in a match can play from whichever device is convenient, rather than give up a big screen or mobility. We just wish the undead strategy game's prices enjoyed the same level of consistency -- Skulls costs $5 on Windows Phone, $10 on Windows PCs and 1,200 points on the Xbox. Still, we'll bite if it means squeezing in one more round on our Surface.
