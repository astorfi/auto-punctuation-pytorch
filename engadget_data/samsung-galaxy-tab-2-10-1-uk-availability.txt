Having been up for grabs here in the US since way back in May, it's now looking like Sammy's second-gen Tab 10.1 is finally ready to make its official retail debut across the pond. According to Carphone Warehouse, the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1's "expected" to be in stock as early as next week -- or, August 22nd to be exact -- in the United Kingdom, with the base 16GB, WiFi-only flavor set to be priced at a mere £300, while £100 more gets you the model that's also sporting 3G connectivity. Better yet, the retailer's taking pre-orders as we speak, so click on either of the source links below and choose the Tab 2 10.1 variant best suited for your slate needs.
