Given how many 3DS XL liveries Nintendo has teased of late, collectors are liable to go broke trying to catch 'em all. Fresh out of Japan is yet another pair of the gaming giant's extra large -- or LL -- handhelds , except this time they're sporting orange and black (just in time for autumn!) and turquoise and black color schemes instead of game-specific branding. Come November 28th, you'll have the privilege of dropping 19,900 yen ($204) for a bundle that includes a 4GB memory card, carrying pouch and the previously a la carte AC adapter. Sure, last year's bundles may have let you hunt monsters, but these new models are cheaper even after subtracting the price of a free game. Who said Nintendo never gave you anything?
