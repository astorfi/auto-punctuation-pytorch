 Taiwan-based DigiTimes is back this morning with more 15.4-inch MacBook rumors. According to "industry sources in Taiwan," Apple is prepping for a Q2 release of the bigger, badder cousin to their 13.3-inch MacBook -- aligning nicely with the "May 2007" date we heard back in October. However, it's not the manufacturer of the 13.3-inch MacBook -- Asustech Computer -- that won the contract. Nope, instead Apple selected Quanta Computer who along with Foxconn pump out the MacBook Pro line-up. Now move along kids, it's just a rumor, there's nothing more to see here... until May of course.
