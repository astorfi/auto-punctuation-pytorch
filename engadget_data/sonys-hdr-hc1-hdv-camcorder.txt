We're still not sold on that whole "The year of HD"
shtick that Sony and Apple put on back in January, but though the actual distribution options for HD may be lacking,
one thing's for sure: Sony put out a fine HDV cam this year in the
HDR-HC1. You can score the
well-reviewed shooter for $1700, much more than a
standard definition model, but if the extra pixels are worth it to you, the HC1 delivers about the best 1080i images
available in a consumer camera â€” and the 10x optical zoom and 2.7-inch touchscreen LCD sure don't hurt none,
either.
