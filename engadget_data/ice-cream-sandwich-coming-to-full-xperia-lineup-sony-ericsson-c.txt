Today, this forthcoming upgrade has become officially official, though details remain equally fuzzy. "We can today confirm that we plan to upgrade the entire 2011 Xperia portfolio to the next version of Android known as Android 4.0 or Ice Cream Sandwich," the company wrote in a blog post this morning. "We are working on merging our current Xperia experience with the new features in Android 4.0." The update will encompass all Xperia Arc, Play and Pro handsets, as well as the company's Live with Walkman device, though we'll have to wait a little longer for details on release and availability. As always, we'll be sure to keep you up to date.
