Memcorp, in conjunction with the ConsumerProduct Safety Commission, is recalling 102,000 battery packs for Disney-branded portable DVD players sold at themeparks and through Disney's online catalog from April 2005 through last month due to reports of overheating. Apparentlythe batteries, which were included with five different models (full list available by following the "Read"link), have drawn 17 complaints with regards to their toasty nature, including three reports each of property damageand minor skin irritation. This certainly isn't the first incidence of faulty batteries that we've seen, but usuallymanufacturers are thoughtful enough not to package them with products intended for children.
