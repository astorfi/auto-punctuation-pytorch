 ZTE must be onto us, for we love a good mystery. The company took to Twitter to tease "one of the most advanced gaming smartphones," which it says will be in customer hands just six days from now. With so few breadcrumbs, it's difficult to determine whether ZTE intends to unveil a genuinely new smartphone, or whether it's merely hyping the release of a known product. While we'd love to see a brand new device -- perhaps based on the Adreno 320 GPU -- a plausible argument can also be made for the alternative. During Mobile World Congress, the company announced its flagship phone, the quad-core Tegra 3 Era, and the handset has been completely absent from the radar ever since. While the Era boasts only a 4.3-inch qHD display, it was said to arrive during the second half of this year -- might the stars simply be aligning with a bit of marketing fluff? Only time will reveal this gamer's true identity, but it seems we won't have long to wait.
