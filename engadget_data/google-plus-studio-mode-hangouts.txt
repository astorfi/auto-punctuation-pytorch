That works perfectly well for broadcasting your e-cooking lessons and all, but Mountain View has higher standards when it comes to live-streaming music. The just-announced Studio Mode for Hangouts On Air optimizes audio for music rather than speech, resulting in richer, clearer sound than what you'll get with the standard Voice Mode. Musicians simply select Studio Mode under settings -- other members of the hangout don't have to do anything. Check out a demo of the new feature below the break.
