After a less than spectacular couple of months for sales in the Greater China area, Tim Cook paid a visit to Beijing to speak with China Mobile chairman Xi Guohua. Apple's CEO was there to "discuss matters of cooperation," according to Reuters, a conversation that no doubt included bringing iPhones and iPads to the the carrier's massive subscriber base.
