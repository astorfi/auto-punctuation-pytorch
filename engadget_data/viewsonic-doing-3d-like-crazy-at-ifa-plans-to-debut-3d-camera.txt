You run your hand along the book's well-worn spine, then crack open the yellowing pages to the spot you were at last. Suddenly you put the book down. Where are you? You stand up and take off your glasses, looking around frantically at your surroundings. Where are you?

Well, you're not in Berlin, Germany between the dates of September 1st and 7th, attending IFA. ViewSonic just announced, no, threatened an onslaught of 3D product for the upcoming tradeshow, including a 720p 3D camcorder that will pack a built-in 3D display for a mere $300 (we're sure it will be delightful). Details are scarce, but our guess would be that it'll utilize a glasses-free 3D display akin to Nintendo's 3DS or the Fujifilm Finepix Real 3D W3. Other 3D members of the brood will include a 3D handheld TV, 3D stills camera, and a 3D photo frame -- all of which will undoubtedly scream quality. As if that wasn't enough, ViewSonic will also be showing off a 7-inch Android tablet dubbed the ViewPad 7, along with a 10-inch tablet that can dual boot to Android and Windows. PR is after the break, we'll let you get back to your book.

Update: Does that 3D camera (the two images on the left) look familiar? It should, it's almost certainly a rebadge of the Aiptek i2. Poor Viewsonic, what happened to you?
