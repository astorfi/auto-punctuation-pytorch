Google has lately taken to highlighting tablet-native Android apps; it only makes sense that the company would devote the same kind of love to Chromecast owners. Accordingly, the search firm has recently posted a Chromecast section in Google Play for those browsing from their Android devices. The selection is thin at the moment -- you'll find only Google's media apps, HBO Go, Hulu Plus, Netflix and Pandora. Still, the section should be a handy one-stop shop for anyone eager to stream video on their TV -- and might have a few more entries soon.
