Make no mistake, Pioneer is awfully proud of this creation, as an on-site rep was claiming that it was "the best Blu-ray player on the market" while bragging to onlookers. 'Course, this Elite device does tout some of the nicest specs we've seen, and yes, it pained us to leave the booth without being able to bring one home. Bottom line: this "reference quality" BD player looked incredibly good in person, and judging by how well Pioneer's other Elite merchandise has been received, we've got high hopes for this one.
