 Microsoft and Motorola continue to duke it out in courts across the world, and it looks like the Google-owned manufacturer has just chalked up a victory in Europe. Based on a pair of patents involved the H.264 video codec, the Mannheim regional court ruled on four lawsuits between the two companies, granting an injunction against the continued distribution of Windows 7, Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player and the Xbox 360 in Germany. Microsoft has already upped sticks from the country to reduce the effect of its current legal predicament. FOSS Patents reports that Motorola won't be able to immediately enforce the ruling. The company is still being investigated by the EU over possible antitrust violations related to licensing its patents -- something that could further complicate today's ruling.

 Update: Microsoft's just got in touch to comment on the recent ruling -- it doesn't look like it's over just yet:

  "This is one step in a long process, and we are confident that Motorola will eventually be held to its promise to make its standard essential patents available on fair and reasonable terms for the benefit of consumers who enjoy video on the web. Motorola is prohibited from acting on today's decision, and our business in Germany will continue as usual while we appeal this decision and pursue the fundamental issue of Motorola's broken promise.
