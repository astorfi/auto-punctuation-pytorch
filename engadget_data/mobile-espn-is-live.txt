 We'll understand ifyou didn't have enough time yesterday, between basking in the glow of your new high def rig, pounding beers, andmunching on god-knows-what to check to see if that Mobile ESPNhandset you pre-ordered is active, but service officially started yesterday. Certainly no surprisefor anyone anticipating getting all that hot sports content on the go, but now that the switch's been flipped you canfeel free to start peeping those thrill-of-victory / agony-of-defeat clips while actually at dinner with yoursignificant other. Good luck, mates.
