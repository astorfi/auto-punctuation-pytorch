 
 The company most famous for its plasma lineup, now has sixteen new LCD TVs for 2013, many of which featuring IPS displays and 3D. The top four of the six lines are 1080p and feature the latest Viera Connect with personalized home screen and Swipe & Share (for sharing photos and video from your smartphone or tablet with the flick of a finger). The same four also feature the accessibility feature, Voice Guidance, but only the WT60 and DT60 can be controlled by voice -- although it isn't full on voice control. They will start to become available this spring, with the top-of-the-line WT60 setting itself apart by featuring a built-in camera, 2D-3D conversion and a special ISFccc Calibration Mode. An interesting offering, no doubt, but still missing many features from the Panasonic plasma line, and there are no new Ultra HD models to respond to the behemoths offered by the competition. Even more details to follow in the press release below, but don't go looking for prices, because they aren't there.
