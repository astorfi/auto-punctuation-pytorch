A trifecta of launch devices is on tap, says the Wall Street Journal, with one each from LG, Samsung and HTC, and AT&T is unsurprisingly fingered as the exclusive early carrier for WP7 goodness. In exchange for that little favor, Microsoft will receive AT&T's "marketing support" in pushing the message out about Windows Phone 7's release. So long as nobody decides that home party packs are a good idea, we'll be cool with whatever.
