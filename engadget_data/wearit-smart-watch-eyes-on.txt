It'd be hard to go hands-on with the WearIT smart watch given that it's still very much a prototype and its touchscreen is ... well, it's not enabled yet. But we did get a chance to put our hands to the device and snap a gaggle of pictures, highlighting its 1.54-inch capacitive touchscreen and trio of buttons (each of which will correspond to specific applications, we're told). The concept with WearIT's watch is that it's a standalone device -- "We're getting closer to Dick Tracy every day," a company rep told us. While the device isn't quite up to Tracy's standards (no phone functionality, for instance), it assuredly packs more power than the aging detective's wrist gadget.


A Cortex A8 600 MHz CPU and 256MB of RAM are at the heart of the smart watch, backed up by a 550 mAh lithium ion rechargeable battery. 4GB of storage is embedded inside, along with 802.11 b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth / Bluetooth LE, ANT+, and a USB 2.0 port (when using the charging clip, included with the watch). Oh, and it runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, though it's pared down considerably for the screen size. We'll have a much closer look at WearIT's smart watch later this year -- the device is expected to arrive in the US starting in November and will retail for $400.
