Measuring up to a mere 27 x 20 x 10 cm (just under 11 x 8 x 4 inches) in the classic and classy "box" configuration, what appears to be a Betamax VCR at first glance is actually a reasonably stacked PC. The machine boasts a 1.6 GHz Atom CPU and up to 2GB RAM; oddly, the site says it sports a "generous" six USB ports, while the pictures clearly show only four and a single firewire jack (which they failed to mention altogether). The Abaco comes loaded with Ubuntu 8.04. Available in Desktop, Thin Client and Solid State flavors, according to your needs. Price varies by configuration, and needless to say, this isn't available Stateside.Update: According to an email from Abaco, we weren't seeing things when we noted a firewire port in those pictures on the site: they were promo shots from a different unit, albeit one with the same case.
