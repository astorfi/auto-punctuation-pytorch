Facebook made some changes to its data use policy late last year (in addition to some changes to its actual process for making changes), and it's now back with another set of updates. As Facebook's Chief Privacy Office Erin Egan explains, the new changes affect two of its key documents -- its Data Use Policy and Statement of Rights and Responsibilities -- and they come as a result of a settlement in a court case concerning its use of personal data in advertising. Among the changes are a revised explanation of "how things like your name, profile picture and content may be used in connection with ads or commercial content," which Facebook says will now "make it clear that you are granting Facebook permission for this use when you use our services."


The data use policy also encompasses data retention by third parties, who Facebook says you must contact directly if you wish to have your personal data deleted, even if you have deleted the third-party application itself. As AllThingsD notes, your profile picture will also now figure more prominently in Facebook's facial-recognition system for photo tagging, although you can still opt out of that if you like. These are also all still just proposed changes for the time being; under its new process, Facebook users have seven days to offer their comments, but no vote will take place.
