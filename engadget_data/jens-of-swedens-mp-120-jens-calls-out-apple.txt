Ah, Jens of Sweden, a taste that only gets better with
age. Their latest stylie player challenges the iPod
shuffleâ€”literally, as in the first line of their press release. In fact, on Apple's and Microsoft's DRM, Jens
Nylander said, "We don't think iTunes Penitentiary will make everyone happy." Bold words, but the shuffle's still the
flash player to beat these days, but we can kind of understand how all the guys who've been doing flash players forever
have to come out with fists of fury to prove themselves once
over. Their attention-commanding "sober midnight black" 1GB MP-120 features USB 2.0, a 128 x 64 OLED screen, and plays
MP3, WMA, ASF, and OGG for 22 hours on its built-in battery. Oh, Jens.
