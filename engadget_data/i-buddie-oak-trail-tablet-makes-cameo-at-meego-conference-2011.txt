We were loitering around the Intel booth here at the MeeGo Conference in San Francisco when we spotted this lonely little device resting unsupervised in the back, so we decided to give it a whirl and snap some pictures. It turns out it's a circa 10-inch tablet made by i-Buddie and built on Intel's recent Oak Trail architecture. Of course it's running MeeGo Tablet UI, but sadly we were unable to connect to the Internet -- something to do with missing WiFi drivers, according to the Intel rep who eventually caught up with us to snatch the tablet from our eager paws. We missed the opportunity to make a video, but take a look at our hands-on gallery below.
