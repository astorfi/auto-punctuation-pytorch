Not Ford -- at least, not this year. The company has had a significant presence here at CES for the past few years and, in 2011, it's going to really ramp things up by announcing a whole new car. Or, at least, an electric version of an existing one. We don't know the details yet (other than it having a silly glowing plug door), but there's an all-electric Focus set to be unveiled at 11:00am local time (that's 2:00 in the afternoon east coasters) on Friday. The conference will be livestreaming if you want to play along at home, but rest assured we'll be there too.
