The pair of monitors are purportedly best matched in one's recording studio, as they feature an integrated 50-watt dynamic amplifier, built-in iPod dock, a pair of auxiliary inputs, S-Video output, and a fully enclosed power supply to boot. Additionally, users can control the action from afar with the wireless infrared remote, and Pod owners should be delighted that they can pick a set up in a black, red, or the oh-so-trendy white color scheme. Set to ship later this month, the iN STUDIO 5.0s will run you just under four Benjamins.[Via iLounge]
