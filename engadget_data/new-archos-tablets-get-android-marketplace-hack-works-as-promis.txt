But while you've been able to sideload the Market apk on lots of these devices, there were apparently compatibility issues with Archos' new Android 2.1 / 2.2 tablets (like the Archos 32 we reviewed just a few weeks). But fear not: ArchosFans to the rescue! A forum member successfully complied a new gApps4Archos.apk that can be easily sideloaded, and installed to give you access to all that Google app and Marketplace goodness. Obviously, we whipped out our 32 and tried it out ourselves. We did have a few issues at first -- you must have the latest 1.0.70 firmware and we had to reboot a few times to successfully connect to Google's servers -- but we were finally able to log into our Gmail and download Pandora. If you're adventurous enough to try it out for yourself, we'd suggest hitting the source link and getting to it. Oh, and feel free to let us know how it goes in the comments.
