Even better still, in our humble opinion, is expressing yourself in full-color with a setof Dub's new "PimpStar" rims (other Dub models: Big Homie, Dirty Dog, Ganja Floater, and C.R.E.A.M. -- CashRules Everything Around Me), which sport a strip of LEDs down each spoke that display the message of your choice whileyou're rollin'. Far doper than either the TireTagz or taxi-mounted ad floaters thatwe've seen before, the PimpStar wheels incorporate a microprocessor and wireless modem so you can configure yourpicture, logo, or message from your laptop while you're driving (although the rest of us would prefer that youutilitize the slideshow option instead). We'll agree that $19,500 is a lot for a set of wheels and tires, but we'd alsoargue that nothing impresses both the homies and the hunnies quite like twenty-six-inch rims blazing the bright blue"e" logo as you creep down the mean streets of Silicon Valley or Silicon Alley pumping the latest podcast.Make sure to follow the Read link for a pretty crunk vid of these crazy rims wildin' out.[Via Leftlane News, thanks toeveryone who sent this in]
