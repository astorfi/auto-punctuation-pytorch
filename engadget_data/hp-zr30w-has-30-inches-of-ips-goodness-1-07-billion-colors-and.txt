HP is refreshing its Performance Display line with the new ZR30w, a 30-inch S-IPS panel whose 1.07 billion colors comfortably cover 100 percent of the sRGB and 99 percent of the Adobe RGB color ranges. That makes a compelling argument for those who place color accuracy high on their list of priorities, and there's also a 2,560 x 1,600 resolution to tempt folks tired of 16:9 display ratios. The minimal bezel and brushed aluminum design finish off the appealing package, but there's one hurdle most of us won't be able to overcome: a $1,299 sticker. As if to illustrate the eternal proverb that you get what you pay for, HP is also bringing out a pair of dirt cheap Compaq monitors today, but you'll have to skip past the break to see them and their spec sheets.
