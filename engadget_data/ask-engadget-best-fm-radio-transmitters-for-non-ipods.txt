The iPod gets most of the good love when it comes to digital audio player accessories, but for this week's
Ask Engadget reader Gregory Y. would like to know if there are any decent FM
radio transmitters for players besides the iPod:



I've had a Sony NW-HD3 MP3
 player since February and have been wondering what other good FM radio transmitters are out there besides the ones
 that are specific for the iPod.



Obviously anything with a standard 3.5mm plug should do the trick, can anyone out there recommend a really good one
for him?
