It seems like just about everyone is testing out the questionable UMPC waters of late, as just days after seeing the niche BumbleBee offering, Gigabyte is purportedly looking to dish out a handheld computer of its own at next month's CeBIT. Although details are admittedly scant, the proposed U60 will tout a swank slide-out / split keyboard approach, a 6.5-inch 800 x 600 resolution display, integrated 802.11b/g, your choice of 20GB / 30GB 1.8-inch hard drives, a pair of USB ports, SD / MMC flash card readers, and a mysterious C7-M processor. Unfortunately, that's about all the information that's been leaked on the 1.59-pound device thus far, but we should know plenty more when the floor opens up in mid-March.[Via UnwiredView]
