Sleek -- which tickled our ears quite pleasantly with last year's SA1 -- is apparently gearing up to unveil something special here at CES. Mum's the word on what, exactly, but judging by the image above, we're assuming it'll be a pair of high-end wireless (Kleer?) headphones with the backing of 50 Cent. You'll also notice a svelte carbon fiber exterior, which ought to flex just right as the low-lows are passing through its drivers. Head on past the break for the full image, and keep it locked right here as we dig for more.

Update: An eagle-eyed tipster has spotted a gallery's worth of shots on 50's Twitter page, and lo and behold, it looks like he's already scored a pair!
