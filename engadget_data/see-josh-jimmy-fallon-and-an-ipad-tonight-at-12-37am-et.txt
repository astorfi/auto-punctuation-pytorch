Avatar star Sam Worthington and the band Liquid Liquid! Tune in to your local NBC station tonight (we've got the times listed below) -- and we'll be sure to post some video as soon as it's available. 

P.S.: We'll have our full iPad review up tomorrow bright and early, so be sure and check back before you head to a store.
