  Consider it a bit of a rebirth. Cricket's premiere smartphone, the Huawei Mercury -- known elsewhere as the Honor -- has just taken on a new life as a member of the carrier's Muve Music lineup. Beginning today, current owners may add the unlimited music subscription service to their phone via an over-the-air download. The requisite Muve Music plan is available for $65/month, which is a $10 premium over the carrier's traditional no-contract Android offering. The service comes with unlimited music downloads, ringtones and ringback tones, along with unlimited calling, messaging and 1GB of mobile data. For a quick refresh on the Mercury itself, the phone retails for $230 without contract, and highlights include a 1.4GHz processor, a 4-inch, 854 x 480 TFT-LCD display, an 8MP rear camera -- and now, an endless supply of tunes. Ready to rock out? You'll find the full PR after the break.
