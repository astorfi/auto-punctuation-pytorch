Even if you don't feel like coughing up the cash for either the iPhone 5c or iPhone 5s, those eligible for an update (that's if you own an iPhone 4 or up, or an iPad 2 onward) can at least console themselves with iOS 7, which debuts today. Gone is the skeuomorphic design of the Forstall era, and in its place is a flatter interface that promises an entirely new experience for iOS devotees. As such, developers everywhere have been scrambling to get their apps redesigned to match the new mobile OS out of Cupertino. While we can't possibly cover every update, we've compiled a quick list after the break of the more substantial app revamps that have come our way.




One of the biggest transformations we've seen comes from popular note-taking app Evernote. Tabs and shadows have been eliminated from the home screen so that sections such as notes, books, tags, shortcuts and announcements are easier to access. Those sections are also now dynamic; they show up when you use them, but disappear when you don't. Other improvements include a quick note shortcut throughout the app, better image annotations, PDF markup for premium customers, AirDrop note sharing and faster overall syncing.


While not quite as meaty, the update from Slacker is fairly dramatic too, with a streamlined interface that includes a tiled home screen and new "My Vibe" playlists that help users select just the right songs for a particular activity (the same look and feel should be coming to Android soon as well). eBay's iOS 7 app comes with features such as refined search capabilities on the iPhone and a "Night Mode" for those late-night shopping sessions on the iPad. Flipboard, meanwhile, incorporated iOS 7's parallax effect to full-screen magazine covers, and Foursquare simply introduced a much flatter design that plays well with the new paradigm shift.

Shazam has improved not just its design, but also its social sharing features, while the new Vimeo app is finally allowing users to upload their videos directly to its service from the Camera and Photo apps. It also now offers instant playback even while offline and AirDrop sharing. We're sure we haven't included all the app updates in this list -- like Pocket, Aviary and Kindle, for example -- so feel free to let us know in the comments of any others we've missed. We'll add more here as we see fit.

Update: Apple has kindly listed all of the apps that have been updated for iOS 7 right here, so head on over to see the full rundown.
