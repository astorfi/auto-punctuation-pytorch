"The remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward, and I've already begun treatment," says Steve. Doctors expect it to take him until late Spring to regain the weight and body mass, and Steve will stay on as CEO during his recovery. Oh, and if you hadn't guessed, Steve isn't so big on the personal stuff: "So now I've said more than I wanted to say, and all that I am going to say, about this."[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]Read - Letter from Apple CEO Steve JobsRead - Statement by Apple's Board of Directors
