We'd seen a bit here and there about Samsung's quirky little
never-going-to-come-to-America (as usual) YP-W3 digital-analog pocket watch/MP3 player, but you know it's really going
to turn heads when someone busts out the Limited Edition version of the thing, all
iced out for real with 0.007 carat diamonds, gold
plated facade, and sapphire glass screen, yo. And yeah, it's still got 1GB of flash memory, plays Ogg, MP3, WMA, WAV,
ASF, and has an FM tuner. But we're going to have to say that no matter what you're going to have to put in some
serious work to pull this thing off classy, Louis Quatorze case or not.
