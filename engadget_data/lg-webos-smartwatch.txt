We can't think of anything that's had more comebacks than webOS, except for maybe The Eagles. Palm, HP and LG have all tried to turn the promising software into a rival for iOS and Android, but so far you'll only find webOS in the Korean company's line of smart TVs. Still, LG appears to be planning to extend the reach of the little operating system that could by baking it into a future line of smartwatches. The Verge has found an LG-sponsored website, since pulled, that promises a development kit for a webOS smartwatch is coming. Ironically, the reveal comes only a few months after LG lost two webOS designers to wearable rival Pebble. Given that the company was quick to make the page disappear (although we've got some more images after the break), and that local rival Samsung keeps Tizen around as a bargaining tool with Google, it's certainly plausible that we'll see a webOS smartwatch in the future. The only question is if, after all this time, anyone will consider buying one.
