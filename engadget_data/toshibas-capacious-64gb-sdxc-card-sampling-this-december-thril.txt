The 64GB device is expected to begin sampling this December, and if all goes well, it should begin pulling in 35MBps write and 60MBps read rates en masse early next year. In related news, a 16GB and 32GB SDHC card from the company should also hit store shelves early in 2010, but really, who's interested in that?
