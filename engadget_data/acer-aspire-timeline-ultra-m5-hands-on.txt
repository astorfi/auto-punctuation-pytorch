Luckily for us, then, both the 14- and 15-inch models are on display here at Computex, right alongside the similar M3 Ultrabook we reviewed earlier this year. Like the M3, they pack NVIDIA's Kepler-based GeForce GT640M graphics and can be configured with solid-state drives, but the M5's design is decidedly more polished, with a brushed metal finish, narrower bezels and backlit keyboard. Nonetheless, some things haven't changed: the keyboard layout is the same, as is the 1366 x 768 TN display and thin chassis, which measures around 20mm thick. No word on availability beyond what we already know, but for now enjoy the hands-on photos and comparison video.
