 One of our favorite review sites has their newest test subject off the block. The Mitsubishi WD-57731 came out on top too. Ultimate AV walked away from the review LOVING the high-def images a lot but wishing for a bit deeper black. This new Mit is a 57-inch 1080p via wobulation DLP based set that has almost every input that you will ever need. We love that this set is following the trend of black bezels rather then cheap silver and chrome. This new model features a new 6-Primary color system that utilizes yellow, cyan and magenta along with the normal red, green and blue. When it is all put into place together, it is said to give you a richer color palette. Mitsubishi has never been huge in the television market. Don't get us wrong, they make quality products but they have never been top sellers, but maybe these newer sets will help them get higher on the food chain. The WD-57731 should be available sometime soon and will retail for $3099. Definitely check out the review if you are looking for more 1080p options besides the current Samsung's and up-coming Sony's.
