Reportedly, a plan was hatched recently at the company's PDP plant in Amagasaki City to release a new plasma display that incorporates a technology to "reduce power consumption by half." Interestingly, said device is slated to launch sometime this Spring, but no further details were given. Moving forward, the company is hoping to bring the power-sipping characteristics to its entire PDP line by fiscal year 2009, but sadly, no model numbers or anything else remotely intriguing were handed out.[Via Widescreen Review]
