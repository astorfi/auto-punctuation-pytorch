We still haven't heard anything official about Google's next Nexus phone, but tonight some people are already seeing the Nexus 5 as an option in the Play Store. Just among our editors, some see the outgoing Nexus 4 while others get the result shown after the break, with a 16GB (from the link in the page, although it doesn't go anywhere) Nexus 5 listed for $349, along with the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10. Previous leaks have given us a good look at the outside while a service manual gave up the internal details: 1080p 4.95-inch display, 2.3GHz Snapdragon 800 CPU, LTE and storage capacity that tops out at 32GB. These screenshots show the Hangouts app where we'd usually expect our SMS icon to be, which is among the software changes we're expecting when this new device arrives with Android 4.4 KitKat some time in the future -- possibly around October 28th.


Update: It looks like Google has plugged the leaky hole, as the page is showing all of us the Nexus 4 once again. Nothing to see here... for now.
