 After Ken Kutaragi straight up told his rivals that he "didn't care" about the so-called competition they were trying to provide, and those very rivals laughed in his face over Sony's countless delays in producing its miracle machine, it seems that we're finally getting a bit of good ole honesty from Sony's "worldwide studios boss," Phil Harrison. Referring to the company's inability to gather up those ever-elusive "blue diodes," he stated that the firm had "overreached in production of the Blu-Ray component," later adding that it was simply the "price you pay for adopting brand new, leading-edge technologies that will be future proof." While we have sincere doubts about any technology being entirely resistant to successors, we certainly appreciate the proclamation that all this delay speculation wasn't without merit. Harrison concluded by suggesting that while these perpetual delays seem like a huge public challenge right now, he's hoping expecting that all the blokes in Europe will be quite forgiving come March of next year, and stated that the entire debacle "will eventually pale into zero." We'll just have to see about that, now won't we?[Via EuroGamer, thanks Garry]
