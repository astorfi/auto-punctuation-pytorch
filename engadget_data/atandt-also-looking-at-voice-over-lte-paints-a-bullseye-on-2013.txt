 With great bandwidth comes great responsibility is a lesson not lost on AT&T, as the cellular carrier has revealed it will follow Verizon's lead in improving call quality with Voice over LTE. Following Verizon's impressive demo of the technology this morning, Forbes cornered AT&T CTO John Donovan at MWC, who confessed that AT&T is working on something similar for a tentative 2013 release. That may sound a bit far off, but remember that Verizon won't launch its service until 2012, and AT&T won't hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony for LTE until later this year anyhow. In the meanwhile, you're welcome to use your occasionally unlimited data for all the Skype you want.
