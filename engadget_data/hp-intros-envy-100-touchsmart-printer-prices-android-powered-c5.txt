It reportedly has a pair of mechanical paper trays that open and close like a CD drive, and CNET says it'll ship October 4th for $249. Before you take those figures verbatim though, know that they might not be quite right, as the publication also says the $399 Android-powered HP Photosmart eStation C510 (aka Zeus with 7-inch Zeen tablet) is coming September 13th -- a day when, we're sure you'll agree, the printer failed to arrive. 

Also apparently slated for September 13th is the HP Officejet Pro 8500A Plus, a full-size all-in-one inkjet model with a 4.3-inch touchscreen, now imbued with HP ePrintCenter apps. Why sit and talk to co-workers around that boring water-cooler, when you can play with your office's printer instead? Two more pictures of the Envy 100 after the break, which is apparently badass enough to come with its own tote bag and 802.11n WiFi.

Update: We're waiting for the HP IPG summit news conference to begin and, well, three guesses what that is hanging out on stage (pictured above). There's a second shot after the break, with a Yahoo search widget clearly on display.

Update 2: Now official, dubbed the Photosmart eStation AIO, and unless our eyes deceive us, we definitely spotted an Android lock screen and status bar. All for $399. There's a partnership in place with Yahoo, including numerous widgets (we've spotted search and weather so far). Something tells us there won't be another search option, but we'll find out for sure and let ya know. It's currently being demoed live on stage. Google Calendar is there, as is a web browser. 

Update 3: Hands-on!
