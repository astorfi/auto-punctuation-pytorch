Promising not only continued support for current Moxi customers but also plans to continue to develop and market the line of products, it appears the communications company sees this as a way to expand its own networking expertise. The cost to snap up Digeo's IP, 75 employees and other assets? A mere $20 million cash - we expect to find out more details via conference call tomorrow, any questions you want answered about the future of Moxi? Let us know in the comments, whether this means the UI will get a makeover is already on our list.
