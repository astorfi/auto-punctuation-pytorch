Speaking of devices finally getting their prices,
iRobot's decided on a value of monetary worth for
their floor scrubbin' roboservant, the Scooba. Assuming
you haven't already inspected the headline, we won't keep you in suspense any longer: it'll be $399.99 (according to
the site) when it sells in November (according to I4U). No one will notice if we don't mop anymore from here on out,
right?
