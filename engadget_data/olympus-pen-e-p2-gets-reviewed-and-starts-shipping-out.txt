Just in time for the holidays, don'tcha know? If you're still wondering if $1,099.99 is worth blowing on this, The Online Photographer has published an hands-on critique, complete with a few luscious sample shots and interesting gripes about the viewfinder. Make no mistake -- the image quality looks fabulous, but man, that MSRP. It's large.
