The word on the street is that on Monday both the FCC and the Justice Department are going to give their official
blessing to Cingular and AT&T Wireless' mega-merger, leaving no barrier to the creation of the nation's largest
wireless carrier. Buyer's remorse aside (seriously, it's a little insane that Cingular paid $41 billion for AT&T
Wireless), the big question is whether or not the shrinking of the cellular market from six major players to five will
lead to significantly cheaper prices for calling plans and cellphones. Either way, expect things to get down and dirty
between Cingular and archrival Verizon beginning next year.
