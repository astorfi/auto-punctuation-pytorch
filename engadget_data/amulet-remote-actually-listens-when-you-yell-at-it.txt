The Amulet Remote, designed specifically for Vista Media Center but likely adaptable to other setups, is a voice-activated controller that enables users to record a series, watch a recorded show, skip to a new playlist or queue up a photo slideshow by simply hooting and hollering. The built-in microphone is there to take whatever vocal abuse you feel is warranted, and there are even a few actual buttons if you're still fond of the tried-and-true approach. It's expected to ship in March for a palatable $299; have a look at what it can do for you in the video after the break.[Thanks, Vanbrothers]
