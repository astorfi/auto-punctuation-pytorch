 We're just about to give both Nokia and Qualcomm some fightin' gloves if the two can't find some happy middle ground between their constant sparring in the press and on the telecom stage. In the latest round, Qualcomm has filed two new lawsuits against Nokia for -- you guessed it -- alleged infringement of five patents. Of concern to Qualcomm this month week is the company's apparent ownership of anything related to the abbreviation CDMA, as it sees Nokia using its technology used in some of its phones for the downloading of applications over wireless networks and related infringing against speech encoders used in certain Nokia handsets. Qualcomm, 0. Nokia, 0. For today, at least.
