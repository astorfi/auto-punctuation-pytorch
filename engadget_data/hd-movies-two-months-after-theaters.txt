 You can't fight it Hollywood:folks want their first run high-def movies and they want to view them in the comfort of their own theater. We chattedwith Mark Cuban last year on thewhole "release in theaters and DVD and TV" concept; looks like Fox was listening. The COO of News. Corp,Peter Chernin, indicates that Fox is working on a 60-dayplan: 20th Century Fox movies hit HD releases within 60 days of the theater release. Oh, how 21st century ofthem!We haven't seen a movie in the theater since "E.T." (the original, mind you), so afterspending mucho dollars on high-def equipment for the home, we're all over this. Granted, we need some HD-DVD or Blu-Raylove as the final piece to this puzzle, but for now we're hoping that the high-def releases become available over cableor satellite. It's possible that local Fox affiliates could pick these up, but that's not likely based on thefinancial impacts.Read [via HDBlog.net]
