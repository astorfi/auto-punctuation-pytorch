  Sony Ericsson took the wraps off a pair of new Walkman phones today, including the company's first to boast that oft-desired HSDPA connectivity. Starting with the more familiar territory, the company's W580 slider handset will give you quad-band GSM/EDGE connectivity, along with a 2-inch QVGA display, 2 megapixel digital camera, an FM radio, and Bluetooth 2.0, among other Walkman-related features, all in 14 mm thick package. The Z750 clamshell phone, on the other hand, adds that aforementioned tri-band HSPDA action to the mix, along with a slightly larger 2.2-inch display, and the same 2 megapixel camera, FM radio, and Bluetooth 2.0. Look for it to roll out in the third quarter of this year as well, with "Phantom Grey" model also available for those that don't dig the pink look.Read - Sony Ericsson, W580Read - Sony Ericsson, Z750[Via HowardForums]
