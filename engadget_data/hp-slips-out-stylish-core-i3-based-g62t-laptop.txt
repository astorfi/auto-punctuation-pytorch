Equally respectable are the laptop's specs, which include a standard Core i3 processor (upgradable to Core i5 or i7), 3GB of RAM, a 160GB hard drive, a 15.6-inch LED-backlit display, and a DVD burner (upgradable to Blu-ray if you like). The biggest downside is the non-upgradeable integrated Intel HD graphics -- but with a starting price of $699 (and plenty of HP coupons floating around), we're guessing plenty of folks will be willing to accept that slight drawback.
