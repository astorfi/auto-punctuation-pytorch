A spate of tipsters (as well as our own Richard Lawler) have confirmed this evening that Sprint's latest whiz-bang superphone is indeed on sale to an elite few, with $199.99 netting you the handset along with a particularly daunting two-year ball / chain combination. $549.99 buys it outright, but there's no clear indication on if these are indeed shipping out in the morning. Either way, we're guessing it's going to be mighty hard to resist this fellow -- you know, Because life is in 3D.
