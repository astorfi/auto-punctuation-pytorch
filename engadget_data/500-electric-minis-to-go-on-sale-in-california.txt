The main assembly of the silver hatchbacks with yellow roofs (apart from the drivetrain) will be completed in Oxford, England, with the batteries and motor installed in Munich. After arriving in the US, just 490 lucky Golden Staters will be able to pick one up -- the other 10 will be show cars. Since BMW hasn't formally announced the plan yet, there's no word on pricing or availability, but something tells us there's not going to be any shortage of buyers when these things hit the streets.[Via Autoblog Green]
