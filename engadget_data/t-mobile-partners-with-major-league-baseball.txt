 As if managers of MLB teams didn't have enough to look forward to with the upcoming baseball season, many of 'em will be staring at one of these contraptions in the dugout. Today, T-Mobile announced a multi-year partnership with Major League Baseball in which the magenta carrier will provide an on-field communication system that links team managers in the dugout to coaches in the bullpen. Naturally, the setup will operate over T-Mobile's wireless network. With the deal in place, T-Mobile subscribers will gain access to exclusive MLB content. For what it's worth, we can also look forward to the carrier's role as presenting sponsor of ESPN's Wednesday Night Baseball. Hey, it's one way to get the word out about those unlimited plans.
