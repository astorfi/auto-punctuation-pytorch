We'll admit to being puzzled by Sony's recently uncovered QX10 and QX100 lens cameras -- how do they work? Thankfully, SonyAlphaRumors has answered some of our questions with a leaked user manual. Both cameras are mostly independent from their mobile hosts, with each getting its own battery and storage. The two should also have their own shutter buttons and zoom levers, although the QX100 adds a ring control to go along with its larger sensor. The manual still doesn't answer questions about price or availability, but there's a chance that Sony will fill in those blanks at its IFA press event next month.
