 Korea's ETNews doesn't have a flawless track record with Samsung leaks, but it's hoping to revive its reputation with this latest sliver of gossip. It's suggesting that the company is going after those people who think the Galaxy Note is a bit on the weeny side by releasing the 6.3-inch Galaxy Mega. The device, which is codenamed "Project MÃ¶bius," is likely to come with a dual-core Exynos chip, 8-megapixel rear camera and a 2-megapixel shooter up front. On the other hand, SamMobile has thrown out a bucket-load of specs to say that we could see a 5.8-inch Mega with a low-res 960 x 540 display, a 1.4GHz Exynos CPU and 1.5GB of RAM. We get the sense that neither device is coming with bleeding-edge specs and will instead slot into the mid-range tiers of the company's product lineup -- assuming they exist at all. Either way, at least we've managed to get through a whole post without using the word "phablet"... damnit!
