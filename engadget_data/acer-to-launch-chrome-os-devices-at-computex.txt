  Acer said it would be first to market with a Chrome OS netbook, and it's looking like it may meet that lofty goal. Sources told VentureBeat that the company will debut multiple new products featuring the cloud-based operating system at Computex in June, less than three weeks from now. Then again, Chrome OS has been slated for the second half of 2010 for some time, so Acer may not be alone in introducing insanely-quick boot times at the show. We could even see devices earlier; we've been invited to an Acer press event in NYC on the last week of May, and it's not too late for Samsung, Asus or Verizon to show off a partner device at Google I/O. It's going to be a exciting few weeks, eh?
