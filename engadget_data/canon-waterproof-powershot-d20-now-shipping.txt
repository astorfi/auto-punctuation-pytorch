 Planning on trekking down to Costa Rica this summer? How's about a jaunt to Moorea? Or, you know, the local YMCA. Wherever your summer (or winter, for those south of the magical equator) journeys take you, Canon's PowerShot D20 is eager and willing to capture memories without worrying over being splished or splashed. The aforesaid waterproof camera -- a healthy refresh to the D10 we so loved years back -- is now shipping, with Amazon listing it at $309. For those who've forgotten, there's a 12.1 megapixel CMOS sensor, a 5x image-stabilized zoom, 28mm wide-angle lens, inbuilt GPS tracking for the avid geotaggers (which sadly doesn't work underwater) and a three-inch LCD 'round back.
