 Getting yourself into a new Tesla is going to get a little easier in 2013. The company opened 13 stores in 2012, but this year has designs to double that. On the show floor of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, George Blankenship, VP of sales, confirmed a plan that will see 25 new retail locations opening throughout 2013, with half of those in the US and the other half abroad. This includes the company's first location in China, which is due to open its doors in the spring.

 The company also re-committed to covering the US with Supercharger charging stations. Only eight are operational now, most on the west coast, but the company plans to cover both coasts in the coming years and then, eventually, connect the two so that you can drive from Boston to LA without burning a drop of fuel -- and without spending a dime, since use of the chargers will be free for Tesla owners. No firm details on when the company's $30k entry-level machine will be launching, but we were at least told it's still at least a few years out
