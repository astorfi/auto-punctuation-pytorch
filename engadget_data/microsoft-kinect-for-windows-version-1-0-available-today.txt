  Today is the day fine folks -- Kinect for Windows is here. The official, and commercial, version 1.0 of the SDK just hit the interwebs along with the accompanying hardware for a price of $250, or $150 for qualified educational customers. The tool has picked up a number of new features since the last beta, including support for up to four Kinects being used simultaneously and near mode for monitoring motion from just 40cm away. The sensor itself seems mostly the same, but may not be compatible with its console cousin -- the device's product page states that it will only operate with software developed for Kinect for Windows. For more info and a complete list of improvements hit up the source link.
