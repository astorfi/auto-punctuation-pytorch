Obama nominated Tom Wheeler for the Federal Communications Commission chairman post back in May, and today the US Senate has finally given him its blessing. Although Texas Senator Ted Cruz had concerns over the nominee at first, the agency's new head honcho has been approved unanimously. The FCC may not pipe up too often, but it influences everything from what spectrums cellular carriers use to whether or not devices are safe enough (radiation-wise, at least) to be sold stateside. It's not entirely clear how Wheeler's history as a cable and wireless industry lobbyist will influence his efforts in the post, but his stance on legal phone unlocking gives us hope that the outfit will take a particularly consumer-friendly tact to its duties.
