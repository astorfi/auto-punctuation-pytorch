 Microsoft may be readying an all-out marketing blitz to get Windows Phone 8 all up in your cranium, but those loyal to Sprint won't be getting anything but perturbed. During today's Windows Phone 8 event in San Francisco, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced that AT&T, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile were "all in" for Windows Phone 8. Strangely, however, America's number three carrier is evidently "all out." While Sprint was a carrier for Windows Phone 7 handsets like the HTC Arrive, the carrier was showing cold feet as far back as January of this year. Given that the Arrive was its "most returned phone," though, it's hard to cast blame.

 It could very well be due to the way Sprint's 4G drama has gone done -- at the time, Microsoft likely didn't want to create WP8 devices that supported by WiMAX and LTE, and now that Sprint has foregone the former in order to grab the latter, it's all a bit too late. Of course, it comments made to PhoneScoop earlier this year by spokesperson David Owen are to be believed, Sprint may join the WP8 party early next year. Sort of seems like a familiar refrain, actually.
