       We're always wondering how much junk we have on our various SDcards; thanks to A-Data, we can tell at a glance. Similar to the JumpDrive with E Ink, A-Data added a tiny liquidcrystal display on their BCD-SD cards. The LC display uses power from a host while inserted and indicates the remainingcapacity on the card. Pop the card out and the display retains the information until you reinsert it, so you can manageyour data needs. A-Data BCD-SD cards come in the typical SD flavors: 128, 256, 512MB as well as 1 and 2GB.
