It boots into a KITT scanner effect and warm, "Michael, where do you want to go today" greeting. Fortunately, you can then reprogram KITT to address you from a list of 200 or so other names (with more to come). Add Flux Capacitor and your ride to nerdvana is complete. See the action after the break.[Thanks, Joe P.]
