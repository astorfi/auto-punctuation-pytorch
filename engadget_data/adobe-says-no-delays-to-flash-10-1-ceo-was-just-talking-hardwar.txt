 In a communication with Phone Scoop, Adobe has tidied up the meaning of its CEO's words from a recent interview with Fox Business. In it, Shantanu Narayen repeatedly tells us to expect new Android, WebOS and BlackBerry devices with integrated Flash compatibility during the second half of 2010, but Adobe has now explained that he didn't mean that the Flash delivery schedule will be delayed, not at all. You see, Narayen was talking about hardware coming out in the second half, but Flash 10.1 itself will still be arriving "to first mobile platforms including Android ... before the end of the first half of 2010." Interesting that only Android is mentioned explicitly, but at least this provides some reassurance to any fretting Flash fans out there.
