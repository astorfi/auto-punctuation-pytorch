To review, we've seen a cellphone, Xbox, MP3 player, guitar, SD card, laptop, and tailpipe (plus lots more we couldn't find or didn't even post about) in the last two yeare. Our partners in crime over at Engadget Chinese came across the latest sighting of the queen of kawaii: a Hello Kitty mobile DVD player with a 3.5-inch screen and a three hour battery life. This whole package can be yours for 4,000 yuan, or about $500 -- not as cute as we'd thought with a price like that, but really, who can resist that puss? As proven, certainly not us.
