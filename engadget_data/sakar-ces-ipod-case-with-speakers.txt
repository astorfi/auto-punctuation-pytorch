Sakar is showing off the SPC-100 iPod case with speakers built-in at CES. Retailing for 30 bucks, we'll just say
that we had higher hopes for their product, as the sound output was just passable and nothing more. Interesting enough,
the rep may have forgot that he was at CES andÂ didn't want us taking pictures of their bulky (it looks way thick)
case, so here's the rogue pic.
