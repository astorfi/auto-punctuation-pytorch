The Taiwanese handset maker posted unaudited consolidated results for the third quarter -- and, not surprisingly, things are (continuing) to look good for the company. HTC marked a 79.07-percent growth over this time last year, with NT$135,821 million ($4.4 billion) total revenue. And according to HTC, the company's net income post-taxes was NT$18,638 million ($612 million) for the quarter. We'll update the results when we get something a bit more official.
