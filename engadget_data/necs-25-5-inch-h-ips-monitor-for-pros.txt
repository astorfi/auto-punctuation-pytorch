While they share most of the specs -- 1920x1200 (WUXGA) resolution, 800:1 contrast ratio, 400cd/m2 brightness, 178-dgree viewing angle, and 2x HDCP-capable DVIs plus one D-Sub15 input -- the MultiSync LCD2690WUXi features an embedded integrated circuit with 12-bit look-up tables (i.e., gamma correction) for even smoother gradients. Hell, the panel also delivers a broad color gamut at 91% NTSC and even pivots 90-degrees to get your bigzz portrait on. Ideal for graphic design, photo re-touching or other professional uses. And believe us, at Â¥239,400 (about $2,036) you'll be more than happy for the boss-man to cover the cost. Expected to hit Japan on 12 January of the new year. [Via Impress]
