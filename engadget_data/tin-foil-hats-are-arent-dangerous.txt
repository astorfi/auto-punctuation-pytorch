Well, we've got some bad bad news for the paranoid (isn't it always?): that snazzy collection of
tin foil hats you keep for those rare events
that draw you from the relative safety of your bunker in Idaho and into the dangerous outdoors, they aren't doing much
good protecting you from the deathly
radiation that permeates the air. In fact, according to some wiz kid at MIT with a $250,000 network analyzer, that
tin cap of yours actually tends to amplify certain frequencies that are reserved by the FCC for government use only,
meaning their mind control rays have the most effect on the very people who go to the furthest trouble to protect
themselves from such trickery. Oh what a world. The researcher theorizes that the government started this whole helmet
craze in the first place, but we're betting this kid knows where his scholarship money came from, and was commissioned
for this phony report to get your guard down. Who you gonna believe?
