Such is PURE's Elan II, which isn't quite as lovingly styled as the EVOKE-1S or as feature-packed as the Sensia, but it provides a cheeky '80s look and offers the company's ReVu technology, allowing 15 minutes of pausing, rewinding, and fast-forwarding of live radio. It'll do FM too, naturally has a line-in for your choice of PMP, and will rock out plug-free for an impressive 35 hours when you fit an optional battery pack, which looks to cost about £25. The radio itself is £99.99, and since we get no DAB love here in the States we won't bother converting those numbers into their dollar equivalents.
