 T-Mobile is whetting our appetites for HTC's ridiculously named yet highly attractive Windows Phone 8X with a sign-up sheet on its website. The manufacturer confirmed that it's aiming for a November launch for the (surprise, surprise) Windows Phone 8 handset, and we've also heard whispers that it'll retail for $199 when it arrives. If those two factoids haven't gotten you excited enough, you can always see how it compares to its rivals in our comparison feature.
