These days, it's all rush rush rush, isn't it? Our tiny digital assistants are becoming more crucial in getting our days running smoothly, and thanks to a new update to the Google Search Android app, Google Now just got a little bit smarter... at least when it comes to transit and transport. There's nothing like the sinking feeling that strikes when your flight gets delayed (and the existential dread that comes with sitting around an airport for a few more hours), which is why Google bolstered Now with cards that'll highlight alternate flights in case the worst happens to yours. And if you're the sort who prefers traveling on land? Now will also surface your train and bus reservations in card form so you no longer have an excuse for missing the 12:25 to El Paso.
