It's been through a redesign (or two), but the PS3 is still going strong. Sony has announced that sales of its current home console have now topped 80 million, with just over a week to go before its replacement successor forces many to swap out those in-demand HDMI and power cables. And when gamers do eventually return the third PlayStation to whence it came (you kept the box, right?), they can take comfort in the fact that they'll always have the warm and fuzzy memories of that format war victory, Sackboy and er, PlayStation Home. We're still struggling to deal with the fact that the console's launch was that long ago.
