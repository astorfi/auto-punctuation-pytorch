Even if you just skim our Computex coverage, you'll quickly see there's a theme tying it all together: displays. Super-high-resolution displays. It's true of every company we've seen, really, but moving beyond 1080p seems especially important to ASUS. So far, the firm has shown off a pair of 4K displays, along with its first 2,560 x 1,600 tablet. Now, it's unveiling its first all-in-one desktop with QHD resolution. That would be the ET2702, which comes standard with a 27-inch, 2,560 x 1,440 IPS screen. Though we admittedly only spent a few moments with it, we noticed the colors held up even under the glare of the harsh lighting in Taipei's Nangang Exhibition Center. We were also taken with the design, which includes an edge-to-edge glass display layered over a long speaker grille. There are some other modern touches, too, like white LED lights, a matte aluminum pedestal and a metal mouse to match. Speaking of that mouse, it's one of the nicer ones we've seen tossed in with an all-in-one: aside from the quality build materials, it has a touch strip providing haptic feedback. The included keyboard is well-spaced and easy to type on as well.


In the US, at least, there will be just one configuration to start, with key specs including: a Core i7-4770 processor, a 2GB AMD Radeon HD 8890A GPU, 16GB of RAM, a 2TB hard drive, 802.11ac and a Blu-ray drive. It'll arrive in either late July or early August, we're told, with a price around $2,000, if not slightly less. For a closer look, we've got hands-on photos below and a short walkthrough video after the break.
