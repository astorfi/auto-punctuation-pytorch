The new section of the Playstation Store will supposedly impose a 100MB limit on content and set prices in the $2 - $6 range, but otherwise have no restrictions, meaning devs will be free -- and even encouraged -- to code up non-game apps as well. Of course, you'll still be able to snag other PSP titles from the other parts of the store, but if this actually happens it'll be interesting to see if Sony can channel some of the energy from the vibrant PSP homebrew scene into a more legit distribution channel. We'll keep an eye out.[Via Joystiq]
