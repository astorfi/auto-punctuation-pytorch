The 750GB LS-L750GL, LS-L750GL / M and 1TB LS-L1000GL / M (the M interestingly stands for "Mac-compatible") all sport a fairly unexciting enclosure and an even less entrancing set of amenities. Taking a peek around back (psst, it's after the jump) shows only a fan, lock port, AC plug and an Ethernet jack, but that should be all you need to get an external HDD set up on your network. The 750GB models are set to land early next month for ¥42,300 ($369), while the 1TB iteration will demand ¥63,800 ($557).[Via AkihabaraNews]
