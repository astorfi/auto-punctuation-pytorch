Fujitsu's
loosed their new T4000 Tablet PC on us (we're always a little surprised when someone has a new tablet, forgive us). The
T4000 runs Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, of course, and has a Pentium-M 725 or 745, Gigabit ethernet, Bluetooth,
DVD burner, and an "indoor/outdoor wide-view display" (we're hoping they're referring to a transflective touchscreen
display) option, as well as an SXGA+ (1400 x 1050) screen optionâ€”which is frankly rather insane for a 12.1-inch
display, and a total necessity if you're not the type who cares about looking bug-eyed all the time.
