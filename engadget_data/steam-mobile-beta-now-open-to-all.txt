  If you were dismayed to find yourself waiting in the queue for a beta invite after downloading the mobile Steam client the other day, fret no more -- the trial is now open to all who desire entry. Of course, it's still really just a companion to the desktop shop and not a must-have mobile gaming market. We're sure some of you have more friends on Steam than you do in meatspace, though, so being able to chat with fellow gaming addicts or purchase the latest DLC pack for Arkham City while on the go might be the greatest thing to ever happen to you.
