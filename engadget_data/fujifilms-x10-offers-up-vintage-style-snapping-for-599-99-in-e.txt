Starting sometime in early October, the X100's more affordable little brother will set nostalgic point-and-shooters back $599.99 -- about $100 bones less than the estimated $715 to $860 ballpark we threw out back in September. If you'll recall, the X10 packs a 12 megapixel EXR CMOS sensor, f/2-2.8, 28-112mm manual zoom lens, up to 12,800 ISO sensitivity, 1080p video, an optical viewfinder, and pop-up flash. No word yet on a final release date. Full PR after the break.
