 
Just months after Verizon celebrated two years of FiOS, and merely four days after celebrating the same for New York, the firm has found yet another reason to boogie down. After a "banner 2007" and a presumably successful January 2008, the outfit has finally netted its one millionth FiOS TV subscriber. The milestone makes it the tenth largest cable provider in the United States, and considering that Mediacom is holding down the nine spot with 1.3 million, we'd say VZW is well on its way into single digits on the leaderboard. Meanwhile, that other fiber-based television carrier is aiming to hit the same mark before 2008 draws to a close.
