The most notable trend spotted was a 4 point (up from 9.0% to 13.0%) quarterly increase in Google's Android market share as all other smartphone OS subscribers declined. ComScore also saw Motorola's slide continue, slipping behind LG now for a third place US finish as Samsung continued to bolster its dominant position. Expect the numbers to be jostled a bit next quarter when Apple's iPhone 4 numbers are factored in. Just don't expect to see the Android numbers suffer, especially with the Samsung Galaxy S launching on all the major US carriers before the quarter is done.
