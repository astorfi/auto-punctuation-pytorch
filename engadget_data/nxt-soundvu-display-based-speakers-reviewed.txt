NXT has made a name for itself with flat, compact, speakers
(including the biodegradable cardboard SoundpaX), and
their latest, the SoundVu system, takes this to an extreme: it plants a thin, transparent speaker behind an LCD screen,
effectively turning the screen into a speaker. While you probably wouldn't want this to be the main sound source for
your home theater, it sounds like a perfect technology for laptops, where space is at a premium. LIVEdigitally took a
look at the first laptop to incorporate SoundVu, the NEC LaVie S, and found that, unlike other laptop speakers (which,
let's face it, sound pretty crappy), you can actually listen to this one.
