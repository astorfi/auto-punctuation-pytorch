 So we've been feeling a certain HD DVD, erm,vibe from Microsoft for some time now. Both of our Bill Gates interviews have pointed the way to the support of a single standard, and that standard hasbeen HD DVD with few exceptions. So it's interesting to hear Peter Moore, Microsoft's gaming veep, spill it to theJapanese website ITmedia that if HD DVD doesn't make it through the format war, Microsoft could launch an externalBlu-ray drive for the 360 instead of going down with the ship. Sounds like a smart move on their part to keep optionsopen, but with all they'vedone to ensure that Blu-ray gets killed dead it seems like they'd have to be really hurting to ever ship a Blu-raydrive for their shiny gaming boxen.[Via Joystiq]
