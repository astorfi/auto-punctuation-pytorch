If you're one of the 2013 Nexus 7 users who's experienced some wonkiness with multitouch, this is (hopefully) your lucky day. Over on Google's product forums today, Mountain View staffer Paulw confirmed a system update that addresses the touchscreen issues. Build JSS15Q is reportedly rolling out now -- if you've received the update, be sure to let us know if your Nexus 7 is finally screen freakout-free.


Update: Looks like the update addresses an issue with the unit's GPS sensitivity, too.
