When Flipboard launched version 2.0 on iOS and Android not long ago, its self-created magazines seemed to strike a chord with users. The latest version of the app for iOS, 2.02, is capitalizing on that popularity with new features that let you check out your readership and see complete profile pages of fellow curators. You'll also be able to see their work and share your own more easily, thanks to a new Friends category and updated share menu, which adds the option to send stories and magazines by SMS. So, if you're looking to boost that fledgeling curated magazine empire, hit the source to grab it.
