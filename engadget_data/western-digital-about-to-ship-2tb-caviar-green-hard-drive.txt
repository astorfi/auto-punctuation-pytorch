In a presumed effort to beat Hitachi (and everyone else) to the 2TB barrier, WD is reportedly aiming to launch its Caviar Green 2000GB WD20EADS later this week, and with it will come 32MB of cache, an 8.9-millisecond seek time and an expected price tag of around â‚¬170 ($224). Best of all? It should be "available immediately" just as soon as it's outed for real.[Via Electronista]
