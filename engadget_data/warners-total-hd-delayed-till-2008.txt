 With the second half of 2007 right around the corner, Warner has come out and confessed that its Total HD discs won't be delivered this year -- contrary to what was promised during CES 2007. While a new release date isn't given, they are shooting for early 2008. There also isn't a mention of the reason for the delay, but we suspect that sandwiching these two formats on one disc turned out to be more difficult than they bargained for; or maybe they want to wait and see if a winner emerges this holiday season. In the meantime, Warner promises to keep releasing titles on both formats, and believes that "There is no expiration date on the viability of this concept."[Via High-Def Digest]
