Today we finally snagged the real deal, and let us just say this Ocean runs deep. (Sorry, had to.) The Helio UI feels a lot snappier, screen orientation switching is nearly instantaneous, and our niggles thus far are few (we really wish it wouldn't kick us out of all apps when we're in "default" position). We'll have the full report on this in the near future, but until this thing officially launches (soon, soon) then feast your eyes on our retail unboxing and hands-on.
