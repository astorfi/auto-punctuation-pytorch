Supposedlyits current incarnation is only 1/4 of the final size, but the target is a 600 pound robot that can distribute weightevenly over its eight legs to avoid damaging the skin of the spacecraft or for scurrying across solar panels. NASA iseven looking into a "web" deployment system for the bot, in which case we're hiding the women and childrenand locking the doors.
