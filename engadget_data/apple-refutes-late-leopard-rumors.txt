 The release date of Mac OS X Leopard is the subject of more speculation yet again, with a source at Apple telling Jupiter Research analyst Michael Gartenberg that the OS is still planned for a Spring release. That's in response to an earlier rumor from the endemically unreliable DigiTimes which suggested that the release might be delayed until October. Earlier we heard that Leopard might make be released as early as this month, although it appears as if the Apple source wasn't directly responding to this suggestion. Either way, we're back to square one: no information apart from Apple's original announcement that it'll be out in sometime in the next few months. Exactly when is anyone's guess, and one that unfortunately can't be predicted using the usually infallible Apple rumor generator.[Via digg]
