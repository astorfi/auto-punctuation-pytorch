 Almost lost in the shuffle (oh, wait, that'sone they didn't announce) among Apple's other product announcements today werea couple that may prove handy for dedicated iPod users. In particular, the AV Connection Kit is a $99 bundle thatincludes the iPod Universal Dock, Apple Remote, iPod AV Cable, an iPod Dock Connector to USB 2.0 Cable and an iPod USBPower Adapter. The $49 iPod nano in-ear lanyard earbuds join Apple's existing $39 iPod lanyard earbuds; the extra $10presumably covers the few extra nanometers of plastic needed to get these suckers further into your ear canal.
