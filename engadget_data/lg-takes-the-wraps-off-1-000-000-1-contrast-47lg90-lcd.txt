Rocking a $3,599 pricetag when hits shelves in September -- we'll assume it missed the original Q2 2007 projections due to our request for 120Hz motion processing, now included -- a spec sheet from LG Canada indicates a 500cd/m2 brightness rating, 3 HDMI v1.3 inputs, Intelligent Sensor to adjust for lighting conditions, Invisible Speakers, ISFccc calibration ready, USB port and LG's SimpLink control technology. The "unique teardrop design" with blue accents encloses a 5-inch thick package that can't be as slim as its LGX cousin, but we're thinking the LED-enhanced view from the front will make up for it. On paper, the Samsung 9 Series seems to have the edge on price and features, but we'll have to wait and see if reality matches the specs.Read - Press releaseRead - Spec sheet (Warning: PDF link)
