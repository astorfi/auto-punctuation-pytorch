Though a solid gigabyte of space for music is all well and good, many folks consider that just a good start on their way to, say, 3 or 4GB in total. Problem is, the M1 lacks any sort of expansion slot, and we've got to agree with LAPTOP's conclusion that it's a nearly unforgivable oversight. Though the large external display, music controls, and A2DP are nice, they found that the phone's 2 megapixel shooter fell short with mediocre picture quality and an autofocus mechanism that took far too long to operate (and also far too long to disable). Add to that a cramped keyboard and internal display, a beefy 0.9 inches of girth, and the fact that the also-new Samsung m610 looks a good deal hotter for less dough, and... well, the M1's prognosis ain't great. So, owners (and secret admirers): what are your thoughts on Sanyo's latest effort?[Thanks, Jennifer]
