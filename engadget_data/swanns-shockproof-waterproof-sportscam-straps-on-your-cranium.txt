The Sportscam is a familiar device -- similar to Contour and Go Pro units we've toyed with in the past -- but rather than seeking optimal image quality at a premium price, this guy sticks to the basics. The VGA camera can only log clips at a resolution of 640 x 480, so HD junkies best look elsewhere. But it's still encased in a rugged plastic shell, one that's both shockproof and waterproof, and it's capable of holding up to five hours of footage on a single 16GB microSD card. There's a rechargeable Li-ion battery that'll last 2.5 hours, and it ships with a variety of mounting options (though we'd suggest around your head, obviously). As we alluded to earlier, this one's a lower-end product, and that $99 price may entice those who would otherwise never consider such a thing. The full release is after the break, and it'll start shipping in the US of A next month.
