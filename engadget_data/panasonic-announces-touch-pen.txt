After flicking a picture from an iPad to a TV screen, he used the stylus to annotate the image right on the display. A mention in the official PR for Panasonic's 2013 Smart VIERA Plasma lineup adds a little more information -- using Swipe & Share 2.0 software for Android and iOS, you can push photos to the new displays, modify them using the Touch Pen, then send the changes straight back to the source device.
