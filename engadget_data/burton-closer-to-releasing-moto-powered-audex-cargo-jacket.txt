"Congratulations, agent, on getting out of that foreign prison after they easily spotted you doing reconnaissance in
your Ronin-branded Burton espionage jacket. After what
you went through in that sweat box, you deserve to vacation somewhere nice and cold, so we're stuffing you into
Burton's new Bluetooth'd Audex Cargo Jacket and jetting you straight to Tahoe." We first spotted a
prototype of the
Moto-powered Audex back in January at CES, a fancy piece
of wearable tech that lets you toss out your old Burton HiFi
helmet and beanie (though you'll still need your
Liquid Lounger), and get your slopes tunes from the
embedded speakers in the hood. While this concept is certainly nothing new (peep the Amp or the
Kenpo), Burton throws in Bluetooth support and a mic for
your cellphone, a combo we've rarely seen (peep the mp3blue
take). The nerve center of this wired gear sits on the wearer's left sleeve: a semi-stylish plastic oval with a
scrollwheel and one-line display that allows you to switch between rockin' and chattin'. The Audex is expected to cost
you about $600 (so hopefully you haven't already dropped three grand on a
Spyder) and should ship at the end of November.
