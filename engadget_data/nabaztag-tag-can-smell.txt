Then check the video of this v2 WiFi bunny who not only emerges from DEMOfall with a mic stuffed in his fake plastic belly, he snagged a sense of smell too. That's right, in the demo he's able to detect a big dirty carrot held in front of his felt-tipped "T" of a nose and respond accordingly. Somehow this all seems perfectly fine and even a hare arousing when explained by mister French Elvis. Oh Nabaztag, we know this world is killing you.
