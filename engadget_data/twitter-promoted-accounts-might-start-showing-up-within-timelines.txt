By now, you're most likely used to seeing promoted tweets (that's fancy for "sponsored ads") appear in your highly curated Twitter timeline. But promoted accounts? That's the stuff best left banished to the wilds of the Discover tab or worse yet, Twitter's desktop interface. Of course, that does advertisers no good and Twitter, in its march towards monetization, needs to get more eyeballs in front of those potential ad dollars. The big fix for that then, is to move sponsors' promoted accounts out of the ghetto and into timelines to leverage the hefty three-quarters of its base that check in via mobile. Twitter's labeling the change as still being in beta, but it's available now for advertisers to test drive across the company's global reach. What? You thought your timeline was sacred? Not when access to it is free, silly.
