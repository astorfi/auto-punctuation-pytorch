The stark gray version looks to posses the very same innards as the white and black model already out, but externally, it's an entirely different animal. 'Tis a shame we haven't a clue where this is headed for release, but we'll put our bucks on somewhere not named USA -- at least at first.Update: Well, what have we here? It's on sale now at Amazon for $349.99.[Via Slashgear]
