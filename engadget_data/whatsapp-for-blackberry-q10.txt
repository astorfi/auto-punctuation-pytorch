 After becoming available on the Z10 just last month, it was only natural for WhatsApp to eventually expand its horizons within BlackBerry 10. And with the Q10 finally nearing its time to take off around the globe, what better time to make the renowned messaging app also compatible with the latest in physical QWERTY keys from the Waterloo-based company. As usual, it won't cost you a dime to get WhatsApp installed on that BlackBerry Q10 of yours, however a yearly fee of about $1 will be due if you're planning on using it for longer than the first twelve months. Either way, it's up for download now, so pay the source link below a visit if you're one of the lucky few to have RIM's BlackBerry's new jewel in your possession a little earlier than others.
