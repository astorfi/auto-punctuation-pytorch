Currently, if you want to buy that hot new Super Mario Bros game your coworkers have been talking about, you need to wait until you could get home, power up your Wii U, launch eShop and then purchase it. That long process could become much shorter, however, if Nintendo follows through on a recent report from NicoNico (translated by Siliconera) that it plans to open up eShop access to PCs and smartphones as well. Dan Adelman, Nintendo's Business Development Manager, confirmed with Joystiq that users would be able to log on to eShop remotely, buy the game, set it up for download and it'll be right there on their console when they get home. Hopefully this update arrives prior to October, so that Link fans among us can get a head start on downloading that new Zelda game before everyone else.
