Microsoft has proposed a standard for displaying data on an LCD mounted on the lid of a closed laptop, similar to
the way some clamshell cellphones display date, time and Caller ID info (as in the gratuitous image at the right). The
company plans to incorporate the technology into
Longhorn (whenever it ships), and
would also make the standard available on desktop machines, allowing them to work with an "auxiliary" display that
could function separately from the host PC, with its own processor and memory. While we like this idea, and think being
able to, say, check our email queue without opening our laptop, would be great, we can't help but be a little intrigued
by the system Microsoft plans to build this on:Â  Smart Personal Objects Technology, better known as
SPOT, which has been a
less-than-stellar success as the system that runs "smart watches." Is SPOT the right solution for this, or is Microsoft
trying to salvage something useful from the ruins of the smart-watch biz? We'll have to wait for Longhorn to find out,
so we guess we'll just have to be (very) patient.
