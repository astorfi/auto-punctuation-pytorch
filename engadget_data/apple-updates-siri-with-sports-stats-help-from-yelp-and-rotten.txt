The service is now able to answer a variety of sports related questions, from scores and stats to game times, and it's added both Yelp and Rotten Tomatoes to its bag of tricks for dining and movie recommendations. What's more, Siri will now also let you launch apps if you're tired of tapping through folders, and Apple is finally expanding Siri's local search functionality from just the US to no less than 60 difference countries. The other big Siri news is that it's finally headed to the new iPad, and even to cars via Apple's new Eyes Free integration, although that is still a bit further off (within the next 12 months is the word).
