If you've ever wanted to hurl your iPhone through your TV while enthusiastically playing tennis, now's your chance. This week, Rolocule Games launched an iOS app -- Motion Tennis -- that turns your Apple TV into a Wii-esque gaming console. To connect devices to Apple TVs, the game relies on AirPlay Mirroring, which can be toggled on in the settings menu. Once your iOS device has been transformed into a tennis racket, you can control the action on your screen -- just be sure to strap the phone to your wrist, lest you become the poor sod to launch a new meme. If Wimbledon's whetted your appetite for more tennis, you can find the game on iTunes or watch the video after the break.
