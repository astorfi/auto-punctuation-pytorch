The fun lil' cutesy robot sounded like it had the potential to go iRobot / Matrix / [insert favorite robots take over world scenario here] when the bot asked, "Have you ever been attacked by a panda?" It really did say that, but if you could avoid the obvious welcoming of our robot panda overlords, we'd appreciate it. [MP4] Download the video
