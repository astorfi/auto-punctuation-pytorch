When is an official tablet unofficially announced? The answer to that question seems to have evolved over the years, as LG now tends to out its products in teasers a week or so prior to their actual unveiling (the G2 is a perfect example). Now, the company is continuing that trend with the G Pad 8.3, its first tablet since the Optimus Pad LTE, which LG is teasing in a freshly posted YouTube video.


So far, many of the details are still a mystery, but we do know the mid-sized tablet is coming (presumably alongside a smartwatch and Firefox OS device), and will most likely make its debut at IFA next week. The video involves professional actors real people on the street talking about what makes a tablet right for them, with answers including a portability, ease of use, quickness, full HD display, the ability to connect to smart TVs and keeping it thin. We have no doubt these "interviews" indicate what we can expect from the still-unannounced slate, and we'll be keeping an eye out for more clues as we get closer to its launch. We've embedded the video after the break, along with a shot of the logo.
