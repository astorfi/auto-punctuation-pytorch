According to CEO Eric Cooney, satellite providers are already preparing to offer full HD channels in the next few years to separate themselves from cable and IPTV competition with more limited bandwidth. Aside from the company's current projects rolling out MPEG-4, he sees 1080p/60Hz as an inevitable progression, with the hardware already in place. Three years from now, after switched digital's hit and fiber continues to expand its territory offering "Blu-ray quality movies" might be a great selling point for Dish and DirecTV, although we shudder to think what kind of DVR we'd need to store the programming.
