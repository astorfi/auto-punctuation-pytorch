 Hard to believe that anyone would willingly stare at Windows XP on a tiny screen (the five-inch display on the OQO and the 4.5-inch display on the Sony UX are already pushing the bounds of XP's usability), but some info and images have turned up over at AVING about one with an even smaller display, the new Vega Ultra Portable. No slide-out QWERTY keyboard like either the OQO or the UX, but the Vega does sport what looks like a full numeric keypad on the front, as well as a 4.3-inch touch screen, an AMD Geode LX800 processor, 30GB hard drive, 256MB of RAM, and integrated WiFi. Should be out sometime next month, at least in South Korea.[Via jkOnTheRun and MobileWhack]
