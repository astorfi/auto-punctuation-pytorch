 With football season ready to kick off yet again there's still no good news for those who want Sunday Ticket without DirecTV, but if you do have the right satellite hookup then there are a few new wrinkles in 2010. First the bad news, at five payments of $59.99 the price has risen yet again to $299.95, but this year features that used to require the $99 SuperFan add-on -- every game in high definition, Game Mix Channel, Red Zone Channel, Short Cuts -- are included, so if that's what you wanted then the price has actually gone down. One SuperFan feature that's still extra is access to streaming games, now broken out on its own at NFL Sunday Ticket To-Go, it brings 14 Sunday ticket games every week, Red Zone Channel, highlights, stats and more via the internet (PC, Mac, Android, iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch, webOS, Windows Mobile) for an additional five payments of $9.95. Check the press release after the break for all the details, but we're pretty sure this is the kind of decision that makes itself for most NFL fans.
