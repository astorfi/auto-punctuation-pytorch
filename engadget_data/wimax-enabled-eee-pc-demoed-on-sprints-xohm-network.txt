 
That, friends, is the WiMAX-enabled Eee PC, showcased today on Sprint's XOHM network (as was the OQO model 02). No word on a price just yet, but it sounds like it will see production with "an attractive MSRP." Also of note, ASUS is planning to dish out 7-, 8-, and 8.9-inch models (not necessarily WiMAX-enabled, mind you) in Q2 in a variety of colors, but it seems we'll be playing wait-and-see regarding the all important price / specifications bit.
