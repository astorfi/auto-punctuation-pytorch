With the V3, V3i, V3r, and V3xx in its rear view mirror, the synergy between the 3G RAZR 2 and AT&T's lineup seems pretty obvious, so we're not at all surprised to see this one passing through the FCC's tender embrace. Strangely, the pictures clearly depict Cingular branding -- complete with dedicated Jack and Cingular Video buttons -- but the draft manual here is chock full of AT&T and Cellular Video references, so we're not too concerned that it's been axed or anything rash like that. We're still expecting a summer release for this one, though for all we know, that could mean September; we'll keep ya in the loop.[Via Boy Genius Report]
