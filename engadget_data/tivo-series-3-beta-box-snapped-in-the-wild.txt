Behold, the Series 3 in the wild! Unfortunately it doesn't yet seem to have TiVoToGo, and from what we hear the cable company had to go through four CableCARDs to get the damned thing working properly (no comment on whether it was TWC) -- but all that's irrelevant. If you're half as excited as we are about this thing then you're pretty mofriggin' stoked. Click on for some more shots of this thing running on some lucky bastard's rig.
      

 

Wait, seriously, two CableCARDs? This is better than we thought!Hubba hubba.
