We still don't know whether HP's inkjet cartridges have built-in expiration dates, as alleged in a recent
class-action lawsuit; we think it's bad enough that
"smart" cartridges from many brands seem to tell the printer they're out of ink before it's actually so. Fortunately,
there are ways to force some of the cartridges to keep working even after they tell your printer they've run out of
ink. A couple of hacks for HP cartridges involve replacing the chip's battery and editing printer drivers. We haven't
tested these mods, and we won't be surprised if they void your printer's warranty, but if you use a lot of ink and
aren't afraid to get your fingers dirty, they could be worth trying while you wait for your lawsuit settlement.
