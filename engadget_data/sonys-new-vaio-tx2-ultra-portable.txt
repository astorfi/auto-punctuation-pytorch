Weighing in at 2.7 pounds and packing Double Layer DVD recording, there is a lot here tolove in a quite a tiny package. What really gets our hearts all aflutter is the 11.1-inch widescreen LCD sporting an LED backlight, which manages to save battery life andbrighten our lives at the same time. They claim a 7.5-hour batter life for this thing, which sounds great, though we'dlove to see what this thing could do battery and performance-wise once moved beyond the Pentium M processor into CoreDuo land.
