  Considering the usual subject matter of The Big Bang Theory it's a bit bizarre that the first couple of seasons weren't already available in high definition, but Warner Home Video has now announced they will be released on Blu-ray July 10th. While later seasons have already seen Blu-ray releases, those looking to start back at the beginning for Leonard, Sheldon, Penny and the rest of the crew had been stuck with DVDs. Assuming you're a fan of CBS' comedy series, you can preorder each Blu-ray / DVD combo release now, priced at $23.99 for the first season and $54.97 for the longer second season. Of course, what we're really wondering is what this means for other orphaned releases that only have some or none of their seasons available on Blu-ray as studios have shifted strategies, we're still waiting for How I Met Your Mother season one. Drop a note about any other shows you're following that have holes in their HD releases in the comments below, or just check out a video clip of the show with the canned laughter cut out -- it's... different.
