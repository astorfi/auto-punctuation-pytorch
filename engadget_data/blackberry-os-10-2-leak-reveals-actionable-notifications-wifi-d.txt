BlackBerry 10 users rejoice! The awesome folks over at the CrackBerry forums have leaked a few screenshots of BlackBerry's upcoming OS 10.2 (build 10.2.0.483, to be exact) which reveal a bunch of new features, including actionable notifications and WiFi Direct. With the former, you'll be able to pull down on notifications and respond to them (as shown above). This OS version will also provide a way to mute notifications or view them on the lock screen. WiFi Direct, which was hinted at during BlackBerry Live, is now confirmed with this build. It enables simple peer-to-peer wireless connectivity between various devices like phones, tablets, printers and TVs. This update also include a new native Evernote app, settings app and app manager.
