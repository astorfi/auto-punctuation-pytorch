At CEATEC this week Sigma was showing off its SMP8644 SOC which promises to make the next generation of Blu-ray players load discs faster and perform better when rendering all that BD-J interactive content. And although it wasn't mentioned, we'd be willing to bet that the new chip can do all of this while at the same being cheaper then its older brothers.
