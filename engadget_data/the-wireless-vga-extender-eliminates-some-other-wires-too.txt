Well the Wireless VGA Extender ishere to help, and not only does it take your VGA signal wireless, up to a1024x768 resolution, but it can transmit your PS/2 plugs for a keyboard and mouse, and an audio jack across the roomwith it. The range is 100 feet, which should be plenty for most fanboy operations, however the ordering form says thatthe device isn't for residential use, so you'll have to work it out with the FCC if this is ever going to end up inyour living room.[Thanks, Preston]
