 We already know that Samsung was too timid (or maybe too sensible) to launch its Windows RT-based ATIV Tab hybrid in the US, but now it appears the manufacturer is having doubts about European demand too. Heise.de and our friends at MobileGeeks are reporting that Samsung will stop selling its ATIV Tab in Germany -- Europe's biggest economy -- and some other unspecified European countries after speaking to retailers about the level of interest they're seeing for Microsoft's stripped down OS. This European retreat is said to have been confirmed by Samsung execs at CeBIT in Hanover, and MobileGeeks editor Sascha Pallenberg told us that the Korean company simply "sees no market for RT in Germany and other European countries." We've asked Samsung for further clarification and we'll update this post as soon as we hear back. As things stand, the ATIV Tab is still listed for sale by Amazon.de priced at 605 euros.

 Update: We're still waiting on an official response from Samsung's PR machine. Reps we spoke to at CeBIT wouldn't confirm or deny these reports.
