Well, perhaps empty is a bit of an exaggeration, as the machine's gorgeous duralumin curves fill our hearts with joy, as does the comparatively inexpensive $1,199 price tag that Sammy just confirmed on its website. And hey, we know of an Engadget editor making do with just 60GB of storage in his notebook, so it's not an untenable thing -- but when Samsung's marketing materials proudly boast that "You'll have room to bring it all with you with the 64GB drive," it's hard to repress the tears. That said, if "portable" is your middle name, you'll find all the pre-orders you need at our source link.
