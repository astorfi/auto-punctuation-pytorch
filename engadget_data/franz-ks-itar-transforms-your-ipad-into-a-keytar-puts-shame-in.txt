The unholy spawn of Jerry Only and that ShamWow! guy, his latest creation is called the Mantaray iTar. Essentially it's an iPad dock with a shoulder strap, but wait -- there's more! You can also mount effects processors (such as the Korg Kaoss pad), essentially transforming your tablet into a kludgey keytar. As our man says, "gadget music is the new punk rock!" But seriously, Franz -- do you expect us to pay $225 for the privilege of performing with iElectribe? Either way, this video must be seen to be believed. Peep for yourself after the break.
