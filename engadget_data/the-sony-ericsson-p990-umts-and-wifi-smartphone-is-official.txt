At last. After all the leaked
photos, Sony Ericsson really had no choice but to
officially announce the Hermione P950 P1000 P990 "well ahead of
availability." This 3G (UMTS) smartphone has the same dimensions as the P910 but adopts the Symbian OS 9.1 and UIQ 3 software platform
while throwing down with WiFi (802.11b), Bluetooth, a 2 megapixel camera with "photo light," video calling, FM radio,
MP3 and MPEG-4 player, and keyboard (QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY, or Russian) underneath the flip-down keypad. Web browsing
is accomplished in landscape mode on the 2.8-inch QVGA screen using the new Opera 8 browser and is "prepared for all
major push e-mail clients." The unit ships with 80MB free memory and
 a 64MB Memory Stick
Pro DUO card in the box. The P990 will drop in Europe and Asia in Q1 2006. More pix after the jump.
