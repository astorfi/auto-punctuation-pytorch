 
Mobile chip wunder-company and recent Microsoft BFF ARM Holdings has released its financial results for the second quarter, and the news is good. Real good. Revenues are up about 50 percent compared to the same period a year before and profits jumped a whopping 167 percent. ARM indicates its strong presence in the mobile market is the primary reason for this growth, citing an average of 2.6 ARM-based chips in every cellphone. New licensing deals, like the one with Microsoft, also buoyed that result. What's next for the company? 2.6 ARM-based chips in every baby, puppy, and kitty.
