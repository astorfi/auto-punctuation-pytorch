The phone hasn't been officially announced by either AT&T or LG, but the safe bet is that the 950 is just a bespoke variant of the familiar Arena KM900, so look for a three-inch 800 x 480 touchscreen with LG's S-Class UI, a five megapixel camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, and 8GB of storage. We'll have to see whether this hits at CES next week or MWC in February -- but until then you can get a feel for this thing by checking out our KM900 hands-on video right here.
