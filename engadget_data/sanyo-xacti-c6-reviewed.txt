       Steve's Digicam gives Sanyo's Xacti C6 camcorder/camera theirtypical thorough going-over, and come away fairy pleased, calling it "awesome" and "a great choice foranyone." The $600 C6 records both 30fps VGA video and six megapixel stills onto an SD card and features a 5xoptical zoom and 2-inch LCD display, but no optical viewfinder. Despite its small size, Steve's give the C6 a thumbs upfor picture and video quality, as well as ergonomics and image stabilization, when compared to other products in thesame class. Also nice is the Wind Noice Reduction feature, which supposedly works well for outdoor shots, althoughindoor shots are a different story, with the flash coming across as pretty weak. Nonetheless, Steve's gives us the goahead to break out our credit cards and buy yet another camcorder that we swear we'll really use this time.
