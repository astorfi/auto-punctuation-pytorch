 
Sure, there's already TVs and devices out there ready to bring the YouTube experience directly to your living room, but today they've launched a page just for browser-enabled living room devices (the PlayStation 3 and Wii) to browse on a TV screen. Point your console to www.youtube.com/tv for the new page, those limited by their PC's can check out the video embedded after the break for a demo. It seems like it would be easy to throw a bone to Windows Media Center Extender devices and HTPC owners by opening things up a bit, but the Official YouTube Blog indicates this beta is intended to encourage more manufacturers to include unrestricted browser support (Xbox 360, please pick up the white courtesy phone.) Take a look and tell us what you think.Read - Official YouTube blogRead - PlayStation Blog
