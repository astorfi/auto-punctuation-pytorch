Pirkus-R is a Bluetooth enabled bipedal robot that can be controlled fromyour phone and walk around of its own volition. If it spots a face it wants to identify, the bot can track its targetuntil it's close enough to match the face with its registry. The little humanoid is set to make an appearance as acontender in the Robo-One fights this weekend at Panasonic Center Tokyo.[Via Pink Tentacle]
