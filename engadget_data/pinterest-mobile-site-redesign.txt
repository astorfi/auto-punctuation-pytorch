To some, looks are everything. To others, it's all about what's inside. To Pinterest, it's a mixture of both. As such, don't be surprised to see a different look from the social discovery network the next time you use your smartphone's browser. In an effort to bring a one-design-for-all of sorts to handsets, Pinterest has redesigned its mobile website with a layout similar to the one found on the iOS and Android applications. Thanks to these changes, the site now displays a more polished design and a layout that's meant to highlight your most useful pins. If you're looking for quick access, the native apps will still be the way to go, but this should be a fine option to the pin-loving people who prefer to use the mobile browser.
