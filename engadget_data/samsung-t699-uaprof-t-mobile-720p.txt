Should it be much of a surprise, then, that the carrier would be looking at cranking out a smartphone lineup full of tempting options? Not at all. It turns out that Samsung is making some contributions to the cause, as a UAProf file for the unannounced T699 has been discovered. Just like most user agent profiles, there's little to discern here aside from the obvious inclusion of a 720p HD display -- but at least this lets us know that the handset exists, and that we have something new to look forward to on T-Mobile. Check out the source if you want to do some deciphering of your own.
