Well, we're all a little perplexed about what it is Steve could be announcing next Tuesday -- he's surelysaving his biggest announcements this year for April when they'll be celebrating Apple's 30th birthday. So what's hegot coming next Tuesday at the "Fun new products"announcement? Is it a touchscreen video iPod or iTablet? The Intel media Mac mini? Some more Intel machines like a12-inch MacBook Pro or Intel iBook? Or something even more interesting, still?We don't want you to tell us,we want you to show us. Whip up your best possible photoshop mockups of what you think Steve's got going on behind thescenes, and drop them in our comments (or you can email your entries to engadget (at) gmail (dot) com, subject"WWJD3," no quotes). You've got until 11.59PM EST Sunday, the 26th -- we'll gettogether the best entries in a gallery on Monday, and the winner (as chosen by Engadget) will get a 1GB iPodnano. See? Easy as that. So show us, What Would (Steve) Jobs Do?[Image courtesy of Shawn]
