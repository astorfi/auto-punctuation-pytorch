Microsoft's SkyDrive Pro is helpful for cloud-savvy businesses, but its 7GB of storage per person now seems restrictive next to improved offerings from rivals  like Box. The company won't let itself be outdone, however: it just bumped SkyDrive Pro's base storage to 25GB per user, and administrators can raise that limit to 100GB if they're willing to pay. There's some incentives to take advantage of that extra space, too. Microsoft now offers a larger 2GB file cap, automatic versioning for new users and a client view that displays all shared documents. If your employer depends on Microsoft for online collaboration, you should notice the additional storage today.
