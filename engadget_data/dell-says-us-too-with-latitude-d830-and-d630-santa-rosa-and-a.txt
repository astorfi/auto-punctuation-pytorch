       We're not out of the woods yet when it comes to Santa Rosa releases. Dell is throwing its business-friendly hat into the ring with the 14.1-inch D630 and the 15.4-inch D830, according to some leaked info Laptoping got ahold of. The laptops are not only going to feature Santa Rosa chips and Vista, but SSD and hybrid storage options (like Dell recently added to the D420 and D640) and up to 4GB of RAM. Depending on the model, the laptops will come with an Intel GM965 or PM965 chipset, along with X3100 integrated graphics -- though it's likely a dedicated graphics choice will be offered as well. The 14.1-inch D630 is sporting the same case as its D620 predecessor, and offers up 1280 x 800 or 1440 x 900 screen resolutions. The D830 does 1280 x 800, 1680 x 1050 or 1920 x 1200 on its 15.4-inch screen, and sports the same look as the D820 before it. Both laptops feature 802.11n, gigabit Ethernet and PCMCIA, while the D830 also adds in Smart Card and ExpressCard slots. Dell is also reportedly prepping the Latitude D531 and D631, which feature similar specs to those of the D630, but run AMD Turion 64 X2 processors and integrated ATI Radeon X1270 graphics. The hybrid and SSD stuff is all here, though the D531 does lose the 802.11n. You can get the D531 with a 1280 x 800 14.1-inch screen, or a 15.4-inch 1280 x 800 or 1440 x 900 screen, while the 14.1-inch D631 sports those latter two.Read - Dell Latitude D630Read - Dell Latitude D830Read - Dell Latitude D531, D631
