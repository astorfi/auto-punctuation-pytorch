 In the "who didn't see thiscoming?" news of the day Sony has announced that the Playstation3 won't be shipping this Spring. A Japanese newspaper is reporting the launch has been pushed back to November inJapan, potentially leaving US high definition gamers PS3-less until 2007. The stated reason for the delay? Copyprotection related to the Blu-ray drive. Apparently that preliminary AACS agreement wasn't enough, or maybe Sony isjust planning on slipping a combo (or at least 4x drive) in theunit.It's been pretty obvious that the PS3 would slip, with it being March and developers still not havingfinal hardware to work on, but November seems pretty late, it will be interesting to see how they keep the hype machinerolling all year long.Hopefully we will learn more about Sony's next generation plans tomorrow.
