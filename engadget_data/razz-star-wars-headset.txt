When you're all yukked out from inundating your friends with
Bushisms, you can turn to PhoneBites' newest gadget: the
Star Wars RAZZ headset. Pre-loaded with 10 different Star Wars-themed sounds, you'll be fooling your friends into
thinking it's James Earl Jones on the line in no-time. Need to call in sick? Have Chewie do the talking. Not sure if
you can change the preset sounds on this thing, but for only $19.95, whaddyawant?
