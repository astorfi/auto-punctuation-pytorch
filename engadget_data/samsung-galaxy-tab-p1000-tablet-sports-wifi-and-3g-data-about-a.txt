So far, Samsung's only saying that its Galaxy Tab will launch in Q3 without providing much in the way of detail other than this picture tweeted (and then pulled) by a Samsung's official Twitter account in South Africa. Since then we've seen rumored specs that include Android 2.2, a 7-inch Super AMOLED display, 1.2GHz A8 processor, 4,000mAH battery, 370-gram weight, and 16GB of on-board memory with up to 32GB of microSD expansion.

Today we've received an anonymous tip with even more info. After a series of communications with this person, we're confident enough to at least pass along what was said. Mind you, we're still classifying it as rumor until we see further evidence. First off, our source claims to have spent time with the same four-button device we saw in the video yesterday. The "sturdy and well-built" tablet was "very thin," described as about the same thickness as an iPhone. Our source says that the P1000 model is correct and that it will indeed feature "full phone functionality" albeit without a dedicated earpiece on the bezel -- for audio, you'll have to rely on a Bluetooth headset or the P1000's speaker. Thank gawd... the last thing we want to see is someone screaming into a 7-inch tablet held to the side of their head. There's a front-facing camera for video calling and a 3.2 megapixel camera around back for shooting pictures and video. Granted, 3.2 megapixels seems suspiciously low for the notoriously pixel greedy Samsung. Besides Bluetooth, we're told that the Galaxy Tab will also feature WiFi and 3G data, a standard SIM slot, and can tether over USB or WiFi. Oh, and the battery can't be removed and the version our source used had a 6x4 icon layout and appeared to be running stock Android 2.2 Froyo. Interesting, eh?

P.S. GPS too.
