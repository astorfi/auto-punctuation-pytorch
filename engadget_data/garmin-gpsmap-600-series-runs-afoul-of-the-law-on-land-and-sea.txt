Looks like we're one step closer to an answer with the GPSMAP 600 series. These rugged, portable touchscreen nav units feature a 5.2-inch display (800 x 480) and come with two mounts: when placed in either the marine or auto mount, the device will start up in the appropriate mode. On the road, the domestic GPSMAP 640 ($1,199 MSRP) provides the maps, turn-by-turn directions, custom POIs and proximity alerts you expect. On the water you get aerial POI views and optional BlueChart g2 Vision for underwater 3D perspective. Rounding things out, XM WX Satellite Weather data, XM Satellite Radio and XM NavTraffic are available with the optional GXM 40 antenna and subscription. The international GPSMAP 620 ($999 MSRP) is a bit scaled down, with street maps and marine chart data available through the SD card slot. There you have it, kids -- and keep an eye out for Crockett and Tubbs![Thanks, Rich]
