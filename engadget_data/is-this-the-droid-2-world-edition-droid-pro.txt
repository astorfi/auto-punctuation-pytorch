Droid Life claims that we're looking at the Droid 2 World Edition (or Droid Pro, or whatever the heck it's called), featuring a pearly white back and a lighter chrome bezel up front; current rumors suggest that this might replace the original Droid 2 altogether, but it's anybody's guess until we see some official information. The site is also reporting that the OMAP3630 core seems to be clocked up to 1.2GHz -- the plain ol' Droid 2 settles for a measly 1GHz. All told, this is shaping up to be one of the quickest product revisions in smartphone history, so let's hope Verizon has the decency to put some sort of upgrade program in place for early adopters.
