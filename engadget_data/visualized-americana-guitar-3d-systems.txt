 Yep, the crazy looking guitar you see above from 3D Systems (being manhandled by our own Andy Bowen) was printed. Not created by machines or people, but pieced together by a 3D printer -- at least the body, that is. The neck, strings, and various jacks / knobs are all fabricated via other methods, but the body is all printed. That includes the many America-centric icons seen throughout the body, from the Statute of Liberty to the Brooklyn Bridge -- okay, okay, it's rather New York-centric, but 3D Systems head Avi Reichental tells us that 3D Systems used iconic New York locations as a representation for the "Americana" the guitar is supposed to embody. He says -- and we can't help but agree, many of us being New Yorkers -- that New York is an "emotional" symbol for the USA. Join us for a visual tour of the Americana, set to the backdrop of the San Francisco Bay, won't you?
