  It's getting so you need a map to traverse Samsung's mobile Galaxy, but that's not stopping the outfit from cranking out handsets -- no matter how minuscule the tweaks. Announced back in January, the Galaxy S Advance falls solidly on the middle of the OEM's consumer scale, delivering a speedy 1GHz dual-core experience on a build of Android 2.3.6. Naturally, the device comes outfitted with TouchWiz, but that skin doesn't get in the way of the apparent snappy performance, as we noticed navigation, transitions and browsing all carried on without a hiccup. As you might've guessed, the saturated, 4-inch 800 x 480 display is of the Super AMOLED variety, so you won't have much difficulty viewing the screen from a variety of angles. And while the construction is a typical plastic enclosure with subtly textured back, the combination of its light weight and thin profile conspire to make this one attractive purchase. A mostly global roll out's already underway, though sadly, the US isn't included on that select list. Peep the gallery below for some additional shots and, while you're at it, check out the video after the break.
