 Far be it from us to assert that Sandisk's acquisition of Israeli Msystems is a bit, shall we say, ridiculous in figures, but hey, the deal did got done. Sandisk handed over $1.55 billion wholly in stock to Msystems in exchange for their business; the firm will become a wholly owned subsidiary, and will presumably keep on doing that think they've been doing (like creating the U3 with Sandisk not so long ago). Not really a whole lot to see here otherwise though, just thought you might like to know since that's such a mighty huge number for to acquire an ally.[Thanks, Jake]
