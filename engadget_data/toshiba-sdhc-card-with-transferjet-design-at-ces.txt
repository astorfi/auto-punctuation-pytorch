 SD cards won't be generating the same feverish hype as other gear breaking cover at CES, but nevertheless, Toshiba's let the world know it'll be bringing a new one to the show. The company won't have a finished product to flog, but instead will be exhibiting a reference design for an SDHC card with TransferJet technology. For those unfamiliar with TransferJet, it's a high-speed wireless transfer technology for sending and receiving files over short distances. While it isn't used nearly as much as its transfer protocol peers, hopefully it'll find some work to do if and when Toshiba takes its card from design to product.
