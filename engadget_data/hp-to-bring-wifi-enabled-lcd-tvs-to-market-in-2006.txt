Now that everything from
cameras to
MP3 players comes with built-in WiFi, it's no surprise to
learn that televisions are the next great wireless frontier. HP is getting in on the game with a 37-inch, WiFi-enabled
LCD set to be released next year. Besides being able to stream content from a PC (and acting as a
Windows Media
Center Extender), this unit will also record video via a built-in DVR. A new HP-designed interface (to be
integrated into all future HP consumer electronics products) promises simple control of all functions by even the most
technophobic user â€” we'll see how that plays out!
