We doubt recent earnings reports at Dell have been met with balloons on the quad and sheet cake in the cafe. And that's likely the case this time around as well. The PC maker reported revenue of $14.07 billion, but earnings of just $372 million or 21 cents per share -- a bit shy of estimates. The company's stock price is hovering around the $13.65 mark, the amount shareholders have been promised once the firm goes private later this year. As you might imagine, Dell's books won't be open to public scrutiny once that transaction closes, making this one of the very last earnings reports. Things may not be looking so good for Q1 2014, but will the company end its public streak on a high note? We'll find out soon enough.
