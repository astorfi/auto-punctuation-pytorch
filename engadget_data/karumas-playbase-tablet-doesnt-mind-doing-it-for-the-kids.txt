Karuma is the newest to aim for the pre-Bieber crowd with the PlayBase: a cheap, durable tablet that's 9.7mm thick. The key specs include a 7-inch capacitive multitouch display, WiFi and a 1.2GHz Rockchip RK2918 Cortex A8 (the same chip in the AndyPad Pro, Archos Arnova 8 and 10). It's running a custom-skinned version of Gingerbread, but the company has included 1GB of DDR3 RAM in anticipation for a forthcoming bump to Honeycomb or Ice Cream Sandwich. As well as the rugged design, you'll also find it comes with a shock-absorbent silicon cover that protects the screen from the elements and can fold back to double as a kickstand. A front-facing camera and five hours advertised battery life round out the rugrat tablet (rugratblet?). Fans of pre-ordering things can throw down cash on November 15th and it'll be on sale proper come December 1st. Whichever way you wish to pay for it, it'll cost you £170 ($270).
