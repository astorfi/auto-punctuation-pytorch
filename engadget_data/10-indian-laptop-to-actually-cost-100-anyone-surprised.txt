 Come on, you didn't really believe that a $10 laptop was even remotely possible, did you? Yeah, didn't think so -- and unsurprisingly, that project sponsored by the Indian government to develop a low-cost laptop actually has a price target of $100, not $10. Chalk another one up to bad transcription, we suppose, although getting the price of a reasonable machine down to $100 won't be all that easy, either -- any bets on where the final price of this thing ends up?
