The local Georgia Tech chapter of the Association of Computer Machinery were awesome hosts and did an impressive job at organizing the event -- something we doubt we could've pulled off when we were in college. We also wanted to really extend our appreciate to everyone who participated including ZAGG who crashed the event with free headphones and gift cards -- and to think when we crash parties we usually don't bring anything. The pictures we took at the event are in the gallery below, but if you have some to add please post 'em on flickr with the tag EngadgetHD so everyone can find them, thanks. We were also happy to learn that a few of the participates were bloggers themselves, so to show our appreciation we wanted to share those sites with the rest of our readers. Thanks again, and we can't wait for the next one!
