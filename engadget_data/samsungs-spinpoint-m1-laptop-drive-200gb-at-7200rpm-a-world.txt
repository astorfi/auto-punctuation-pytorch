The business minded SpinPoint MP1 is the most interesting of the two by far, offering a massive 200GB of data spinning at a 7200rpm off a SATA 3.0Gbps interface -- an industry best. They say it's intended for enterprise RAID and blade servers but don't be surprised when people start bunging 'em into their laptops. The lowly SpinPoint M5 then, goes up to 160GB at 5400rpm with a SATA 1.5Gbps interface. However, Sammy wants you to know that a "dual-disk" model is under development offering up to 250GB of storage. Both will begin mass production in May for undisclosed prices. Read -- M5 Read -- M1
