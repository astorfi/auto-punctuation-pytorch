About the recent Bossaconference 08, one particular fellow managed to get some quality face time with Ubuntu Mobile and Moblin and break things down in bulleted fashion. Put simply, the former is a handheld (read: not phone / desktop) Linux OS that's optimized for touching and meant to be seen on 4- to 7-inch displays. As for the latter, it's merely a "project site for embedded Linux development," not an operating system in and of itself. Think you're ready to get schooled further? Tap the read link and dust off that Trapper Keeper.[Via jkOnTheRun]
