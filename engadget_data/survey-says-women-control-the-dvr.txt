After being derided as less technically
adept by their geekier-than-thou male cohorts for years, it turns out there's at least one home entertainment device
that women can call their own: the DVR. According to a new survey from cable network Lifetime, 55% of married women say
they understand their DVR's functions better than their husbands. Of course, the survey only questioned women, so we
assume that if husbands were asked the same queries, somewhere in the excess of 100% would say they're the DVR pros â€”
and that they control what shows are recorded as well (when they can find the remote, that is; since apparently men
don't ask where to find things, their wives may just end up taking charge after all).
