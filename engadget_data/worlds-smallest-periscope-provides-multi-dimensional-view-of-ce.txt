 We never thought we'd say this, but the standard microscope's day may be coming to an end. Okay, so maybe that's a stretch, but a new device conjured up by scientists at Vanderbilt University sure could stand in as a suitable and deserving replacement. In what's being described as the world's smallest version of the periscope, the so-called mirrored pyramidal wells are being used to allow researchers to see several sides of cells simultaneously. The pyramidal-shaped cavities are molded into silicon "whose interior surfaces are coated with a reflective layer of gold or platinum," and when a cell is placed inside, it gives Earthlings a magical multi-dimensional view. It's said that this technology is actually stupendously inexpensive compared to other methods of 3D microscopy, and according to Vandy's own Ron Reiserer, this "could easily become as ubiquitous as the microscope slide." Them's fightin' words, no?[Via Physorg]
