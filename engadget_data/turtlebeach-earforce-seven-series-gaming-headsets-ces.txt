 While Astro Gaming and Mad Catz like to announce stuff in a controlled drip, Turtle Beach -- as usual -- is going ahead with a tactical blitz of new gaming headsets at CES. Just as we've come to expect from the company, CES 2013 looks no different and no less exciting for audio-concerned gamers. While the headset veteran isn't showing anything with a major wow factor (think back to the PX5 from CES 2011), it's made some welcome updates to its Ear Force lineup, and finally announced concrete pricing info for its soon-to-be flagship Seven Series tournament models. We'll likely see some major announcements come E3, but for now, join us past the break -- especially if you're hoping to replace the likes that old PX21 (and its not-so sturdy earcups) of yours.
