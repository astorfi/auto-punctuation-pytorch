We're not so sure this was the kind of demo we'd have liked from Sony's, Toshiba's, and IBM's much hyped and lauded
Cell processor, but Toshiba ran a live
demo of the chip wherein it decoded 48 simultaneous standard-def MPEG-2 video streams, which were then projected onto a
1,920 x 1,080 (aka 1080i HD) display. That's great in sticking to their plan to also carve the microprocessor an
embedded multimedia powerhouse niche, but we're gonna remain aporetic until we see just how many polygons this thing's
really going to push.
