Neuros has updated its standalone MPEG-4 Recorder and set it sights squarely on PSP users in the process, dumping
the SD support of the original model in favor of
MemoryStick, and adding the PSP's native 368x208 as a recording resolution option. The Neuros MPEG-4 Recorder 2, as
it's called, also adds support for iPod compatible video, as well as 640x480 resolution for better playback on TVs.
Like the original model, the MPEG-4 Recorder 2 can rip video from just about any source without the need for a PC,
although with just a MemoryStick for storage (or a CF card using the available slot) you're not going to be able to
load it up with lots of stuff in one shot.Â  It'll run you $150.
