 Some big news out of Hulu late this afternoon: CEO Jason Kilar has just announced that he will be leaving the company sometime in the first quarter of this year. The news was first reported by Bloomberg News and followed quickly by a blog post from Kilar himself containing the email he sent to his staff. In it, Kilar says that he is now working with the company's board to manage the transition, and also confirms that Senior Vice President and CTO Richard Tom will be leaving along with him. He didn't exactly delve into the reasons for his resignation, though, saying only that the decision has been "one of the toughest I've ever made," and adding that he'll keep the team updated as "dates and other items get solidified."
