However, Lightroom fans who update to version 3.5 (currently at release candidate stage) should discover that it effortlessly handles RAW images from a bunch of recent cameras including the Olympus E-P3 and E-PL3, Panasonic G3 and GF3, and the Sony Alpha NEX-C3 The update will also fix a number of bugs, such as inconsistent processing times and a loss of geo-tagging metadata when converting to Adobe's Digital Negative format. Time to get those psychedelic HDR images flowing.
