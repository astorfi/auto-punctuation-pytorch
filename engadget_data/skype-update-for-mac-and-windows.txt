And, you guessed it, today's no exception. Unlike in previous occasions, however, this time Skype's software goods are only for folks using Redmond or Cupertino machines -- but they're also quite diminutive, so the Linux crowd won't be missing out on too much. How so? Well, both versions (Mac 5.8, Windows 5.10) aren't really adding any fresh features, only bringing an undisclosed amount of "generic" bug fixes and some unspecified enhancements to keep the apps running smoothly. You can grab the updates now from either of the links below, or straight from the Skype application on your computer.
