Hot on the heels of its minuscule Playdisc, the company is still making noise at KES by unveiling its i-EGG DAP speaker, which sports a "futuristic" oval enclosure, detachable stereo speakers, a 3.5-millimeter audio input jack, USB port, and an SD slot for loading up your tunes. This battery-powered device also touts stereo out -- in case the mysterious internal wattage isn't robust enough for you -- and it supports both MP3 and WMA from your USB thumb drive / SD card of choice. While pricing information was not disclosed, we do know that Axxen plans to hatch this in late October for the Korean market.[Via Akihabara News]
