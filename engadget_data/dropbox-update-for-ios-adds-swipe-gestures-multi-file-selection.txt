Dropbox's latest update for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch solves some of the minor niggles we've had with its iOS version. You can now share links to folders direct from the app, while the refresh also adds the ability select and share multiple files at once. Alongside the obligatory bug fixes and performance improvements, Dropbox version 2.3 also throws in a handful of new touchscreen-friendly gestures to the mix, allowing the user to share, move, delete or tag favorite files with a swipe. The update's started to roll out to our iOS devices, or you can jump the queue at the source link below.
