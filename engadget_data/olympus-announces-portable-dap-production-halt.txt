Grab your tissues, folks, 'cause it's a sad day for the legions of Olympus MP3 player fans worldwide. (Pause. Wait
for laughter. Continue.) So we may have exaggerated that whole "legions of fans" thing a bit, but we're pretty sure
that a few people will be upset to learn that Olympus has announced it will halt production of portable DAPs, along
with shifting production focus away from compact digital cameras and towards digital SLRs. The only good news here is
that our m:robe, which gets mocked everywhere we
go, will soon become a collector's item that we can unload for profit on eBay.
