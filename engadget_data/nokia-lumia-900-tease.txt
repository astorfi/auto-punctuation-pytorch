Yes, the Nokia Lumia 900 was caught looking through Windows Phone apps once again. This time, it became the latest addition to WPBench's database. While it didn't lend any credence to rumors that the AT&T-bound version will be nicknamed the Ace, we at least have another piece of evidence to convince us that the newest entry to Nokia's Windows Phone pursuits is indeed real and likely on its way real soon. We're keeping our fingers crossed for something juicy this week.
