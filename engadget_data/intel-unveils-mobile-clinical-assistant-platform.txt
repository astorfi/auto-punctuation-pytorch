 Intel took the wraps off some of its latest handiwork yesterday, showing off plans for a new mobile computing platform for healthcare professionals at its Developers Forum in San Francisco. The platform, dubbed the mobile clinical assistant, is designed to streamline the work-flow of doctors and nurses, letting them digitally record patient's vital signs, progress charts, and prescription information on specially-designed tablet PCs, and wirelessly transfer that information to pharmacists or anyone else that needs to check up on your vitals. Anything in the way of specific details are still pretty vague at the moment, but the first devices based on the platform are set to be developed by Motion Computing and introduced in the first half of 2007. Among the possibilities for the devices are RFID-scanning to identify patients (better pack that tinfoil hat for your next hospital visit), barcode scanning for prescriptions, and integrated digital cameras. We're all for improving healthcare through technology but, to be honest, we'd kinda like to have a couple of these around Engadget HQ for ourselves -- especially given the spill-proof, drop-tolerant casing.[Via Geekzone]
