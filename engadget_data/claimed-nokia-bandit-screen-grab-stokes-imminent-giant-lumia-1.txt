While technically not the biggest Nokia news of the morning, it's possibly news of the biggest Nokia. The ever resourceful @evleaks has posted what is claimed to be a screenshot from the Nokia "Bandit," also suspected to emerge as the Lumia 1520. There's a lot going on in the image, but one thing's for sure, you'll not be left wanting for space for mini tiles. Though even then, there are options.


Update: Upon further inspection, there are a few interesting things to note. The original image is 1,080 x 1,920 -- a resolution not currently supported in Windows Phone. This corroborates claims that GDR3 will be coming along for the ride, along with a revised camera app (or icon, at least). Oh, and of course, more columns and rows for your start menu!
