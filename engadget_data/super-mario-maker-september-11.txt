After a year of teasing, Nintendo's finally revealed when we'll get to make side-scrolling Mario levels of our own in Super Mario Maker: September 11th, 2015. Can't wait that long? The gaming giant is partnering with Best Buy again, and tomorrow (June 17th) from 4PM to 9PM local time, select stores will have demo kiosks where you can kick the game's tires. As a reward for you enduring the crowds of kicking fans, you'll snag a 30th anniversary Mario button. Pretty cool, right? Supplies are limited, of course, and Nintendo's set up a website to help you locate where the nearest participating yellow-tag store is.
