So, now that the bar is set at an unbelievably high level, how's about an outlay of the sure-to-be-phenomenal specs? We're talking a 4.8-inch display, brushed-metal housing, a 3D view using NASA terrain height data, free real-time traffic updates for life, voice destination entry, Bluetooth handsfree support, text-to-speech and an inbuilt lane assistant. The only question left is simply this: is all of that uber enough to warrant the $599 price tag?
