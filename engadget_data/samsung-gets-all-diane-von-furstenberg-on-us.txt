So now that we can all officially say that technology
and fashion go
hand-in-hand, we can really stop being surprised when
designers come out with special-edition gadgets. Like, for example, Vogue's and Dianne Von Furstenberg's new
couture-tech line, which includes the DVF Mobile (a gussied-up Samsung SPH-A680 cameraphone) and an accessory called
the CityBand which makes carrying the essentials (cellphone included, we presume) easier. A lady gadget bag, if you
will. We think weÂ may wait it out for palmOne to release a Issei Miyaki Treo 650, though.
