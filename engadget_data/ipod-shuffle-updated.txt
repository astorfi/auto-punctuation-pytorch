 It's been quite a while since the Shuffle has been updated, but we're happy to say that Apple has shown the tiniest of its music players some much needed love. There's only one change here, but it's by far the most important -- colors! Now the tiny PMPs will match their revamped "iTouch" brothers. Just, you know, with much less functionality. There's even a soft and subtle pink model for all those ladies out there that love being pandered to and a Project (RED) version for the socially conscious. The latest generation of the shuffle should start shipping today.
