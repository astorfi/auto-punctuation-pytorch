 As stylish as it can be, LG's Optimus L Series is very appliance-like, the smartphone line that gets the job done versus the more luxuriant Optimus G. It's almost no surprise, then, that LG's sales rate has accelerated to the volume we'd expect from an air conditioner or fridge: just two months after the L Series hit 10 million in sales since launch, it's already at 15 million. That's no doubt heartening to LG, especially with the L Series II right around the corner. We doubt Samsung will break into cold sweats, though. When the Galaxy S III alone moved twice as many units by November of last year, LG still has some catching up to do in 2013.
