 We've known that the Galaxy Note 10.1 was destined for Verizon Wireless as early as CES two months ago, but now Big Red has finally supplied us with details on when and how much. The carrier will begin offering the Note 10.1 this Thursday, and all it will cost you is a mere $600 for the privilege of calling it your very own. To recap, Verizon's version will offer Android 4.1 with cascading Multi-Window support, a 1.4GHz quad-core Exynos processor, 2GB RAM, 7,000mAh battery and -- naturally -- the carrier's huge logos taking up the most space on the back.
