Though the last Best Buy database screencap ended up being even more dubious than we had suspected, today's MacRumors-borne pic has the added bonus of a trio of new entries, aptly titled Dummy SKU A, B, and C, respectively. There's not a lot to go on here, and assuming the shot is legit (we cannot independently confirm at this point), it doesn't really say much. Oft-coveted refreshed MacBook Pros? Those pesky WiFi iPads due out next month? Bobble heads for Steve Jobs, Phil Schiller and Scott Forstall? We may never know for sure.
