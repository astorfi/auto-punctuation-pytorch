Barely hours into day one of the Nikon D80's official existence, we're seeing hands-on previews galore coming from camera review sites that have been very evidently sitting on this one for a bit. Not that we're complaining -- and neither are the reviewers. The general consensus seems to be that the D80 is basically the D200 for nearly half the price. Going for around $999 street, the D80 packs in plenty of features derived -- or just plain ripped -- from the Nikon D200 and D2x, and uniquely stores the resulting images on that stash of SD and SDHC cards most everybody has these days. We'll look forward to full reviews to get all the juicy performance details, but we're sure that the 10.2 megapixel CCD and those speedy shutter times won't go unrewarded.[Thanks, Mike]Read - PopPhotoRead - DPReviewRead - Imaging ResourceRead - LetsGoDigital
