Ok, but what if the college he dropped out of was Harvard, and the one job he's is as founder and chairman of the world's most powerful software company? No, not even then? If you haven't already seen it, watch as our man Bill flounders in the hunt for a new gig, as shown at his final CES keynote a couple of days ago. Good luck out there, man -- and don't forget, if you're looking for a few extra bucks we'd love your help covering Macworld next week.
