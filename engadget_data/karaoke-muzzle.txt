Nip that pesky karaoke squawk in the bud with this handy gadget from our ever resourceful friends in Japan: the
karaoke muzzle. Wail away long into the night without disturbing your neighbors or sleeping significant other. No need
to hold back on that killer rendition of Extreme's More Than Words when the inspiration strikes (as it so often does)
at 3 a.m.
