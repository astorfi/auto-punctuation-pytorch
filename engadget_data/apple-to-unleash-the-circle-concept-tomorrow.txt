The latest word to sweep the internets is that Apple is prepping to get all up in Zune's "The Social" grill with "The Circle." Unfortunately, that's the only word on the service / products so far, other than that it's going to be centered around video. So player-to-player video sharing? New branding for existing video products? Steve Jobs is starting a cult? Free Sesame Street song with every iPod? We really have no idea, but we'll be finding out soon enough.[Via PMP Today]
