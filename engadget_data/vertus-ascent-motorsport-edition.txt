Nokia may not be making the same cash as they once were, but we have a feeling that if nothing else the margin on
selling a Vertu or two might provide them a slight
bit of saving grace. Their latest to follow the Pink
Edition (featuring a pink leather case) is the Ascent Motorsport Edition, a variation on the classic Ascent with a
"Liquidmetal" alloy and oil-resistant leather case, inlaid with carbon fiber, and produced in a limited run of 997
devices. Yours now for the cost of an organ transplant (or two).
