If you've ever signed up for a Uplay account, your information could now be in the hands of criminals. Ubisoft's confirmed that a security breach at one of its sites, now closed, has granted hackers access to sensitive user data (i.e., usernames, emails and passwords). Critically, no actual financial information was leaked, owing to the fact that Ubisoft doesn't retain personal credit or debit card account numbers on its servers. Regardless, the Assassin's Creed developer is taking proactive measures, contacting account holders directly and strongly advising them to update any related passwords. You can find the full email just after the break.




    Dear Member, 			We recently found that one of our Web sites was exploited to gain unauthorized access to some of our online systems. We instantly took steps to close off this access, investigate the incident and begin restoring the integrity of any compromised systems. 			During this process, we learned that data had been illegally accessed from our account database, including user names, email addresses and encrypted passwords. Please note that no personal payment information is stored with Ubisoft, meaning your debit/credit card information was safe from this intrusion.  			Out of an abundance of caution, we also recommend that you change your password on any other Web site or service where you use the same or a similar password. 			You can find more information here https://support.ubi.com/en-US/FAQ.aspx?platformid=60&brandid=2030&productid=3888&faqid=kA030000000eYZ2CAM. 			For any additional support enquiries, please contact our customer service via our support web site at https://support.ubi.com 			We sincerely apologize to all of you for the inconvenience. Please rest assured that your security remains our priority. 			The Ubisoft team
