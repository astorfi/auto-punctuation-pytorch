       Looks like we might not have to wait quite as long as we feared to reach that promised land of flash-based laptopsfor the masses -- at least according to Intel. They're expecting to start tossing NAND flash chips into notebooks beginning next year, mainly tobenefit start times and lower power consumption. It sure is a convenient time for Intel, in light of their recentpartnership with Micron to produce NAND chips, with first customer being Apple who took $500 million worth for theiriPods. Also, Micron just today announced their purchase of Lexar Media for $688 million in stock, so there will beplenty of muscle behind these laptop flash drives when they do finally start to come around.Read: Intel promises flash HDs next yearRead:Micron buys Lexar
