Granted, 6.1 still hasn't been announced to the world, but it's a well-documented rev that should do a decent job of holding us all over until 7 finally (finally!) happens. Given the pure hotness of the hardware, we kinda wish Microsoft actually had rolled some sort of crazy post-6.1 update just for it, but we guess Sony Ericsson's custom panel interface will have to pick up the slack there.[Via SEfanatics]
