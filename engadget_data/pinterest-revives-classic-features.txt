 When Pinterest unveiled its big redesign last month, it took the sort of gamble on feature trade-offs that we've seen before: some big leaps forward at the expense of a few leaps back. Much to the relief of many, the company is already doing what it can to restore what was lost while still forging ahead. Veteran users can once again see pins they've just posted, mention friends and find would-be contacts on Facebook on Twitter. As for the less nostalgic among us? The progress isn't as dramatic, but it's there: Pinterest has reworked notifications to show their history, and searches now include as-you-type keyword suggestions. More updates are on the way, including notifications for new pins, so we wouldn't worry that Pinterest is spending most of its time mending broken fences.
