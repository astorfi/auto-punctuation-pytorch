The MediaSmart Receiver does the usual MCE business (actually, it's an Extender for Windows Media Center, meaning it can do DivX and XviD), in addition to playing H.264, MPEG-2, AAC, having built-in 802.11a/b/g/n, a Pocket Media Drive bay, and all the outputs you'll need to get the thing up and running (component, HDMI with HDCP). And, of course, it'll stream you media via DLNA / UPnP servers, play it off the drive or USB ports, as well as switching modes o HP's own media interface, just in case you're not into the Extender experience (or don't rely on an XP or Vista box to deal with your media). No pricing intel just yet, but expect a Spring release. Of course, if you wanted to get a small Media Center Extender with a hard drive, USB, and high def outputs, there are a few decent alternatives out there.
