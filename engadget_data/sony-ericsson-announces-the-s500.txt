This winsome slider is a bit of an oddity in that it has most of the features expected in a Walkman-branded handset, but is not -- instead it's said to be inspired by "the materials and colors found in the natural world." Featuring quadband GSM plus EDGE (no HSDPA to be found here), a 2 megapixel cam, Memory Stick Micro expandability, nine hours talk and 370 hours standby, the goodness finds itself piled in non-traditional colored "Mysterious Green" or "Spring Yellow" housings. Unique to this handset is theme and external lighting effects that can be set to change with the season, as day turns to night or even at the beginning of the weekend; this seems like a fun idea, as long as the blinky lights aren't too bright. No word on carrier or pricing, but we can expect it to hit in Q3 this year.
