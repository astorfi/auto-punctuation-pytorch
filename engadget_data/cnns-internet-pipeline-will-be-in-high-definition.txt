 Good
news/bad news situation for people looking interested in more high
definition news content. In case you hadn't heard, CNN will be
launching Pipeline tomorrow,
an online streaming video service (subscriber only). For $25 a month year
you get your choice of four video streams which will feature little if
any anchor commentary. 

The good news, is that the entire control room will feature high
definition equipment and all original content will be filmed in HD (no
mention of resolution). All video will be streamed in a widescreen
format although not in high definition, citing bandwidth (maybe they
should work something out with our friends at 2Much?).
Video not originally shot in widescreen will be stretched to fill the
frame with the same technology currently in use by TNT-HD.Beyond
the implications of a major news network providing so much content just
for the Internet and going subscriber only, even though we can't watch
it in high definition just yet now that they have the equipment in
place perhaps CNN-HD isn't that far off. Not just for cable and
satellite customers, but as IPTV rolls out to more media-addicted
consumers maybe multiple interactive high definition news streams will be a
killer app.Read [Via TV Newser]
