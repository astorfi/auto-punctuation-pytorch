Now the company wants in on the fitness tracking craze. Forbes is reporting that Ma Bell will start offering apparel that could track GPS routes, heart rate and other vital stats -- similar to the E39 shirt above from Zephyr and Under Armour. The clothing isn't just for athletes though, the military, first responders and seniors could also benefit from the technology. Sadly, no firm release date or prices were announced, so don't expect to wander into a Modell's and pick up a wicking t-shirt that uploads your workouts to RunKeeper any time soon.
