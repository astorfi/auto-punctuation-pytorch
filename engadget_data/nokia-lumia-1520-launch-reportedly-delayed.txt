If you believe the rumors, Nokia was supposed to launch the supersized Lumia 1520 (aka Bandit) as soon as next week. However, this unannounced Windows Phone may have hit an unofficial snag: Reuters claims that Nokia has delayed the unveiling by "several weeks" in the wake of Microsoft's plans to buy the company's device business. There's no word on an adjusted release date, although the historically accurate @evleaks has heard that the 1520 might appear in late October. Not surprisingly, Nokia isn't commenting on delays for a product that doesn't officially exist -- but don't be shocked if there's a new flagship Lumia later in the fall.
