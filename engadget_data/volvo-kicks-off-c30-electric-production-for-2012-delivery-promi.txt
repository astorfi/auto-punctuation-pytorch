Earlier this week, the car maker announced that it's just started producing the C30 Electric (as test-driven by us back in March), the task of which is split between the company's Belgium and Swedish plants. If all goes well, Volvo will deliver 250 or more units to leasing customers across Europe (Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway) by the end of 2012. There's no word on US availability for this petrol-free ride, but Volvo will instead be offering the more powerful V60 plug-in hybrid to its American friends in 2013 or 2014. Patience is a virtue, dear friends.
