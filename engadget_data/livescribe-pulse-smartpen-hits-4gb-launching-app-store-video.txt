Today we get a new titanium color on the outside and bump from 2GB ($170) to 4GB ($200) within. There's also a tease of an Application Store launch later this year. Oh boy, that's exactly what's been holding back the smartpen industry from replacing all those pesky laptops in collegiate lecture halls.
