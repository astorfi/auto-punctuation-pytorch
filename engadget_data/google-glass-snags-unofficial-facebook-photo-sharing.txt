Sure, Glass Explorers can post photos to Google+ with the high-tech headsets straight out of the box, but sharing to other sites requires additional glassware. While Facebook has yet to out its own app for Glass, an unofficial application dubbed Glass To Facebook has just arrived, allowing Google's adventurers to post images to the social network. Hooking up the the app appears to be an easy affair, consisting of granting the software access to a user's Google and Facebook accounts, and enabling it with Zuckerberg's crew. After that, Mountain View's headgear guinea pigs will be able to snap pictures and shoot them to Facebook. Count yourself as a lucky Google Glass owner?
