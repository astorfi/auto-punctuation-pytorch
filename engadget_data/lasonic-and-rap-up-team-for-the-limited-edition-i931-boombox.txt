Weighing in at about 25 pounds, this behemoth boasts two 12-inch speakers, it docks and charges your iPod, and it's going to look semi-fly doing it, too. It's also got an AM/FM tuner, EQs, an alarm clock -- you know, the works. This hulking "high performance portable music system" is destined to make you nostalgic for a simpler time of miniscule MP3 players with teensy little earbuds. It's $189 and available now.[Via Rap-Up]
