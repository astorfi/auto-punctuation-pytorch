  It's easy for life to imitate art when you're armed with near billion dollar coffers. Taking a cue from his 1989 hit, The Abyss, James Cameron made a solo plunge down to the deepest part of the Earth -- a spot seven miles below sea level known as the Challenger Deep -- and recorded his journey in 3D for our slack-jawed, couchbound amusement. The terrain, described by Cameron as both "desolate" and "lunar," is part of the Mariana Trench and had remained unexplored by humanity since the Trieste first touched down in 1960. That two man crew, hampered by the technological advancements of the time, didn't have the luxury of capturing the undersea trek, so when Cameron's footage finally hits screens, it'll be the planet's first peek at a truly alien world. Conspiracy theorists and New Age-y types will be disheartened by the lack of any reported close encounters of the aquatic or Steve Zissou kind, as the blockbuster filmmaker only spied a variety of small, whitish and, predominantly, eyeless creatures. The trip was seven years in the making, and involved the construction of the Deepsea Challenger -- the high-tech mini-sub which carted Cameron safely to the Pacific Ocean's depths and back.
