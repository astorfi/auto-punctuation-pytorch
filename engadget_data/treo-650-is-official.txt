Yep, the wait is over: the Treo 650 got officially
official today, and right on schedule, too (well, depending on whether or not you take into account them seriously
jumping the gun and accidentally distributing the Treo
650 press release last week). No, you can't buy it yet—you're at the mercy of the carriers now, which won't
actually be offering the new smartphone until they're good and ready—but at least we know that it can't be too much
longer now. And as we all already knew, the major improvements over the old Treo are Bluetooth, a higher resolution LCD
screen, a faster processor, and a removable battery. The stuff we are disappointed by: still only 32MB of memory,
supposedly some carriers will be crippling the Bluetooth, and the camera is still only VGA quality—no bump up to 1.3
megapixels like we'd hoped.
