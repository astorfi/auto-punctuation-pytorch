  A Galaxy S II it is not, but that isn't a bad thing, as not everyone's kosher with cramming 4.65-inches worth of superphone into their pocket. Enter T-Mobile's Galaxy S Blaze 4G -- a souped up Galaxy S class device with some new silicon from its faster (and larger) brother. Hitting select stores March 21st, followed by more retail outlets and online on the 28th, those plunking down the $150 asking price will be treated to a 1.5GHz Snapdragon S3 processor, a 4-inch Super AMOLED WVGA panel and a 5 megapixel rear shooter with 720p video capture. TouchWiz and Gingerbread are still the name of the game here, but Samsung's assured us an Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade will come in due course. With a couple of weeks before judgement day, why not get cozy with our hands-on from MWC? Go-on, it won't bite.
