 For anyone who doubts that we live in a 1984esquesociety, the high-tech surveillance that is planned for Super Bowl XL this Sunday should prove once and for all that notonly has Big Brother arrived, he's moved in, unpacked, and cracked open a beer. According to super-secret spy gearmanufacturer Intrepid Defense & Security Systems, the 5,468 law enforcement agencies monitoring everyone'smovements, facial features, and heartbeats will have a new tool at their disposal for the first time at the 'Bowl-live-action 3-D holograms projected inside a box so top secret that this is the only pic we could find. The fuzz willbe getting their spy-on from surveillance vans patrolling Detroit, and use remote long range, hidden miniature, andembedded street cameras to stream data to the LiveVision3D display and rendering software for viewing"three-dimensional holography that can reveal shadows, angles, depths and details unseen by conventionalimaging." Since we have a few unpaid parking tickets from our college days, and shouldn't risk this type of publicexposure, we think we'll skip the full-on surveillance assault and catch the game on our pimped out riginstead (from the Ultimate Man CaveCouch, perhaps?).[Via Digital Tech News]
