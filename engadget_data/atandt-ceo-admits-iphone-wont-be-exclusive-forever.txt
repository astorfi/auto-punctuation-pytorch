That word came at Fortune's now happening Brainstorm: Tech conference, where Stephenson unsurprisingly didn't elaborate on any negotiations with Apple, and only went so far as to say that he thinks AT&T's partnership with Apple "works really, really well -- maybe as well as any strategic partnership we have." Of course, none of that means exclusivity is going away anytime soon, and you can pretty safely bet that AT&T will keep on pushing as long as it can.
