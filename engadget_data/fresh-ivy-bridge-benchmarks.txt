  We've heard whispers of Ivy Bridge's benchmarking prowess, but now we have more comprehensive and independent test results of a Core i7 3770K CPU, courtesy of AnandTech. The conclusion? The upgrade is "quite good," which is Anand Lal Shimpi's way of describing a 5-15 percent boost in CPU performance for the same money as Sandy Bridge, not to mention lower power consumption and the ability to run the latest games on the HD 4000 integrated graphics. Of course, this latter discovery requires clarification: some games, such as Metro 2033 could only achieve 30fps at a max resolution of 1366 x 768, but others fared better. Crysis Warhead ran at 50fps even at 1680 x 1050. With that type of onboard oomph, you'd have to spend over $100 on a discrete graphics card for it to be worthwhile, which even Lal Shimpi acknowledges is "sort of insane".
