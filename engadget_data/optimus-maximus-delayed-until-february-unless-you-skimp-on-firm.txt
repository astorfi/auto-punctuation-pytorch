Art Lebedev has announced that the Optimus Maximus keyboard isn't quite ready for prime time yet, and will be delayed until late February. Lucky for you reckless early adopters out there, if you pre-ordered the Maximus you can get Art Lebedev to ship you the keyboard now, it'll just be lacking its final firmware, and therefore you've got a bit of a hack job to look forward to when Lebedev releases the full firmware -- which will be software-updatable. Not exactly exciting news, but we'd much prefer Lebedev get this out the door than sit around a few more years waiting on perfection.
