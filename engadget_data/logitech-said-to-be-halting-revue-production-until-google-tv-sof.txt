DigiTimes' nameless sources today report that Gigabyte, the company charged with building Revue units for Logi, has been instructed to stop production of them for the period covering December 2010 through January 2011. The restart in manufacturing will be conditional, we're told, either on a significant update to the current Google TV software or a whole new version rolling out. The Revue is still available to buy through Logitech -- shipments are only drying up in the channel between manufacturer and vendor -- but if the insiders have their story straight, this'd be a clear indication that early sales expectations have not been met. Better luck next year, we say.
