All the while, however, it's remained one of the last broadcast holdouts against offering content to the Hulu empire. Now, CBS chief Les Moonves says new Hulu Plus subscription service has interested the broadcaster enough to open talks with the video service. Don't get your hopes up, though, as discussions won't necessarily lead to anything and it's not necessarily your only option for legally streaming the channel online. Still, feel free to fancy a converged queue of episodes from across the networks. Why, that'd be awesome times awesome. That'd be awesome squared.
