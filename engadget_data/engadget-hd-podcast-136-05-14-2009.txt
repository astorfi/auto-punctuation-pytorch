  We're sticking with our format of taking live comments from the Ustream chat at the end of each topic. Big news on the HTPC front this week, as a way to get CableCARDs working with non-OEM supplied systems was unveiled and we even went through the process of getting the job done. If DIY HTPC tech isn't geeky enough for you, you'll probably like our HD 101 explanation of some of the alphabet soup in HDTV. We also talk about some gear that's passed through our hands lately, including the SlingPlayer Mobile for iPhone, Samsung's wall-mounted BD-P4600 Blu-ray player, and Logitech's Harmony Adapter for the PlayStation 3. Toss in some discussion about BD-Live's failure to capture our imagination, debate about whether to take in the new Star Trek movie in an IMAX or DLP theater, DISH Turbo HD customers missing out on the latest HD offerings, and chewing over what to do about line conditioners for your theater rig, and we call it a podcast!
