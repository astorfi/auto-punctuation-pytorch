 Earlier this month, Mr. Khalil Zaidan of Portland, Oregon, sued Acer, Gateway, Toshiba, HP, IBM, and Fujitsu for violating his 1996 patent "Hinge Assembly for Electronic Devices." A closer reading of the patent indicates that Zaidan seems to have patented the basic principle behind a tablet PC, allowing a computer to perform "rotational adjustment." Still, the case -- filed in United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division -- seems like a pretty easy way to milk these big companies for some cash, given that tablet PCs have been around well before November 2006. Nevertheless, while Zaidan is asking the court for damages on patent infringement be decided in a jury trial, we're betting that this gets settled out-of-court pretty quick. We're pretty sure that if Zaidan could actually build a Commodore 64-esque tablet (that's what his diagram is supposed to represent, right?), he could just make money from that instead of going through all this legal nonsense.
