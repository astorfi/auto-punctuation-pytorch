As you can see above, however, the device is unsurprisingly a little less sleek looking than it was in the polished press photos, but still far from an eyesore. What's more, while it didn't delve into a full review, Tech Ticker did say that the Y has a "good" build quality, and that the keys are "nicely spaced out." Be sure to hit up the link below for plenty more pics, and decide for yourself if it's worth the $800+ price tag.[Thanks, Chirag]
