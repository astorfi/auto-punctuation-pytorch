Kakai, an undercover startup that we heard whispered about back in April, is slowly but surely removing their own veil. Now, the company has decided to go by Kno (short for knowledge, dude), and will make its public debut at the D8 conference next month. All we've heard so far is that the company's first product will be a Linux-based "foldable double-screened device, [which is] designed to feel like a mix of laptop and textbook." It'll be both portable and gesture-based, and as you'd likely imagine, will be aimed directly at the education market. We're also told that the endeavor will include "robust software and a seamless website to deliver course material, allowing for note-taking and offering other audio and video capabilities," and while that's all a bit difficult to simply envision without a stiff cup of java to stimulate the imagination, we'll be taking an up close and personal look in just a few days when we head out to California for Walt and Kara's annual shindig.
