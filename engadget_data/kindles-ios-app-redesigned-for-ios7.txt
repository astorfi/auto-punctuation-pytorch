We swear, we won't be giving you the blow-by-blow on every single app that gets updated for iOS 7 today, but this one seemed like a biggie. Amazon just announced that its Kindle reader for iOS has received a major redesign, with fonts, menus and other details retooled to match the flat, streamlined look of iOS 7. Additionally, version 4.0 of the app brings "Collections" to make it easier to categorize books, magazines or whatever else you've downloaded. Other than that, Amazon's media alert is basically a recap of what the app does, so rather than rehash all that, let's cut straight to the screenshots, shall we? You can find those below; we'll just show ourselves out while you take a look.
