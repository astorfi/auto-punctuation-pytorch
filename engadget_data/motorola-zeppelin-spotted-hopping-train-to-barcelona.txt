That said, mobil.cz is reporting that this rather shapely device is an all-new Motorola smartphone bearing Android and the Zeppelin name that's scheduled for unveiling at MWC in Barcelona next month. It's said to have touch-sensitive buttons below the display, a 5 megapixel cam, 3.2-inch HVGA display, GPS, and Blur, presumably (well, hopefully) based on Android 2.0 or 2.1. In other words, it won't be the highest-end phone on the block, but it won't be the lowest, either -- and it could very well be the most stylish. If this is legit, we shouldn't have too long before we find out.
