Earlier rumors that it'd be called "Vibrant" are all but confirmed today thanks to a carrier-run site that's slowly revealing a rebus puzzle... and so far, we can clearly see Sam + Sun + G and Viking - King + [unknown] + Ant. So yeah, that pretty much locks it up -- and with a Super AMOLED display on board, we'd say the name fits perfectly (and TmoNews claims to have the original image anyway, where the unknown portion is Bee + R). We're expecting some sort of US-focused Galaxy S announcement out of Sammy next Tuesday, so we imagine this'll be it.
