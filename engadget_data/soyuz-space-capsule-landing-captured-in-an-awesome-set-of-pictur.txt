We're glad to report that the three astronauts, who had spent the last six months in the International Space Station, arrived safe and in one piece (well, three pieces total) on September 25 of this year, after a failed undocking attempt the day before. Various versions of the Russian Soyuz spacecraft have been in use since 1966.
