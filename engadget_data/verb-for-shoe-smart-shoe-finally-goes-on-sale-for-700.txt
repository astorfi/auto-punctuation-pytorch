Four years and several hundred melodramatic product renders later, the basic idea is the same: an embedded computer automatically adjusts the shoe to your feet, syncs with your PC, and communicates with the shoes of others to exchange contact information. We're not sure why you'd want to drop seven Bens on this functionality (we'd rather carry a cell phone and laptop and wear non-ridiculous shoes, you know?) but hey, if you're going to be a fashion disaster, you might as well do it with wireless capabilities.
