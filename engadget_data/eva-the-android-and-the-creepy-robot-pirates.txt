Not a Vegas lounge act, but a project by David Hanson, a doctoral student at the University of Texas's Institute for
Interactive Arts and Engineering. David has gone very far into facial-expression recognition… too far, in fact — we're
pretty sure we'll have nightmares after having seen these two videos. Now, we see a lot of
ridiculous-looking robots, and a fair number of
downright creepy droids, cross the news desk here at
Engadget, but we have never seen a robot with a goatee and an eye patch (okay, Disneyworld, but that doesn't count).
Nor have we seen anything quite as disturbing as the facial-expressions exhibited by Eva, a poor victim of advances in
elastomer material sciences, whose lot in life is as a neck sprouting awkwardly from a table. Peep the videos, friends,
but your retinas will never be quite the same.
