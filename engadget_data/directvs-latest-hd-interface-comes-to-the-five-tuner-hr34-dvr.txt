  Even if you don't have DirecTV, you've probably heard of the HR34 if you're into DVRs. That's because it's the only DVR from a provider that can record five HD shows at once and it also works in multiple rooms of the house thanks to RVU. All that upside came with a big downside, though, the old and ugly DirecTV DVR user interface. We figured it was only a matter of time before DirecTV's new HD user interface made it's way to the big daddy, and now Solid Signal reports that it's everything you've been waiting for with only slight differences from the HR24. No word on exactly when this update will roll out to HR34 DVRs everywhere, but we suspect it can't be long now.
