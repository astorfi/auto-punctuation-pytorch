We understand that any full-screen, touchscreen phone or DAP will look pretty similar given the limited panel sizes available to manufacturers. The possibilities with the user interface are however, infinite. We already know that you have a half dozen or so iPhones in-house so please, just admit to your "inspiration." No more weightless claims that your design appeared four days before the iPhone unveiling. You're not fooling anyone.
