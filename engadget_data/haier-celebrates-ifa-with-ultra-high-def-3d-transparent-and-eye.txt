For 2011, TV maker showed off its futuristic transparent and brain-controlled TV technologies. This year's selections are set to follow in that vein, beginning with the debut of a new 46-inch transparent TV built on last year's technology, capable of detecting six points at the same time. As before, Haier's seeing business potential in the device, and will be showing it off in the context of a window display at this year's show. Also on the slate is the company's first 3D LED Ultra High Definition set, a 55-incher that will be displaying Ultra High Def footage of booth visitors.

 Haier will be showcasing even more 3D stuff at the show, including a 55-inch glasses-free LED set with 28 viewing angles and 3D Multi-View, "which allows two people to watch two different images at the same time, on the total surface area of the screen," according to the company. Also on the docket is an eye-controlled set that lets viewers take charge of volume and channels with their peepers and a 3D gesture control system that has a camera built into the set's frame. On a more old school tip is the "high performance sensitive" remote, which has a nine-axis gyroscope inside.
