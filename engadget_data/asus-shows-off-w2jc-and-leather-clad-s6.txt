It's not going to be too much unlike every other laptop around (Core Duo processor,etc.) but hey, it's swathed in leather (which was apparently afeat requiring no less than 25 patents), man, and will sell for between £1400 - 1700 ($2450 - 3000 US). Asus wasannounced their new 17-inch W2Jc flagship laptop, featuring an aluminum chassis, subwoofer, DVB-T and analog TV tuners,120GB drive, Dolby audio, and a rather unfortunate £1,999 ($3,495 US) price tag.[Via ShinyShiny]
