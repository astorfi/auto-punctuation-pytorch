So it's only taken Playboy roughly six weeks to figure out how to exploit the
iPod photo with the iBod, which is basically just a set
of thumbnail porno pics specially formatted for the iPod photo that you download to your computer and then upload to
your player (so you'll have a little something something to enjoy no matter where you go). The first set's free (and R
ratedâ€”hey, we were just doing our research), to get the others you have to sign up for the Playboy Cyber Club.
