       We've gotten some reports in that the BlackBerry network has been completely offline in North America for the last couple of hours (since 8PM EST). Apparently email traffic and all BlackBerry Enterprise Server services have been totally wrecked; we confirmed with the BlackBerry-using among our crew. Apparently the network should be back online by or at midnight tonight -- anyone else seeing this issue? Let us know when it lights back up, would you?[Thanks, Harvey]
