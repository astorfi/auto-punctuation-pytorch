The company's latest Ball-based sweeper uses Dyson's proprietary (and complicated-sounding) Radial Root Cyclone technology to maximize its 235 air watts of suction power -- most of which is concentrated at the cleaner's head. It also ships with a mini turbine head, which you can use to clean up the hair that real animals leave on your car seat. In true Dysonian fashion, however, this Ball-bearing beast won't come for cheap. You can scoop one up at the source link below, for a cool $600.
