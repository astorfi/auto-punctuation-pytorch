Color us impressed. We got our first shot at Helio's upcoming superphone today, and from the all too brief time we had, we think this thing is gonna pack a punch. The dual slide mechanism was extraordinarily smooth -- one of the smoothest we've ever felt. It's big, but not unreasonably so for a handset of its capability and form factor, and the software build seemed slick and stable (the messaging app was killer, in particular). Click on for the Ocean in all its split-personality glory!
