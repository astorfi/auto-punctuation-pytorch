Art Lebedev is apparently hoping to solve that age-old dilemma with the Pultius remote, a concept created in response to a challenge to "design a remote control with as many buttons as there are channels on TV." Since it's just a concept, there's no word on price or availability, but really, we've learned not to expect that sort of thing from Art Lebedev at this point.
