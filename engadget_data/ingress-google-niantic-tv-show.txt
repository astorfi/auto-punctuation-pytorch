Google and its video game studio, Niantic Labs, are adding another layer to their augmented reality app, Ingress, by bringing it to TV, The Information reports. In Ingress, players travel -- in physical reality -- to marked locations called "portals," and they hack and defend those positions using iOS and Android devices, including Android Wear. It's a lot of mystery, stealth and geolocation wrapped in a sci-fi vibe, and players are meant to feel like operatives in world-changing missions. Plus, the app has been downloaded more than 10 million times since launching in 2012. Yeah, that sounds like it could make for a fairly entertaining TV show.



The Information says that Google and Niantic are working with Sean Daniel Co., the production company responsible for The Mummy film franchise and a new series heading to SyFy called The Expanse. Google hasn't pitched anything to networks and it hasn't appointed a showrunner, according to the report, so it seems like things are in early stages. We've reached out to Google for more information.
