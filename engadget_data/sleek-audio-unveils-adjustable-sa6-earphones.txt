Reportedly, these in-ear monitors utilize an "ultra wide band balanced armature driver with custom porting," which apparently allows the user to adjust the sound with the included treble / bass tuning ports. Additionally, the firm throws in a variety of tips and enables wearers to rock them "in three different ways." The SA6 is currently available for pre-ordering, and while these aren't slated to ship until Q3, you can save $20 off the normal $249.99 price tag by slipping your order in now.[Via Audio Junkies]
