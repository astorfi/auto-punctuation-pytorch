If you've been dreaming of drone-delivered packages since Amazon announced Prime Air last year -- apparently your dreams are getting a little closer to reality. In its 2013 letter to shareholders published today, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos not only confirms the delivery drone's existence but also addresses its production. In what still may be the greatest retail troll of all time, Bezos says "The Prime Air team is already flight testing our 5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles, and we are in the design phase on generations 7 and 8." All we want to know is what version Amazon will have to get to before we can start placing orders.
