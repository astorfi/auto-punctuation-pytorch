Just because it has the Commodore name on it doesn't mean it has anything anymore, but Yeahronimo Media Ventures,
which snapped up the brand from Tulip Computers late last
year, has busted out a new Commodore portable video player (or at least they've slapped the Commodore name on one). The
PMC30 isn't anything all that special otherwise (30GB hard drive, 3.6-inch LCD screen, 5 hour battery life for video,
and support for MPEG4, DivX 5.0, and WMV9 video files and MP3, AAC, and WMA audio files), which means that they're
hoping that the nostalgia kick alone will be enough to drive sales.
