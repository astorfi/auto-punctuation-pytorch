It's a iffy little entry-level device with a Blur-like UI and a fairly functional Android 2.1, but a lethargic 524MHz MSM7525 processor and 3-inch touchscreen with a resolution so small you can see individual pixels without squinting. UI browsing and surfing was laggy too, though we did like the device's comfortable-to-hold size and dedicated physical Send / End keys -- not to mention the the Backflip-like trackpad on the back. Let's hope this one arrives at a price low enough to woo the mainstream, because we're honestly having a hard time calling the Citrus a smartphone. 

Update: Now with screenshots and a test image from the Citrus camera!

Update 2: Video of the Citrus and the Motorola Droid Pro after the break.
