Here at CES, the outfit has introduced its Gen 2 pSSD lineup, which is comprised of the pSSD-P2 and pSSD-S2. Said drives are aimed at low-cost PCs (netbooks, in particular) as well as commercial applications such as POS terminals, printers and ATMs. Unfortunately, "aggressively priced" is as close as we're getting to an actual sticker, though we are told that they'll be available in 8/16/32/64GB capacities as early as next month.
