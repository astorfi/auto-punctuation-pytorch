The touchscreen seems resistive, but it's plenty sensitive, and the 1 second-ish page refresh rate makes it pretty usable. They weren't lying about the device feeling and looking like plastic, but we really do mean that in the nicest way possible. There's USB and a power button on the bottom, but looking at it straight on the device is about as minimal as could be. We'll have to really play with one before we can comment on usability, but from first glance the interface looks intuitive, well laid-out and surprisingly packed with functionality.  Update: We've got video up now as well. Look at all that sexy!
