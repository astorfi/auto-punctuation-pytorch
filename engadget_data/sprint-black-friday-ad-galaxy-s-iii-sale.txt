 As the holiday season draws closer, bargain hunters and retailers alike are starting to map out their Black Friday game plan. However, if you're balling on a budget and looking to score a stellar smartphone, then allow us to lend a helping hand. An anonymous tipster has shared a peek at one of Sprint's post-Turkey Day attractions, with the gory details shown in the image above. Both current and prospecting customers will have a chance to snag a Galaxy S III for $50 on a new two-year agreement, with Sprint no doubt hoping to use its unlimited data policy to lure to-be network switchers. Supplies are expected to be limited, so you'd be wise to get up entirely too early if you're hoping to guarantee yourself a unit.
