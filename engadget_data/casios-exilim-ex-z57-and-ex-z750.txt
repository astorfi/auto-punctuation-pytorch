A pair of new compact digital cameras from Casio today, the 7.2 megapixel Exilim EX-Z750 and the 5 megapixel Exilim
EX-Z57:



 The five megapixel EX-Z57 sports a 3x optical zoom lens and an oversized 2.7-inch LCD screen, the largest Casio has
ever stuck on the back of a digital camera. They had to ditch the optical viewfinder to make room for that larger LCD,
but they claim that despite the extra two-tenths of an inch, the battery life on the EX-Z57 is just as good as that of
the EX-Z55.



 The LCD screen on the 7.2 megapixel EX-Z750 isn't quite as large as the one on the EX-Z57—they held on to the optical
viewfinder, so the LCD's a more standard 2.5-inches in size—but like it's sibling this one also has a 3x optical zoom
lens (and honestly, they could do better, it's about time they started putting 4x or 5x zoom in these things). Other
features: a shutter release lag time of just 0.007 seconds and can record MPEG4 video clips.
