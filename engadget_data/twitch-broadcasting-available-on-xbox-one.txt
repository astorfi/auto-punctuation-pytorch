Xbox One owners, start your streams -- the Twitch app's broadcasting support is now available, just in time for Titanfall's launch on March 11th. As promised, you can share live gameplay sessions with viewers around the world. You can use your Kinect to chat with any fans, although any interaction is strictly optional. As long as you have a Twitch account and a willingness to show off, you can fire up your console to get the necessary app update and start playing in the public eye.
