For those who slept in, it looks as if RadioShack will be the go-to place if you're looking to snag one early from the retail universe. According to the badly formatted flyer pictured above, The Shack will be the first B&M location to stock the US version of the HTC Desire Z, and it'll be hawking 'em for $149.99 on a two-year postpaid contract starting October 3rd. Got that penciled into your little black book? Good.
