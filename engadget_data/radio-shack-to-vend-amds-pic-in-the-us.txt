Remember AMD's low-power $300 PIC (Personal
Internet Communicator)? Yeah, it's not really on par in price with the
$100 Negroponte, but what we didn't see coming
was an American retailer like Radio Shack picking up the 366MHz Windows CE-based box for distribution stateside. But
apparently Radio Shack believes there's still a persistent market in selling underpowered low-cost consumer computing
devices. Why? Well, we're not entirely sure what appeal a $300 PIC would have for a consumer who can buy a $400 proper
(however low-end) PC, but for the lesser informed buyer it really might not be a very hard sell.
