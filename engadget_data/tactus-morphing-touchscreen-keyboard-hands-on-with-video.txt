 We had opportunity to catch Tactus at SID earlier this year, though with news that the Tactus keyboard was new and improved for CES we had no choice but to take a quick peek. What's new? Well, Tactus has been sampling some new coating materials attempting to reduce glare -- and succeeding -- and to cut down on the controller's size by 70 percent and in so doing also doubled up the speed that the keyboard activates. As a refresher, the system includes a reservoir stored in the device, a controller to move the fluid into the tixels -- yes, tixels, Tactile Pixels -- and software to control the entire system. Once activated, the tixels inflate and become squishy that offer tactile keyboard-like feedback. We like this, though it's still early days, the system works surprisingly well. Application may eventually vary from gaming to accessibility with future offerings adding a complete matrix of independently addressable tixels. Take a peek at the gallery and video after the break.
