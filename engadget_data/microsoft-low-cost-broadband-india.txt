A major partnership with Google putting free Wi-Fi in 400 train stations wasn't the only major network news coming from India today. The Indian government also announced on Monday that it will pair with Microsoft to bring low-cost broadband connectivity to half a million villages throughout the subcontinent. That should help at least some of the estimated 4 million people that go without internet connectivity every year



"We believe that lost-cost [sic] broad band connectivity coupled with the scale of cloud computing intelligence that can be harnessed from data can help drive creativity, efficiency and productivity across governments and businesses of all sizes," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during a news conference. The plan will work the same way as Microsoft's previous efforts in Africa, leveraging unutilized white-space spectrum to deliver a broadband connection. Further details on the plan's implementation and rollout are expected to be announced in the coming days.
