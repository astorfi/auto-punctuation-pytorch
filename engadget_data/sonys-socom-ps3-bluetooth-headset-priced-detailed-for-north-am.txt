 We know, we know -- you already know most everything there is to know about Sony's SOCOM PS3 Bluetooth headset, but up until now, the most important tidbit has remained a mystery. The device will be launching this fall as part of the SOCOM: Confrontation bundle for $59.99, or if you just loathe the whole SOCOM series, you can pick it up all by its lonesome for $49.99. Tough call, huh?
