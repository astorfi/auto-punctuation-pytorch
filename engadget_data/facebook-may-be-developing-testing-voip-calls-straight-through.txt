Mashing on that icon didn't connect them and their buddies don't seem to have received any alerts at all, but the fact remains that the world's most popular website just did something a little bit different. The logical suspicion is that the Skype partnership that saw Facebook Connect infiltrate the web telephony service is now bearing fruit in the other direction with us seeing a bit of Skype functionality being built into the social network.
