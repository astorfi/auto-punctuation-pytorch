LG hasn't finished with new G3 variants yet, judging by a promotional video (below). It appears that a G3 Stylus will soon join the flagship Quad HD G3 and its much smaller and lesser equipped sibling, the 4.7-inch G3 Beat. There's not much to go on other than the stylus, though it looks even bigger than the 5.5-inch G3. Don't count on an Optimus Vu resurrection, though -- a previous UA profile leak detailed an LG Stylus with a qHD 960 x 540 screen, which would make it similar to the new G Vista for Verizon. If that proves accurate (and it may well not be), the new handset would be less Galaxy Note 3 and more Galaxy Note 3 Neo. Meanwhile, Samsung's latest stylus-equipped Galaxy Note 4 device is expected soon with a 2,560 x 1,440 screen -- that's "QHD" with a capital "Q."
