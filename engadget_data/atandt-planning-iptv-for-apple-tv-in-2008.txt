 Maybe this shouldn't come as that much of a surprise, but when AT&T execs talk about having a long and close relationship with Apple, they're not just planning on putting out future iPhones. A well-connected source tells us that AT&T and Apple are working on adding IPTV capabilities to the Apple TV beginning sometime next year. (A launch window hasn't yet been determined, our source says that plans are still being worked out.) We're guessing that it'll be something like AT&T's U-verse TV service, but it's still way too early to say whether this would be a blown-out offering a full package of channels aimed at replacing your current cable/satellite service, a more limited selection of on-demand programming, or whether it'd even be available to non-AT&T subscribers.
