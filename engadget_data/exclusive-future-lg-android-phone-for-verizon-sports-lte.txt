That likely makes this one of the six-odd LTE phones Verizon has publicly said are slated for the first half of next year. Secondly, it's got an HD camera of some sort -- probably indicating either 720p or 1080p capture -- and finally, it appears to have a huge, mirrored display and possibly a front-facing cam in the upper right. Looks like there's also a WiFi logo on back (of course), but can anyone make out the other two logos there? And more importantly, can anyone wait for this to launch?

Update: It's been proposed that one of the logos might be for DLNA, since LG's a major DLNA player -- most recently with its PlayTo service on the LG Optimus 7.
