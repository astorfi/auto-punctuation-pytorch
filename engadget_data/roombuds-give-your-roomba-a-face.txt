The way it scoots around the floor with
seeming intelligence, feeds on scraps, and doesn't require daily walks to do its business, the
Roomba would seem an ideal
alternative to a house pet; all it's missing is a cute, cuddly visage. Now you can give your Roomba the face you always
thought it should have with RoomBuds, wraparound outfits for the robot vacuum that come in a variety of animal prints,
including tiger and leopard. Of course, once it has a face it may only be a matter of time before the Roomba develops a
personality, starts behaving unpredictably, and begins launching into impromptu renditions of "Daisy." Maybe we'll keep
our Roomba naked and stick to a flesh-and-blood pet; at least a dog will eat your leftovers without having to get
charged up first.
