Just in case you forgot that apparently rocking that iPod on the subway can get you in trouble with those of
nefarious intent, the NYPD has apparently been handing out pamphlets with tips on iPod safety maneuvers:




TRANSIT SAFETY: DON'T BECOME A VICTIM! Keeping yourself and your belongings safe within the New York Transit
 System


  LET'S STOP iPOD THEFT


  * STAY ALERT

  * KEEP YOUR iPODâ€¦ OUT OF SIGHT

  * DON'T STAY BY TRAIN DOORS WHEN USING ELECTRONIC DEVICES

  * BE ALERT FOR PICKPOCKETS WHEN LISTENING TO MUSIC

  * CHANGE THE EARPIECE COLOR WHEN RIDING IN PUBLIC



Recap. They don't want you flashing your iPod around, listening to music loudly, or wearing the trademark iPod
headphones? Uh, are there any other reasons left for New
Yorkers to own an iPod? Seriously, if people started abiding by these rules, the L train (and to a lesser extent, F
and G) would probably shut down entirely.
