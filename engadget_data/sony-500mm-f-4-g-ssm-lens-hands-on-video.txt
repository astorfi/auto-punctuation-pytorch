  You don't see many lenses pop up 'round these parts, but Sony's new 500mm f/4 G SSM optic is impressive enough to warrant some hands-on attention. We spotted the new A-mount telephoto mounted on an Alpha A77 at Sony's booth at CP+ 2012, and queued up for a chance to take some shots. The lens focused surprisingly quickly, especially given its massive 500mm fixed focal length. Moving from subject to subject at varying distances, we were typically able to achieve focus in a fraction of a second. Long lenses have traditionally been tricky on the focus front, but this guy handled it like a champ, with speeds that appeared to rival far shorter primes. The SAL500F40G, as it's to be known, will be hand built to order beginning in March, with a yet-to-be-confirmed (likely sky-high) price tag. Click on past the break to see just how quickly we can zero in on some wild CP+ show floor action.
