In another testament to people's unabated love for stickers (or giant emoticons), LINE has launched in 11 languages and about 230 countries. New growth has apparently centered around the Middle East and Asia, with Taiwan, Japan and Thailand currently its most popular locales. The company is still looking to compete with incumbents like WhatsApp and Facebook in the US and Europe, however, with a little help from all those LINE-hosted games and apps.
