In the midst of a sit-down, the chipmaker's CEO claimed that rival Intel was playing a game of catch up to AMD's innovation, stating, "If you look at the last five years, if you look at what major innovations have occurred in computing technology, every single one of them came from AMD. Not a single innovation came from Intel." Ruiz went on to blast the Santa Clara-based company, saying that, "Intel continues... to abuse their monopoly and that's why around the world governments and regulatory agencies continue to go after them." Hey -- at least he doesn't seem to be feeling bitter about the whole thing.[Via The INQUIRER]
