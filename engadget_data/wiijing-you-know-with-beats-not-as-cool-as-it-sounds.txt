We're not going to explain to you the intricacies of the beat doctoring and mix busting this Wiij throws down, since the video (which can be viewed after the break) does a pretty job of demonstrating such qualities, but we would like to postulate a further question on the matter: is there anything the Wiimote can't do?[Via Nintendo Wii Fanboy]
