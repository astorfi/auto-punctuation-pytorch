Last month, Evernote rolled out a revamped Skitch app, giving it a fresh coat of paint to fit in with iOS 7. Today, the main Evernote app for iPhones and iPads has gotten similar aesthetic treatment, and added a couple of new features to boot. First up is the Places feature for both free and paid users, which shows you the locations of any geo-tagged notes and photos on a map, and also makes those notes searchable by location. Next, Premium Evernoters will now have the option to customize their home screen -- meaning you can change the order of your buttons or remove those you never use. Naturally, the update also brings some general performance improvements and bug fixes as well, so head on over to the source to see for yourself all the new app has to offer.
