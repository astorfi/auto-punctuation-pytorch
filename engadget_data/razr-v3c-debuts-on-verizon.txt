We knew it was due any day now what with that V3c dummy page up on their site, but today Verizon officially announced the RAZR V3c (aka the CDMA RAZR). As expected, it features EV-DO, a 1.3 megapixel camera, and Bluetooth (though no OBEX, as usual) and you can expect to shell out $199.99 after $100 rebate with two-year contract to get one of these suckers come December 12th - ahh, to give to another, or to buy for oneself? Happy holiday decision making!
