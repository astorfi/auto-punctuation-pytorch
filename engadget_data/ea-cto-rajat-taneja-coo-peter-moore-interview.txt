It's E3 time, people, and the launch of a pair of brand new consoles has the gaming world abuzz with the possibilities they bring. The success of those platforms isn't just about the black boxes, however. Gaming publishers like Electronic Arts are building many of the games people will want to play on Xbox One and PS4. So, when we got the opportunity to speak with EA's CTO Rajat Taneja and COO Peter Moore about the company's plans for next-gen, we jumped at the chance.


Rajat regaled us with tales of all the back-end work going into preparing Origin for next-gen, and chatted about the challenge of scaling up to accommodate all of the new users that will come with the new consoles. Naturally, that led to a discussion about the company's single identity framework that allows gamers to access their EA account on any gaming platform. Meanwhile, Peter talked of the importance of Origin's single login service, EA's ability to produce games that take full advantage of the new capabilities of next-gen consoles and even how the lesson's learned from the problems with Sim City will be applied to future games. You don't have to take our word for it, though -- check out the pair of videos after the break to hear for yourself first-hand.
