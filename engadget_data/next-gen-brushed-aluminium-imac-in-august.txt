 The rumor cycle continues to turn, with the iMac the latest to get the ol' speculation treatment. ThinkSecret says that the next iMac will hit in August, and will feature a new, 2-inch thick aluminium enclosure. The new model will reportedly feature a trimmed down chin -- bye bye Jay Leno iMac! -- 20- and 24-inch screens only, and Santa Rosa CPUs up to 2.4GHz. Before you start buying up metallic-styled peripherals in preparation, you might be wise to take a quick glance at our iMac rumor tag: if the eventual iMac replacement is nothing like this report, don't say you weren't warned.
