 
Here's yet another HTC handset from the WP7 launch today: the 7 Trophy. Features like the 3.8-inch WVGA LCD, 1GHz Snapdragon and the 5MP camera certainly sound familiar; even the phone's battery cover has taken a design cue from the Desire -- same peel-off method, and same matte texture. Not all that exciting, really, but the OS was running pretty smoothly except for the buggy HTC Hub and browser. For now, help yourselves with our hands-on shots below.

Update: Video added after the break.
