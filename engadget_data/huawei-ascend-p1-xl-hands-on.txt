In fact, at 9.9mm thick, the Android 4.0-powered XL is almost as thick as the original P1's thickest point, and in terms of weight the extra 930mAh of battery juice adds another 25g on top of the P1's 110g, which isn't all that noticeable when we fiddled with the new phone. Leaving the thickness and the camera shape aside, the XL is otherwise identical to its sibling device. We'll let you see the external differences in our hands-on photos below.
