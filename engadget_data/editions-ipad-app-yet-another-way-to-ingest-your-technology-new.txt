It's a snazzy new iPad news app, taking its place alongside a smattering of formidable alternatives while presenting a highly customizable view. Upon first launch, you're presented with a veritable plethora of options, enabling users to create an "Edition" consisting of local news, technology, business, politics, etc. You're even able to add and subtract actual news sources from within a category, amongst other subtle personalization tweaks. Of course, you can download our app on a handful of platforms, but if you're looking for a bit of variety (and really, why wouldn't you be?), hit the source link to give 'er a go. It's free, after all.

Update: Seems to be US-only for now, but we're told it'll hit the UK and Canada "in the coming months."

Disclaimer: This app was created by AOL, who keeps the lights on around here.
