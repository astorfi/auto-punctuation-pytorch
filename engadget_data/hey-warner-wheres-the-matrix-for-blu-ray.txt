       The red camp has been enjoying The Matrix in HD over six months now and all the Blu-ray fans got was a promise of later this year -- at this point, an empty promise at that. Warner started out in the red camp, and although they officially went dual format before the first disc was released, they've always leaned red by only releasing some of their biggest titles on HD DVD; like Batman Begins, The Matrix Collection, and V for Vendetta. According to our poll, most of you believe Warner will go Blu-ray exclusive -- which would be a big change -- but at this point we'd be happy if they'd just catch up and start offering the same movies as they do on HD DVD.
