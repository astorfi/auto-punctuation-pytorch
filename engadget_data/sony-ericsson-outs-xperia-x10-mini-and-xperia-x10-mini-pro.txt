We'd heard a few whispers of Sony Ericsson's Xperia X10 mini, but frankly, the X10 mini pro here comes as a bit of a surprise. The sets are nearly identical with the exception of launch colors -- the mini will ship in black, pearl white, lime, pink, red and silver, while the mini pro features just black and red -- a minuscule size difference, and the pro packing a QWERTY keyboard. The X10 twins run Android 1.6 (though with the time to market gap we've come to expect from SE this could change) on a 600MHz Qualcomm MSM7227 and will ship in both North American and global 3G variants with quad-band EDGE, WiFi, Bluetooth, and a pack-in 2GB microSD card. As far as OS tweaks are concerned, Sony Ericsson's Timescape is being touted as a major feature that enables all your communications with contacts to be accessed in one place making it simple to access to call history, Facebook, Twitter, messaging, and the like. Four-corner control also gets a mention and is basically user-customizable shortcut icons placed -- not surprisingly -- in each corner of the device's 2.5-inch QVGA touchscreen display. Both phones' launch dates are set for sometime in Q2 this year.
