Earlier this week, some lucky guy from Taiwan claims to have stumbled upon the same Honeycomb device, and was kind enough to share the above homescreen spy shot as well as some thoughts on his one-hour hands-on. We're told that there'll be a 7-inch version as well as a 10-inch version (the latter appears to be what Rubin had), and the one we're looking at here has a 1280 x 800 display of unknown size, NVIDIA Tegra 2 T20 dual-core chip, gyroscope, a 5 megapixel main camera, and a 2 megapixel front camera. Memory-wise it has a 32GB embedded MMC and a microSD slot. 

The poster reckons the hardware -- which is "pretty light" -- is all ready for launch, but Honeycomb still needs some final fine-tuning. Sadly, he hasn't got a date, but said device will apparently be priced like the current Motorola high-end phones, and will be available in three flavors: UMTS, CDMA, and LTE (which we heard about a little while back). Well, only time will tell whether this guy really does have a good friend at Motorola, or that he's been talking to some unicorns.

Update: And just like that, the poster's removed the offending screenshot and trimmed down his first post.
