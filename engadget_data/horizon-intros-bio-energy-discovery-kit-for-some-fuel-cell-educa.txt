 Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies certainly has plenty more ambitious fuel cell products in the works, but it looks like it's not leaving any potential opportunity to make itself known untapped, with it now introducing the education-minded Bio Energy Discovery Kit to spread the fuel cell word to students and educators alike. According to the company, the kit is actually the "fuel cell industry's first direct ethanol product," which means it's able to take plain water and any household alcohol (like diluted vodka) and, in this case, provide enough power to run a fan non-stop for days on end. That wonder of science doesn't exactly come cheap, however, with the kit running a full $100.[Via Blast]
