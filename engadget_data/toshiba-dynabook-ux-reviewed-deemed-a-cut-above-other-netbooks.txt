Portable Monkey's just gotten their hands on one and while they are fans of the design, think the over all build quality is a bit better than many netbooks, and also found the battery life to be pretty good (they got about 3.5 hours per charge), there are also a few drawbacks. The keyboard is cramped, the built-in scrolling is none too responsive, and the volume of the speakers is extremely quiet. The NB200 is set to be released in the coming months in the UK, and it's expected to run about $600 when it makes its way to the US.
