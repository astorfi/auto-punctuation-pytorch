That word comes from the mouth of epiZENter.net, and why would a self-termed Creative fansite lie about something like this? Apparently the player does WiFi sharing, but that's all we've got to go on at the moment, so let your imagination run wild. Zen to Zune to iPod wireless sharing? In a world of magic, anything is possible.  [Image courtesy of Bent Post]
