 The Man Room is reporting that The Hulk not going to be coming out on November 14 as previously announced. We have no idea why Universal Studios has bumped the release but sometimes these studios do know more then we do. This just proves that delays aren't something that only the Blu-ray camp has to deal with. We will update our release calendar accordingly and keep you up-to-date when the title gets re-announced.
