While it still says "ships: November" Apple just added the "Add to cart" button allowing you to place your order with standard 5 business day, 2nd day, or next business day shipping. $899 takes home a 1,920 x 1,200 resolution, DisplayPort, built-in iSight camera / mic, integrated stereo speakers, 3-port USB hub, and MagSafe adapter for your like-equipped MacBook. Sure, it'll look great next to all your Apple gear but you can get a similar panel (if not exactly the same) or better with more expansion for a lot less.Update: It's worth noting that while there are plenty of bright, 24-inch LCD monitors on the market, Apple's is relatively inexpensive (possibly the cheapest) for LED backlit monitors of this size. We'll have to see how it stacks up side-by-side before getting too huffy about the price. As to the lack of additional ports for game consoles, etc: huff away.[Thanks, Rob P.]
