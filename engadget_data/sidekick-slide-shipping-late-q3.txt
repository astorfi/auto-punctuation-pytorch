If you look closely, you'll see that the leaked doc is about the Sidekick Slide, AKA Motorola Q700, AKA the Sidekick 4. The photo apparently snapped yesterday by a T-Mobile Sidekick 3 (if you believe the EXIF data), shows a product finalization of August 27, 2007 with a "SK SLD" release sometime in "Late Q3." That would make the end of September the outer-most retail date. Of course, there are contradicting Q3 2008 dates above which seem to reference Sidekick L(X) and L(E) devices. In other words, we don't know. Now get your Photoshopping conspiracies ready and sound-off in the comments.[Via Tech That Out]
