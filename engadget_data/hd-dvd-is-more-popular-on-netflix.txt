Now it seems we were correct to assume that these reports were somewhat inaccurate. What we did get wrong, is that we figured Blu-ray was more popular than HD DVD. It seemed logical to us that since Blu-ray outsold HD DVD two to one, that they'd out rent them too. But in reality it's the other way around and HD DVD is over 2 times more likely to be set as a Netflix subscribers preferred format. While Netflix subscribers can rent both formats, only one can be preferred. The real question is, what does this mean? And is it a good thing? One might argue that people are more likely to buy an inexpensive HD DVD player and rent movies, rather than sit on the side lines; but we'd bet the red camp has a different take on the matter -- especially when you consider their favorite stat to brag about is attach rates.
