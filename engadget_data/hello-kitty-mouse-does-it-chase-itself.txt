Nevertheless, this adorable critter plays nice with Macs and PCs, reportedly boasts a 1,200dpi sensor, includes a scroll wheel and right / left click buttons, and touts one of the most un-ergonomic designs we've ever witnessed. Notably, we've no idea whether or not this piece is actually authentic, but hey, it sure looks the part and costs just $10.08.[Via ChipChick]
