Panasonic's LUMIX DMC-TS1 may be your salvation, and we're happy to have one in the house for a bit of testing. It's only just arrived and we're still getting a feel for it, but so far we're impressed with the build quality of this semi-rugged 12 megapixel compact shooter, which is taking some solid pictures and videos through its 4.6x stabilized zoom. Full impressions will come soon, but for now enjoy a few unboxing shots.
