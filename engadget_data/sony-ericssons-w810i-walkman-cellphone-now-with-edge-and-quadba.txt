It's pretty much theW800 only now supporting EDGE and Quadband GSM 850/900/1800/1900, USB 2.0, and dedicated music buttons in the joysticklike the W900 --exactly what you were askingfor.Â  Like the W800, you get a 512MB Memory Stick in the box, a 2 megapixel camera, 3.5-milimeter headphonejack (still via included dongle we think), Bluetooth, and 1.9-inch 176 x 220 pixel screen. Said to be shipping beforeMarch for an as of yet undisclosed price.[Thanks, Antonio and Luis]
