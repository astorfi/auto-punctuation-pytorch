 Were you hoping to get that Galaxy Note II in a cooler color than marble or titanium gray, like maybe hotrod red? Would you settle for "amber brown" or "ruby wine," to perhaps match that chaise lounge? That's good, because Samsung has decided to out the 5.5-inch phablet in those trendily specific colors on January 17th, in Korea at least -- though given the five million plus units sold so far, it's earned the right to tint the Note II however it wants. The new hues will blanket the front, back and S-Pen of the device, but we're not sure if we're fashion-forward enough to rock "ruby wine" -- especially on a loud & proud handset like that.
