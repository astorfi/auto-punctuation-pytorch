It seems reasonable enough if the price includes tax, though the pre-holiday date might be a bummer for the more impatient among the UK's iPhone hopefuls. Then again, we're thinking the odds are good that both the MSRP and drop date are merely Amazon estimates here and not anything official -- especially since there's no mention of a carrier. Needless to say, iPhone Watch continues east of the pond.[Via MacNN]
