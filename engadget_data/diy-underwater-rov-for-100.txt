Considering the average Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) can run anywhere from $8,000 into the millions, this dude's
$100 DIY underwater ROV is pretty impressive. Made in two weeks, there is one significant compromise in the absence of
thrusters — it's a towed vehicle — but whaddya want for a Benjamin? It's made largely of PVC pipe and comes equipped
with a black and white camera and secondary color camera, IR illumination for night vision, and 100 foot tether for
providing power and sending video back to the surface for monitoring and recording in real-time.
