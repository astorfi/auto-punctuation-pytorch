Looking for more evidence that Nokia's about to unleash an oversized Windows Phone? You've got it: the company's official Tmall store (an online marketplace in China) recently published a product page for the fabled Lumia 1520. There's no images to speak of, but the listing agrees with the handset's rumored 6-inch 1080p display and 20-megapixel PureView camera. The page also promises a Snapdragon 800 CPU and a 4,999 Yuan (about $819) price tag. That said, the page seems to just be a placeholder for now, but the phone is expected to be officially announced at Nokia World later this week. Hopefully, it'll be worth the wait.
