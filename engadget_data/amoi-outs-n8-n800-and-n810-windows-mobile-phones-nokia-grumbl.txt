The recently-announced N8, N800, and N810 Windows Mobile 6 Professional devices (pictured from left to right) won't likely find their way out of Asia -- which is just as well, considering the lack of 3G and the fact that Nokia might not be too pleased with the naming convention -- but all three are lookers, if we do say so ourselves. The N8 is the only keyboard-sporting handset of the three, while the N800 sets itself apart with a VGA display. GPS, Bluetooth, and 2 megapixel cameras grace the whole lot. It looks like all three are expected to ship this month, but triband GSM / EDGE is a tough pill to swallow, though, ain't it?[Via Pocket PC Thoughts]Read - Amoi N8Read - Amoi N800Read - Amoi N810
