Now we have some encouraging news for its planned November release date: the QWERTY remote has hit the FCC. Called simply the "Remote controller" (model numbers DSM-221, DSM-22), it looks to have passed with flying colors, the FCC celebrating by ripping it to bits and photographing every piece of exposed silicon. Want to see the cruel results? We have a taste after the break, but for the rest of the grisly photos you'll have to hit that source link.
