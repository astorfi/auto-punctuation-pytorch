Apparently the developer of the channel is actually on Roku's payroll now which ZatzNotFunny points out could further complicate the situation. According to forum posts, Roku is in negotiations over access and expects to have more news next week, we'll wait and see if this is more Popcorn Hour round 1 or round 2.
