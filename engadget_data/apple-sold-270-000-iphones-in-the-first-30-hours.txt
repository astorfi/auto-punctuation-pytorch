 According to Apple's Q3 financial results call, Apple sold 270,000 iPhones during the first 30 hours of sales -- the quarter ended on June 30th. Apple admitted to and apologized for activation problems, which would account for that 146,000 activations figure that AT&T released yesterday. As for sales past June 30th, Apple isn't saying much, but they do plan to be able to announce at least one million in sales by September 30th, and 10 million by the end of 2008. Apple reiterated launch plans for the iPhone in Europe, stating that it'll have the phone in a few "major" countries (Most likely UK, France and Germany) by Q4 2007, and hit the rest of Europe with the phone in 2008. Apple did mention "we'll have details later in the quarter about which carriers we'll be working with" as in, plural, so take that for what you will. During the call, Apple also admitted to an impending cashflow from AT&T, which had been speculated, and is most likely based on contract renewals and new subscribers that the iPhone nabs for AT&T. Apple will start counting the revenue in the September quarter, but didn't say anything else on the subject while dodging questions about Yahoo!, YouTube and Google contracts.[Thanks, Wildthing]
