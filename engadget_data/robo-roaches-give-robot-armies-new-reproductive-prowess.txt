So we're really not too surprised to see them both joining forces tocreate a super being: the Robot Zombie Cockroach. A research team at Tokyo University is making these bio-bots bylopping off the antennae of regular roaches and replacing them with pulse-emitting electrodes. The researchers thensend signals with a remote control to a backpack worn by the roach that powers the electrodes. The roaches can be toldto go left, right, forward and back, and the team sees all sorts of "betterment of humanity" applicationssuch as outfitting the bugs with mini-cameras to take on the good old search and rescue, or for a bit of espionage. Wejust hope they keep these guys away from the vats of radiation in the other room, or we're going to have somesuper-ninja-robo-roaches to deal with before long.
