We'll let you decide, but this image of what Treocentral forums user Merlyn 3D is claiming tobe the Treo 700p (that'd be the supposedly forthcomingPalmOS-based version of the Treo 700 series) was apparently snapped some time earlier today. Based on the other shotMerlyn posted, this device (if it is, in fact, real) runs PalmOS Garnet 5.4.9, which means if this thing has EV-DOsupport (which it damn well better) PalmSource must have done some serious work under the hood.[Thanks,Lawrence]
