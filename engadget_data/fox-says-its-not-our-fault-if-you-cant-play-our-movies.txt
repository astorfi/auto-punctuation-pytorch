Fox told Video Business that they're not sure if it's BDJ or BD+ that's causing the issues, but either way it's not their fault. They suggest that if anyone's having problems playing the disc, that they should "lobby their hardware manufacturers to release firmware upgrades post haste." This is pretty much what we'd expect them to say, and in the end it's the consumer that's getting the short end of the stick. LG has stated that they'll have an update for the BH100 within a few days, while Samsung BD-P1200 fans will have to wait a few weeks.[Via HighDefDigest]
