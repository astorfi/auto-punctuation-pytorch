These huge 19-inchbehemoths (1680 x 1050 WSXGA display) sport dual GeForce Go 7800GTX 256MB graphics cards running in tandem for seriousframe rate action even with game performance features turned all the way up. Both machines are powered by AMD's 64-bitmobile Turion processor running Windows MCE, sport WiFi, Bluetooth, dual-layer DVD burners, and a 1.3-megapixel webcam,and feature five USB 2.0 ports, FireWire, DVI, serial, PC card slot (ExpressCard or not is unclear), SPDIF out andTV-out. UK fraggers can get their hands on either of these graphics powerhouses next month starting aroundÂ£2200.Read- Rock Xtreme XLRead- Evesham Quest A630
