Harman Kardon is planning a fall release for a new car iPod adapter that'll add a back-lit display and separate
controller for more convenient operation of the ol' white player while driving. Both will be mountable anywhere in the
vehicle, and are united in audio goodness by the small "brain" that's the central hub for all the physical cable
connections as well as a charger for the iPod. Connection to the car's audio system can be of the direct line-in
variety if you opt to have the unit professionally installed for an extra $70 fee; otherwise you can set up the $199
adapter kit yourself and use the built-in FM radio transmitter to pump the audio signal to your can stereo. More pics
after the break.
