The listing -- which carries a heavy $750 price tag -- outfits Sammy's new slate with a familiar 1.4GHz quad-core Exynos processor, 16 GB of internal storage, and a requisite 10.1-inch 1,280 x 800 resolution touchscreen. Negri also states the slab will rock a quadband 21Mbps HSPA 1900/1800/900/850 radio, which would come as a nice surprise if true. Saltier still, is the firm's proposed ship date -- August 3rd, which is tomorrow.
