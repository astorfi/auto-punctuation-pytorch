	You know those pictures of smiling people and happy families that come with frames when you buy them from department stores? We'd like to submit this image from USA Network's White Collar to RIM as a possible preloaded wallpaper, should it ever want to go in a dramatically different direction with its marketing for the PlayBook. Standard business customers are only so exciting. But white collar criminals and the people tasked with stopping them -- now that's where the action is. Side note to the gentleman on screen: you're holding it wrong.
