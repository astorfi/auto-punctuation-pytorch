While that invite up there hints rather coyly at a new handset, a little digging confirmed this is, indeed, the LTE-packing Motorola Spyder, whose first-of-its-kind 4.3-inch, 960 x 540 qHD Super AMOLED display surfaced in leak shots last month. How do we know? Well, when we opened the invite in our browser and saved the image to our desktop, we noticed Moto's own PR team had labeled the photo "spyderlaunchinvite." So that's what we're betting on seeing that day, though it's less clear if it'll bear the name Spyder or Droid RAZR, as rumored (that familiar red light in the photo suggests it might well be part of the Droid family). And who knows what else the two companies have in store? The Atrix 2, perhaps? The Xoom 2? The Xoom 2 Media Edition? The Xoom Family Edition?! We'll find out at the event next week, where we'll be liveblogging, giving you the blow-by-blow. Until then, peep the video after the break if you're down for parsing a 35-second teaser.
