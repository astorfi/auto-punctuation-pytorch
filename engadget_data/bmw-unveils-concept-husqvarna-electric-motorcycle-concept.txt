It's a slinky thing, with a single front fork and a spindly rear swingarm, two features that don't make it look particularly trail-ready -- despite the Husqvarna branding. (BMW bought Husqvarna back in 2007.) But, it does look a little more off-roadable than the electric scooter concept BMW also unveiled. No further details about range, speed, or indeed likelihood of production are available for either, but there are more pics of both in the gallery below.

Update: We got some further details on the bike. It weighs just 80kg (about 150lbs) and riding it through traffic is said to be like playing a videogame. The press release after the break doesn't say which videogame, but we're hoping it isn't Frogger.
