Slim Devices is at it again with their
Squeezebox digital audio players. Their third
generation product it merely a cosmetic update to the already sexy
Squeezebox2, but the truth is you couldn't really ask for
much more out of an audio gateway. The Squeezebox has near comprehensive format support, a 320 x 32 pixel screen,
802.11g, digital audio outs, and a solid software back-end, so there isn't much left to add. The new look is merely a
reminder that yes, this player does rockâ€”though you'd think by now it could rock for a bit less than the current $249,
that's the same price as last time around.
