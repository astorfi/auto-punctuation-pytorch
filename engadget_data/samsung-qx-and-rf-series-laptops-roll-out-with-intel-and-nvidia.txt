 
We told you it's a busy time for laptops! Following up on its recently announced SF and NF series, Samsung's unleashing two more families of lappies and we're here to tell you all about 'em. First up is the QX series, which finally brings NVIDIA's Optimus to the manufacturer's rigs. We're assuming overseas the QX will come in a variety of sizes, but here in the US the 14-inch QX410 (pictured above) will be a Best Buy exclusive and will pack a Core i5-460M CPU and a NVIDIA GeForce 310M GPU. Externally, we have to say it's one of the nicest systems we've seen lately -- the brushed metal lid adds some polish and the chiclet keys remind us a lot of those on the VAIO Z. The QX410 should be priced around $849 when it hits the double B this fall. 

Packing a bit more muscle are the 15.6-inch RF510 and 17.3-inch RF710, which have both Core i5 and i7 options. The RF510 boasts a NVIDIA GeForce 330M GPU and Core i5-460M processor and is slated to hit for around $899, while the RF710 with an i7-720M CPU, the same graphics, 640GB of storage and a Blu-ray drive will be priced at $1,029. Those sound mighty tempting to us. Hit the break for the full release and the galleries below for some shots.
