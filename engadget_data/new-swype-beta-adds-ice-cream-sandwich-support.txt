   It may be here a bit later than the 140-character box promised, but this fresh beta version of your favorite third-party keyboard app brings along a treat you'd been begging for. Swype's latest gift to the early-adopting crowd brings along some much requested Ice Cream Sandwich support. And, although all you Gnex-rockin' folks are getting what you wanted, the beta also adds other bits like accuracy improvements, add-ons with DragonGo! as well as downloadable languages for slates. We figured all that tapping's got you fatigued, so we're hooking you up with a clickable link to the download below.
