On sale in 13 countries, Microsoft's Xbox One is already pulling in the sales. Now that A+ titles like Titanfall and Twitch game streaming are finally with us, the company is ready to take the next-generation console to new markets: 26 of them in fact. Gamers on all continents will be served, but you'll have to wait until September to get your hands on Redmond's new black box. In the meantime, check out if you reside in one of the confirmed markets in the list after the break, and then wait a few short weeks until Microsoft shares more information on its local launches.
