Not built for the mere mortal, Canon's EOS 1D Mark III should ring in a hefty chunk of change, but for us it was the live LCD and 10fps shooting that brought it all home. Unfortunate that they were showing it under fairly poorly lit conditions, but we've got plenty of shots of it -- and its glass-encased internals -- in our hands-on gallery.Update: We couldn't resist, so we went back and shot some more of this beast -- those photos are in the gallery. Some kind Engadget reader wanna buy us one?
