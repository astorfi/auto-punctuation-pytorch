Spying on those pesky kids or that errant spouse back home just got a little easier for
customers of UK cellphone service provider Three Telecom. The company has rolled out the Pupillo, a Â£150 ($261)
battery-powered spycam that can be accessed by 3G cellphone. It even has night vision for those stealth spy sessions.
Of course, the fact that it looks like a miniature garbage can with a lens doesn't exactly make it discreet; maybe the
next version can look like, er, R2-D2 or something.
