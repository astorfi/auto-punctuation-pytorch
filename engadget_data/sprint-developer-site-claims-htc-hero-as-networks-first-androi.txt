Planted over in the Android section of Sprint's own Developer site, we're greeted with this statement: "Announcing the HTC Hero, which will be the first Android device running on the Sprint network."

Of course, this isn't as good as a carefully worded press release from the bowels of Overland Park, but it's certainly enough to whet our appetites. C'mon Sprint -- out with the price and release date, pronto![Via Phandroid]
