They're generally void of any telling detail aside from the device's model number, and they rarely give any insight into what we can expect from the upcoming product. The Sony Ericsson LT28at, a handset we haven't seen or heard from before, decided to be a little different and use the opportunity to get a little pre-CES scoop. The LT28a -- not to be confused with the LT26i (Nozomi), a rumored handset with a 4.3-inch HD screen and 12MP camera -- claims to offer LTE, a 720p HD Reality display, 13MP rear camera with an LED flash and a front-facing cam capable of taking 720p HD video, and is said to take the Xperia lineup into "superphone territory." Sounds nice, but we have a feeling the land will be populated by hostile forces of all kinds at CES, so we hope they're prepared.
