In addition to group video calling, the application sports a whole new interface that Skype says has been "slimmed down" (compared to the previous beta versions, at least) and allows you to see 30 percent more contacts at once. As with the Windows version, however, that group video calling feature has now been relegated to the premium package which, after a free seven-day trial, will run you $4.99 for a day pass or $8.99 a month for a subscription (though you can get 33 percent off if you sign up before February 28th). Head on past the break for quick video overview.
