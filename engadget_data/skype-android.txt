Skype's starting off July with the release of a brand new version of its Android app. The overhauled 4.0 update borrows a good deal from the Microsoft-owned VoIP company's Windows 8 app, bringing conversations to the top. Log in, and you'll see recent chats -- from there, you can give one a tap to replay. You can also start a fresh one with a swipe and a tap on a contact name. Skype's promising a faster and more reliable app this time out, released as the Android version passes 100 million installs. Check out a celebratory video after the break.
