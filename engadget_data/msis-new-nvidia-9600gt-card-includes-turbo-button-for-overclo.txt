The button bumps the clock speed of the graphics core and the memory, as well as increasing voltage to world-destroying levels. Unfortunately you'll have to reach around the back of your dusty machine to click it, but we're sure 30 minutes and a soldering iron can re-route the button to this little doomsday-inspired puppy.
