That word comes from Intel Graphics and Gaming Technologist Ron Fosner, who was showing off a graphics demo running on a multi-core Nehelam system that, as you can see in the video at the link below, likely won't have NVIDIA or AMD rethinking their strategy just yet. Fosner also curiously looked to the past to back up his argument, saying that "if you look back into the mid 80's, there were no discreet graphics cards." Of course, all of this is all the more puzzling given that Intel is itself dabbling in discrete graphics with its Larrabee project, albeit under the guise of a CPU / GPU hybrid.
