Motorola promised that it was making a cheaper variant of the Moto X for developing markets, and we may have received our first glimpse of it today. A Sina Weibo user claims to have a photo of interchangeable back panels for the budget smartphone, suggesting that its buyers wouldn't have to use tools like Moto Maker to get lively colors. There's nothing shown of the device itself, but the poster does mention dual SIM support. If the parts are real, though, it could just be a matter of time before leaks reveal the rest of Motorola's lower-cost handset.
