Apparently this one is coming at us from Shanghai, and while we're not sure what anyone is saying on the forum to which these pictures are posted, we're guessing a chorus of "sucks to be you!" and "recalled for a reason" is a solid guess. Check after the break for a couple more pictures, including the stark beauty of the aftermath.[Thanks, Steve Du]
