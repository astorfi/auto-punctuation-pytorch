 
At long last, an official release date for Texas Instruments' DLP Pico projector. Mark it down, December 1st is the launch (delivered by December 19th) of the "world's smallest / lightest" (51 × 105 × 17-mm / 120g) projector under the Optoma PK-101 branding. And in a smart, hip-by-association marketing move, it'll be sold from the Apple Store in Japan with an iPhone / iPod kit and dock connector for a tax-inclusive price of about ¥50,000 ($511). It'll work with non-Apple gear too, of course. With up to 2-hours battery life, an integrated 0.5 watt speaker, and white LED light throwing a 60-inch, "dazzlingly bright, sharp, vivid video image" packing 480 x 320 pixels from up to 8.5 feet away, Tokyo's Golden Gai district will never be the same.P.S. Encore video hands-on of the unit in action posted after the break.
