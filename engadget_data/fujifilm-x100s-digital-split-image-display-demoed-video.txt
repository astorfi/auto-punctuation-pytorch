Earlier this week, the company announced this new way of manual focusing on the X100s, in which the user overlays two images to attain proper focus. This feature seems to hit a high note for range finder camera users as it brings a certain familiarity for focusing work flow. Note that the display in the video is the rear LCD of the camera and not the prized hybrid viewfinder. Overall the movement looks smooth and usable, but we'll confirm when we get our hands on the new X100s. Check out the video after the break.
