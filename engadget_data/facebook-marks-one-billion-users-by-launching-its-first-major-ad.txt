Mark Zuckerberg has today introduced the company's first proper ad, a one minute and thirty second video dubbed "The Things That Connect Us" that was produced by ad agency Wieden & Kennedy and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. According to Zuckerberg, the ad was made to "honor the people we serve" and "express what our place is on this earth," adding that Facebook belongs to a "rich tradition of people making things that bring us together."
