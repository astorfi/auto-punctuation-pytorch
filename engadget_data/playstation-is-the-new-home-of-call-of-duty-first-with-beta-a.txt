At tonight's pre-E3 press conference, Sony made yet another big splash by announcing itself "the new home of Call of Duty." The next entry of the franchise, Call of Duty Black Ops III, will have a beta exclusively for the PlayStation 4 in August, and map packs will arrive first on PlayStation. It sounds like the agreement will last longer than just the one game, with Andrew House saying the PlayStation-first DLC is "starting" here. There's a lengthy new trailer for the game too, which you can see after the break.
