If you got hooked on Flappy Bird just in time for the game to be pulled, you're in luck. Creator Dong Nguyen told CNBC today that he'll put the title back in the App Store in August. When it does return though, it's said to be less addictive thanks to a new multiplayer mode. And there are entirely new games modes too, including one that features a man hopping from building to building. No word on how Nguyen plans to keep folks from getting hooked on those just yet.
