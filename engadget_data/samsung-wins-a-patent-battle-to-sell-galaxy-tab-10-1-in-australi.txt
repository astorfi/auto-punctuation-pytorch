 The latest development in the patent skirmish between Samsung and Apple is a decision in Australia's Federal Court to overturn a ban on Galaxy Tab 10.1 sales that was placed in October. The Sydney Morning Herald reports local retailers are still unsure when they may be able to sell Samsung's slate, as Justice Lindsay Foster ruled the ban will remain until 4PM Friday, giving Apple time to appeal the case to the High Court first. Like its battle over the redesigned slate just introduced in Germany, this war between the electronics giants will continue on -- we'll let you know when there's another decision of consequence.Update: You can read the decision yourself, linked below under more coverage.
