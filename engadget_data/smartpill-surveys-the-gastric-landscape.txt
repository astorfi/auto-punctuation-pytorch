The pill, expected to be available later this year, can transmit gastric data toa wireless receiver, avoiding the need for gastric emptying Scintigraphy, a procedure that exposes the patient toradiation. While this and other smart pillsmay make us a little queasy, we still prefer them to the alternative, and we eagerly await SmartPill's plannedimprovements to the pH.p capsule, which the company says will make it a viable alternative to that other quaint toolused to check gastric problems: an endoscopy.[Via Strange New Products]
