 It's been about two years since Cablevision introduced its Optimum for iPad app that brought its live TV channels streaming to the tablet, and now it's finally ready to offer the feature even when users are away from their home WiFi network. That ability is coming in an update rolling out tonight, however currently it only applies to the News 12, News 12 Traffic & Weather & MSG Varsity channels. All of those are at least partially owned by Cablevision, which should help it avoid the sort of legal challenges suffered by its initial rollout. Other tweaks in version 3.1 include improved guide info for shows, the ability to delete multiple recordings and an indicator when scheduling an in-progress recording. Of course, most subscribers will want to stream other, more popular channels to their mobile devices and PCs no matter where they are -- we'll see if they start popping up soon, and how quickly the lawsuits fly afterwards.
