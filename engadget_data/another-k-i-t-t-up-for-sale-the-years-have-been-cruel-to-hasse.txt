The upside of this blow to vigilante law enforcement was that car nuts could finally get their hands on an original Knight Industries Two Thousand (only ten were ever made), with a version hitting the auction block in 2004, and now one of the four original K.I.T.T.s up for sale by a California business. Kassabian Motors is offering the 1982 Pontiac Trans Am V-8 for a cool $150,000, which gets you a restored interior, those retro light up controls, and of course the snazzy red nose scanner, but unfortunately, no oil slick or Super Pursuit Mode. Finally, as a special bonus to overseas bidders, Kassabian will also reportedly retrofit the car with a CD changer sporting all of David Hasselhoff's many hits at no additional charge: "Michael, we seem to have a problem; these songs totally suck."[Via Boing Boing]
