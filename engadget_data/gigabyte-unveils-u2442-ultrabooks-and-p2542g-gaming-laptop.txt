  You didn't think a company like Gigabyte would roll into CeBIT empty-handed, did you? The Taiwanese company knows how to rock a trade show properly and came packin' a whole bevy of goodies. Getting top billing are the brand new U2442 ultrabooks and the P2542G gaming laptop. The slim and light model comes in two versions. The U2442N comes rocking an Ivy Bridge class Core i5 or i7 in a shell that's 18.5mm thick at its narrowest point and starts at 1.49Kg (3.3lbs). The U2442V trades in the standard voltage CPUs for ULV ones, while keeping the same 14-inch 1600 x 900 display. They both also offer a GeForce GT 640M GPU with 2GB of memory, up to a 750GB hard drive as well as USB 3.0, Bluetooth 4.0 and Thunderbolt connections.The 15.6-inch P2542G sacrifices portability, but comes packing high-end components like an Ivy Bridge Core i7, a 2GB GTX 660, a Blu-ray drive, a THX certified, dual-woofer sound system, a 1920 x 1080 display, oh, and an HDMI out jack in addition to the usual assortment of USB ports.
