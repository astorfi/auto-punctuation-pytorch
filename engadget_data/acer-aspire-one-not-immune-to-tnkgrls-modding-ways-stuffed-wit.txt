Gone are the square miles of emptiness surrounding the screens and keyboards as manufacturers start to put every inch to good use, but that seems to have little impact on folks bent on hacking these mini laptops to pieces -- with the Acer Aspire One the latest subject of such work.

No real show stoppers, but if you've been waiting for reports from the other side before you put your own Aspire One under knife, here they are.
