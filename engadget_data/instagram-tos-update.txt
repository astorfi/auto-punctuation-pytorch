 Facebook and Instagram will be able to get a bit cozier under that new shared roof beginning early next year. On January 16th, the photo sharing site's new Terms of Service will go into effect, enabling the network to share information, content and usage stats with "businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of the same group." In a blog post, Instagram reps outlined the benefits of the revision, explaining that the site will be able to "fight spam more effectively, detect system and reliability problems more quickly, and build better features for everyone by understanding how Instagram is used."

 Additionally, in the full ToS, the second item under Rights states "you agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you." In short, Instagram has the right to share content that's already public with advertisers in order to generate revenue. If you're an Instagram user and you care about your rights while using the service, you'll be best served by making your way over to our source links below.
