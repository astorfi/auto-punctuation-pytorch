Remember the robot that gassed Junichiro Koizumi-san,
the Japanese PM? Well, now the company that made it, TMSUK, wants to give you a hand shopping with their new prototype
RFID-enabled shopping assistant robot. Basically it's just a machine that follows you around and pitches in by carrying
your heavy bags around as you cruise the Fukuoka airport mall in Japan. How long until we can get a mod so that if
you're a dude, it'll help you remember that plaid AND stripes = 0, stripes AND dots = 1?
