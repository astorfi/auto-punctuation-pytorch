 This should come as no surprise, but following Sprint and Verizon's previous commitment to an LTE-Advanced future, one who breathes could justifiably assume that AT&T might have something to say on the matter. Well, that time has come. Speaking at the LTE North America conference in Dallas, the CEO of AT&T Labs, Krish Prabhu, has confirmed that Ma Bell intends to begin the deployment of its LTE-Advanced network in 2013. Sadly, he didn't elaborate any further, (which leaves a pretty wide target, if you ask us). Still, with the potential for improved capacity, coverage and stupid fast speeds, we're not exactly complaining. As for that target year of 2013, bring it on.
