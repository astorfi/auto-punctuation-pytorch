Hardware specs include a weight of 370 grams -- less than the iPad 2's 601 grams, but more than say, a Kyocera Echo at 193g -- 512Mb of RAM, 4GB of storage and a 2GB SD card, with connectivity over 4G or WiFi. Both the Tablet P and the Tablet S will share NVIDIA Tegra 2 processors and 0.3MP (not 3.0MP as we'd previously reported) front cameras, but the more conventional, WiFi-only Tablet S weighs in at 600g, has 1GB of RAM and will be available in 16GB or 32GB versions. There's still no word on price or exact shipping dates but retailers have reportedly been told to expect more information soon, so stay tuned for further updates.

Update: This post previously stated the tablets would launch next year, that was a mistype. We're still expecting to see them launch in September.
