The BWU-100A is a 2x BD-R/RE burner that also reads and writes to DVDs and CDs. It will be available in August for the (comparatively) low price of $750. The drive will come bundled with Cyberlink BD Solution to help author and burn your discs, however there is not any software for Blu-ray movie playback included so you'll need to find your own.
