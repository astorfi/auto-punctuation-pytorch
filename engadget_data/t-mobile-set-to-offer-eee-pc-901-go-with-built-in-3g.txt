 T-Mobile has already offered up a standard issue Eee PC as part of a mobile broadband package, and it looks like it's now set to take things one big step further by introducing a special Eee PC 901 GO model with built-in 3G. As you may recall, a disassembled Eee PC 901 recently revealed some pretty clear accommodations for a 3G card, so this latest development is hardly a huge surprise, though it is certainly a welcome one. Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot of details just yet, but T-Mobile says the "jointly developed" ASUS Connection Manager will get you up and running within seconds, and you can apparently expect about to get about five hours of mobile broadband use out of the battery before it runs dry. Given that T-Mobile chose to make the announcement at IFA, however, we'd assume they'll have a bit more to say about it before all is said and done, and we'll be sure to let you know if they do.[Via jkkmobile]
