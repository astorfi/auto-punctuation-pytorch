Aside from that, it's also proposing a generic top-level domain -- .car -- that would presumably dumb down websites for use in the vehicle. Of course, you won't find us cheering on a movement to generate yet another worthless TLD, but we'd certainly be down with text-to-speech software that read the latest gadget headlines (just an example, is all) aloud as you cruised the freeway.
