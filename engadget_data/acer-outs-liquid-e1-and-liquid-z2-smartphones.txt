 Introducing the first two handsets of Acer's 2013 line-up: the Liquid E1 and the Liquid Z2. The company formally announced the Liquid E1 last month, but with Mobile World Congress around the corner, the mid-range phone just got official for the European market. The E1 packs a dual-core 1GHz processor and runs Jelly Bean on a 4.5-inch qHD display -- and, notably, it will be available in both dual- and single-SIM configurations. Acer is marketing the E1 as a multimedia-friendly handset, and accordingly it includes two speakers with DTS Sound, plus "Float" software that prevents notifications from popping up when you're watching videos.

 The Liquid Z2, on the other hand, is an entry-level handset with a dual-core 1GHz CPU and a 3.5-inch HVGA screen. It runs Jelly Bean with an optional interface that mimics a feature phone's home screen. Like the E1, it's available with one or two SIM cards, and you have your choice of a 3-megapixel or 5-MP camera. 
 Pricing isn't set in stone, but Acer told us the Liquid E1 will be in the €199 to €229 range, while the Z2 should cost between €99 and €129. Both phones will first go on sale in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Ukraine, with availability in Italy, Russia and the UK coming later. We'll deliver the hands-on goods in Barcelona, but for now you can peruse the press info after the break.



  Show full PR text   Acer Hits Smartphone Market with Launch of Liquid E1 and Z2  BARCELONA, (Feb. 20, 2013) ---Acer will be showcasing the first two smartphones of its 2013 line-up targeted at feature phone upgraders, first-time and multimedia users at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Featuring a new industrial design in pearl white and carbon black and dual SIM cards(1) the Acer Liquid E1 and Z2 complements the company's mobile footprint and reinforces Acer's commitment to the smartphone market.
  Acer Liquid E1: Cinema Experience with Dual Speakers  Targeted at multimedia users the Liquid E1 features a large 4.5-inch qHD display(2), powerful dual-core processor, optional dual SIM cards(1) and two speakers to smoothly handle multimedia and communication at the same time. The unique Float Caller notification ensures that users will not be interrupted by incoming calls or messages by taking over the full screen while using apps or watching videos. Instead, a Float Caller notification window pops up and lets users take calls or reply with quick messages.
  Liquid E1 also features an impressive dual-speaker system and DTS Sound™ for enhanced audio with volume maximization, so users can freely enjoy music stored locally or streamed from their PC through AcerCloud. The integrated Moodagent creates music playlists based on an individual's mood or uses songs from the library to create playlists that not only matches a person's mood, but also a specific taste in music. The zero shutter delay camera captures images momentarily and snaps fast-action sequences with 4-, 8- and 16-burst shooting.
  Liquid Z2: Your gateway to the world of Smartphones  The Liquid Z2 features a quick mode navigation tool and a fast 1 GHz processor offering first-time users and feature phone upgraders a fluid first time experience. The Android OS learns users' habits and has a very intuitive interface with large icons. It's easy to operate and makes Internet browsing, photography, and listening to music a breeze, especially with the support of AcerCloud. The versatile 3MP or 5MP camera launches in just 1 second, offers panoramic and multi-angle modes, plus continuous shooting (up to 99 shots) to capture precious moments. SRS Sound™ immerses users in excellent mobile audio with greater clarity and deeper bass. The enhanced sound is echoed by rhythmic design features including rippling lines along the smartphone's edges. The optional dual SIM cards(1) gives users all the convenience of having two mobiles in one and a great way of saving money by combining two different rate plans or services.
  Easy to Share Files and Media  Acer smartphones also support AcerCloud, a file sharing and media management solution that lets users easily retrieve, enjoy and share their multimedia and data files using a variety of computing devices. AcerCloud simplifies management of digital assets across mobile devices, regardless of platform, and is free on new Acer products.
  Price and Availability  The Liquid E1 and Z2 will be available to buy in France, Belgium, Netherlands and Ukraine followed by Russia, UK and Italy across selective, retail-, telco-, and online channels. Additional information is available at www.acer.com.
