What hope the carrier had left of keeping the Samsung Galaxy Stellar under wraps has just been been dashed by a full product page at Best Buy. Like we suspected, that astronomical name is attached to the conspicuously grounded Jasper: as long as the listing is accurate, we're looking at a 1.2GHz dual-core processor (toned down from the 1.5GHz rumor), a 4-inch, 800 x 480 display, a so-so 3.2-megapixel back camera and a 1.3-megapixel shooter at the front. We aren't seeing the leaked mentions of Amazon apps or a Starter mode, but there is hope that the Galaxy Stellar might undercut the still fairly stiff $100 price from the earlier Verizon-sourced scoop -- while it's not guaranteed to remain, the $450 contract-free price at Best Buy is about $50 less than we saw before. All that Verizon needs to do now is dispense with formalities and commit to a launch; meanwhile, you can catch a snap of the listing after the break and click the source to see the page for yourself, while it lasts.
