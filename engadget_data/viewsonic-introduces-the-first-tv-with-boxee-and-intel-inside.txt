It didn't appear to integrate live TV or other inputs into the Boxee software, instead of opting to run the software as its own app, offering a similar experience to the existing Boxee Box, minus the box of course. This TV should drop in "early Q2," press release details are after the break.

(South Hall 30873), a leading global provider of computing, consumer electronics and communications solutions, today unveiled its first connected TV featuring Boxee, software that brings intelligent capabilities to the smart TV experience. The new TV is powered by the Intel® Atom™ processor CE4100, a system-on-chip designed for CE devices such as Blu-ray players, set top boxes and digital TVs.An award sweeper at last year's CES, Boxee provides access to a wide array of shows, movies, video, music, and photos from the Internet and their home network allowing you the freedom to watch whatever you want, whenever you want as well as providing social networking features enabling users to exchange recommendations with friends on Facebook, Twitter, and Google Buzz. For the first time, Boxee is available integrated onto a smart TV enabled device from ViewSonic. Through this partnership, consumers will have access to preferred content via a personalized account. Whether viewing TV, movies, Internet video favorite apps, or personal content from your PC, Boxee's software enables users to access content by category, title, or source rather than by channel -- including entertainment media from Netflix, Vudu, CBS, Pandora and more -- simply type the name of what you want to watch and hit play."The CE4100 delivers processor performance for the smart TV experience, which offers rich content and application choices through integrated broadcast and Internet viewing and interaction," said Wilfred Martis, general manager, retail segment, Intel Digital Home Group. "With the ViewSonic solution, consumers can easily access and enjoy Boxee's ever-expanding content library on TV.""Consumers are watching more videos online, and are looking for technologies that enable them to watch content on their big-screen TVs instead of their PCs," said Jeff Volpe, vice president and general manager for ViewSonic Americas. "We are leveraging our front-of-screen display expertise to provide consumers with the first and only TV to integrate the Intel Atom processor CE4100 with Boxee's award-winning media search and streaming software."
