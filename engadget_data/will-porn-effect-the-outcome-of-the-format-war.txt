       It is well accepted that whatever technology the porn industry adopts becomes widely accepted, and there is little doubt that it helped VHS and the Internet. However is the next generation pre-packaged media really that new? Certainly not as much of a breakthrough as the Internet or pre-packaged media like VHS. When VHS first hit the street it was the first time someone could enjoy movies in the comfort of their own home whenever they wanted. With the Internet people could download what they wanted when they wanted and they didn't even have to go to the store and risk being spotted to buy it. When DVD came out it added special features and instant access to scenes, but other than the great picture quality, what do the next gen formats offer in regards to porn? Sure PIP might be nice, as well as better sound, but no doubt it isn't as big of an increase so will the porn industry have the same impact. This pretty much sums up why you don't see much next gen porn news on Engadget HD, we simply don't think that one studio announcing titles on one format or another is big news, although it might be if it were the biggest name in porn, but Vivid still says they will produce on both formats and the BDA has even issued a statement saying they don't have a problem with porn.Read: Blu-ray: We Like Porn, TooRead: HD DVD or Blu-ray?
