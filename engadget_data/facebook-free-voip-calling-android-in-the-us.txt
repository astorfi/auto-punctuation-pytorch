 Not content to own your phone's home screen, Facebook is bringing free VoIP calling to users of its Home and Android Messenger apps in the US. The social network's VoIP for iOS has been available in the US for a few months now, and Android users are already enjoying the service in 23 other countries, including Canada. Stateside, the VoIP for Android will roll out over the course of the day, and it shouldn't require a manual update; users will know they have the new VoIP feature if they can click the "i" icon on a friend's profile and then select "free call." From Chat Heads, starting a call requires tapping the "more info" dots next to a friend's name to jump into the Messenger app.
