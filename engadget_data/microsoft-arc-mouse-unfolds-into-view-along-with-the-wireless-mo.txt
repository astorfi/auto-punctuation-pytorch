The two-part wireless Arc Mouse isn't just pure fashion -- the folding design allows it to flip closed for easy storage and portability, and unfolds to full size when in use. Sadly, it doesn't get the hot new BlueTrack tech, but uses a traditional optical sensor instead -- but the 2.4GHz connection provides a 30-foot range. The Wireless Mobile Mouse 3000 is your basic travel optical mouse, but it'll get six months out of one AA battery. Both of these should be out this month -- the Arc Mouse will come in black and red for $60, while the Mobile Mouse 3000 will come in black and white for $30 -- there'll be some colorful special editions in Target as well. Check the Mobile Mouse 3000 after the break.
