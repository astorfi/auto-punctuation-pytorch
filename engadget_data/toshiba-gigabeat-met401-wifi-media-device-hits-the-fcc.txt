Dubbed the MET401, the device looks to boast built-in WiFi capabilities and, as you can see above, appears to run on Windows Embedded. Unfortunately, those are about the only details we know at the moment, but those curious to see the complete FCC test report can get their fix at the link below.[Thanks, cf18]
