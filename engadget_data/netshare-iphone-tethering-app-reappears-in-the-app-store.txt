It won't show up in searches, but you can still get it if you know the link -- that's a bit odd. Nullriver told Macrumors that it doesn't believe the SOCKS proxy violates any of the App Store SDK restrictions, and that while AT&T has tethering restrictions for its 3G network, other carriers around the world don't, making the app legit in its opinion. Looks like Apple's agreed -- for now. We did a quick hands-on video last night, check it out after the break.Update: Yeah, it's offline again. This has really got to be drumming up sales, though. Well done, Nullriver. Thanks to everyone who sent this in.
