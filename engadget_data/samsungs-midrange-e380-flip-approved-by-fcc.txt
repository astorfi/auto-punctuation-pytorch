Strangely, the FCC lists this as a single-band GSM 1900 device, but they also make mention of an SGH-E388 sister product that might be more friendly to American frequencies. If you, for whatever reason, thought that there weren't enoughÂ midrange Samsung clamshells in the pipeline, hopefully we've made your day.[Via Slashphone]
