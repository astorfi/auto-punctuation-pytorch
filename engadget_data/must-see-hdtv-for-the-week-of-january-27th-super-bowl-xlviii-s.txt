This week's highlight event is hard to miss, as the Super Bowl dominates Sunday night's TV broadcasts. Before that however, the State of the Union address will appear on major networks Tuesday night, providing not only fodder for the politically interested, but also a comparison of broadcast quality across channels for videophiles. American Horror Story wraps up its season on FX this week and Melissa McCarthy takes the stage on Saturday Night Live, while Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition hits next-gen consoles. Check after the break for trailers plus our weekly listing of what to look out for in TV, Blu-ray and gaming.
