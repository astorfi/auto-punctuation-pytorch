 Synthesizers are notoriously expensive, especially some vintage models, but how'd you like a Korg Polysix for the bargain price of $14.99? Well, as long as you've got an iPad (or a mini), that's now possible with the iPolysix app released today. The '80s-era analog polyphonic synth is "fully replicated," with plenty of additional tools for tablet composers -- the new Polyseq step sequencer, dual Kaoss Pads with chordal support, and a "production environment" with two synths, a drum machine and mixer. You can also publish your creations and remix tracks with other users via the SoundCloud-integrated Polyshare feature. If you're hemming and hawing about a purchase, make up your mind soon, as the app's price doubles on January 1st. You won't find it in the Play store, but the Android Polysix app we saw running on Miselu's Neiro prototype leads us to believe Google's OS won't be excluded from the jam session entirely. Advert / app demo after the break.
