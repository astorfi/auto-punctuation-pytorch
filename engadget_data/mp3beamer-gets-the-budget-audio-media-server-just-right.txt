What would you say to a Pentium 4-based Linux-powered audio server that has a 4-in-1 card reader, PCMCIA slot, SPDIF
in/out, 1394, USB 2.0, S-video, RCA, DVI, and a DVD drive that automatically rips and encodes your audio to MP3 on its
80GB drive? And what if we also told you it distributes the music not only over the network, but wirelessly as well,
supports syncing, and has slick web, Java, WinCE, Palm, and Windows interfaces? Oh yeah, and that it only costs $400?
Well, we'd say that this is everything the Sony NAS-A10
wishes it could be, but doesn't even come close. In fact, we'd say this is basically everything we'd always wished a
budget audio/media server could be, and we couldn't be more stoked about it.
