An internal Verizon Wireless announcement has informed employees that managers will be required to attend a sure-to-be-invigorating netbook webinar to explain to them exactly what these not-at-all-recognized machines are. The lower level folks will have to suffer through the same slide deck a few days later, which leads us to believe that the carrier is just hours, days or millenniums away from spilling more details about this whole initiative. Can we offer a pinch of advice, VZW? Subsidize 'em deep, offer more than two and cut the asking price on your HTC Touch Diamond by at least 50 percent.[Thanks, Anonymous]
