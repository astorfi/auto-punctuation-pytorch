The real standout, of course, is that flip-out LCD -- which feels bolted on by the gods -- but really the whole camera's build quality (and corresponding weight) is immediately obvious. We found the LCD plenty bright and colorful, though it certainly feels small for a modern camera. The price isn't small, but hopefully the RAW, 10 megapixel results will speak for themselves.
