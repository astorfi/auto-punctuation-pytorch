Through the magic of Google Translate we know these are due in Norway May 13 (along with Star Trek II, III, IV & VI in standalone editions on BD & DVD) and it's not unreasonable to assume they'll hit U.S. shelves around the same time. Of course, if you can't wait until then, or at least for some more official info from Paramount, we're sure there's an HD DVD player and boxed set in a bargain bin somewhere just waiting to be picked up.[Via Indy Star]
