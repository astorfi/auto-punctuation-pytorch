Based on the positioning of a couple of magnets, the phone auto-loads the pertinent application -- the multimedia station at least offers a charging plug, but the car dock is all stand. Lucky for us it's not hard to figure out where to place a couple of magnets (we used some nerd-approved "Buckyballs") and spoof the phone into acting like it's docked. We're sure with some additional craftmanship we could have a dock that actually holds the DROID upright, but we won't get ahead of ourselves. For now check out our very own multipurpose homebrew DROID dock after the break.
