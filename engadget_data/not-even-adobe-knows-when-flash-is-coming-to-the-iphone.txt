The addition of Flash support has been rumored pretty much since before the iPhone was even released, and apparently, Apple isn't even talking to Flash owner Adobe -- much less Walt Mossberg -- about when (or if) it's going to happen. Writes company spokesman Ryan Stewart on his blog, "No one aside from Steve Jobs has any idea if or when it's coming." With the SDK right around the corner, we figure Flash is going to end up happening whether Apple provides it or not, but it'd be nice to see Cupertino give Adobe something to work with here, seeing how it's their standard and all. Remember, Apple, there's no "I" in "team."[Via mocoNews]
