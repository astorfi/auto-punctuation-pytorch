HardOCP says the best way to think of the GeForce 9800 GX2 is a 8800 that's been shrunk down to 65nm and SLI'd onto a "single" card. The card is supposed to be at least 30% faster than a 8800 Ultra, and will apparently support Quad SLI. So, now for the really nerdy part:

1GB frame buffer
Two PCBs
Two 65nm GPUs
256 Stream Processors

That's the way HardOCP tells it, and who are we to argue?[Via PC Perspective]
