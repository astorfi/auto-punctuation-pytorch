But of course web apps don't compare to real apps like this new one for Android users. The new FiOS Mobile app features a guide for remote scheduling as well as VOD browsing so you can mark what you want to watch later, as well as parental controls and a free space indicator -- something TiVo doesn't even offer on the DVR itself. Of course there's no way to actually watch content from your DVR, and we're not surprised. Now before you get too jealous of Android users with Verizon's FiOS TV DVR, we'd like to remind you that the FiOS DVR has a measly 160GB hard drive and no external disk support, and as you can see from the screen shot, FiOS users don't have any free space left for new recordings anyway.
