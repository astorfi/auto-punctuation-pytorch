 If the 170g Huawei Ascend D2 is a bit too imposing for your hands, then you may be curious to know of the Ascend P2, a previously teased smartphone that was just leaked by @evleaks. While there's no further info to go along with this image, it does show off a 13MP camera on the back of the phone, which makes us wonder how Huawei even managed to pack that into the sub-6.45mm-thick metallic body. A little digging around also showed that the company's Consumer BG CEO Richard Yu was seen fondling the P2 during a meeting back in December -- you can recognize the phone in the photo after the break. Naturally, we look forward to this successor to the Ascend P1 at Mobile World Congress next month.
