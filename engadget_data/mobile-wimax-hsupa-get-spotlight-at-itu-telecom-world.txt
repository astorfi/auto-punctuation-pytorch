       LG and Samsung are using Hong Kong's ITU Telecom World 2006 as a platform for highlighting a couple technologies that, frankly, can't get here soon enough. It seems somehow appropriate that the Korean crosstown rivals are fighting for their share of the spotlight, parading HSUPA and Mobile WiMAX equipment -- both of which have the potential to shatter upstream speeds offered by the latest live technologies (HSDPA and EV-DO rev. A), while Mobile WiMAX also offers the tantalizing opportunity to pull upwards of 10Mbps down to you. While this isn't the first time we've seen either of these technologies in the wild, they're obviously becoming more ubiquitous at each and every trade show around the globe -- which means our dream of some day hosting Engadget Mobile on a cellphone grows ever closer.Read - LGRead - Samsung
