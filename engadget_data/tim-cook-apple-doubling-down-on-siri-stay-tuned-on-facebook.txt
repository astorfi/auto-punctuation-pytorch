Speaking at D10, Tim Cook said that Apple is "doubling down on Siri," adding that "you'll be really pleased with what you see in the coming months on this." He did also acknowledge that Siri currently has its shortcomings, but said that "customers love it," and that "what makes Siri cool is that she has a personality." When it came to a largely non-existent iOS feature at the moment -- Facebook integration -- Cook said to "stay tuned," noting that he has "great respect for them," and that he wants Facebook's hundreds of millions of customers to have "the best experience" on the iPhone and iPad.
