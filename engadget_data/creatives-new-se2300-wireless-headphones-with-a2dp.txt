The SE2300 cans keep it safe with a tried-but-true over the ear clip-on design and a nifty tether too keep track of the little things all mitten-style -- quite festive indeed. The A2DP headphones boast of an 8 hour rechargeable battery and AVRCP support to control your player wirelessly. Creative includes a Bluetooth dongle with the bundle, but you can sync with other Bluetooth devices just fine. The $99 pricetag seems just about right, but while these should be out in Singapore just about now, we're not positive when they'll be hitting the States.[Via MobileWhack]
