The head-mounted display, first introduced as a prototype back in January at CES, has finally graduated into a real product. The device is aimed at gamers and TV watchers, generating a 3D image with use of a pair of 0.7-inch OLED panels, which each display separate images, doing away with the ghost imagery that often comes along with 3D displays. The device is a solid piece of hardware, just what one would expect from Sony -- especially for a piece of hardware that'll run you around $600 when it hits the US around the November / December time frame. Check out a hands-on video of the device after the break.
