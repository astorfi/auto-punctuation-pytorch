The original version of the episode is included, as well as a "Hybrid Extended Cut," combining the high-definition on-air version of "The Measure of a Man" with video of the extra material taken from an early VHS rough-cut of the episode that was in the writer's (Melinda Snodgrass) archives.

   The spectacular collection boasts a must-see reunion of the cast, who were brought together earlier this year in Calgary in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the series. Produced exclusively for the series' Blu-ray, this never-before-seen reunion roundtable chat features all of the best known cast regulars, joining together for the first time in years to tape a discussion about the legacy of the series, including Patrick Stewart (Captain Jean-Luc Picard), Jonathan Frakes (Commander William T. Riker, LeVar Burton (Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge), Marina Sirtis (Counselor Deanna Troi), Brent Spiner (Lt. Commander Data), Michael Dorn (Lieutenant Worf), Gates McFadden (Dr. Beverly Crusher) and Wil Wheaton  (Wesley Crusher).

   The 5-disc collection features all 22 episodes of the second season of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, including the beginning of Whoopi Goldberg's notable recurring role, and the introductions of Diana Muldaur as the new ship's doctor and the deadly alien villains The Borg.
