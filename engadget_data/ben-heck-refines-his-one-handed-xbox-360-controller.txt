The latest and greatest mod by Ben Heckendorn is a refined version of his right-handed Xbox 360 controller. As opposed to the one-size-fits-all modularity of the Access, his one-handed controllers puts all the buttons easily within reach and places the right analog stick at the base of the controller -- you play the game by moving the analog stick against your leg. The new version has slimmed down the design considerably and spruced up the aesthetics -- thought the inclusion of a PS3 d-pad could be seen as sacrilege to some.[Via Cool Mods]
