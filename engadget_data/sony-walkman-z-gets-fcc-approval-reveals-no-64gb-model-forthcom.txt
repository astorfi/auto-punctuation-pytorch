   We played with Sony's Walkman Z back when it was still called the "Walkman Mobile Entertainment Player" -- with the power to wirelessly push your media to a compatible Bravia TV. Fortunately the range has just stopped by the FCC's underground bunker, where its 802.11 b/g/n WiFi and Bluetooth radios were soundly prodded. Sadly, it looks like we won't be getting the 64GB edition on these shores, Sony is cheaping us out with a low-end 8GB model instead. In Japan, the 16GB model retails for 27,800 Yen ($360) and the 32GB for 32,800 Yen ($420) -- but given the company's penchant for releasing products after we've emptied our wallets for Christmas, we doubt it'll matter much.
