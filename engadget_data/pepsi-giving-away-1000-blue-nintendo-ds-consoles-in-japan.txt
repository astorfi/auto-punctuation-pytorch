Oh, don't worryâ€”there'll be plenty of opportunities for Nintendo to do what they've done with the Game Boy Advance
SP and come out with endless limited-edition versions of the Nintendo DS, but in the meantime, if you're itching for a
non-silver DS, you better get your bad self over to Japan. Pepsi is doing a contest with Nintendo next month over there
where they're giving away a thousand blue-colored Nintendo DS game consoles (and a bunch of other Super Mario
crap).
