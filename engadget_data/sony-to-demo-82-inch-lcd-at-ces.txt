Fittingly, the Sony model uses proprietary Samsung tech in order toachieve wider viewing angles, and features a 1200:1 contrast ratio and a response time under 8ms. Sony will show offthis bad boy in a few days at CES, where we'll hopefully have some live pics for you and an estimated price that isslightly more accurate than our usual guesstimate MSRP of one million dollars.
