Our latest look at the device comes courtesy of BlackBerry Times in China, who has what appears to be an early version of the device. They expect the smooth plastic back to be replaced by the leather look RIM favors on its higher end devices, but otherwise the unit looks to be pretty solid and far along. The Google-translated Chinese seems to confirm again that the screen is not SurePress. Not a lot of landmark news to be gleaned here, but we're mostly stoked about these delicious bokeh-filled shots of device -- it's really looking good, and the comparison shot with other recent BlackBerrys (check after the break) is rather helpful for sizing this thing up.
