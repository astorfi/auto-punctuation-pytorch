Twitter has been slowly expanding its advertising offerings for some time now -- first with more ads in more places, then with more folks able to buy ads. Now it's taken things one big step further and opened up its self-serve Twitter Ads platform to all users in the United States. That means anyone can now sign up and buy promoted tweets of their very own, with all the same options and analytics previously afforded to businesses and individuals invited to take part in the program. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be seeing more ads on Twitter, but you may well start seeing some more unexpected ones. Those interested in shelling out some cash can find all they need to get started at the links below.
