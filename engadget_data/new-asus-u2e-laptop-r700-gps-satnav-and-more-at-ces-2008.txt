First up -- just as hoped for -- the company is bringing the Nova P22 desktop our way, a Core 2 Duo-based number which should please the style conscious without breaking the bank (at its $799 price tag). Also headed this way is the $399 R700 GPS navigator that we saw for Europe recently, a 4.3-inch touchscreen-based nav unit with a petite 1.3-cm-thick (er, thin) footprint, and a bunch of media playin', Bluetoothin' functions that will make you weak in the knees. Also announced for the US is the U2 laptop (here known as the U2E), a Core Duo ULV-based computer, coupled with a 32GB SSD -- which cuts down on the energy-sucking without sacrificing performance (or so they say). There was one new product in the PR that we haven't seen: the 24-inch widescreen MK241, which features HDMI support, a built-in webcam, microphone, and speakers, though no word on price or release date.
