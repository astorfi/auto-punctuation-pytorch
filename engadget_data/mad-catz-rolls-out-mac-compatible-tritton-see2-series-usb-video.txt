 It's been quite a while since Tritton last cropped up on our radar, but the company was acquired by Mad Catz last summer, and it's now announced a new range of Mac-compatible, 720p-supporting external video cards. That includes updated versions of its existing SEE2 UV150 external VGA video card and SEE2 XD300 Xpress Docking Station (with VGA, Ethernet, four USB ports, and mic and speaker ports), along with the all new SEE2 Xtreme UV250 external video card, which packs both VGA and DVI ports and supports resolutions up to 1920 x 1200, but is apparently only compatible with Windows. Look for it to be available in April for $100, while two Mac-compatible devices will be available next month for $60 and $100. Full press release is after the break.
