The Xbox One may come with its own beefed up audio accessories, but audiophiles waiting on Turtle Beach's XO Ear Force headsets will have to wait: Microsoft won't support them until 2014. According to a statement confirmed by Microsoft, the Xbox One Headset Adapter that enables the use of third party audio accessories will ship early next year, leaving early adopters to make due with the official pack-ins. Redmond says it'll use the spare time to help manufactures "create new headsets that will take full advantage of the Xbox One technology," also noting that the console's included headset is free, after all.

The companies will collaborate on audio solutions for the Xbox One through 2015
VALHALLA, N.Y. – October 18, 2013 – Turtle Beach, the leader in gaming audio products, today announced an extended partnership with Microsoft to create innovative hardware, software, and applications that support the Xbox One's advanced audio capabilities. The new agreement extends a relationship first revealed when Turtle Beach announced the XO FOUR and XO SEVEN next generation gaming headsets in May, 2013.

The partnership provides a wide range of opportunities to increase exposure of the Turtle Beach brand to consumers. In connection with the launch of the XO FOUR and XO SEVEN headsets, Turtle Beach and Microsoft will collaborate on consumer, trade and retailer events, as well as integrated marketing initiatives, including retail point-of-sale displays and kiosks.

Turtle Beach headsets have supported Xbox One preview events across the world, including: trade events such as Gamescom in Cologne, the Tokyo Game Show, PAX Prime in Seattle; loft showcase events in San Francisco and New York; and the 'Area One' experiential tour which will visit 75 major markets in North America and Europe. Turtle Beach headsets will also be featured in Microsoft's Xbox One booths at the 2013 Brasil Games Show from October 25 to 29, and Paris Games Week from October 30 to November 3.

"Turtle Beach is a key partner with Microsoft in the new Xbox One console platform," said Branden Powell, Director of Strategic Alliances at Microsoft. "We are committed to our partnership with Turtle Beach and will continue to work together to create innovative audio solutions that support the Xbox One's advanced audio capabilities."

Turtle Beach expects to launch the XO FOUR and XO SEVEN headsets for the Xbox One console in the first quarter of 2014. Microsoft has informed its partners in the Xbox One console launch that the Xbox One Headset Adapter, being built by Microsoft and provided to Turtle Beach for inclusion with new gaming headsets, will not be available until early 2014. Both companies will leverage the additional time to build supply to meet anticipated high-demand when the headsets launch.

"We are very excited about the coming XBOX ONE launch and expect to continue to work closely with Microsoft to deliver the best audio products and capabilities for the XBOX ONE through 2014 and 2015," said Juergen Stark, Chief Executive Officer at Turtle Beach. "I know we will excite consumers with our new headsets in the coming months and I am looking forward to the launch of the XO FOUR and XO SEVEN in early 2014."

Turtle Beach is launching nine additional headsets in the next 60 days, including limited edition Call of Duty®: Ghosts gaming headsets, iSeries media headsets, and the Marvel's Thor: The Dark World edition of the new Marvel SEVEN entertainment headset.
