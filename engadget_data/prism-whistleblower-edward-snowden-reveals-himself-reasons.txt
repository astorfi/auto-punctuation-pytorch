Only days after the initial leaks and explanations by the US government about the National Security Agency's data surveillance program PRISM, Edward Snowden has revealed himself as the whistleblower. He's employed by defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton and also worked at the NSA as a "technical assistant" for the CIA. In speaking to The Guardian, he explained his reasons for disclosing the intelligence program: he wanted to "to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them," hoping that they'll use the information to debate the issue.


While the NSA's data-mining tool is reportedly known as Boundless Informant, Snowden has been keeping himself bound to a hotel in Hong Kong during this whole drama. Major internet companies have insisted that the government doesn't receive direct access to their servers and President Obama has stated that "nobody is listening to your phone calls, but the issue remains far from black and white. Snowden claims a "massive surveillance machine" is in the making under the radar -- at this point he's now waiting to see what happens next, assured he's made the the decision that feels right to him.

Update: In case there was any doubt that Snowden has ever been employed by Booz Allen Hamilton, the company just released the following statement: 


Booz Allen can confirm that Edward Snowden, 29, has been an employee of our firm for less than 3 months, assigned to a team in Hawaii. News reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm. We will work closely with our clients and authorities in their investigation of this matter.
