 We're not quite sure what it is yet, but LG has just invited us to save the date May 1st for a special event held in New York city, in which it asks us to "share the genius" and "capture the spotlight in true brilliance." If this is indeed a new device, it alludes to a higher-res display and greater sound; is this a US version of the Optimus G Pro or simply the next-generation Optimus G? Hard to say at this point, but we're keeping a pretty close eye out for more details. In the meantime, this is at least one more thing to look forward to in a couple weeks.
