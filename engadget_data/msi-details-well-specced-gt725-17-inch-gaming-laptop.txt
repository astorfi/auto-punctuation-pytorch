Anywho, MSI has just come clean with the actual specifications, and gamers in the crowd looking for a portable rig should be pleased. The machine is claiming to be the first ever gaming lappie to include ATI's 512MB Radeon HD4850 GPU, and that's complemented by a 17-inch WUXGA (anti-glare) display, a 320GB SATA hard drive, Blu-ray optical drive, 4-in-1 multicard reader, up to 4GB of RAM, a plethora of ports, nine-cell battery, 802.11b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, gigabit Ethernet and a 2 megapixel webcam. There's also an ExpressCard slot, four standard speakers plus a "subwoofer" and a Turbo Drive Engine to make overclocking a lesson in simplicity. The 7-pound unit is being billed as MSI's new flagship laptop, and with a list of internals like that, we can fully understand why. Full release is after the break.
