What's the difference between a case and a cover? The Korean company Anymode is provoking just that question with a Galaxy Tab 10.1 case (cover?) that looks awfully familiar. The Smart Case, as it's known, comes in multiple colors, protects the tablet's front, and folds into a triangular stand. You might be thinking that sounds remarkably like Apple's Smart Cover, and if so, you're not the only one. Ah, but the plot thickens: 9to5mac reports that the maker of this blatant knock-off has strong ties to Samsung. Family ties, even, as their tipster claims Sang-yong Kim, the Anymode CEO, is the nephew of Kun-Hee Lee, Sammy's chairman. We couldn't confirm any blood relation, which could mean we're dealing with a cover-clone conspiracy theory. Either way, we suspect this'll lead to more billable hours for Cupertino's lawyers.

[Update: Samsung has responded on its official blog, distancing itself from Anymode's product:


		As a general practice, Samsung Electronics reviews and approves all accessories produced by partners before they are given the "Designed for Samsung Mobile" mark.

		In this case, approval was not given to Anymode for the accessory to feature this official designation. We are working with Anymode to address this oversight and the product has already been removed from the Anymode sales website. The product has not been sold.
