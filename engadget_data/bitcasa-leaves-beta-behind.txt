 Bitcasa made some serious waves when it hit the scene in December, offering bottomless cloud storage for $10 per-month or $99 for a full year. The service is now leaving beta, with the promised Mac and iOS apps in tow. And, just as icing on the cake, a Linux client is also on the way (and already available in alpha form). While going gold isn't going to change a lot about Bitcasa in the short term, at least the company knows how to celebrate right -- with steep discounts! Sign up for the service during the month of February and you'll get a full year of Infinite Drive for $60 $69. You can sign up at the source and peruse the PR after the break. We're already busy backing up our My Bloody Valentine bootlegs.

 Update: As some of you have noticed, the price being advertised on the Bitcasa site is $69 for the year, not $59 as the press release states. We've updated the post to reflect the advertised cost and asked for a clarification.

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - February 5, 2013 - Bitcasa, the creator of infinite and secure storage across all devices, announced the availability of the new Infinite Driveâ„¢ across iOS, Android, Mac desktop, Windows Desktop, Windows RT, and the Web. For $10/month, worldwide users can enjoy infinite storage, anywhere access, and automatic backup with built-in client-side encryption to ensure privacy. During the month of February, Bitcasa will be offering special pricing of $59 for a year of infinite storage, a 40-percent discount compared to the regular pricing of $99 per year.

   Bitcasa simplifies storage with the Infinite Drive, which works like a magic external hard drive that never crashes or runs out of space. Users can free up space by moving files from laptop and mobile devices into the Infinite Drive. Everything becomes instantly available across all devices regardless of device capacity or file formats. In addition, Bitcasa is fully encrypted client-side, which means that unlike other services, Bitcasa employees can't access any data for any reason.

   "When I started this company, I talked about faulty external hard drives and the outrageous fees for limited file synchronization services," said Tony Gauda, Bitcasa CEO. "I believe - and many of our users will agree - that, with the launch of the Bitcasa Infinite Drive, hard drives are now dead. Our customers have stored more than 1.7 billion photos on the Infinite Drive, and this is just the beginning. Imagine a world where gigabytes simply don't matter anymore. That's Bitcasa."
