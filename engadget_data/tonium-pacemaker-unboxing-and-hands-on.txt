Each cable is individually packaged in tissue paper inside its own box, and the flaps all have different little fortunes printed on them, from "Your future is looking sound" to our personal favorite "Listen to your mother." As for the Pacemaker itself, it's been pretty fun to mess around with in the few minutes we've had, but we've got to get some more tracks loaded up before we can say anything meaningful. Stay tuned!
