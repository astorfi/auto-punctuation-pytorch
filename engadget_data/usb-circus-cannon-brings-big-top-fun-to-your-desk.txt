 
Much like the USB air darts we saw last winter, this new Circus Cannon connects to your free USB port (go on, unplug that scanner that you hardly use anyway), and then will shoot three foam "babes" (they look like darts with faces to us) whenever you please. If that wasn't enough, the $35 package comes with its own miniature circus net and pre-recorded sound effects -- you can even add your own sound effects, surely to the annoyance of your co-workers. Mac fans, sorry, this one is Windows XP-only. We've heard the USB freak show is just around the corner, so watch out.
