It's also quick to point out, however, that they're still far from finalized, noting that, "as a part of our process in briefing creative agencies, we shared some early prototypes and concepts of our retail store plans." Otherwise, company spokesman Frank Shaw would only go so far as to reiterate that "no final decisions have been made," and that Microsoft is still on track to open its first retail stores sometime this Fall.

Update: Looks like the folks at Redmond have picked the first two retail locations for its stores, and according to CNET, those lucky locales are Scottsdale, Arizona and Mission Viejo, California -- yeah, not exactly the most exciting picks, but perhaps the local authorities were quicker to sign the leases. Unsurprisingly, the California store is in a mall where an Apple store also resides -- let's hope the two stores find themselves within earshot of one another.
