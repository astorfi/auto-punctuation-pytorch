 
 Ready to make its debut on Cricket Wireless, we've spent some time with the One SV here at CES. In a great flame red finish, the specification sheet matches what we've seen on the Desire X and Desire C. There's a strong-performing 4.3-inch Super LCD 2 display with a UI that has that familiar HTC sheen. Yep, there's that Sense overlay and those bonus camera features (burst photography and the like) that we've seen from the Taiwan phone maker's 2012 catalog. Like the Desire X, the curved size and (relatively) small screen-size mean it's easy to handle, while LTE connectivity and a 1.2GHz Snapdragon S4 processor made easy work of browsing on Chrome and navigating Android 4.0. We'll be bringing you our full review of Cricket's new 4G phone later this month, but until then we've got a hands-on video after the break.
