 In yet another blow to freeloaders wardrivers nationwide, one of their most active participants was recently arrested and charged with theft of services after leeching off an unsecured network at Vancouver, WA's Brewed Awakenings coffee house for over three months. According to store employees, 20-year-old Internet enthusiast Alexander Eric Smith (actually the second Smith we've seen nailed for this crime) would regularly park his truck in the customer parking lot and tap into their signal, even though he reportedly had never actually been inside to buy anything -- which was apparently okay for three months, but suddenly turned into something one worker described as "borderline creepy." Hey Alex, it's called wardriving for a reason -- it's one thing to be cheap, but this is what you get for being lazy and not switching it up a bit.[Via The Wireless Report]
