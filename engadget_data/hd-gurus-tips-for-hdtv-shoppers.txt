 If you're shopping for a new HDTV this holiday season (lucky dog) or if you're the local "TV expert" who has a stream of coworkers asking for advice, check out the details at the read link. For those who will be combing the HDTV aisles over the coming months in search of their next acquisition, Gary Merson (aka HD Guru) has broken down some good tips on how to pick the right HDTV set. They're simple guidelines, but just the sort of advice that the general consumer needs when wading into the HDTV waters. And the advice comes from a guy who really knows his HD, so you know it's on the up and up. We especially like how the tips start by considering the space that will be home to your new toy -- choose a screen size based on viewing distance, then measure your viewing angles. Once you're in-store, pay attention to SAL: 1)Signal quality; 2) Angle of view; and 3) Lighting conditions. We'd add in a "T" as item four: disable Torch mode. So we've got "SALT," as in "take specs and salesmen with a pinch of."
