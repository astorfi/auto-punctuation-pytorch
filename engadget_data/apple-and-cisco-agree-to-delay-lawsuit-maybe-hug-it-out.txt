Apple and Cisco, in a "tersely" worded joint statement yesterday, announced that Cisco has agreed to delay its iPhone lawsuit, while the two companies start up talks again to see if they can't settle this naming dispute out of court. It's unclear if Apple suddenly decided the lawsuit wasn't so terribly "silly" and decided its best shot at a cheap solution was an out of court settlement, or if Cisco was afeared that its once firm grasp on the trademark was slipping, and decided to grab the money and run. Or maybe, just maybe, the two companies decided that with all the petty bickering in the world, couldn't they just get along? Oh man, sometimes we just crack ourselves up.
