For what it's worth, the customer service lines will stay open even after that happens -- and you'll still be able to buy a phone through KT in South Korea, Vodafone in Europe, and "possibly other [retailers] based on local market conditions" -- but by and large, your average American is going to have a hard time getting one pretty shortly. If you're a registered Android developer, though, Google's looking at continuing to offer the device through some sort of sales partner -- a wise move considering it'll be just about the only thing you can buy unlocked running a clean-slate latest build.
