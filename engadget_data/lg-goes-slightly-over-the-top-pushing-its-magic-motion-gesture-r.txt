Check it out above to see Bin Won, star of such Korean flicks as Mother (currently streaming on Netflix Watch Instantly, if it's not in your queue it should be, it's an excellent thriller) and The Man From Nowhere, pull off some action movie moves complete with gunshot sound effects carrying nothing but LG's Wiimote knockoff. Changing the channel is rarely this exciting for us, but if LG plans to convince customers waving your arm in the air is the best way to control the TV, they'll have to start somewhere.
