Not only does it boast a high 1280 x 720 resolution, but it uses a less common lenticular lens approach instead of the parallax barrier method used by the likes of the Nintendo 3DS and HTC EVO 3D. According to Hitachi, that allows for much brighter 3D images than other displays (470 cd/m2, specifically), and images that are actually brighter in 3D mode than in 2D mode. Here's hoping Hitachi shows off a bit more than the image above before too long.
