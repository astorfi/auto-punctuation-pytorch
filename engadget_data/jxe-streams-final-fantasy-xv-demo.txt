Final Fantasy XV is playable right now and that seems impossible. Even just as Episode Duscae, the small demo included with the newly released Final Fantasy Type-0, it feels like a phantom. Final Fantasy Versus XIII was announced in 2006 as a PlayStation 3-exclusive side story to the impending Final Fantasy XIII. After years of trailers, delays and a slow trickle of art from the game -- a song from the soundtrack showed up on Yoko Shimomura's greatest hits in 2008, for crying out loud -- it was retitled Final Fantasy XV in 2013 and announced for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Now it's partially here. Nine years after that first announcement, we're digging into the expansive Episode Duscae on JXE Streams.



We're streaming Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae for two hours starting at 3PM ET on Engadget.com/gaming, Twitch.tv/Joystiq and right here in this post. Director Hajime Tabata said that the demo takes approximately that long to play through; our goal is to get through the whole thing for your viewing pleasure. We'll be playing it for the first time ourselves, so come join us in finding out what we've been missing out on this past decade!

JXE Streams broadcasts live every Tuesday and Thursday, but we also stream other days as well. Be sure to bookmark Engadget.com/gaming to check our upcoming schedule.
