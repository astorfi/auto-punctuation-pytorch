With Hyperloop still a twinkle in Elon Musk's eye, we've got to look elsewhere for our futuristic transport. Thankfully, Aerofex has stepped up with its Aero-X, a hoverbike that is finally scheduled to launch in 2017. Two users can ride this motorbike-like vehicle, where the wheels have been replaced with carbon fiber rotors that'll lift you 10 feet into the air. This first model has a top speed of 45 miles per hour, and a full tank will carry you for an hour and 15 minutes -- making it good enough for a short trip to the store. The Aero-X has a weight limit of 310 pounds, so if you're going to pretend you've got a speederbike, probably best to leave the stormtrooper armor at home. Still, it's available to pre-order right now, assuming you've got $85,000 stashed down the back of the couch, plus the refundable $5,000 deposit, of course.
