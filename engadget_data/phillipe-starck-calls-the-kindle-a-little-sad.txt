  Quite a few people have weighed in on the Kindle's retro style, and we're sure the lot of them felt a little vindicated when superstar designer Philippe Starck straight-up called the device's design "almost modern" and "a little sad." Speaking at the LeWeb 3 conference in Paris, Starck said he'd have put the minimum amount of plastic around the screen, but that it looked like Amazon's designers weren't "courageous" enough to take that step. He also harshed on the ridiculously easy-to-press page buttons, saying that the physical interface just "wasn't well done." All excellent points, we have to say -- although you'd think that a guy rocking shoulder pads like that would be down with the Kindle's totally-80s effects.
