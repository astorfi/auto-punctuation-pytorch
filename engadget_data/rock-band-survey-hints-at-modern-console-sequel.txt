"Hello friends! You should fill out this important Rock Band survey," reads a tweet from the official Rock Band Twitter account. "Sharing the link is encouraged. DO IT NOW!" The link attached to that message leads to a three-page survey regarding your history with the Rock Band series to date. It's pretty typical stuff - What Rock Band game did you play most?, Which console do you use to play Rock Band?, etc. - but the third page is where things get interesting.
      

 
          
 
 
 Not only does the survey ask players which new-generation consoles they own, and whether they'd prefer a hypothetical future release to be digital or physical, it also asks players to rank which features of prior Rock Band games they most enjoyed. "Would you be inclined to preorder a new Rock Band title?" is the survey's final question.While a lone survey is far from proof that Rock Band 4 (or whatever it might be called) is in development, this does at least indicate that Harmonix is looking into bringing the series to more modern hardware. Hopefully there's a cheap, simple way to carry over all those plastic instruments fans bought as well.[Image: Harmonix/MTV Games]
