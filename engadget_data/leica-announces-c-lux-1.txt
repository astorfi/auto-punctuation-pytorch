It's not at alldifferent from Panasonic's 6 megapixel DMC-FX01 (besides thebranding, of course), which is probably a good thing, since the FX01's a hot little number. If you didn't catch it thefirst time around, expect optical image stabilization, the latest Venus image processor, 3.6x optical zoom, and thesignature super-simple Panasonic interface.[Via Photography Blog]
