This guy stands 5 feet tall and is kitted with a 5 megapixel camera, forward-mounted display, WiFi and optional 3G connectivity, and a laser pointer for, well, pointing at things. Available for purchase sometime in late 2009, the price will be somewhere in the $15,000 - $25,000 range. Video after the break.[Via Get Robo]
