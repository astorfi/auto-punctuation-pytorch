The rumored HTC "Nike" (these code names of theirs keep getting weirder and weirder, we swear) should bow as the P5500 when it becomes available this fall in HTC-branded trim, rolling deep with a 400MHz Samsung core, 128MB ROM / 64MB RAM with microSD expansion, integrated FM tuner, Bluetooth 2.0, a 3 megapixel cam, and a 2.6-inch QVGA touchscreen. Best of all, it'll pack GPS and industrial-strength data via both 802.11b/g and HSDPA (no word on bands, though) -- and yes, that is Windows Mobile 6 Professional you see there, hence the touchscreen.[Via Navigadget]
