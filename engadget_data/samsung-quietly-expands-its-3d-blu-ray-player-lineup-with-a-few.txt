The $399 (MSRP) BD-C7900 updates the older BD-C6900 with two HDMI outs, useful for those with an older receiver that isn't HDMI 1.4 compatible, while the $279 BD-C6800 seems to have all the features of the BD-C6900 except for that porthole on top, and comes in at a lower price. Last up is the BD-C5900 with an MSRP of $229 which puts it within reach of two bills at retail, but means losing the 1GB of internal storage featured by the other two players. The product pages aren't all fully updated on Samsung's site yet, but the BD-C5900 has already arrived at Amazon and Best Buy and the others shouldn't be far behind. Of course, if 3D's not your thing, we'd still keep an eye out for their arrival -- a price break on the older 2D-only models that were released earlier this year shouldn't be too far behind.
