It's not quite as small as the MobiBlu DAH-1500 will
be, but the iOps Z3 will be of diminutive size all the same: no depth info, but 2.17 inches tall by slightly shy of an
inch wide. It's got a 4K color OLED screen for viewing JPG images, including a zoom feature. Other specs include a USB
2.0 interface, MP3/WMA/Ogg support, and your choice of 40 different languages in the interface. Only available in,
oddly, pink and green, the iOps Z3 will come in 512MB and 1GB formats. As a special bonus, iOps wins today's runner-up
slot for the Quirky Marketing Award (the winner, of course, being
Hitachi) by billing this player as the "Jewel in my
Neck." We're pretty sure the embedding is optional.
