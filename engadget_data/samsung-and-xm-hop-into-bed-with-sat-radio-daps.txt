Well, well, then. So XM and
Samsung announced a partnership to co-develop
digital audio players that will be XM satellite radio enabled. The icing in the cake here comes in the form of XM's
$25M investment in WorldSpace last week, which secures them satellite radio access in a few new places you might have
heard of: Africa, Asia, Europe, etc. In other words, all the other markets that Samsung would really like to sell
devices outside the States. Man, did Apple ever miss the
boat on this oneâ€”think Jobs is
on the phone with Karmazin right rocking it supplicant style?
