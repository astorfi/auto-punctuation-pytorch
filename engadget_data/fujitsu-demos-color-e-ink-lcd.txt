But we have a feeling it's going to be alittle while before anyone tops Fujitsu's bezel-tastic QVGAcolor LCD e-ink display, which holds color images steady in perpetuity without power. It's hard to tell how good thecolor representation is, what with that blaring flash, but the applications of color e-ink are enormous, especially asthe displays get larger (and smaller) -- and Fujitsu does claim to have sheet paper-size prototypes.
