 Looks like the Optimus G isn't the only smartphone from LG that'll soon hit US carriers, as its similarly sized (yet slower) sibling has just been outed for T-Mobile. True to form, the price and release date of the Optimus L9 are wholly absent from the equation, but outside of any substantial tweaks, shoppers may rightfully expect an Android 4.0.4 smartphone with a 4.7-inch qHD display that's powered by a dual-core 1GHz CPU. In its global iteration, the device also sports a 5-megapixel camera, 4GB of built-in storage and a 2,150mAh battery, which provides a rough guideline of what's on the horizon at T-Mobile. Naturally, there are more powerful smartphones to be found, but if the price is right, the Optimus L9 may hit a sweet spot for many.
