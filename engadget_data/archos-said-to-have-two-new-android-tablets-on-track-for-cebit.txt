Details are still pretty light, of course, but the company's German PR firm has reportedly said that Archos will debut two new "low-cost" Android tablets that are "specifically designed for use at home." One of those is rumored to be a new Archos 7 tablet, while the other remains a bit of a mystery -- although the combination of "low-cost" and "home use" seems to suggest that 3G might be out of the question for either of them.
