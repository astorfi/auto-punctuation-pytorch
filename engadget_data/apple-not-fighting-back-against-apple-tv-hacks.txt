       We had a word with Apple yesterday about the Apple TV -- specifically about that supposed backdoor. We asked whether enthusiasts really are in fact having services and hacks shut down through surreptitious software updates and backdoors into the Apple TV, to which Apple let us know that is absolutely not the case. Although they didn't account for any issues these have been experiencing when upgrading their machines, Apple is certain that they didn't do any of that funny stuff that would make Sony's legal team cringe. Apple's stance, it claims, is more along the lines of: it's your box, do with it what you please -- but be mindful of voiding that warranty. Guess this is just the stuff you've got to deal with when tooling around with an STB -- your hacks aren't necessarily always going to stick and work, which is why they're hacks.
