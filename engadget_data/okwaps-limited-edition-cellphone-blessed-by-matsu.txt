We'll admit to never having heard of Taiwanese cellphone manufacturer Okwap, who are said to be totally big over
there right now (something we suspect is like your band being huge in Belgium), but they're trying to give their
handsets a little spiritual edge over the competition with a new divinely-blessed limited-edition cellphone. Each of
the 2,000 Matsu phones have been blessed in a ritual at a Matsu temple (Matsu is the Chinese goddess of the sea or
something like that) and comes with a hologram of the deity on the back, religious chant ringtones, and Matsu-themed
wallpaper. We fully expect Motorola to strike back with a Jesus phone soon, though we'd probably feel bad swearing on
one.
