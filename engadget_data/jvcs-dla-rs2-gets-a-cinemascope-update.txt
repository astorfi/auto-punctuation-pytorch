At the $9,000 price point, doing a constant-height 2.35:1 projection setup on the cheap isn't exactly an option, so JVC has thrown in an RSAL2 anamorphic lens and an RSVP2 processor (which does look an awful lot like a DVDO VP50) for your viewing pleasure. Other than those features, things look pretty much the same, which is no knock on the well-respected pj known for bright (and dark), colorful images.
