Enjoy this for what it is: a bitchin' chiptune cover of the theme song to the nerdgasm, soft porn fantasy-fest that is HBO's Game of Thrones. And, yes that is a "keytar" with a Nintendo Entertainment System attached that YouTuber Theremin Hero is deftly fingering to play the show's epic opening theme. Dude's even rocking Think Geek's 8-bit tie. Clearly, he's committed. The full video is after the break.


(Full disclosure: I've tried reading book one of Game of Thrones at least twice on a plane ride and failed to get hooked. Same goes for season one of the show. I just don't get it.)
