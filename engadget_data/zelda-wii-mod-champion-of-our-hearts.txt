We're not really sure there are even any points of potential improvement in this Zelda shrine, unless of course it could magically turn into Link and wanted to be friends with us. The word from comments is that the fancy sword and shield are from the collector's edition of the Twilight Princess score, and it turns out you can remove the sword and flail it around like you don't even care. The best news is that you can make this Wii your own, since it's already up on eBay, waiting to dive into the arms of the highest bidder -- just look out for the mind-melting embedded Zelda theme music MIDI when you hit up that read link, death comes to all who hear it.[Via Nintendo Wii Fanboy]Update: Apparently eBay was giving our good-hearted seller a bit of a hassle, so he had to relist it with proper permissions for sale on behalf of a charity. Check out the new listing here.
