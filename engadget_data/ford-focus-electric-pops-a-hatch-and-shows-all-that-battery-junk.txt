We didn't get the chance to pop the rear hatch on the thing when we were exploring it at CES. Here in Detroit we did and you can see what we found above. That's definitely a big 'ol box, putting a hurting on cargo space, but ultimately a small price to pay for rolling totally fuel- and emissions-free.
