At this point, this is just a concept and the white plastic chassis is far from pretty or final, and frankly it just looks like a last generation HP Mini. The 10-inch resistive touch display was responsive to finger taps from what we could see in our brief fondling. Oh and the Android OS we know and love was, you know, running. It all looks interesting, but for now we were way more impressed with Lenovo's Skylight.
