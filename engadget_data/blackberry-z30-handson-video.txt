Those BlackBerry Z30 rumors (which was known previously as the A10) might turn out to be for real after all, if this early hands-on video from Vietnamese outlet Cellphone S is to be believed. The footage shows what is presumably the BlackBerry Z30 in all its glory, with what is apparently a 5-inch AMOLED display with 295 ppi and 720p (1,280 x 720) resolution. Purported specs include a dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro processor, a rear 8-megapixel camera, a front-facing 2-megapixel cam, a 2,800 mAh battery, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage and it's said to ship with BlackBerry 10.2 as well. Perhaps more interesting to our US audience is that it appears to have the AT&T logo on the back, hinting that it may arrive on our shores sooner than later. Have a peek at the video after the break, and hit the source for more close-up pics of what could be yet another BlackBerry savior.
