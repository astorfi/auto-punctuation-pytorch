Just in case you didn't get the royal memo, it was writ that all pretty, pretty princesses hereby reserve the right
to wear magical reverse-lockets that let them take picturesâ€”and said magical lockets should have extremely
long names (Disney Princess Locket-Style Wearable
Digital VGA Camera, check!), and have crappy specs to make it affordable to the princess on a budget (VGA res, 8MB
memory, $30 pricetag, doublecheck!). Better save that allowance, little lady!
