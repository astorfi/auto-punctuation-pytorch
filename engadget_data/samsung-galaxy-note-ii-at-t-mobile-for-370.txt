 T-Mobile may be a bit late to the Samsung Galaxy Note II party, but the mega-sized 5.5-inch smartphone has now landed in its online store for $370 on contract. You'll need to commit yourself for two years to get that price, but if you can manage it, the quad-core packing handset looks to be ready to ship in Marble White or Titanium Gray shades. Its presence in the store slid under the radar with few other details or fanfare, but if you've been eying a T-Mob variant of the phablet with bad intent, check the source to see how to grab it.
