Despite Microsoft's enthusiasm for its next-generation console, one important piece was missing from its Xbox One announcement last month: the console's price. Luckily, the company's E3 press event presented the firm with the perfect time to remedy the mistake: the Xbox One will sell for $499 in the US, 499 euros in Europe, and Â£429 in the UK when it launches this November. The console will be rolling out to 21 countries in all, so let the countdown to launch day begin!
