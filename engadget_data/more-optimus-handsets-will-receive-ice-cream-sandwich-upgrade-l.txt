LG revealed the news today in a Facebook post, specifying that the Optimus Black, Optimus 3D and Optimus LTE will all receive updates to Google's latest OS, along with the previously announced Optimus 2X. The company also said that it's "continuing to evaluate the ICS OS to determine whether it is compatible with the functionality, features and performance of other LG smartphones," adding that it hopes to bring the update to as many devices as possible. LG hasn't provided any concrete timeline for the rollout, though it expects to publish more details next month. As always, we'll be sure to keep you posted.
