AT&T's swiftly sped past its "coming soon" announcement for Sammy's heralded handset, now giving us a firm release date of October 2nd for its NFC-enabled variant. You can snag the 4.3-incher when it hits the carrier for $199.99 on a two-year contract, and choose from the usual array of data packages -- with $15/mo being the minimum required. Make sure to enter your deets at the source link below so you'll be first in line for this sure-fire, sell-out device.
