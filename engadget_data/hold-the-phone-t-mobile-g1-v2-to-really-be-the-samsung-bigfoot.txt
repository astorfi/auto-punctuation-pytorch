Mobile-review just published this shot of a Samsung Bigfoot with a slider QWERTY keyboard, and we've got to say, it looks a hell of a lot more like the device in that leaked T-Mobile roadmap than that rendered Moto unit. (It also looks a lot like the Samsung Beat DJ, but that's neither here nor there.) Not only that, but there's also an early spec sheet and another image of a candybar set called the Spica -- apart from the slider, Bigfoot and Spica are nearly identical lower-end versions of the I7500, with three-inch screens, three megapixel cameras, and Android 2.0 "Donut" preloaded. That certainly throws a monkey wrench into what we had thought was a neatly-tied little bow, but we've got to say we're stoked to see so many Android sets appearing all at once. Now if someone could just tell us when and where these would ship, we'd be all set. Spec sheet after the break.[Via Unwired View]
