 In a surprisingly rare occurrence these days, DirecTV has a new HD channel to announce, now that it's carrying WAMI / Telefutura in the Miami area. Unfortunately, if you're a primarily English speaking customer there's not much to report, and according to a recent interview with Multichannel News, DirecTV thinks that's just fine. Executive VP Derek Chang told the site that after cracking 100 channels it became "more about the overall experience" (unless that experience is a new DirecTiVo) and that everyone has most of the important stuff in HD. Of course, we know from some of our readers comments that missing AMC, BBC America and more is leaving some of "the important stuff" out. That sounds like poll time to us, so whether you're DirecTV subscriber or not, pick one of the options below and let us know how you feel about their channel lineup.
