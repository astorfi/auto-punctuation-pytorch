 NVIDIA might be on a big GPUs-as-CPUs kick right now, but rumors of the company developing a straight-up x86-compatible CPU are as old as the hills, and it looks like they're back for another round. This time it's the Inquirer doing the mongering, with whispers of a release at Nvision next week -- we've got to say that we doubt it, especially given how much trash NVIDIA's talked about Intel and Intel CPUs recently, but we'll certainly be watching this one.
