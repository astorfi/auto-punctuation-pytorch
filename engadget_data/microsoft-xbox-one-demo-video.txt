With only two weeks until the Xbox One hits the shelves, Microsoft's marketing blitz continues with a 12-minute video demonstration of its next-gen console in action. Xbox executives Yusuf Mehdi and Marc Whitten highlight some of Kinect's new features, showing how users can switch to their personalized dashboard using just their voice, or use its 1080p camera to engage in a live Skype video call. We're also treated to some real-world examples of the Xbox One's snappy multitasking features, which we first saw in the "Meet Xbox One" video late last month, reinforcing the speed at which the system can switch between the dashboard and a paused game (in this case Forza Motorsport 5). These features, of course, are just a few of the several fascinating abilities we got to witness this week -- you can digest it all right here.
