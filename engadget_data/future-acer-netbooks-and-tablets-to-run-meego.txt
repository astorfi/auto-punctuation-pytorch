 
Intel's just released its Computex press release, which beyond detailing its new Oak Trail and Canoe Lake platforms, reveals that Acer is about to take a bite out of MeeGo. Acer CEO Gianfranco Lanci is quoted saying that the company plans to run MeeGo on its future Atom-based tablets and netbooks. There's no word on using the Intel / Nokia OS on its phones, but we'll be keeping an ear to the ground on that. It's pretty ironic, huh, that Acer was rumored to launch Chrome OS netbooks at the show, but now we're hearing of this MeeGo love affair. Full Intel press release is after the break.

Intel announced a processor and MeeGo* software win with Chinese carmaker HawTai Automobile for a future in-vehicle-infotainment platform; a greater than 50-times lower platform idle power reduction with Intel's next generation Atom(TM) processor platform for handheld devices including smartphones; and a collaboration with Google*, Sony* and Logitech* to deliver a new Smart TVs experience powered by Intel Atom(TM) CE products and running Android*-based Google TV*.Intel recently unveiled the future System on Chip (SoC) Atom(TM)-based "Tunnel Creek" that, for the first time, will allow other companies to connect their own custom silicon to Intel's SoC product. The Intel(R) Atom(TM) processor also powers the Intel(R) Reader, and the company has received more than 3,000 non-PC design inquiries -- most new-to-Intel potential customers -- ranging from fish finders to golf carts.During his keynote, David (Dadi) Perlmutter, executive vice president and co-general manager, Intel Architecture Group, touched on these and other Intel efforts, which included showing off the world's thinnest netbook running on the upcoming mobile dual-core "Pine Trail." At just 14mm, the razor-thin "Canoe Lake" innovation platform runs cooler and is 50 percent thinner than any other netbook consumers can find on the market today. In addition, Perlmutter showed a range of other Intel(R) Atom(TM)-based devices spanning energy efficient blade servers, retailing systems, presentation projectors and multiple tablets."Intel believes the strength of the Atom(TM) franchise can help consumers realize the true potential for a common experience to enable the compute continuum," said Perlmutter. "With platforms ranging from compact and portable netbooks, to Smart TV experiences and innovative tablets designs, Intel Architecture is driving innovative products based on a unique 'port of choice' software strategy."Keynote HighlightsCiting a million PCs sold a day(1), Perlmutter also highlighted the momentum around the all new 2010 Intel(R) Core(TM) processor family, including Intel(R) Wireless Display and an overview of next-generation Intel(R) Core(TM) processors using the Intel microarchitecture codenamed "Sandy Bridge," targeted to be in production late 2010.Renee James, senior vice president and general manager of the Software and Services Group at Intel, joined Perlmutter onstage to discuss how software -- and software choice -- will help drive Intel's vision for Atom(TM) and a cross-device experience. This provides consumers consistency and accessibility to their content on a choice of computers and PC-like devices. James also announced that Asus will be the first OEM to ship a pre-installed, customized AppUp client called "asus app store" on netbooks this fall, beginning with Windows and following with MeeGo*-based systems.Acer CEO Gianfranco Lanci discussed with Perlmutter how future Intel(R) Atom(TM)-based netbooks and tablets from Acer, running the MeeGo* software platform, will foster an open ecosystem of innovation."Acer will be ready with MeeGo-based mobile devices," said Lanci. "MeeGo's open software platform will present our customers with another choice of a friendly, easy-to-use operating system. We are pleased to collaborate with Intel in our continuous drive to provide effortless technologies that empower people at work, home - anytime, anywhere."New Intel(R) Atom(TM) Processors on TapIn production now and on shelves before the winter holiday season, mobile dual-core Intel(R) Atom(TM) processors will deliver a noticeably snappier, more responsive consumer experience in the same compact form factors, and with the same great battery life. Intel(R) Atom(TM) processors N455 and N475 with DDR3 support for netbooks are available today and D525 and D425 for entry-level desktop PCs are expected to be available on June 21. Available to customers in early 2011, "Oak Trail" is our upcoming SoC Intel(R) Atom(TM) platform optimized for sleek tablet and netbook designs, delivering up to a 50 percent reduction in average power consumption with full HD-video playback and targeting software choice including MeeGo*, Windows* 7 and Google operating systems.About IntelIntel /quotes/comstock/15*!intc/quotes/nls/intc (INTC 21.42, -0.34, -1.56%) is a world leader in computing innovation.
