 So, has anyone been having issues with their HD DVD players. There are only two of them out there, the Toshiba HD-A1 and HD-XA1 and they both seem to be having "issues." Most of the problems have involved freezing up during the movie. To solve this, a user would have to hit pause in order for the audio and video to sync back up. It seems that this happens on every movie and sometimes more then once. The bad units seem to have a common thread however; all seem to have been made in March. Are any of our readers experiencing this?
