The glasses are lightweight and could still be worn comfortably over our thick-rimmed specs. We first tried Tomb Raider: Underworld to largely mediocre results, but Mirror's Edge and Left 4 Dead really shined. When we took a step back to watch two screens, however, they couldn't decide which display to sync up with and the flickering lenses managed to numb our brain. A surprisingly good experience, sure, but we can't imagine paying upwards of four benjamins for these and a compatible monitor. If you're wondering what the screen looks like without the eye wear, check out the video after the break.
