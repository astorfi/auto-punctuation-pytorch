Separately, they've also announced a new version of their Java-based Google Maps Mobile app that adds support for live traffic and saving favorite locations. We've tried the new release, and yeah, it's gorgeous -- Moto bundling or not, Yahoo's got some catch-up to play.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
