Dude, every kid's dream day has just arrived: the Redlands, Calif., school district is in the process of designing
an "exertainment center" to combat growing levels of obesity by using workout games like Dance Dance Revolution and
EyeToy: Play as part of the physical education curriculum. They're working with local health care facilities to design
the center and raise money to install Sony PlayStation units in at least one of the district's elementary schools,
incorporating five to seven different stations to handle classes of 35 students as they game their way into better
fitness. We can't even tell you how gypped we feel right now about all those youthful hours we endured playing capture
the flag.
