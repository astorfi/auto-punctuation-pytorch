 Norwegian camera siteFotografi.no has posted some pics of a camera the site claims is Canon's next DSLR, the 35D. The pics are significantlysharper than last month's images, courtesyof a Chinese site, that purported to show a camera referred to as the 30D, and look like professional product shots.According to Fotografi.no, the camera is due to be announced at a Canon press conference in Oslo on February 21, and isexpected to be a 10 megapixel model. We weren't aware that Oslo was the center of the photographic universe, so we'renot sure why Canon's press conference is being held there, especially since PMA is just a few days later in OrangeCounty (which isn't the center of the photographic universe either, but will be for a few days). We'll reserve judgmentfor now, and will resist all temptation to lump the Norwegian press conference invitation in with other interestinginvitations we've seen recently. [Thanks, Frank]
