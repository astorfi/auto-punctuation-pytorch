This should one day soon open the door to the creating functional human body parts using DNA-injected 'ink.' The team at the Computational Synthesis Laboratory, led by Hod Lipson, are now testing the printer as a way to crank out synthetic heart valves. Check out the ear being synthesized in the video after the break.
