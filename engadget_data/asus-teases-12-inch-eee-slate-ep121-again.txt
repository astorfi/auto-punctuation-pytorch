That changes today as ASUS Chairman, Jonney Shih, promises an "Eee for everyone" at CES 2011 -- and that's not an exaggeration what with 7-, 9-, 10-, and 12-inch Armdroid and Wintel tablets expected. While the video doesn't show the physical EP121 first revealed as a prototype in Taipei, it does call it an "Eee Slate" (not an "Eee Pad" like before) while demonstrating pen-based input on the multitouch display riding Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system and a Core i5 processor. Naturally, ASUS is also promising better performance and more flexibility than existing tablets. Don't worry, we'll be getting hands-on with this beast in a few weeks before it hits retail sometime (somewhere) in January. Until then, you can watch the teaser after the break.

Update: DigiTimes claims that the EP121 will target enterprise customers when launched. Additionally, two 10-inch Eee Pads (one with Windows 7 on Oak Trail and one with Android on Tegra 2) will hit retail as early as March for $499 to $599. Meanwhile, 7-inch Android models will also launch as early as March featuring either Tegra 2 or Qualcomm chipsets with at least one model featuring a "3.5G" radio for "phone functionality."
