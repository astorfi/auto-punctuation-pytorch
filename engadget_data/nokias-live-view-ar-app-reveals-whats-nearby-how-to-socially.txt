Nokia's got you covered with its Live View AR app. The most recent hatchling from Espoo's Beta Labs program brings selectable POI overlays to the camera inputs of a N8, C7 or E7. The Finnish firm also highlights the release's tight integration with Ovi Maps, with deep hooks for turn-by-turn navigation and sharing -- allowing you to spam friends as to your future whereabouts via SMS. Interest piqued? A video demoing the application and an interesting way to calibrate a compass awaits you beyond the fold.
