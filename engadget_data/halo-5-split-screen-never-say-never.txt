Halo 5: Guardians doesn't have split-screen cooperative play. This is a drastic shift for the series -- every console Halo game has featured local co-op, including the recently released Halo: Master Chief Collection, a bundle of the franchise's major titles. Plenty of longtime Halo fans have hit Twitter with messages ranging from disappointment to some that promise to cancel their Halo 5 pre-orders. Microsoft doesn't have any plans to launch the game with split-screen, but in a world of constantly updating consoles and streams of downloadable content, there's a sliver of hope for couch co-op fans, according to Microsoft General Manager of Games Publishing Shannon Loftis.



"Well, we do listen to gamers," Loftis says during a meeting at E3. "The priority feature for the release of Halo 5 was 60FPS, so that's what the team has been focused on delivering. But, you know, never say never. The glorious thing about Halo and about Xbox is that we can deliver continuous improvements to any experience. But, no announcements being made here."

To reiterate: Loftis did not announce the implementation of split-screen co-op in Halo 5, but the possibility is there post-launch. If Microsoft developers are listening to Halo players, here's a sampling of the feedback they're getting:

@Halo BRING BACK SPLIT SCREEN PLEASE I WANT TO PLAY WITH MY BROTHER BECAUSE I DONT HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY 2 XBOXES!

— Tim Fry (@_Kyabetsu) June 17, 2015So there won't be local split-screen co-op in Halo 5... But... But why? You are breaking my heart 343. My best and dearest moments (cont.)
