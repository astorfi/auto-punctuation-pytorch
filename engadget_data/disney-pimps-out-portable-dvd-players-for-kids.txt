Well, we suppose if all the kids already
have cellphones, and they're getting hooked up with
mobile TV, they may as well all get
personal video players as well — and we'll
give ya one big fat guess who's gonna give it to them. Disney is tricking out some DVD players with character-themed
designs, like lovely little Miss Disney Princess above, Power Rangers (peep after the jump), and, of course, good ol'
Mickey. The devices can play DVDs, CDs and MP3s plus, by popular demand from all the under age 9 focus groups polled,
the ability to display digital photos (what, all these kids have digital cameras now, too? We can't keep up!). The
models with 3.5-inch screens will go for $129.99, with a 7-inch clamshell model for $199.99. Even adjusting our
allowances from back in the day for inflation, we can only imagine Disney's reaching a long arm right around into
parents' pocketbooks with this kind of stuff — just think what kind of nest egg good ol' Walt will be tapping into once
he's woken from cryogenic slumber.
