Apple and Starbucks are partnering to bring you that lame sauce song playing way too loudly over your local Starbucks's soundsystem. When you're in a Starbucks T-Mobile hotspot, an icon will pop up on the iTunes WiFi Music Store that allows you to purchase that track from a playlist of recently played songs in that store. You also get free WiFi access to the iTunes Music Store -- not quite as great as full-on free WiFi, but we'll take what we can get.
