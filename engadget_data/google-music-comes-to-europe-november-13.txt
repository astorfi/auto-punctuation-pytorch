 Folks may be more excited about the newest Nexus phones, tablets and their fresh flavor of Jelly Bean, but Mountain View also unveiled a little something for music lovers across the pond today. That's right, Google Music is coming to Europe beginning November 13th. Unfortunately, not everyone on the continent will gain access, but residents of the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain will have Google's musical cloud services in just a couple weeks. Not only that, Big G is adding an iTunes Match-style feature to Google Music that'll scan your songs and add them to your cloud library, no uploading required. The feature will launch in Europe, with US residents enjoying the feature "soon after."
