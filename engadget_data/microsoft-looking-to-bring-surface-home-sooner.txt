The initial plan called for consumer-grade Surface products to, uh, surface in five years, but the demand for the tech is so high Ballmer said Microsoft is going to "follow our nose" and get it out ASAP. When that actually might be, we still don't know, but hey -- it's not like we're getting tired of that Big-Ass Table video anytime soon.[Via The Raw Feed]
