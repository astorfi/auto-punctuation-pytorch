 Here's something you probably didn't expect: a compact Sony camera with a full-frame sensor. While Photoprice.ca was uncovering a treasure trove of leaked press shots that include the Alpha A99 and NEX-6, it also came across images of the RX1, whose body looks borderline pocketable yet stuffs in the same kind of sensor (and likely image quality) you'd normally reserve for pro-grade models. Several extra details reveal themselves right from the start. The RX1 is carrying a 35mm, f/2.0 lens with no apparent button to detach the lens -- the included glass is probably as good as it'll get. However, the RX1 is most definitely tuned for experienced shooters, with a toggle for macro focusing as well as dedicated controls for aperture and exposure compensation. We're also liking that there's a pop-up flash, a standard hot shoe for accessories and three custom settings on the mode dial. The slip doesn't include mention of a release date or a price, but talk during the A99 slip mentioned a September 12th unveiling that wouldn't shock us if it included multiple cameras -- and we would be equally unsurprised if the RX1 carried the same high price commonly associated with other full-frame bodies.
