Not exactly --- shall we say -- expected. Regardless, T-Pain was most definitely in the house, primarily to showcase his newest $39.99 accessory, the I Am T-Pain microphone. For all intents and purposes, this here mic is your dream come true, enabling you to sing into it and hear it emitted back with a "T-Pain Effect" embedded. In other words, it's your autotune instrument of choice. There's a bit of inbuilt memory as well, enabling users to record clips for future hysteria, while also giving them the chance to blend in T-Pain remarks as they rap and offload their favorite clips to their PC. It's absurd in every sense of the word, making it impossible to pass up. If that makes any sense. Head on past the break for an interview with the man himself, courtesy of our pals over at TUAW.
