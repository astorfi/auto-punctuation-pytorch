That's interesting in and of itself, but together with this morning's whispers of Apple's tablet coming early next year and past talk of an Apple / VZW partnership, and the tale gets exponentially more intriguing. As TC suggests, a tablet lacking voice service on the LTE network wouldn't violate AT&T's not-at-all permanent exclusivity. Its source said there was one LTE device, not a wireless card, that this early launch was being "specifically geared towards," but even if so, that could apply to any number of other non-Apple gadgets (from Nokia, perhaps?). Of course, much of this is rumor built on rumor, so no matter how well these pieces might seem to fall in place -- or how potentially awesome the idea might seem -- there's a large grain of salt you should be taking with you.
