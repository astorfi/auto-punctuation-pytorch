Looks like Sony's finally hopped on the biometrics bandwagon with their businessy new 4:3 Vaio BX series
(VGN-BX90PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6) which in addition to their groundbreaking new support of SD, will feature a
Pentium M 780 (2.26GHz) CPU, 14.1-inch SXGA+ (1400 x 1040) display with "privacy filter," dual-layer DVD burner,
FeliCa, Bluetooth 2.0, built-in webcam (ahh, takes
us back to the TR series!), and, of course, WiFi b/g. Also interesting is their addition of a touchpoint (you know, the
eraser head between G/H/B), a modular drive bay, and a TPM chip for all you Fritz lovers.
