We definitely wanted PMP, cellphone, and watch displays with rapid response time, exceptional contrast, and a high volume of color. Fast forward two years: word is this stuff is finally ready to hit the market and designers can now order custom-made equipment for their devices. There's an animation on Liquavista's website that promises some radically hip stuff, and we're looking forward to that, but so far we feel a bit let down by these images of mostly-static watches whose main claim to fame is colors. Get crackin', designers: we want to see those sunlight-viewable video displays and hip-hoppin' PMP visualizers in the non-cartoon world ASAP.[Via core77]Read - Press releaseRead - Official website with demo animation
