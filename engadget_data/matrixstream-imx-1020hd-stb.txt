They're definitely ahead ofthe curve because so few HDTVs can currently accept a 1080p signal and even fewer, as in zero, networks arebroadcasting in 1080p. Don't sell the IMX 1020HD short, however. It's really geared towards 1080i and 1080p video overbroadband and already know from our HD Trailer Tuesdayseries that the 1080p videos look stellar. MatrixStream uses H.264 (or MPEG-4, Part 10) compression to keep thepicture quality up and the file size & bandwidth required down. Trials of the new 1080p set-top box start thismonth and a consumer roll-out is slated for the end of Q1. Hey, MatrixStream: we've got broadband and a space next toour HD set if you're interested!If you want to catch a video of the Mac mini-looking device in action,flush your broadband pipes and grab the 70MB WMV filehere. Ironically, the video is 640 x 480, but we forgive 'em. The VOD functionality looks really snappy in thedemo.
