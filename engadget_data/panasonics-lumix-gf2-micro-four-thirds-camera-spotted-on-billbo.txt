Just days after hearing that Panasonic's newest Micro Four Thirds camera was on the way later this week, along comes this -- an event poster in Paris that leaves little doubt about what's to come. As the story goes, this shot was taken over in France, and it's detailing an event that'll actually take place tomorrow. If we had to guess, we'd say the world's smallest mirrorless camera kit will be officially unveiled within the next 24 hours. We mean, wouldn't you?
