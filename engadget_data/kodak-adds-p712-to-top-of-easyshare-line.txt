With a suggested retail price of $499, the shooter strikes quite the bargain for its price range, with 12x optical zoom, optical image stabilisation, speedy auto-focus and a 0.07 click-to-capture rate. Kodak has also included a 2.5-inch LCD and a hot shoe, along with 30 fps VGA video capture and RAW support. The P712 should be shipping worldwide this July.[Via DP Review; thanks Justin]
