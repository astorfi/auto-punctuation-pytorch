 The FiOS fun just isn't in Florida anymore. Those three new HD stations that randomly appeared on some people's lineup are now nationwide. The addition of HGTV, Food Network, and LMN (Lifetime Movie Network) brings their HD lineup to a boastful 27 stations. While Comcast and TWC are turning off their analog streams to make theoretical room for new HD stations, and ticking off more than just a few people by doing so, Verizon is slowly but surely adding national high-def stations. Fiber-optic has quite a bit of room thanks to a totally digital stream but unfortunately, it's not available everywhere just yet.
