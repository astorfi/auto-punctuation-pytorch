And, sure enough, the company's computers tend to be fairly upscale models, with featurestargeting gamers. The company's latest, the Axen X-1 laptop includes a mammoth 19-inch display, dual NVIDIA 7800 GTX GoGPUs, an AMD Turion at speeds of up to 2.2 GHz, dual-layer burner, 7200 RPM hard drive, and up to 2GB of RAM. Of course,you'll pay over $4,000 for all that large-screen, desktop-level performance, and we doubt it's very portable either.But, hey, we hear SavRow's throwing in a second pair of pants with each purchase.Update:It looks like someone in China or Taiwan is getting busy with 19-inch laptops.Â  A company called Eurocom is alsocoming out with a 19-incher called the M590K Emperor, with verysimilar specs to this one. While we can't be 100% certain they're the same computer, it does seem that the SavRow unitisn't quite as "bespoke" as the company claims.
