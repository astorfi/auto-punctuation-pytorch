Cue Google, who's just added a database of EV -- that's electric vehicle for you non-green folk -- charging stations to Google Maps, enabling drivers to locate places to get their juice on while on longer trips or when out of town (though without the social flare of PlugShare). We've gotta say, a future of self-driving cars that can automatically charge themselves doesn't sound too bad to us -- and spending less on gas only makes the deal even sweeter.
