LG's VX9800 multimedia/communicator cellphone
just got one of the highest forms of praise possible by a reviewer: Mobile Tech Review's editor-in-chief, Lisa Gade
bought the phone herself after reviewing it. Not much of a surprise, then, that MTR gives the VX9800 five out of five
stars and their Editor's Choice designation; the only real fault they can find with the phone itself is that the
speakerphone doesn't work with the clamshell closed. That being said, everything else about this
slightly-bulky-but-attractive transformer seems to work great, with the MP3 player rockin' (even through the speakers),
the 1.3 megapixel camera snapping impressive pics, and the lighted keyboard a "joy to use." Throw in Bluetooth (no
A2DP, though), EV-DO (no built in email client,
though), and a 3-day-under-heavy-usage battery life (not swappable, though), and we're kind of tempted to cheat on our
Treo and snatch one up ourselves. Well, kinda.


Update: Battery seems to be swappable after all. Even better.
