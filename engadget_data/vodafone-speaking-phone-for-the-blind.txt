Vodafone Italia is showcasing their Speaking Phones for the blind at the exhibition for technologies capable of
improving the lives of disabled persons - or more affectionately know as Dishow (Dishow in da Hizhouse!). But it's not
the hardware that's special as many Symbian-based Nokia Series 60 phones can be converted to Speaking Phones. Special
software allows the Speaking Phone to identify and describe the menu icons and text messages to the blind user and also
allows them to compose and send their own messages. While this is still in trial phase in Italy, it has already been
released in the UK and South Africa with more European countries coming later this year. In the UK, Speaking Phones can
be ordered at any UK Vodafone store and can be demoed at selected stores and at the RNIB (if you have to ask, you don't
need this phone) Resource Center in London.
