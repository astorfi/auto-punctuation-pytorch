 Alright, so maybe our man in Japan beat us to the punch this weekend with an unboxing of the Japanese retail version PS3, but whatevs, we've got an unboxing of the North American retail version right here for ya. Click on for all the love.
      

 

We didn't have the guts to find out what happens if you don't remove stuff from the box in the proper order. Wait for it!Not pictured is the HDMI cable Sony was kind enough to throw in. Guess if you're reviewing this thing they wouldn't want you to have to hunt for a cable yourself.Yup, shiny as hell!
