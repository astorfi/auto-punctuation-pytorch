 Sure, Microsoft has already delivered its new Windows Phone 8 OS to the masses, but the WP7.8 release details, on the other hand, have been extremely minimal since we learned about the upgrade earlier this year. Well, according to Microsoft's Greater China Vice President, Windows Phone 7.8 will be hitting the Chinese market in the coming weeks, adding that there's an honest belief both numerical versions (maybe more?) of Redmond's mobile OS could easily live alongside each other in this country. Still, in the "coming weeks" could mean anything, although rumors around the web suggest the 7.8 version could make its official debut as early as next month -- which goes perfectly on par with previous whispers of an eventual launch by the end of 2012. We'll have to wait and see.
