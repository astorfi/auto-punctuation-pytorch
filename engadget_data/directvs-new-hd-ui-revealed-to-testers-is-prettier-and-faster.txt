It's the HD UI that was mentioned during the last earnings call, and brings not only fully 16x9 formatted graphics but also, according to testers, a serious performance boost to satellite receivers. If you're in the test group restart your box and punch 0,2,4,6,8 to snag the new software and have a look for yourself, but if you're on the outside looking in hit the source link for one of DBSTalk's typical thorough walkthrough PDFs.
