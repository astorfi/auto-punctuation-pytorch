The folks at Laptop Mag got their lucky paws on Sony's latest 3G ultraportable, and were more than pleased with the results. Housing a 1.2GHz Intel Core Solo processor, 1GB of RAM, 80GB 4200RPM hard drive, dual-layer DVD burner, Intel's GMA950 integrated graphics set, and an 11.1-inch 1,366 x 768 resolution LCD, reviewers were thrilled with the decent performance and exceptionally long "8 hours, 32 minutes" of battery life they realized in testing. Both the design and long list of ammenties were greatly appreciaited, but the wee keyboard and (unsurprisingly) high pricetag were complained about. The "star attraction," as it was so aptly called, delivered a very impressive "average throughput of 768Kbps," with peaks as "high as 1Mbps." They did note that upload speeds were a tad slow, but they hope that Sprint's continued rollout of Rev A technology will help the issue resolve itself. Overall, it came "pretty close to being the ultimate ultraportable," and should suit just about anyone with deep enough pockets quite well.
