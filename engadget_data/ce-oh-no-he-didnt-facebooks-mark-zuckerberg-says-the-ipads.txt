Responding to a question about a possible Facebook iPad app, Zuckerberg shot back by saying that "the iPad's not mobile... it's a computer." Of course, he did quickly clarify that he didn't mean to be rude to Apple, and added that "we all love Apple products," the iPad just "isn't mobile in the same way."
