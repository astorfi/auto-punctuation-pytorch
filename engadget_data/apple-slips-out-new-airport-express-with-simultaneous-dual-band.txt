The new pocket WiFi router has a reworked design -- not unlike a white Apple TV -- as well as newfound support for simultaneous dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless. That's certainly good news if you want separate public and private hotspots when you're online at the hotel. The audio-out jack and USB 2.0 port are still there to share your sound or printing, and there's an extra Ethernet jack to feed wired devices. It's available now, and the $99 asking price certainly hits a sweet spot.
