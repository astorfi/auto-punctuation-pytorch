 Annoyed that YouTube had reached Freesat boxes and not just TiVo? Worry not, for Sir Richard and his chums at Virgin Media are on their way with a basket of soothing balms. Your DVR's EPG will soon feature baked-in YouTube results along with regular TV listings, giving easier access to all of those shudder-inducing Harlem Shake videos without resorting to a smartphone. It's been positioned at Channel 198, and you can also access it via the Search and Browse menus on your box -- no matter the paint job.

   UK's first integration of YouTube content app into channel listings  Gives customers widest choice in how to access content  Channel 198 now home to world's most popular online video community

  Virgin Media has today created a channel for YouTube in its Electronic Programme Guide (EPG), enabling Virgin Media TiVo® customers to access the video community's online content from listings that have until now been available only to traditional linear broadcast channels.

   YouTube is the first app to be included in a TV guide and is available from today to all Virgin Media TiVo customers. In addition, Virgin Media has integrated YouTube clips and channels more deeply in TiVo's 'My Shows' and 'Search and Browse' areas, giving viewers the widest choice in how to access entertainment. The app is free to access and can be launched by scrolling through the channel listings and selecting number 198.

   Peter Chapman, associate director of content acquisition at Virgin Media said: "As the first and fastest growing next generation TV service, Virgin Media TiVo is transforming the way we watch television. The distinction between different types of entertainment – from channel schedules to On Demand TV, from linear broadcasts to online content – is blurring all the time. By giving YouTube a place in our channel listings we're breaking the mould of the traditional EPG and giving our customers even more choice in how they can watch the great content on our platform."

   Francisco Varela, Global Director Platform Partnerships at YouTube said: "We're always looking for new ways to bring the exciting content generated by our creator community to viewers and are delighted that the YouTube app now has a place in Virgin Media's channel listings."

   As the world's most popular online video community, YouTube enables millions of people to discover, watch and share originally-created videos. In addition to being available through Virgin Media's TV guide, the YouTube app can be found within the 'Apps and Games', 'My Shows' and 'Search & Browse' areas on Virgin Media TiVo. YouTube search results are even instantly available on every programme information page as bonus features, allowing viewers to easily become immersed in bloopers, fandom content and more, all directly related to the show they're interested in.
