Announced today via the company's Beta Labs site, Nokia Xpress leverages the cloud to compress internet data up to 85 percent, help users keep tabs on their consumption habits and even reformats favorited sites into a magazine-like layout. The Windows Phone app also enables users to make "smart searches" for content across Bing and YouTube with a simple tap of a selected term, as well as translate the contents of a foreign language page easily from the settings menu. Unfortunately, the app isn't yet available on the Marketplace, so for the time being, you'll have to download it direct from the source below.
