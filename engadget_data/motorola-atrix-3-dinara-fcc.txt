Going undercover as the MB886, it sports the proper LTE bands for AT&T and even uses the same model naming convention as its two predecessors. Naturally we don't get much more information than the usual measurements and radios (of which include HSPA+ / WCDMA 850 / 1900 as well as quad-band EDGE), but the phone is rumored to include an LTE-friendly Snapdragon S4 processor and a 720p display.
