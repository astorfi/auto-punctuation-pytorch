As you may recall, they did come back in stock for a short time, but HP tells us that limited supply has dried up and that there are no plans right now to restock the inventory. In fact, a HP representative was pretty explicit in saying that the high-resolution panel won't be returning to the 14.5-inch Envy. We're sorry we don't have better news for you or a fresh pack of tissues to help dry your tears, but hey, we guess there's always the larger 17-inch model with its full 1080p panel.
