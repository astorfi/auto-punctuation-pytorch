This is still just a concept demo, but it is a working demo: DSpeak is basically Voice over IP calling using the
wireless capabilities of the Nintendo
DS. Using a connected headphone/microphone, DSpeak allows you to hold conversations with other DS users via WiFi,
and the audio quality is reportedly "perfectly fine, as good as a mobile phone." Plus, you get little Mario and Wario
icons moving their mouths when you speak — come on,
Vonage, how you gonna beat that? The software
itself will be available as a free download, and the booth boy told us that they'll be including headsets with
DSpeak-compatible games (the headset will probably also be available for sale separately for some nominal fee).
Otherwise that's about all we know—we couldn't squeeze a release date out of them, and no one at the Nintendo booth
knew a damn thing about the actual technology they were demoing.
