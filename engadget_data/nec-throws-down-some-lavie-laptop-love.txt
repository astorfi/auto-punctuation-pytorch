NEC's new Turion 64 X2 laptops manage 15.4-inch 1,280 x 800 displays, ATI Radeon Xpress 1100 integrated graphics and dual-layer DVD burning across the board. There's also Firewire, four USB 2.0 ports, a PC card slot, multi-card reader, gigabit Ethernet and 802.11a/b/g WiFi. The Lavie L line tops out with the 210,000 Yen (around $1,819 USD) LL590/GG, which includes a 100GB HDD, 768MB of RAM (2GB max) and WMCE '05, powered by an AirTV external TV tuner. Two other lower-end configurations are available, along with a 125,000 Yen ($1,082) build-to-order LaVie G type L option. The biggest downside of all this seems to be the lame 1.9 hour battery life, though the 1.5-inches of thickness and 6.8 pound heft are close contenders. Maybe we'll keep our anti-The Man tendencies in check for the time being.
