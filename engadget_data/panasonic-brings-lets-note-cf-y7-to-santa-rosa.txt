Not wanting to feel left out of the mad Santa Rosa rush we've seen over the last few days, Panasonic has introduced its first Let's Note model to sport Intel's new chipset, the CF-Y7. This 14.1-inch upgrade features a 1,400 x 1,050 display, 1.4GHz Core 2 Duo L7300, 1GB of RAM, four-flavor WiFi, and a super multi drive, and ships with Windows Vista Business. Also on board are an 80GB hard drive, SD reader, and a claimed 7.5-hour battery, but only a PCMCIA slot instead of the preferred ExpressCard. Hitting Japan on May 18th -- and possible the US as a Toughbook in the future -- the Y7 is expected to go for around Â¥275,000 ($2,227).
