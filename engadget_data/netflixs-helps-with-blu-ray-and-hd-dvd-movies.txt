 Hacking Netflix has stumbled across something rather cool. Apparently there is an option someplace in your preferences that allows for your high definition settings. For instance: if you set HD DVD as your first choice, Netflix will send you your next movie on HD DVD if it is available. Better yet, you can set a second and third option giving you the option of Blu-ray and normal DVDs. We couldn't find this option in our Netflix preferences so if this is true, this is a cool little option.
