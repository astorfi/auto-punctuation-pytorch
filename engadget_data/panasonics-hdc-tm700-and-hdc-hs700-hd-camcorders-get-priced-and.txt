       
Spring has arrived here in the States, which means that nearly every single one of those camcorders introduced at CES this year will be shipping out in time for you to capture Little Billy's summer league baseball, Tiny Tom's first dip in the ocean and Merry Maggie's (eighth) wedding ceremony. Included in that bunch is Panasonic, which has informed us that its HDC-TM700 and HDC-HS700 1080p 3MOS camcorders will be available in the middle of next month (that's April, for those without a Gregorian calendar nearby) for $999.95 and $1,399.95, respectively. You know capturing Bashful Brad's Bar Mitzvah in the finest of quality is worth it.
