 Sony has announced that it's now sold over 70 million PlayStation 3 consoles -- matching the number of Xboxes sold according to Microsoft's latest financial report. Direct from the Japanese console maker, it also revealed that more than 15 million PlayStation Move motion controllers have been sold since its launch over two years ago. Meanwhile, the slightly aging (but constantly tweaked) base console is now approaching its sixth birthday, but there's no word yet on its hardware successor, with Sony preferring to focus on new connectivity features between the PS3 and its handheld relative.

The Instant Game Collection enables PS Plus members to enjoy popular titles from third party developers and publishers as well as SCE Worldwide Studios at no extra cost. SCE has also enhanced the content offering for PS Plus members in Japan in November.

    PS3® has gained tremendous support from 3rd party developers and publishers worldwide.
