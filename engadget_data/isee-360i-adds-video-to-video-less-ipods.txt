 Still a little peevedthat Apple added video the iPod just a few months after you snapped up an earlier model? Yeah, well ATO is introducing aportable dock called the iSee 360i (got enough "i's" in there?) that'll let most 4th generation iPods, theiPod mini, and even the iPod nano go toe-to-toe with those new video-enabled iPods (basically by taking advantage ofthe earlier iPods' mass storage capabilties to store video files -- Nyko's iPod Movie Player does pretty much thesame thing). The 3.6-inch, 320 x 240 pixel LCD of the iSee 360i isn't exactly massively bigger than the 2.5-inchdisplay of the current iPod, but when you're talking about tiny screens for watching video, every inch counts, right?No mention of which codecs are supported, but the iSee 360i does have direct line-in video recording and a battery lifeof 4 hours, which is double what you'll get with the 30GB iPod. Should start shipping this quarter with a retail priceof $249.
