Sony Pictures has announced that it won't downsample Blu-ray output for analog sets,which don't support HDMI. That means you'll be able to watch full-res output if you hook up your Blu-ray player to yourold display, rather than the 960x540 that could be outputted using the Image Constraint Token. While we're a littlesurprised that Sony would actually come out and do something so consumer-friendly, we're not that shocked.After all, the number of people with analog HD sets is relatively small compared to the overall market, Sony's piracyconcerns have to do with digital copying, and, of course, Sony's in a battle for market share, and if this isa way to win a few more customers over to the Blu-ray camp, they're gonna do it.
