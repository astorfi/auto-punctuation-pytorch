Strike the lawsuit between Cox Communications and DirecTV from the list, however -- it's been settled. At the heart of the matter is Cox's attempt to "recast" the findings of a Comcast-commissioned survey showing Comcast picture quality was preferred over both DirecTV and DISH. Since the lawsuit was initiated, Cox has removed all references to the survey from its website, which now the only cites "no ugly dish or extra equipment to buy" as an advantage of Cox cable over satellite HDTV. Other terms of the settlement are, ahem, confidential.
