These latest examples come courtesy of Chinese case retailer X-Doria, and include a case for what appears to be a 4th-gen iPod touch with a camera, and one that's described as a case for a "nano 6G," but could seemingly also be for a new iPod shuffle with a touchscreen. Of particular note, the apparent iPod touch case seems to reveal a curved back more similar to the current model than the iPhone 4, while the nano / shuffle case looks to be a near perfect match for that 1.7-inch Apple touchscreen that mysteriously turned up in Taiwan last month. What does it all mean? There's less than a week until we know for sure.
