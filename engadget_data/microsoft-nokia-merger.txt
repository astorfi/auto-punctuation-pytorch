Let the wedding bells ring! Microsoft announced this morning that it finally has something we've been curious about since September: the actual date the company will complete its proposed acquisition of Nokia's devices and services business. In a blog post, Microsoft's General Counsel Brad Smith explained that all of the legal hurdles have been cleared and that the merger will officially take place this Friday, April 25th. "We look forward to introducing the next billion customers to Microsoft services via Nokia mobile phones," Smith said.


Microsoft will manage the Nokia.com domain and the company's social media presence for up to a year, and former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop will be in charge of Microsoft's devices group, reporting directly to CEO Satya Nadella. Aside from this, Microsoft has been pretty tight-lipped on details about what the post-acquisition world will be like, mainly due to legal restrictions. After this Friday, however, we hope the company will open up a bit more about what we can expect going forward.
