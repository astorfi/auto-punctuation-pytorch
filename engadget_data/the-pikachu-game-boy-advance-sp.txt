We're sure there's at least one person out there counting down the seconds until Nintendo busts out a
special-limited edition version of the DSâ€”there were some rumors of a
black Nintendo DS, but our best guess is that the first
non-silver DS will be timed to coincide with the release of the PlayStation Portable here in the US. In the meantime,
Nintendo just keeps pumping out new
limited-editions for the Game Boy Advance
SP, with the latest being the very yellow, very Japan-only, Pikachu SP.
