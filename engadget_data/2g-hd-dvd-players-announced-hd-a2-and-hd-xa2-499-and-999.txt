It appears we will be getting the same players announced in Europe recently, named the HD-A2 and HD-XA2, this fall. They both feature the new slim design -- hopefully a sign of dedicated hardware as opposed to the stripped-down laptop that made up the HD-A1 -- and the XA2 will feature an HDMI 1.3 output with 1080p. The A2 will start shipping in October for a price of $499, while the HD-XA2 will debut in December with a price-tag of $999. No other specifics were available, but we would not be surprised if the HD-A2 matched its European cousin in losing the analog 5.1 output present on current HD-A1s. Also mentioned in the press release was their estimate of 25,000 HD DVD-equipped homes in the US, as well as upcoming movie releases like Fast and the Furious 3: Tokyo Drift, Batman Begins, and The Polar Express. Niveus has announced HD DVD-enabled Media Center PCs with 3TB of storage scheduled to ship in September.UPDATE: Pics of both players straight from CEDIA
