As a unique selling point, both of the tablets can be upgraded to support mobile data connections via add-on modules.

 You're looking at the most interesting of the pair up above, which is the Evo 7 HD. It includes a 7-inch WXGA (1,280 x 800) display, 1GB RAM, a dual-core 1.6GHz CPU and Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean). The tablet features 4GB of built-in storage, which can be expanded with a microSD card. You'll also find a 3-megapixel rear camera and a front-facing VGA setup for video chats. The base configuration of the Evo 7 HD will hit the market in May for $179, which features 802.11 b/g/n (WiFi) and Bluetooth 4.0. As for mobile data, the tablet will also be sold with a removable 3G module ($249) or a 4G module ($349).

 Not to forget the Evo 7, this tablet features a 7-inch WSVGA (1,024 x 600) display, 1GB RAM, a single-core 1GHz CPU and Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). It includes a sole VGA camera on the front, 4GB of built-in storage and a microSD slot. Look closely and you'll also discover that the Evo 7 is less impressive in the communications department, which is limited to WiFi, Bluetooth 2.1 and an optional HSPA+ 21 module. Neither pricing nor a release date have been established for the One Touch Evo 7, but you can take a peek at it -- along with our hands-on video -- after the break.
