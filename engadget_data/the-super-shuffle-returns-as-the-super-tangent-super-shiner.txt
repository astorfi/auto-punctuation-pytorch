We're not sure what the hell's going on now, but our old pals at LuxPro have pasted up a product page for a new,
slightly less iPod shuffle-esque version of their notorious
Super Shuffle MP3 player which is either called the Super
Shiner or the Super Tangent. It still comes in either 512MB or 1GB flavors and has a built-in FM tuner, a digital voice
recorder function, and a shuffle mode, but they've changed the controls a bit to make the player less of
lawsuit-magnet. Oh, and the player also now comes in both black and red, in additon to the original white. This is all
assuming that this player actually exists, of course.
