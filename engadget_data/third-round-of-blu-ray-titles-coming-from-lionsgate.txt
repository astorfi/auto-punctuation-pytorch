 Lionsgate isn't done with Blu-ray yet. The studio have already announced two waves of their titles and now they have just announced that on October 17, we are going to see some of the studios top titles. American Psycho, First Blood, Saw II and Young Guns are all coming out on 1080p discs with Dolby Digital Surround EX and DTS-HD surround tracks. We have to be honest though, we had no idea that First Blood could be a top title. Maybe a bit of 1080p and great surround sound will make it watchable. The titles are going to retail for $29.99.
