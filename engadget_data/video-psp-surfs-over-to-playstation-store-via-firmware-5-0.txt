Sony has hosted up a clip to give us all a better idea of what firmware 5.0 has in store for the PSP, and while there aren't any real surprises, it's always good to get a sneak peek. We're told that users will soon be able to create an account and access the PlayStation Network right on the PlayStation Portable, and the PS Store access is the same as on the PS3. Enough chatter -- give the video a look in the read link.
