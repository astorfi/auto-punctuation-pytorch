 If you've been delaying the start of that much-needed exercise routine because you can't conjure up the coinage required for an iPod nano and Nike+iPod kit, or if you spent your Apple allowance on a shiny new VX8500 instead, your excuses to procrastinate have come to an end. Verizon Wireless has teamed up with Bones in Motion to offer a downloadable app on select mobiles -- the Samsung SCH-A930 / SCH-A990, LG Chocolate (VX8500), and Motorola's V325 and RAZR V3c / V3m for starters -- which utilizes "GPS tracking technology to continuously monitor speed, distance, calories burned, pace and route." The software even sends goal completion alerts to you for that extra boost of confidence when running solo, and will upload your results to a personalized website for progress monitoring purposes. Additionally, customers can access Runner's World RunTracker system which incorporates the BiM Active data into more detailed reports that can be wirelessly shared with anyone else within the network. If you're concerned over the snazzy software eliminating the ability to hear your V CAST tunes while in motion, fret not, as Verizon made absolutely certain that playing those oh-so-pricey jams in the background wouldn't slow anything down. Unlike Apple's one-and-done solution, the BiM Active program will run you $9.99 per month, or if you just need it for the NYC Marathon, the 24-hour version will set you back $1.99.[Via Smart Mobs]
