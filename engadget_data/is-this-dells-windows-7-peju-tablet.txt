There's not a lot of info on the thing at the moment, and what we do have ought to be taken with a few pinches of salt. But here's the breakdown, according to the aforementioned tipster: the slate's got 2GB of RAM (though larger options will also be made available from the company), a USB and HDMI port and a stylus holder on the back of the device. Dell is apparently looking to make it available in December for around $900 to $1,000, just in time for that holiday tablet rush. Could this be the 10.1-inch Peju tablet that we caught wind of, back in July? We can't say for sure, of course, but it certainly seems like a possibility.
