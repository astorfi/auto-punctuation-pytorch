 Just released in Japan, Sony's 3.50 firmware for the PSP should making the global rounds soon enough. That, coupled with the latest PS3 firmware update, means you've just scored "Remote Play" functionality -- access to videos, music, and pictures on your home PS3 running 1.80 -- over the Internet. In other words, you can stream media but can't actually play games remotely. The update also includes an RSS Channel Guide but we know it's the remote play you want. The new firmware should already be available via your PSP's Network Update option even though many of Sony's download sites are still pegged at version 3.40.[Via Impress and CVG]Read -- Japan releaseRead -- US release
