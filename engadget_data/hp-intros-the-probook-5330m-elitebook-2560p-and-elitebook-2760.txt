The company also trotted out three lightweight models for the corporate set, including the 12.1-inch EliteBook 2760p convertible tablet, which has been rearing its head around the FCC as of late. Although it's an update to the current-generation 2740p, it sticks with its tried-and-true metal design. But -- surprise, surprise -- it steps up to Sandy Bridge Core i5 and Core i7 CPU options, promises 5.5 hours of battery life with the standard six-cell, and will be one of several models compatible with HP's newly minted (optional) prepaid data service, DataPass. Is this the Windows 7 tablet you've been looking for? It's on sale now starting at $1,500 -- stylus included.

	Next up is the EliteBook 2560p laptop, an update to the 12.1-inch 2540p. This one, too, has a tough aluminum-and-magnesium-alloy build, but it gets the good ol' Sandy Bridge treatment and also shifts to a 12.5-inch display -- a screen size that's rarely stretched to 16:9 proportions. And, HP claims it's the only laptop of its size with a built-in optical drive, if sacrificing optical discs isn't a compromise you're willing to make. Look for it on May 23 with a starting price of $1,100.

	Lastly, there's the ProBook 5330m, a 13.3-incher that's trying hard to win over Generation Y-types just dipping their toes into the workforce... and who will call in sick if their work machines aren't trendy, or something. In addition to a dual-tone aluminum chassis, it plays cool with a backlit keyboard, Sandy Bridge Core i3 and i5 CPU options, and Beats Audio -- a first for an HP business system. On the inside, meanwhile, it offers TPM circuitry and optional Intel vPro processors -- perks for the IT managers likely to buy these in bulk. These are on sale now, starting at $800.
