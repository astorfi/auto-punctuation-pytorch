Well, looks like the Dutch police were pretty happy with the results of their recent
high-tech recon efforts at nabbing soccer rioters via
SMS, so they've launched a computer-based system to make sure banned fans have stayed home. A computer with voice
recognition software calls a random selection fans with stadium bans at their homes during matches and identifies them
by voice to make sure they're not at the stadium. The calls can't be forwarded to cellphones, which makes it seem sort
of odd that banned fans have to be at home during soccer matches. We're not sure what happens if they've gone
on vacationâ€¦ maybe best to get that VoIP phone and drag your router with you if you're liable to get called.
