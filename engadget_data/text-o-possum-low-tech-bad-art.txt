Delivered as a conceptual composition, the taxidermized opossum is supposed to represent our "disconnect from nature." Undoubtedly thrilling stuff if you just got out of art school, but seriously, this is just one of those laser keyboards wedged under the leg of a dead animal. We get the impression that, Damien Hirst excepted, no one's very interested.[Via Wired]
