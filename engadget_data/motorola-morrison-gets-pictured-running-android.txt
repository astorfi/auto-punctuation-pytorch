In addition to offering us a better look at a slightly more refined version of the phone, it also quite clearly shows it running Android, and it does indeed appear to be the real deal. As you can see above, it's also still sporting that T-Mobile logo, though we're still not hearing anything different than the previous rumors that it's slated to launch on the carrier by the end of the year.[Via TmoNews]
