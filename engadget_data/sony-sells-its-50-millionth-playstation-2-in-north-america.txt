For those with short-term memories, the PS2 hit the scene in the year 2000, well before the iPod, Windows XP and America's current president took their rightful places. NPD numbers estimate that around 43 million of these 50 million units were sold here in the US of A, and if you're really looking for some staggering numbers, get a load of this: In November 2008, 206,000 PS2s were moved in America, while just 172,000 more PS3s were sold in the same window. Talk about longevity / sluggish adoption, respectively.Update: We meant 172,000, not 1,720,000.
