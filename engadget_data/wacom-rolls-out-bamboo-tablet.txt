Of course, you won't get a built-in LCD, and it's not wireless, but you will at least be able to take advantage of Vista's various pen-based capabilities (it'll work just fine with a Mac as well). The device itself also won't take up too much room on your desk space, measuring about 7.8 x 7.3 inches although, as far as we can tell, it's not actually made of bamboo. If that's not too much of a deal-breaker, you'll be able to pick up one of these this month in Japan for Â¥8,980, or about $75.[Via Impress]
