Digital Photography Review checks out the P-2000, Epson's new 40GB digital photo viewer/storage device.Â 
Despite the fact that they could probably just as easily pimp the P-2000 as a personal media player, since it also
supports playback of MP3 and AAC audio files and MPEG-1 and MPEG-4 video files, Epson is aiming this thing mainly at
hardcore digital photographers who need a solid device for copying photos over from their digital camera (it has a slot
for CompactFlash, SD, and MMC memory cards). Anyway, DPReview digs the P-2000's crisp VGA quality 3.8-inch LCD screen
and solid battery life, but they do have a few complaints, like that it won't work with JPEGs that are larger than 8.9
megapixels (which is actually a big negative for anyone shooting with some major megapixelage) and that it has limited
support for RAW image files (though to be fair, most of the P-2000's competition doesn't have any support for RAW files
at all).
