Considering the Prime's leaked November 9th launch date, it's no shock to see the tablet now surfacing at the Commission with confidentiality agreements in tow. Most of the slate's internal goods are hidden behind that wall of secrecy, but we can confirm the de rigeur presence of WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities. Shih's already dished out some of this quad-core tab's specs, so we know to expect a mini-HDMI port, 14.5-hour battery, SD card slot and a destined Ice Cream Sandwich OS. The only remaining question is whether this second coming will pack any wireless operator-friendly frequencies. We'll keep you posted on any new developments, but in the meantime, feel free to traverse the spectrum tests at the source.
