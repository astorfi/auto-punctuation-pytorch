We know, the plan's been all but confirmed since July, but it's nice to see the deal go through and all the necessary paperwork signed. Both now-wholly-owned subsidiaries (through a share exchange that commenced today) are scheduled to be de-listed from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on March 29th, 2011, and after that... well, independence was fun while it lasted, eh chaps?
