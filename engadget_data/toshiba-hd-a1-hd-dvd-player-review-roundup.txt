We saw one of the first such reviews, from The Man Room,yesterday. Now, we've had a chance to check out a few more (props to PC World's Martyn Williams, who not only got oneof Toshiba's Japanese HD-XA1 players to review, but even checked out the bundled Japanese films "Biohazard"and "Moonlight Jellyfish"). If there's a consensus opinion, it's that HD DVD may be great for early adoptersand HD connoisseurs, but less discerning viewers may not see what the big deal is. As Ben Drawbaugh puts it on HDBeat:"Bottom line is that HD-DVD is great, but will you notice? If you can't tell the difference between DVD's and HBOHD than you might be just as well off with a upconverting DVD player. If you never noticed HBO-HD's cropped movies,non-dynamic sound and compression artifacts you may be better off sticking with HBO-HD. If you do notice theseannoyances you won't be disappointed with HD-DVD or Blu-Ray."
