  Well, that didn't take long. One day after agreeing to implement a do not track button as part of a new consumer bill of rights, Google has given the people what they want... sort of. Keep My Opt-Outs is a Chrome extension, developed by the Mountain View team, that will prevent advertisers from using your browsing history against you. Presumably, this function will get built straight into the browser one day but, for now, you have to go dig it up in the Chrome Web Store -- far from an ideal solution. Still, a tepid step into the shallow end is better than no step at all. You can install the extension yourself at the source.Update: As a few of you have noted, this extension has actually been available for quite some time, since Google originally announced the ad cookie blocker back in 2011. Check out the details in the team's original Public Policy blog post and combine it with a dose of web history cleaning to keep your activities to yourself.
