 Now that some 6 million Sony-manufactured batteries have been recalled, and all the big names are preparing for a summit on standardizing manufacturing processes for li-ion cells, we were just waiting for the fingers to start a pointin'. Well, a pointin' they have begun, as Japan's trade ministry ordered Sony (with Dell) to investigate the issues surrounding how a few million batteries were manufactured in such a way that a percentage of them might just explode all crazy on their owners. The Japanese trade ministry ain't screwing around, either -- Sony and Dell are to report back their findings, or face severe penalties under Japan's consumer safety laws. Hey, if we were Japan we wouldn't want Sony's flub on our hands either, you know? We'll let you know when we find out about their findings.
