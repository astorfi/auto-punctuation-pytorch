 As we predicted, the TiVo Series 3 HD Box has finally been officially announced today, with availability coming "mid-September" according to the press release (or October?) -- but as we already know, you can order one from TiVo.com immediately. Like we've reported countless times before, dual CableCARDs enable the recording of two different shows in HD simultaneously, and the whole package has THX certification. And yes, our pricing was spot on: $800 for this bad boy. Oh, and don't forget to check out the new television commercial, featuring the little TiVo guy bouncing around and getting out of a limo, transitioning to the ever-popular Shanan presenting the features of the Series3 -- you know, the one who looks like she's straight out of the Broadway musical Cabaret.Read- Official Series 3 press releaseRead- Promo vid
