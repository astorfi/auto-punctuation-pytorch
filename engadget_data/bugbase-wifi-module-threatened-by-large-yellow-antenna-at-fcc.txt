That looks set to change in the very near future with the FCC testing of the BUGwifi module, an add-on announced way back in January then never heard from again. There's still no word on when we might expect this stubby open wundermodule to start hosting wireless Guitar Quake deathmetalmatches, but things usually don't take long once the FCC has done its deed.
