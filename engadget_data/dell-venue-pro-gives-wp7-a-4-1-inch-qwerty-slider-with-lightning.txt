Dell's AMOLED-equipped WP7 debut has just gone official with a cringe-worthy renaming to the Venue Pro for T-Mobile, who has in turn announced its intention to carry the 4.1-inch portrait QWERTY slider "in time for the holidays." Notably, you won't be able to purchase the Venue Pro directly from T-Mo stores, as Dell and its choice of handpicked retailers are set to handle the purchasing experience. Don't look for any AT&T hookups, either -- Dell has acknowledged T-Mobile as its "launch partner" for the device, giving team Magenta a second major exclusive, even if this one doesn't last much beyond the launch period. Needless to say, we'll seek to confirm the full spec sheet as soon as we can, though the officially known 1GHz Snapdragon chip and 5 megapixel imager agree with the Lightning's original leak.

 In addition to the HTC HD7, T-Mobile plans to offer an additional Windows Phone 7 smartphone option in the Dell Venue Pro, a stylish full-QWERTY slider featuring a 4.1-inch screen, 5 megapixel camera and a Qualcomm 1 GHz Snapdragon processor. The Dell Venue Pro is expected to be available in the U.S. in time for the holidays directly from Dell and select retailers with service from T-Mobile.
