More specifically, TWICE is reporting that a 32- and 42-inch Blu-ray-infused AQUOS HDTV will be arriving in just a month, both of which will tout 1080p panels, 120Hz processing technology and a slot-loading optical drive. No prices have been set just yet, but a nice round $2,000 figure is being floated around for the big daddy.
