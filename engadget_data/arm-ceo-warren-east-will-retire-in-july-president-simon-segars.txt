 Warren East has overseen a sharp rise in the fortunes of ARM Holdings plc over the last few years, but tonight the company announced he will step down effective July 1st. Stepping into the lead role is current president Simon Segars, who has been with the company in a number of positions since 1991. East has been successful in expanding ARM's business from one product line when he took over in 2001 to a technology offering used by over 300 chip customers to make 9 billion chips last year, according to chairman John Buchanan. He's also had a reputation for interesting quotes and predictions, with some (Windows on ARM) working out better than others (netbooks taking over the market.) We interviewed Segars both at CES and MWC earlier this year, you can check out the videos embedded after the break.
