Peter Homer, an engineer from Southwest Harbor, Maine, beat out three other competitors and the current NASA Phase VI glove to bag the $200,000 prize with his design made with off-the-shelf kitchen cleaning gloves and "a cloth material he found on eBay." The achievement is all the more remarkable for occurring in the contest's first year, since NASA doesn't usually see very many winners in these challenges -- in fact, this is the first time anyone has ever won. Expect to see NASA trolling eBay for ISS parts in the near future.[Via NewScientist]
