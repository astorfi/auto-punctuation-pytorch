Sure you can rent them on the Apple TV, and you can buy them on both the Apple TV and in iTunes, but the press release highlighting the debut of HD Movie purchases specifically said "Starting today, movie fans can purchase box office blockbusters for download in HD for $19.99 from iTunes, and films will be available as iTunes Movie Rentals in HD for $4.99 within 30 days after release." Now we suppose it's possible that the 30 days mentioned starts when the titles are released for sale in the iTunes store, but we really thought it started when the movie was released, period. Either way, we should know for sure in about two weeks.
