Why hello again, One Mini! While HTC has yet to make this metallic 4.3-inch phone official, the closest thing we have right now is this certification in China's TENAA database. What's new is the "601e" model name, which positions it in a similar tier as the other slightly bigger 600 series devices destined for China, namely the Desire 606w (aka Desire 600 Dual SIM globally), Desire 608t and Desire 609d. But unlike these models nor the Chinese variants of the larger One, it appears that this 601e with WCDMA radio is just a single-SIM device. With the appearance of this filing, it shouldn't be long before the One Mini finally hits the shelves around the world.
