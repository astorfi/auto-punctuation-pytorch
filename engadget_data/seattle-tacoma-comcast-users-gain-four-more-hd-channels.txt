       Although there's been no official announcement from Comcast, it seems that subscribers in the Seattle / Tacoma region have recently been blessed with four more HD options. According to tipster Cameron, the operator informed customers via postcards that it would be adding A&E HD, History Channel HD, USA HD and National Geographic HD as of December 6th. Comically enough, Comcast also sent out a friendly letter informing users in the area of price hikes that were coming in 2008, but we suppose you've got to pay to play, eh? As for channel numbers, you can catch the aforementioned additions on 670, 671, 672 and 673, respectively.[Thanks, Cameron]
