The display is 62mm (2.4-inches) in diameter, with an outer border of 75mm (3-inches). Apparently the thing is a proof of concept for new manufacturing technology that can produce an LCD of any shape, and the specs aren't at all bad with a 240 x 240 resolution along the longest lines, 500 nits of brightness and a 600:1 contrast ratio. As for the actual circular LCDs, Toshiba sees 'em ending up in automotive applications and mobile devices, but there's no word on when they'll hit production, and we can't confess to a burning desire within to start staring at round screens in addition to our abundance of rectangle ones.
