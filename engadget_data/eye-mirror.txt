In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line.

Turning around is for suckers. Just screw a GP360 onto the front of a DSLR, GoPro or other video camera, and you can capture 360-degree video or stills. You can watch the video on your computer or mobile device or upload it to the Eye Mirror site for sharing. Pretty snazzy, no? The GP360's makers assure us that the add-on is rugged, too. They've tested it at down to 60 meters diving, in Arctic conditions and at up to 160 miles per hour while skydiving. Sounds like a pretty gig at the end of the day. The project's Kickstarter page has a lot more information, including links to some interactive demos that let you scroll around the aforementioned 360 degrees while the video plays. Pledge $196 and you can score a GP360 of your very own - or heck, if all you want is someone to talk to, $33 will get you the personal phone numbers of the guys behind the project.


Previous Project Update: Looks like the GPS Cookie did just fine, thank you very much. The journey tracking device scored almost $30,000 out of a $7,500 project goal.
