The first Chromebook Pixel wasn't exactly a huge seller, what with its hefty price tag and all, but Google's apparently still preparing to release a second version. OMG! Chrome! spotted a video of Renee Niemi, who's in charge of Android and Chrome for Work and Education, at the recent Google Teamwork event, where she revealed that the company's working on the next-gen Pixel that will soon be slated for release. Mountain View has since pulled down the video, but the publication transcribed the relevant part as follows:



We do have a new Pixel coming out and it will be coming out soon. We will be selling it but I just have to set your expectations: this is a development platform. This is really a proof of concept. We don't make very many of these -- we really don't. And... our developers and our Googlers consume 85% of what we produce. But yes, we do have a new Pixel coming out.




Since the company hasn't officially announced anything yet, we don't have the laptop's specs or features to list. According to OMG! Chrome!, though, it might still have the same 12.85-inch high-res screen, along with the new heaven-sent, reversible type C USB port. It'll most likely cost upwards of a grand (whereas other Chromebooks are priced only in the hundreds of dollars), considering the first Pixel starts at $1,300. There's also a chance that the new model will be announced at Google I/O 2015 in May, as the first one was launched at the same event back in 2013. We reached out to Google for confirmation and for more details, and we'll update this post once we hear back.
