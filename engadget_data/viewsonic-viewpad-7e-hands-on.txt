Nook Simple Touch gets $79 limited edition for Black Friday, makes other e-readers vaguely jealous
Is this Dell's Windows 7 'Peju' Tablet?

The ViewSonic ViewPad 7e isn't exactly what we'd call a barn burner. The 1GHz Samsung chip inside is enough for some basic web browsing and light app duty, but even the ViewSonic reps we spoke to referred to it as an "e-reader on steroids," positioning it more as a competitor to the Nook Color than the iPad. In our brief hands-on, the little tablet ran Gingerbread capably enough that we weren't drumming our fingers on the table, but the 7-inch, 800 x 600 screen was not always particularly responsive -- it took three swipes to unlock the first time. Despite it's noticeable bulk (you can see it resting besides a Galaxy Tab 10.1 in the gallery below) it was surprisingly light in the hand. Of course, it saves precious ounces by going with an all plastic build, but it hardly feels cheap or shoddy (though, the buttons are a bit stiff). On the left-hand edge you'll find a microSD slot for adding to the 4GB of integrated storage, while along the top is the AC plug, a mini USB port and mini HMDI for pumping out 1080p video. As we've mentioned before this budget slate is available to pre-order now for $200. Don't miss the bevy of photos below as well as the PR after the break.
