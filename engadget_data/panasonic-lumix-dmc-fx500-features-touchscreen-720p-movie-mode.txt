This well-spec'd shooter sports a pocket-friendly design, a 10.1-megapixel sensor, a 25-millimeter ultra-wide-angle lens, 3-inch touchscreen, 5x optical zoom and a swank movie mode capable of logging clips at 1,280 x 720 at 30fps. For those worried about said feature chewing through their SD / SDHC card (or the 50MB of built-in memory), WVGA (848 x 480) and VGA (640 x 480) video modes are available as well. You'll also find such niceties as optical image stabilization, red-eye correction, face detection and Auto Focus tracking for good measure. Drooling yet? Chew on the choice of black or silver and get your $399.95 ready to drop come May.[Via PCMag]
