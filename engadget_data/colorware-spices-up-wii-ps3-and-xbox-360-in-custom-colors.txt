Able to switch up the aesthetics on your controller, system, or both, users can now hit up 30 different shades for all three now-gen systems with prices starting at $100 per job. (Not a bad idea if you're not up to plunking down for, say, an Elite.) ColorWare also hinted at new Zune, BlackBerry, and even iPhone colors in the pipeline for this summer, but right now we're just happy to spend an afternoon re-envisioning our console collection in crazy pastel hues.Check it out: Wii, PS3, Xbox 360
