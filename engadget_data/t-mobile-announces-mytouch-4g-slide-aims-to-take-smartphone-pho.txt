 

Well, we'd seen plenty of pictures of T-Mobile's new myTouch 4G Slide over the past couple of weeks, and now it's official. T-Mo officially pulled the wraps off its newest handset, and it's packing a 1.2 GHz dual-core Snapdragon processor and a 3.7-inch WVGA Super LCD screen. As for software, the slick slider comes with some tasty Gingerbread slathered in Sense 3.0. There's also an 8-megapixel shooter that does low-light photos with a wide-aperture lens capable of f2.2 -- just like that new Nokia N9 that has us all hot and bothered. The camera also has burst mode for snapping rapid fire photos, takes HDR pictures, and does 1080p videos, too. It's slated for a July release, so we won't have to wait much longer until we can indulge our inner Ansel Adams. Such fantastic smartphone photography is all yours for $199.99 on a two year contract, and there's a video of the phone and a smattering of other details in the PR after the break.
