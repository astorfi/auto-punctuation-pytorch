 
Dell's "stick some art on it" approach to laptop design got off to a bit of a rocky start, and the stylized lids can still be a tad incongruous with the rest of the laptop's staid design (Design Studio laptops are still limited to the Studio 15 and Studio 17), but there's no faulting Dell for volume. They just added 120 new designs, a slick new way to browse through the looks, and most importantly: some pretty good choices (along with enough stinkers to keep it interesting). New artists include Deanne Cheuk, Maya Hayuk, Jason Holley, TWEEQIM, Korakrit Arunanondchai, Filth, Robert Hargrave, Peter Stevens, Keith Warner and OBVLN. It's $85 a pop, and (PRODUCT) RED designs include a $20 contribution to Bono.
