And with a name like SubjuGator, what do you expect, really? This past weekend saw the 8th Annual Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle Competition in San Diego pitted 19 collegiate teams against each other to complete three tasks:
finding a docking station, inspecting a pipeline, and surfacing in a recovery zone. The University of Florida's
SubjuGator dethroned MIT to walk away the victor â€” an autonomous submarine designed to operate underwater at depths in
excess of 32 feet. The unit is controlled by over 10 microcontrollers and peripherals, and is based on a single-board
Pentium M system running Windows XP. No word if Ballmer performed the monkey dance upon hearing the news.
