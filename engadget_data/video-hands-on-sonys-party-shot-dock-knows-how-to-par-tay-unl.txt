 
Know what's awesome? Parties... and parfaits. But if we had to choose, we'd rather have Sony's Party-shot dock on hand at our next soir√®e instead of a delicate ensemble of whipped confectioneries. Just set your Partyshot-enabled Cybershot into Sony's automatically swiveling and panning $150 IPT-DS1 Party-shot dock and relive up to 11-hours of battery powered magic the next morning. Assuming it's still there, of course. See it in action with your 24 hour IFA party people after the break.
