That includes the Camileo Clip pictured above (which actually has a clip 'round back for hands-free shooting), as well as the more traditional Camileo X200 and X400, all three of which record 1080p video and rely exclusively on SD cards for storage. The X200 and X400 also, of course, steps things up quite a bit in terms of features, the standout ones being a 12x optical zoom on the X200 and a 23x zoom on the X400. Still no word on prices for any of them, but Toshiba says they'll be available sometime in the fourth quarter of this year (in Europe, at least). Hit the PR after the break for the complete list of specs.

At only 85g and 46.5mm x 80mm the CAMILEO CLIP is Toshiba's first Full HD mini camcorder. Thanks to its ruggedized and splash-proof casing, the CAMILEO CLIP is a tough companion for all outdoor activities – in both good and bad weather, while sailing or biking for instance. Attached to the jacket with its robust clip on the rear side, the camcorder takes action shots from the user's point of view while leaving the hands free for action. The CAMILEO CLIP is always in place to capture great moments. 		Bright and brilliant results even at twilight		The embedded 5 Megapixel CMOS sensor with back side illumination technology (BSI) catches wild adventures and beautiful scenery in Full HD quality and bright and natural colours – even at twilight. A 10x digital zoom allows for far-off shots in video and photo mode. The electronic image stabiliser (EIS) provides for high-quality recording and avoids blurry clips. 		A reliable companion		The CAMILEO CLIP supports micro SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards with a capacity of up to 64GB. The CAMILEO Uploader software offers an easy way to upload clips and photos direct to social platforms. miniHDMI® and Mini-USB.2.0 interfaces provide for hassle-free connectivity to electronic devices like TVs, notebooks, and tablets.

Toshiba introduces new power-zoom Full-HD CAMILEO		camcorders 		CAMILEO X200 and CAMILEO X400 feature advanced easy-to-use		applications and technologies providing stunning video results 		Neuss, Germany, 1st September 2011 – Today, Toshiba Europe		GmbH introduced two new digital Full HD camcorders expanding the		CAMILEO X series. The compact CAMILEO X200 and CAMILEO		X400 are both packed with features for advanced filming like 1080p		Full HD video resolution, Electronic Image Stabiliser (EIS) and the		possibility to take snapshots while recording videos. The new		CAMILEO camcorders are a good choice for ambitious users who		appreciate the benefits of first-class video technology and clever highend features. 		The glossy black CAMILEO X200 and the matt black		CAMILEO X400 will be available in the fourth quarter 2011 in Europe.		Simply point the camera at the scene – technology does the rest		The new camcorders can be easily operated through the menu		displayed on the large 16:9 touchscreen. Featuring a wide selection of		useful tools, the CAMILEO X200 and X400 allow the camera operator		to focus on the scene. The face tracking and smile detection		application makes it easy to capture perfect videos and photos of		people in front of the camcorder: it automatically tracks faces in video		mode and shoots photos when someone smiles. 		CAMILEO X200: Great for making memories last		The powerful zoom makes the CAMILEO X200 the right choice for		high-quality footage. The camcorder features a 12x optical zoom and		a 20x advanced zoom providing detailed portrait and landscape		videos in stunning quality. 		CAMILEO X400: High-quality videos even in low light conditions		Thanks to the CAMILEO X400's 23x optical zoom and the 120x digital		zoom, film makers can capture scenes that are beyond the reach of		most camcorders. The new camcorder also meets the challenge of		filming in low light conditions as its 5Megapixel CMOS sensor features		back side illumination technology (BSI). It significantly increases the		sensor's light sensitivity and allows brilliant and vivid videos to be		captured at twilight or in rooms with artificial light. 		Video editing made easy		The CAMILEO X200 and X400 both feature the video editing		application Cut 'n' Save that makes film editing easy. Plus, a		dedicated pause button makes it possible to pause the recording and		to continue with a different scene within the same clip – also easing		editing.
