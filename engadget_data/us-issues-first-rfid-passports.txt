 After an on-again, off-again reviewprocess that finally culminated with full State Department approval last year, the US government hasfinally issued its first passports containing RFID chips. The embedded chips in the new passports -- which are beingissued to a group of diplomats as part of a pilot program -- contain the same information that's in the printeddocument, including a photo of the passport holder. Government officials have said that the use of the RFID chip allowspassports to be scanned and cross-referenced with security databases more easily, while privacy advocates have arguedthey'll make it easier for identity thieves and terrorists to extract information -- especially after a security firmsuccessfully demonstrated that they were able to crack the encryption usedon prototype Dutch RFID passports. Despite such concerns, the new passports are scheduled to be rolled out nationallyin October.
