 
Don't be fooled by the Rumor's midrange appearance -- Sprint's positioning its brand spanking new QWERTY dumbphone as an entry-level device with a price to match. Features of the long-rumored (pun intended) LG handset include an integrated POP3 email client (beware the slow 1xRTT radio, though), microSD expansion, media player, 1.3 megapixel camera, Bluetooth, Sprint Navigation, integrated access to Facebook and Xanga, and a pair of numeric and slide-out alphanumeric keypads. Get it in silver or black / blue late this month online and in Best Buy locations -- Sprint stores start stocking it on November 4 -- for $79.99 on contract after rebates.
