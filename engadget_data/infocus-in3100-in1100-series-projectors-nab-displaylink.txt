Enter InFocus' IN3100 / IN1100 series of multimedia projectors, both of which claim to be the first of their kind with DisplayLink embedded. With a simple USB-to-PC connection, the beamers blast whatever totally boring and equally insignificant chart you're being forced to speak on upside the wall. As for specs, we're left in the dark with regard to resolution (hint: don't set your expectations too high), but the IN3100 series boasts 3,000 to 3,500 lumens and a 2,000:1 contrast ratio while the IN1100 series offers up 2,000 lumens and an 1,800:1 contrast ratio. You can slap the former (starting at $1,499) on your corporate card later this month, but you'll be waiting until early August before nabbing the $1,099 and up IN1100.
