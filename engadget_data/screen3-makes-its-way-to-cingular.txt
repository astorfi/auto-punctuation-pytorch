We've mentioned Motorola's SCREEN3 initiative
a little in the past, which as you may recall is a form of ticker / snippet-centric push-information service delivered
to your passive cellphone's screen. Think: mobile screensaver that runs headlines, weather updates, etc. Well, expect
to see it rolled out in the near future from Cingular as Live Ticker, part of a broader effort they're hoping is going
to drive sales of data plans from users clicking headlines who might not have otherwise eaten up mobile Internet. It'll
apparently first show up on Moto's v557, though we'll be
seeing a lot more SCREEN3 stuff than just that device showing up in the very near future, believe you us.
