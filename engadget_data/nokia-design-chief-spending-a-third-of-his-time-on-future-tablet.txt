  Nokia design chief Marko Ahtisaari wasn't going to be drawn on details and release dates, but he has revealed that a tablet from the (predominantly) phone-focused company was definitely in the works -- and taking up a fair chunk of his time. In an interview with Finnish magazine Kauppalehti Optio, Ahtisaari said that he was looking to create a new device that would stand out from the increasingly packed tablet crowd. The full interview isn't online just yet, but the teaser adds that the head of design is also involved in a new 'revolutionary' user experience that means you wouldn't have to be constantly arched over your phone -- whatever that involves. A Nokia spokesperson told Reuters that they "continue to eye the tablet space with interest, but have made no specific announcements." However, we're sure Nokia will have plenty more to say about these nebulous ideas in the near future.
