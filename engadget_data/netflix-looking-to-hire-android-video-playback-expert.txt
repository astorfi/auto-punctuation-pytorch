It's hit the Wii, it's coming to the iPhone, and now? That's right, the kids at Los Gatos want YOU to help "build Instant Streaming client implementations on Android devices." Are you "a senior engineer with a strong background in embedded and mobile development, specifically on media-enabled devices," with over ten years experience, hands-on experience with media playback on the Android platform, and a knack for DRM technologies? You're in luck! Hit the source link to get started. And if you do get hired, make sure you keep us in the loop as things progress. You owe us at least that much, right?
