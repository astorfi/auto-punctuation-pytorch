 XM looks be trying to make things right with its customers after an outage put a crimp in its service earlier this week, although the company isn't exactly going all out to make sure they stay on board. As compensation for any withdrawal symptoms customers may have suffered (those that haven't already jumped ship, that is), XM has deemed it suitable to dole out credits for two whole days of service (yes, days) which, at the current rate of $12.95 a month, works out to about 87 cents. Of course, you'll have to do a bit of work to pocket all that change, with a call to XM customer service at 1-800-967-2346 required to pry it from the company's coffers.[Via Orbitcast]
