Android Central reports that the carrier has begun sending letters to all customers still waiting for their phones that apologizes for delay, and informs them that they'll soon also be receiving a $25 Verizon gift card as a little thank you for their patience. As for when you'll actually receive the phone itself, however, Verizon is only saying that if your order date was June 28th or prior, you "may experience an additional delay of up to 7 business days."

[Thanks, Jacob]
