The horizontal QWERTY slider feels pretty solid in the hands, and like HTC's new Libra, it's also got a numeric keypad on the face for ease of dialing. They wouldn't say who was going to carry it (like we didn't already know) or much else about the device, but that's why you read Engadget. Check out the gallery for some more shots of the unbranded unit.
