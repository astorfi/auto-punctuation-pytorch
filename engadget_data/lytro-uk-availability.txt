Assuming you haven't given up on the idea, you'll soon be able to buy a Lytro light field camera in the UK -- even though it's been on US shelves since early last year. To remind you, it works by combining a fixed f/2.0, 8x optical zoom lens with an 11-"megaray" sensor to create a layered 1,080 x 1,080 "living picture," in which the focus can be changed later by viewers. For those who waited all this time, there is a consolation: Lytro recently enabled the camera's WiFi chip, allowing you to see images on any iOS device via a companion app. The 8GB model in graphite, electric blue, seaglass or moxie pink will run £399, while a 16GB offering in "red hot" will be priced at £469. You can grab one after July 22nd at Dixons Travel, Harrods or John Lewis -- to see how it works, check a sample image after the break.


Update: Lytro has just informed us that the "seaglass" color isn't available in the UK yet, so adjust your matching fashion plans accordingly.
