 No, Nexus 4 users, Google hasn't forgotten about you. About a day after Google started pushing Android 4.2.2 to most Nexus devices, the company's latest and greatest smartphone is also getting the patch over the air. When it shows, there will be a pair of small additional rewards for running the latest hardware -- the Nexus 4 now plays a unique sound when wireless charging kicks in, as well as an updated low-battery sound. We wouldn't upgrade just to get the new tones, but they cap what's proving to be a more significant update than the version number would suggest.

 Update: As Brian Klug over at AnandTech notes, Google both giveth and taketh away -- that very, very unofficial LTE access disappears with the update. When 4G only worked in limited areas, and was never going to get official support, we won't cry too much.
