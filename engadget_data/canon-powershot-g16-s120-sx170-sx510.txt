This model, which is set to ship in October, replaces last year's G15, and includes a 12.1-megapixel CMOS sensor, DIGIC 6 processor, 5x 28-140mm f/1.8-2.8 optical zoom lens and 1080/60p video capture. Next up is the S120, retailing for $450, also in October. This pocketable S110 replacement includes a 12.1-megapixel CMOS sensor, DIGIC 6 processor, 5x 24-120mm f/1.8-5.7 optical zoom lens and 1080/60p video capture. The SX510 HS is the cheapest of this premium bunch, with a $250 MSRP. This superzoom, expected in September, packs a 12.1-megapixel CMOS sensor, DIGIC 4 processor, a 30x 24-720mm f/3.4-5.8 optical zoom lens and 1080p video.




The G15, S120 and SX510 HS all include built-in WiFi, letting you pair the camera with Canon's Image Gateway Android or iOS app to upload shots to a variety of social networking sites, including Facebook, Twitter and Flickr. The final model, the PowerShot SX170 IS, does not include WiFi. It's quite a bit cheaper at $180, however, and should ship in September. This entry-level cam includes a 16-megapixel sensor, DIGIC 4 processor, a 16x 28-448mm f/3.5-5.9 image-stabilized lens and 720p video. That last flavor replaced the SX160 IS, which launched last year as well. The SX170 swaps a rechargeable battery pack for its predecessor's AAs, resulting in a thinner profile. Catch a bit more on all four models in the press release after the break.
