 You know, it has been abit RIM-patent-fiasco-freearound these parts lately. But no worries, since Visto hasdecided to whip up a bit (more) patent trouble of their own. Fresh off a victory over Seven Networks regarding the samefour patents that they claim RIM is infringing, and already mired in legal fights with RIM competitor Good Technology and Microsoft,Visto is looking for more, and they think they can get a payout from RIM. Visto wasn't clear as to what RIM technologyis infringing on their patents, but they do mention "Visto's intellectual property serves as the basis for thisindustry's birth." Quite the strong words when going up against RIM, who had a slight influence on thebirth of the wireless email industry if our memory serves us right. RIM believes that the Visto patents are invalid,and that Visto's victory over Seven Networks was in regards to a different type of technology than RIM's. Their patentsare also dated before Visto's, but there's really no telling where this could go after the fiasco the NTP case turnedout to be. We'll keep you posted.
