HTC finally took the wraps off its hotly-anticipated (and well-scooped) "Vox" handset at 3GSM today. The feature set is, by and large, pretty indistinguishable from any other Windows Mobile device these days (quadband EDGE, 2 megapixel camera, 2.4 inch QVGA display, microSD support, WiFi, 128MB of Flash, and 64MB of RAM), but it gets juicy when you slide the Vox's two halves apart to reveal a (gasp!) full QWERTY keypad. By Pocket PC WM6 Professional standards, that's nothing new -- heck, HTC's own devices have had that trick up their sleeves for ages -- but never before in Smartphone trim. Because it's a Smartphone, it'll come equipped with the Standard version of Windows Mobile 6, and we're thinking it'll be likely packing one of the most luxurious typing experiences of any WM6 Standard device on the market (which, of course, we can use to express in email and SMS our frustration to HTC about the lack of a 3G radio). Click on to the gallery for the full expos√© of HTC's newest, leanest, meanest QWERTY device doing its thing!
