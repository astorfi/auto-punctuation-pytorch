Well Texas Instruments thinks it'll soon be able to nullify this trade-off with an in-handset projector that we've heard about several times before, but last night's Pepcom event in New York was the first time we've been able to peep the technology up close. Not that the TI reps made it easy to do so: the prototype unit was in a locked metal case underneath the table, and we had to swear up and down that we saw Walt Mossberg getting a demo before they'd cough it up. As you can see, the reason they want to keep this under wraps for the time being is that the quality and brightness are certainly not ready for prime time yet; while the unit we saw used lasers as the light source, we're told that an LED-based model still in the lab offers significant improvements. Keep reading for more shots of this rare prototype -- along with a video courtesy of Popular Science -- and give yourself a few moments to bask in the future before returning to the stark reality of your own phone and its dim little QQVGA action...
