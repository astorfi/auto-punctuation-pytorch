Normally it isn't that big of news when a company announces that, no, theye're not doing anything different—but when
it's a company as big as Dell, and they announce that they are calling off any talk of switching their product lines
over to finally include AMD chips… well, sure, it's a big win for Intel and all, but it's a far greater loss
for AMD. A company whose products perform so well and at such an amazing price point might finally have received the
ultimate brand-boosting validation, yet they remain locked out of one of the hugest consumer chip contracts ever.
Either way, it means that even though Dell and Intel were able to work it out this time, maybe Dell won't be monogamous
with Intel exclusively forever.
