Well, what do we have here? According to China's official certification website (TENAA), this above is the unannounced Nokia Lumia 625. The handset apparently features a 4.7-inch WVGA screen with super-sensitive touch, 1.2GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor, 512MB of RAM and 2,000mAh battery -- basically a lower-end model. While the listing only mentions GSM / GPRS and WCDMA / HSPA support, the phone supposedly includes LTE, and wraps everything in a unibody design that follows the attractive looks of its smaller cousin, the Lumia 620. In fact, the shape appears to match the RM-941 that passed through the FCC back in June. The device is expected to land in China at the end of July for 1,999 yuan ($325) -- just hit the source link below for more info.
