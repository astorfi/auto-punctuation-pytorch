 It looks like the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch aren't the only Apple devices getting a software update today. The company has also rolled out an update to the Apple TV, which adds Bluetooth keyboard support, along with the ability to play music you've purchased from iTunes through iCloud. You'll also get a new "Up Next" feature that lets you choose what to play from the cued up music (or simply keep an eye on what's coming up).
