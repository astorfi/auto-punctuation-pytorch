If you heard that Amazon was launching an app on Google Play, you'd be entitled to hope that it'd be the long-awaited Instant Video for Android. Prepare to be disappointed, since the company's actually released Sev Zero: Air Support for tablets that don't have the words "kindle" and "fire" in their name. It's a companion piece to the Amazon-made Sev Zero game that debuted on the Fire TV, enabling a second player to join in on the tower defense-cum-fps-style fun. Still, maybe next time on that whole video app, please Jeff?
