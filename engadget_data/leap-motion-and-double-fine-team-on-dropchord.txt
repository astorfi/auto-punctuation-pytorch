Emerging technology often needs a halo app to lure us in. For the upcoming Leap Motion controller, that app could come through the unusual (if welcome) channel of Double Fine's Dropchord. The game's exact mechanics are a mystery, but the music focus and exclusively gesture-based input should finally reward those who've spent years shredding invisible guitars. Gamers who don't want to spring for a peripheral just to get one game will have the option of an iOS version sometime after Leap Motion gets first crack on May 13th. Knowing Double Fine's reputation in motion gaming, the extra hardware just might be worthwhile -- see Giant Bomb's proof after the break.
