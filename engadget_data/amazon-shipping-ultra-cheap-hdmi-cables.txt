What does $1.22 get you these days? Bottle of soda, 122 turns on those penny horse rides, or an HDMI cable via Amazon. Yeah, we're not going to vouch for this cable but if you're looking for a cheap way to connect Comcast's cable box to your swanky, new Vizio LCD, this is it. Oh and if you need a cheap digital optical cable, you can order both for a whopping $2.07. Best part about $1.22 HDMI cable, you know the manufacturer is still running in the green.
