Available "this month" for $300 in silver and dark blue, Sony's 500-followup features a new electronic paper display that is more responsive with a better contrast than its predecessor while offering expansion for both Memory Stick Duo or SD memory cards. A new USB Mass Storage mode allows for a lickity-quick transfer of files when connected to your PC. Better yet perhaps, is to see a late 90's indie band coming out in support of Sony, eh Joey?
