Check out the gallery below to see this wonder of modern technology doing its thing... you will not be disappointed.

Update: Grace K. sent in a Flickr link, complete with video of the Micro. Check it out after the break. It doesn't make this thing feel any more "real," but what else were you planning on doing today outside of looking at Apple rumors? Mow the lawn? Pshaw.

[Thanks, James]
