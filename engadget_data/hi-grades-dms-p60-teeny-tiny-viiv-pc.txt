The unit is based on a 1.6GHz Core Duoprocessor, which (mostly) accounts for the skimpy size, but they still manage to pack in a 80GB 2.5-inch HDD, DVDburner, analog TV tuner, WiFi, Bluetooth, 56k modem, gigabit Ethernet, DVI, S-Video, and a memory card reader just forgood measure. There is an infrared keyboard with integrated trackball included, but it requires an external infrareddongle to work, throwing off Hi-Grade's otherwise all-inclusive "cram it in" policy. To fully round out theViiv spec, the unit has instant on, instant off capability, and yet goes for a mere $1400, unless you opt for a DTVtuner or want to bump the processor speed. So if all that Viiv hullabaloo was necessary for us to see well designedmedia PCs like this one, we say it was well worth it.[Via Digital Media Thoughts]
