No word yet on iTunes, but it does look like the pair have finally reached a naming agreement that has both sides pleased, ending years of legal sparring. "We love the Beatles, and it has been painful being at odds with them over these trademarks," said Steve Jobs. "It feels great to resolve this in a positive manner, and in a way that should remove the potential of further disagreements in the future." And just how was this resolved? Both companies are going to be paying their own legal costs, and Apple Inc is walking home with the entire brand, with an apparent agreement to license certain trademarks back to Apple Corps. No wonder Steve was pleased. We'll keep our fingers crossed for some sort of iTunes deal, but obviously that oft-rumored Super Bowl ad spot opportunity has come and gone. Luckily, the word from Apple Corps' Neil Aspinall hints at good things to come: "It is great to put this dispute behind us and move on. The years ahead are going to be very exciting times for us. We wish Apple Inc. every success and look forward to many years of peaceful co-operation with them."[Thanks, Raghu]
