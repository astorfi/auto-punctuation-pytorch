Is the 4.7-inch HTC One not the right size for your hands? Do Nokia's latest Lumia phones not appeal to your design sensibilities? Well, a leaked document from O2 Germany lists four unannounced devices reportedly coming out later this year that just might satisfy your very particular tastes. The HTC One Mini is on there (a 4.3-inch phone we're already well familiar with) as is the One Max, which rumors suggest will have Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 and a 5.9-inch 1080p display. Moving on to Nokia, there's the "Eros," though that might be a typo for the 41-megapixel "EOS" that's expected to be announced on the 11th. There's also the "Mars," which is the first time we've heard that name. Check out the full list after the break.
