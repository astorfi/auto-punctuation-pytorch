In tacking the "Music Edition" label onto the tail ends of their names, they've re-upped the N73 and the elder-statesman N70 candybars, slapping them with a fresh coat of black in the process. Unlike the N91, the internals seem the same -- they're advertising the new models as coming with 2GB and 1GB of storage respectively, but the bumped capacities turn out to be nothing more than bundled storage cards; likewise, the touted 3.5mm audio jacks are delivered via in-box Pop-Port adapters. We're always happy to see a manufacturer breathe some fresh life into old handsets, but unless black is your color, we hope existing N70 and N73 owners don't let a couple bundled accessories ruin their love affair.
