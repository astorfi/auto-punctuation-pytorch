Now that the LG G2 is official, the battle between mid-2013 Android flagships is fully underway. But which wins the war? We've pitted the new smartphone against its biggest competitors in the US -- Samsung's Galaxy S 4, the HTC One and the Motorola Moto X -- to understand which device most deserves a place in your pocket.


Based purely on the spec sheet, the G2 is the frontrunner. Its larger 5.2-inch screen, quicker 2.3GHz Snapdragon 800 and image-stabilized 13-megapixel rear camera will please those who want a media powerhouse. Its extra-large battery and 24-bit / 192KHz audio are also unique in a category where longevity and sound quality tend to play second fiddle. If all you want is the most technically capable device, look no further.


Yet each of the G2's competitors has an advantage that's harder to quantify. The GS4 has a full set of hardware nav keys (for those who prefer them), air gestures and a slightly tougher plastic build. The One claims superior low-light photography and dual speakers. And the Moto X partly makes up for its lackluster speed through design customization and helpful tricks like Touchless Control. To us, that puts LG in an awkward middle. While the G2's performance is almost beyond compare, many of its software features aren't all that unique -- those who aren't sold on its performance could easily be lured away.
