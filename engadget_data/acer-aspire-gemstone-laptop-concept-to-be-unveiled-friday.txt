The "Gemstone concept" is apparently a new Acer Aspire laptop line, or so it seems -- the promo material is a bit obtuse. It could very well look totally gaudy, but we suppose we'll find out on Friday, and it's pretty much impossible to look much more ridiculous than Acer's Ferrari lineup, so how can we lose?[Thanks, Olivier]
