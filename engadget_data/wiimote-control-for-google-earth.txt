There's nothing too complicated going on here, with just the requisite GlovePIE software (the Wiimote's new best friend) and the Google Earth script written by the star of today's video, J. Coulston, needed to take the world in your hands. Once you've got that up and running, you'll be able to impress your friends and navigate the globe with the flip of your wrist. Just don't get too excited when you spot your neighborhood. You know what can happen.[Thanks, Jesse E.]
