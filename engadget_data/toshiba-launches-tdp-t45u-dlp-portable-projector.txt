The XGA DLP projector has a 2000:1 contrast ratio, 2500 ANSI lumen brightness, 6.6 pound weight, composite, component, S-Video, and "two computer inputs" (thanks -- they actually mean two VGA) for a $1,200 slim. Click on for some more pics of the little bugger your boss to make you start carrying one starting late next month.[Via AboutProjectors]
