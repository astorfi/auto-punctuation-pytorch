Such is the case with the Wow-Pen Joy, a new mouse that conforms to the hand like a pen would, apparently making your computing experience a little less tough on the wrists. Although it resembles one of your clay sculptures from elementary school, the twisted lump of plastic sports 800 dpi resolution and can be jacked right into any XP or Vista machine. We can't promise this will actually help with the chronic, stabbing wrist pain caused by your "regular" mouse (see inset), though we can tell you it won't break the bank at 20,000 KRW, or about $30.
