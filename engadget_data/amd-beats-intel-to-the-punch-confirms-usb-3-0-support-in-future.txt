 When a leaked document strongly suggests that Intel's upcoming Panther Point chipset will support USB 3.0, AMD's not going to take that cheery news lying down. Not even a day later, the underdog chip maker has confirmed that its A75 and A70M Fusion chipsets will support the standard protocol, which claims speeds ten times faster than USB 2.0. No word on when that'll happen, or whether AMD will beat Chipzilla to market -- but if nothing else it can brag about being first out of the gate with an official plan. Huzzah!
