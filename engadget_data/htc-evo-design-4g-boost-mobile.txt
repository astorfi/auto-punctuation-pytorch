It's reporting that the HTC Evo Design 4G will be landing on the prepay network before the end of this quarter. It was running Gingerbread when we first got our hands on it, but will apparently be landing with Ice Cream Sandwich squeezed into its 1.2GHz single-core configuration. It's been a while since a new smartphone was offered up to the Boost faithful, so when the EVO 4G turns up it should be king of the pile, though we're not sure if it'll be asking an equally regal ransom when it does so.
