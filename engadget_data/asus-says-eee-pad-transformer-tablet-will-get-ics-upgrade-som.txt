Speaking with Pocket-lint, an ASUS rep said that the Eee Pad Transformer "will be getting [the] update to ICS," but that the company "can't provide a schedule at this stage." Still no word from other Honeycomb tablet manufacturers, unfortunately, but we'll keep you posted. Of course, this also leads us to believe that the freshly-unveiled Transformer Prime will likely have Android 4.0 right from the factory, but we'll have to wait (presumably, anyway) until November 9th to know for sure.
