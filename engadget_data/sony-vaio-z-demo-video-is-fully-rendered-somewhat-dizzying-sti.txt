We've had a chance to briefly see one in person, but still found ourselves oddly entranced by the promotional video embedded for your pleasure after the break. It shows a rendered Z floating about in space, flaunting its various assets (backlit keyboard, switchable graphics, side-talkin' power button) before ending with a branding slogan that's so powerful you just can't help but reach for that credit card: The Executive Decision. Yeah, we're getting chills here, too -- but that's probably because someone left the door to the trailer open again.
