       Fans of open wheel racing rejoice, ESPN and ABC have announced they will broadcast all 16 events of 2008 in high definition. Just like ESPN's "most advanced" NASCAR coverage, all the cameras covering the event will be HD, including in-car. The 16 races will consist of seven each aired on ESPN2 and ABC, two on ESPN, as well as 16 Indy Pro Series races that will air on ESPN2-HD. Last year's Indianapolis 500 was the first IndyCar event in HD and now its far from the last. ESPNews, ESPN U, X Games and now IndyCar have gotten the 720p treatment, we just want to know what they will do next.
