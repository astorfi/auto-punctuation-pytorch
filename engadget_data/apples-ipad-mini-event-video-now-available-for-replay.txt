 
 Apple decided to broadcast its event live this time around (provided you had an appropriate Apple device), but those that missed it as it happened expectedly aren't out of luck. The company has made the video of the event available for replay at your leisure, although you'll once again need to view it in either the new Events channel on your Apple TV or in Safari on OS X 10.6 or later (at the source link below). Of course, you can also catch up with the event courtesy of our liveblog for our own running commentary on the proceedings.
