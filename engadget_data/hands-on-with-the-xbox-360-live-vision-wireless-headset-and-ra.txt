We also got to take a look at the Live Vision, Wireless Headset, Racing Wheel and Wireless Gaming Receiver up close and in person. Unfortunately for us, we were told these were all hand-built product mockups that apparently wouldn't withstand the wear and tear of a thousand or more press and partners manhandlings with chubby greasy party hands. Well, who cares, we touched the headsets anyway and they felt pretty nice, fairly light, if not a little fragile. Guess that's what we get for playing with the mockups though, right?

Yep, it's the same camera we've been seeing, well, for a long time now.The Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver didn't get much play at the press conference, but it's a small device you will use to connect any RF wireless Xbox device with your PC (i.e. headset, wireless controller, etc.).Yeah, don't touch, we get it.The Racing Wheel is wireless if you use the battery packs, but if you want rumble you have to plug it in. Bummer, man.This thing clamps it to the desk, obvs.The girls of PMS were situated throughout the event at World Championship of Poker kiosks with avatars of themselves going all in... or whatever it is poker players do.Just in case you were wondering what the pool area looked like.
