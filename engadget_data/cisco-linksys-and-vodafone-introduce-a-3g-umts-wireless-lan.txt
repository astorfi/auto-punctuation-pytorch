Cisco-Linksys and Vodafone have teamed up to provide a high-speed internet solution for situations where wired
connections are simply unavailable.Â Although not
the first of its kind, the new 3G/UMTS WLAN router (really a Vodafone Mobile Connect 3G data card inside a Linksys
WRT54G3G Wireless-G Router) interests us because Vodafone is involved in the type of product that would seem to ruffle
the feathers of their corporate step-child Verizon. This new take on the 3G router allows up to five users to
simultaneously access the Vodafone network from their WiFi-enabled laptops, while also hooking up other devices such as
printers to form a decent make-shift office. The 3G router is being marketed towards mobile professionals in the media,
finance and construction industries, although we wouldn't mind using it for impromptu LAN parties in airports, hotels,
or anywhere else we can snub overpriced WiFi.
