It's no secret that European Commission regulators  dislike roaming charges. However, The Guardian now hears from sources that the Commission may propose legislation next week that eliminates those charges altogether. Carriers would reportedly have to charge the same service rates in every European Union country, forming alliances in nations where they don't operate. Networks that don't scrap roaming fees by July 2014 would also have to give customers a choice of foreign providers. Subscribers wouldn't even have to swap SIM cards or phone numbers, according to The Guardian. A spokesman for the Commission's Neelie Kroes declined comment on the rumor, but noted that the agency wants roaming "out of the market" -- clearly, the cellular status quo won't last for long.
