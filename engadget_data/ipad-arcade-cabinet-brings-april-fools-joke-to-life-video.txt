Inspired by the iCade cabinet -- an April Fools' joke that had most of us asking where we could buy one -- this really real arcade cabinet integrates Apple's slate, hooks it up to a set of old school controls, and lets users go to town with such old timer classics as Mr. Do! It's still in prototype form, hence the boxy exterior, but the action on screen is looking as good as you'd expect. See it on video after the break.
