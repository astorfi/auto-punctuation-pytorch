Over at the Roku forums, an official has made clear that demand was exceptional and the pool of private beta testers has now been chosen. Sadly, there's no mention of when Roku plans on sharing the love with the public at large, but Dave Zatz has appropriately pointed out that YouTube could be following close behind. Still, we have to concur that the most pressing question has yet to be answered: will this Amazon VOD be offered up in glorious high-def? Pretty please?[Via ZatzNotFunny]
