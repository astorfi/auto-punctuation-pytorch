The new HP Pavilion dv6z Quad notebook -- one of 11 new Fusion-powered models from HP -- is a case in point, having just arrived at the company's online store. The base model promises battery life of up to almost six hours, "discrete-class" integrated Radeon graphics with 512MB of video memory, and a 1.4GHz quad-core processor that can be clocked up to 2.3GHz using AMD's Turbo technology. Oh yeah, and there's the real benefit of switching to AMD: that base configuration costs just $650, versus a minimum of $999 for the Intel-equipped dv6t. For the money, you'll also get 6GB of DDR3 memory, a 640GB 5400rpm HDD, a 1366 x 768 display (yes, a glossy one), HDMI output, and a pair of USB 3.0 ports in addition to two of the USB 2.0 variety. We ought to clarify that the sexy steel gray version on the left will cost you $25 extra, but hey, who wants to be "umber gray?"
