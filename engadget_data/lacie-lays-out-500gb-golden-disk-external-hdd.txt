The Golden Disk itself is an exclusive designed by French designer Ora-√èto, and includes 500GB of storage, PC / Mac compatibility, a USB 2.0 interface, and LaCie's own 1-Click backup software to boot. Not much else to mention besides the price, so go on and get your $189 ready for an October landing, ya heard?[Via Pocket-Lint]
