Targeted ads have popped up in Facebook, Instagram and Twitter feeds as well as inside mobile apps and more. That said, it shouldn't really be a surprise that Google has seemingly explored the possibilities of beaming those advertising bits to some rather unique places. In a letter to the Securities and Exchange commission concerning mobile revenue disclosure, the folks in Mountain View said flashing ads and services on "refrigerators, car dashboards, thermostats, glasses, and watches" is quite plausible. This isn't a huge leap as many items on that list are powered by Android to some degree, and Google nabbing up Nest back in January locks down the remainder. Audi, Honda and other auto makers have ported the mobile OS into vehicles, Android Wear is set to sort smartwatches and we've being seeing smart friges and ovens at CES for years now. And of course, Google Glass. So when you're AC craps out in the heat summer, perhaps that learning thermostat will show you the best local HVAC contractor in the near future.


Update: Google offered the following comment on the matter:



""We are in contact with the SEC to clarify the language in this 2013 filing, which does not reflect Google's product roadmap. Nest, which we acquired after this filing was made, does not have an ads-based model and has never had any such plans."
