Nobody can talk about the 'shell (as we refer to it) without praising its handsome exterior, and with good reason, too: even if you're not a fan of a curvy, thinned-out approach, it is most definitely refreshing to see a netbook that doesn't just look like... every other netbook. We decided to take the newest ASUS for a spin, comparing it to the netbook we're friendliest with -- the HP Mini 1000 -- to see how they stack up against one another. Could we swim through the blackened, dark abyss of netbook confusion and emerge with a clearer sense of ourselves? Does clarity come at a cost? Can the 10.1-inch Seashell fulfill all of our netbook dreams? Join us after the break for our musings.
