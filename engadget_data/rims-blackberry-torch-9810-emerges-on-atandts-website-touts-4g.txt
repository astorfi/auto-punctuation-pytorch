The same BlackBerry Torch 2 that we previewed back in June has made the trek over to Ma Bell's network, with a 'Coming Soon' page emerging just moments ago. AT&T claims that this is the world's first 4G BlackBerry on its airwaves, but of course, that asterisk upside the "4G" logo couldn't possibly be more telling. Regardless, the full-featured slider will arrive with BlackBerry 7 OS, a full QWERTY keyboard, sliding display, 1.2GHz processor, 8GB of onboard memory, room for 32GB of expandable storage, 720p video capture, inbuilt WiFi and support for the carrier's HSPA+ network. Mum's the word on a price and release, but you can tap that source link to get signed up for more.

Update: It's official!
