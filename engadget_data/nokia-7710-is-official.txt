This one's been an open secret for months now, but Nokia has finally formally introduced the
7710, their new multimedia-centric smartphone that'll be
the very first handset to run on their new Series 90 software (the 7700 was supposed to have been the first one, but
they ended up killing it before it ever came out). No keypad, but you do get a nice, big, widescreen LCD, a one
megapixel digital camera, FM tuner (with Nokia's new Visual Radio software), Bluetooth, an optional DVB-H mobile
digital TV attachment (it's mainly European thing), and, perhaps most importantly of all, no sidetalkin'! Click to see
a bunch more photos.
