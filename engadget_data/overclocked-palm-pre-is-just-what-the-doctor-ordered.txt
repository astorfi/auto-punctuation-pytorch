This custom kernel, demonstrated in a video below, comes courtesy of two hackers called unixpsycho and caj2008. One quick install will make your dull and lifeless 1.3.5.1 Pre come alive. Warning: use of this software may "frakk" your Pre if deployed on a 1.4 device. Side effects include reduced battery life and increased pocket warmth. If your Pre develops excessive heat see a doctor immediately -- or just turn it off for awhile.

Update: caj2008 dropped us a note to point out that battery life is "not significantly affected" by this patch, but we're still waiting on the FDA ruling on that one.
