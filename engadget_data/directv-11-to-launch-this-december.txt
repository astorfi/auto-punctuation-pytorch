 Hot on the heels of the successful launch of DirecTV 10, it seems that the next satellite has already been dated for takeoff. According to Spaceflight Now, the "Sea Launch Zenit 3SL rocket will carry the DirectTV 11 direct-to-home television broadcast satellite" into orbit, where it will then be used to disseminate HDTV broadcasts to subscribers. The calendar was updated on July 15th, and current estimates peg the launch to take place sometime in December. You won't find us complaining about a delightful Christmas gift from DirecTV -- in the form of more HD channels, of course.[Via SatelliteGuys]
