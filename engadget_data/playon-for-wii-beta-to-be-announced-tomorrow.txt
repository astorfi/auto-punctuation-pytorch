The software license runs $39.99, but there is a 14-day free trial -- so you can see for yourself whether or not it makes sense to tie up your console with re-runs of CSI: Miami when you could be better off shakin' your groove thing to Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party. Hit the read link and decide for yourself.
