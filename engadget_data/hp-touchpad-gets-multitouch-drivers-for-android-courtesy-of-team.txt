Yet, with the future of webOS in flux, crowds have clamored to get Google's green bots on the woebegone tablet. Last week, Team-Touchdroid gave the TouchPad a slice of Gingerbread, and now it's delivered full 10-point multitouch as well. Of course, the video below only shows it doing the trick on a testing app, but it's a good start. Shouldn't be long now before you TouchPad owners can get touchy-feely with any Android app your hearts desire.
