Spring in New York and and the unmistakable sign that Sony's PRS-500 Portable Reader is set to launch. Er, or so we were thought until we took another peep at the SonyStyle site which now features a "late Summer 2006" availability for the 6-inch, E Ink reader. Ah well, by then we may have lost our Reader jones after spending the summer in the Engadget Hamptons' hideaway listening to interns whisper verse from ancient texts.
