Android on laptops is normally reserved for hybrid devices or units no bigger than 10 inches. If this leaked video is correct, however, then HP is planning to launch an Android laptop with a 14-inch display. The clip, found by Notebook Italia, shows a Slatebook 14 with a 1080p display, controlled by a quad-core NVIDIA chip and running a recent build of Google's mobile OS. The video also shows that the Android soft keys will remain on the bottom of the screen, as well as adding them to the keyboard where you'd normally find the Esc and Windows keys. There's not much more than that to go on right now, but we've pinged HP to find out if this is really coming, or just the hopeful fantasy of someone who really hates Chromebooks.



You've got a Windows laptop, MacBook, or Chromebook. Do you need an Android one too?
