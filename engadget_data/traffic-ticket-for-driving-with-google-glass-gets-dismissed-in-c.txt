Pay attention to the road. At least, until the cars are able to drive themselves. That's the rule, and it was probably one of the reasons why Google Glass early-adopter Cecilia Abadie got ticketed for donning the wearable at the wheel. It was a second citation, alongside speeding, although it was dismissed by San Diego Court Commissioner John Blair, noting that: "There is no testimony it was operating or in use while Ms. Abadie was driving." However, he did say earlier that Google's wearable did however, fall "within the purview and intent" of the state's ban on driving with a monitor. This particular case might have been dismissed on lack of evidence, but we reckon those wider implications (and resultant legal tussles) are far from over.
