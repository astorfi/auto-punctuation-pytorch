Orb Networks opened up their API a
few days ago, they must have figured out that loosening up and letting developers (and the rest of us) create
third-party plug-ins for their placeshifting app is an easy way to add value and make their product even more
attractive to customers (Sony, are you listening?). Anyway, one of the best we've seen yet is a TiVoToGo add-on called
TiVoAnywhere that'll let you remotely access shows recorded on your TiVo (as well as schedule recordings) from any
Orb-compatible device (which used to include just PCs and smartphones that had Windows Media Player, but they've
recently expanded compatibility to add support for RealPlayer and a few other players).
