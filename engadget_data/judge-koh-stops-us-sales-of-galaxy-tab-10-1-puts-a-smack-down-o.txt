Well, Apple appealed that decision and was given a second crack at banning Sammy's slate last month -- and it looks like Cupertino made the most of the opportunity, as Reuters reports that Judge Koh has granted Cupertino's request to enjoin the sales of the Galaxy Tab 10.1. Details are scarce at the moment, but we do know it's only a preliminary injunction, meaning if Samsung's ultimately victorious in the case, the injunction will lift and it'll be free to peddle its wares once again. Still, it's certainly bad news for the Korean company, but given its expansive stable of other slates still on sale combined with its recent economic performance, we're sure Samsung can weather the storm while the courtroom fireworks continue.

 Update 1: All Things D got a copy of Koh's order, and we just gave it a quick read. Turns out that she granted the injunction due to the strength of the merits of Apple's case and the unlikelihood that Samsung would invalidate Apple's design patent -- the court already held that the 10.1 is "virtually indistinguishable" from the iPad's design and likely infringes Apple's IP. Furthermore, Judge Koh held that, because Apple and Samsung are direct competitors in the tablet space and "design mattered more to customers in making tablet purchases," Apple would be irreparably harmed by further 10.1 sales. Those two factors outweighed any hardship suffered by Samsung, and thus, the Galaxy Tab 10.1 was stricken from US shelves.

 Update 2: Well, that didn't take long -- a mere five hours after Judge Koh's order, Samsung filed an appeal, according to Foss Patents.
