It still probably won't be you. Apple is courting enterprise IT departments to test out the 2.0 beta in a new "iPhone Enterprise Beta Program," but there are quite a few restrictions and caveats, with an extensive application form and no guarantee of success. If you get into the program, you'll get to test out all those new enterprise features announced today, and provide Apple with feedback on how awesome everything is.
