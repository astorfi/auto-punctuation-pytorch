The sequel to one of Verizon's most enduring brands will, as promised, set you back $150 on contract once you've taken advantage of that $50 rebate. Its name already reinforces what's new in data speeds, but if the heat of summer has left your memory hazy about everything else, just remember that it's the closest the carrier will get in the near future to having a One series phone. The most incredible of Droids has a Snapdragon S4, 960 x 540 screen, 8-megapixel camera and Sense 4.0 like the One S over at T-Mobile. What's lost in the lower 1.2GHz clock speed and dropping the speedy ImageSense chip is gained through a more pleasing Super LCD, a removable battery and a micro-SD slot.
