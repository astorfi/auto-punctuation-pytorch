At $5,499, the box is no steal, but it's plenty of frills, including Dell's new H2C cooling system we heard about earlier, which works a bit like a car radiator, with a fluid chiller with ceramic-based thermoelectric cooling to keep it all frosty. Dell also squeezed in an Intel Core Extreme QX6700 quad-core processor, which is factory overclocked to 3.2GHz, dual NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTX graphics cards, 4GB of 667MHz DDR2 memory, a pair of 160GB 10,000rpm HDDs with room for two more, dual optical drive (Blu-ray was mentioned in the keynote, but it doesn't sound like it made it into the base configuration), plus Dell is tossing in a 2007WFP 20-inch display and Dell AS501 flat-panel speakers. Since this is a whole gaming package -- apparently consumers go for that whole bundle thing -- Dell is including a Razer Tarantula keyboard and Razer Copperhead mouse. No mention of Vista, though: it's XP Media Center 2005 all the way here. Should be shipping now.
