The slab of external magnetic storage is set to cost Â¥15,540 or about $172 should it ever ship Stateside. Unfortunately, Microsoft isn't revealing its plans for that at the moment while conceding the need for more local storage for content such as software, TV shows, and movies downloaded from the Xbox Live Marketplace. In other words, you'll get your storage bump... someday.
