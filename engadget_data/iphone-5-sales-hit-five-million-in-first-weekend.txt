 So, how's that new iPhone doing? Not too shabby -- looks like Apple's moved more than 5 million in three days, according to a press release the company just dropped. Cupertino is also reporting that iOS 6 has been installed on more than 100 million devices since the operating system was unleashed on the world. At present, the iPhone is available in the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Australia, with 22 more countries being added to the list before the end of the week. By the end of the year, the number is expected to top 100. Check out the obligatory back-patting by Tim Cook and pals in the presser after the break.

We appreciate everyone's patience and are working hard to build enough iPhone 5s for everyone."
  iPhone 5 is the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever, completely redesigned to feature a stunning new 4-inch Retina(TM) display; an Apple-designed A6 chip for blazing fast performance; and ultrafast wireless technology*--all while delivering even better battery life.**
