 In what we're hopinggets no one wants turned into Engadget Mobile's version of the "cellphones are dangerous/notdangerous" saga, a new study released by International Data Corp (IDC) of Internet users in Australia, Hong Kong,Malaysia, China, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan claims that less that 10% of cellphone owners use non-voicefeatures other than text messaging. This study would seem to corroborate an earlier one of U.S.Internet users by InsightExpress showing that less than 25% of Americans express an interest in watching TV on theircellphones- but also contradicts a Nokia-sponsored study ofEuropeans, whose optimistic results could have nothing to do with the fact the Nokia wants to sell people DVB-Hhandsets. The IDC study also showed, unsurprisingly, that SMS remains a popular feature among the mobile crowd, with65% of those surveyed sending text messages every day.[Via textually]
