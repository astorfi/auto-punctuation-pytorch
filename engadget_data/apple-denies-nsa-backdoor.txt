While it may feel we're more at the stage where we're counting the parts of our digital lives that the NSA can't access, the revelation yesterday that the agency had relatively deep access to iPhones was still a shock to many. Apple included, it seems, prompting it to issue a statement to AllThingsD denying any involvement in the NSA's program, explaining it has never worked or cooperated with the NSA to create a backdoor on any of its products -- though it does comply with official requests. The same statement goes on to claim that it will work to close any vulnerabilities in its software, no matter who it might be that is exploiting them. Apple is far from the first large tech company to have its products and services targeted by the NSA, and we suspect it's only a matter of time before even more come to light. You can read the complete statement past the break.



Apple has never worked with the NSA to create a backdoor in any of our products, including iPhone. Additionally, we have been unaware of this alleged NSA program targeting our products. We care deeply about our customers' privacy and security. Our team is continuously working to make our products even more secure, and we make it easy for customers to keep their software up to date with the latest advancements. Whenever we hear about attempts to undermine Apple's industry-leading security, we thoroughly investigate and take appropriate steps to protect our customers. We will continue to use our resources to stay ahead of malicious hackers and defend our customers from security attacks, regardless of who's behind them.
