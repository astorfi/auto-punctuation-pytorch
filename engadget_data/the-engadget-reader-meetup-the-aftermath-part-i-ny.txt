Whoa, it was crazy! Over two hundred people showed up for our first reader meetup, and we were seriously feeling the
love. After a 40 minute Q&A with us Engadget editors, we gave some of that love back in the form of a couple
thousand dollars worth of stuff (we won't go into the specifics out of respect for our readers who couldn't make it).
First, we'd like to say thanks so very much to the people out there who found the time to make it out last night!
Honestly, your support was completely unbelievable. We'd also like to thank everyone who took pictures for us, which
you can see a gallery of below. We'd really really like to thank Anjie, Liz, Barb, and Yoshimi for their help!
Then there's Kiho, who let us totally blow Compact-Impact wide open for
this thing. Last of all, we're thanking all you guys who read the site and make it possible. Here's to another great 15
months! Tons of pictures, so click on!
