A fresh version of Tumblr just hit iOS devices less than a week ago, but now the Yahoo-owned service is pushing out a newer release with "a very important security update." Not only is the outfit recommending that users download the tweaked app immediately, but it's also asking folks to change their password on Tumblr and on any other service they use the same passphrase. There's no mention of a breach or exactly what the new code patches up, but we'll keep you in the proverbial loop as we learn more.


Update: We've gotten word from Tumblr that it was notified of a security vulnerability and immediately dispatched the update to remedy the issue. Hit the break to read the outfit's entire statement.



Earlier today, Tumblr was notified of a security vulnerability introduced in our iOS app. We immediately released an update that repairs the issue and are notifying affected users. We obviously take these incidents very seriously and deeply regret this error.
