The series ends with an excellent comparison of LCoS against CRT, LCD, plasma, and DLP displaytechnologies. Ok, it's no surprise to find LCoS offering the highest resolutions and non-CRT contrast ratios whileproviding the best flicker and artifact-free images of any display technology. Still it's good to get it allside-by-side which might help in that next trip down the A/V aisle. Sure, 4 of the 5 units reviewed were prototypes soit's best to think of the series as a tech review, not a buyers guide, mkay? But just in case you were wondering, thewinner of the five display shootout was that monster JVC Professional 1080 priced at uh, $45,000 dollars. Kind of hurtsdon't it?
