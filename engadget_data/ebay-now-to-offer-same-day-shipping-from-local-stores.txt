Local eBay users have started receiving beta invites for eBay Now, an iOS app that will allow shoppers to pick up items from local stores without leaving the house. eBay is offering beta users $15 off of their first order and free same-day delivery for their first three. Orders will come with a $5 delivery charge once the freebies are used up, forcing users to weigh the value of their time against the frustrations of local parking. The service is only available in San Francisco at the moment, but feel free to hit up the source link below to toss your name in the Beta raffle bucket anyway.
