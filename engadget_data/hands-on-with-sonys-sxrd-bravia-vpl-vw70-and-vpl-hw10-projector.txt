The VPL-VW70 and VPL-HW10 projectors didn't look all that different than previous units in the family, with smooth lines, a rather large body and all of the ports conveniently tucked on one side. At $8,000 and $3,500 (respectively), they ain't cheap, but even those tags are minuscule compared to similar units just a few years back. Have a closer look in the gallery below.
