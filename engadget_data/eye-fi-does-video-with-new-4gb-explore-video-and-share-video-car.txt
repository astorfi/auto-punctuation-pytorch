 
Just like Eye-Fi promised in January, the WiFi SD card maker is adding video sharing to its repertoire. The new Explore Video and Share Video cards bring video sharing and 4GB capacities to the existing photo sharing lineup. The new cards go for $99 and $79, respectively, while the old 2GB Eye-Fi Home and Eye-Fi Share cards have been marked down to $49 and $59 each. The cards can handle uploads to YouTube and Flickr, and are built for HD uploads, and naturally the Explore card adds the hotspot service and geotagging on top of regular service. You can pre-order the cards today, and they should be shipping by the end of the month. Eye-Fi is also releasing a free iPhone app (as promised) this week, which works with your existing Eye-Fi account (yeah, you need to own a card) and allows you to upload iPhone shots to the same 25 services the SD cards work with, along with the computer syncing Eye-Fi is known for.
