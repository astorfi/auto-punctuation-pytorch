Verizon's flagship Moto X will release on August 23rd, according to a leaked road map obtained by PhoneArena. The site also notes that Motorola's first handset built in the US gives users who order online the choice of separate colors for the back cover and trim and can also be engraved a la iPods and Zune HDs of yore; brick and mortar retail models will be standard black. The document also lists an August 1st release date for the HTC One, a phone we still have a soft spot for. We've reached out to the Big Red carrier for confirmation and will update this post accordingly should we hear back.
