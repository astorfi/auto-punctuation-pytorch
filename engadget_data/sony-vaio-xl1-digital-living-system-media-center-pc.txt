Well Sony is swinging around those new VAIO X Media
Center boxes we mentioned a bit ago. The VAIO XL1 Digital Living System includes HDMI video out, WiFi, an external
DVD changer, and a wireless keyboard with track pad. PC Magazine has the review, and they're definite fans: they say
it's got more inputs and outputs than any other Media Center they've spied,
and the 200 disc DVD changer can rip through 200 CDs automatically, or burn 200 blank DVDs without monitoring. There's
a catch though: just one analog TV tuner. Well, that and Sony'll take a hefty sum of money off your hands while they're
at it â€” $2300 will net you the set.
