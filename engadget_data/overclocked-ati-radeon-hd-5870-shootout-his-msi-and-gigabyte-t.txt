In the months since that original debut, we've seen an Eyefinity 6 Edition hit the market for multi-monitor maniacs, and quite a few factory overclocked options have also made their way out. The benchmarking gurus over at Hot Hardware scrounged up three of the latest and greatest, all priced just below the $500 mark, which have core clock speeds that are 100MHz higher than standard and memory clock speeds that are up 50MHz above the norm. Cards from MSI, HIS and Gigabyte were represented, and while each of 'em put up a better-than-average fight, the latter card came out on top in nearly every single test. Gigabyte's Super Overclock technology tended to outperform the other OC'ing solutions, but the whole lot managed to show up the non-overclocked alternatives by a good bit. Still, you'll be forced to pay a 25 percent premium for an 11 to 16 percent boost in performance, so these are still probably best for enthusiasts who can't stand to leave a single frame behind. Peep that source if you're in need of more coaching before pulling the trigger either way.
