There's going to be no escaping the World Cup when travelling on the Tube over the coming weeks. To supplement Virgin Media's WiFi hotspots, which'll let you check scores on your phone, ESPN has linked up with Transport for London (TfL) to bring scrolling news, results and score updates to platform screens and entrances in more than 140 stations. The sports broadcaster is said to have stumped up around Â£100,000 for the privilege, and will kick off proceedings on June 12th, when hosts Brazil meet Croatia, continuing until July 14th, the day after the World Cup final. If you find yourself heading out in London to catch some of England's late-night matches, you'll almost certainly be reminded of the team's performances (whether they're good or bad) on your way home.
