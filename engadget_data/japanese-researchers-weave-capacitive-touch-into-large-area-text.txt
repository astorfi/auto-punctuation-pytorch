The results is a big old cloth that can sense your loving touch and inform nearby computers of what you're up to. Initial uses envisioned by the research outfit include implementation in hospitals to monitor bedridden patients, but the ultimate goal is to make this extra-sensitive array a wearable accoutrement. Wouldn't that be lovely?
