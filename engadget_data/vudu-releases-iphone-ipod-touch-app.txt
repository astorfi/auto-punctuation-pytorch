 
VUDU keeps on rolling with new additions and this week it's an application for all those iPhone and iPod Touch owners. The free download allows you to browse or search the selection -- something that previously required a VUDU, or registered users could do on VUDU.com. It works pretty fast over 3G and even allows you to queue up rentals or purchases on the go -- nice. But it seems there isn't a way to add things to your wish list or to even rate titles; and worst of all, you can't use it as a remote for your VUDU -- which probably wouldn't be as useful as it is cool.
