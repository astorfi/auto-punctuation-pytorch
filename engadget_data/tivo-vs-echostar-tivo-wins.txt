 We still find the timeliness of the case a little dubious, but it certainly didn't take very long for a winner tobe determined in TiVo'spatent suit against EchoStar -- the jury apparently voted in favor of the plaintiff. What this means in terms ofhard numbers we don't yet know, but it sounds like TiVo's going tohave a windfall of technology licensing fees due their way sometime soon. P.S. To our TiVo stock holdingfans, an interesting tidbit: your stock, as of this writing, is up almost 20%. Damn.[Via Zatz Not Funny]
