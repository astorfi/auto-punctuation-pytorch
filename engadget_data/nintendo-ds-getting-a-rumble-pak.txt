Is the Nintendo DS getting a
Rumble Pak attachment? The DS does have that Game Boy Advance card slot that's just begging to be messed with, and
Planet GameCube reports that at E3 last week several of the DS consoles running playable demos of Metroid Prime:
Pinball had rumbling GBA Option Paks popped into them. No word on whether these'll be packaged with various games or
sold separately or both.
