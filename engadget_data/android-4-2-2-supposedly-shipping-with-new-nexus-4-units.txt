 Google has a tendency to post minor Android updates on devices and timetables we wouldn't entirely expect. We might just be witnessing a repeat: both Brazil's Adrenaline and Malaysia's Lowyat.net claim to have seen newly shipping Nexus 4s with an as yet unannounced Android 4.2.2. What's new in the extra 0.0.1's worth of code isn't immediately evident, although the update (if real) isn't known to be rolling out as a separate upgrade for existing devices. We've reached out to Google for comment; let us know if you see any 4.2.2-based surprises in the interim.
