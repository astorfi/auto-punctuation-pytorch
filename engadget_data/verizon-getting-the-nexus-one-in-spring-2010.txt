At a purchase page that went live during the company's product launch event in Mountain View, users are notified that the phone will soon be available on America's largest carrier. Two things are immediately interesting here -- for starters, it's not coming (right away, at least) to bump heads with the iPhone on AT&T, and secondly, Google is openly suggesting that you buy Motorola's (as in, not HTC's) Droid now if you just can't wait a day longer for some of that Android goodness. If AT&T wasn't scared, it should be now.
