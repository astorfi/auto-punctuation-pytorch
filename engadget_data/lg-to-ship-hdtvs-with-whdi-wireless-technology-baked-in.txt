LG has previously shipped HDTVs with WirelessHD technology built in, but today the company is announcing a new partnership with AMIMON. The reason for the ruckus? The outfit is fixing to ship a wireless HDTV product line with second-generation WHDI technology built in, enabling 1080p content to be sent from a source to the HDTV sans wires over a 5GHz unlicensed band. Mum's the word on what sets will have WHDI baked in, but we'll be sure to dig up anything we can once the show floor opens up here in Vegas. In related news, 15 other companies have decided to drink the WHDI Kool-Aid, and you can read more on that whole shindig after the break.
