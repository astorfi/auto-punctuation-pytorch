We know how Facebook imagines it'll work in VR, but what about the rest of the internet? Google's Brandon Jones has announced that he's working on a way to add virtual reality support for Oculus Rift and Cardboard into Chrome. It's the second browser to champion WebVR, since the platform has been seeded into experimental builds of Firefox over the last week. Of course, the internet won't be a city you can walk through, but Jones believes that 360-degree product shots and interactive exhibits should be reasonably easy to create and use. It's still a long way away from being ready for consumers to use, but we have to admit -- surfing the 'net would be wayyy radder if it was done in Virtuality. Wait, is this 1994?
