Intent on keeping both wedding videographers and indie film makers happy, it all starts with the $17,500 RED ONE base system (center). From there you can add your choice of the $1,250 Basic or $2,750 Premium production packs (top right and left, respectively). But don't stop now, go ahead and throw down for a $1,650 RED ONE Power Pack featuring 2x RED BRICK 140Wh batteries and charger, a $1,950 RED Electronic Viewfinder, and the $1,700 5.6-inch LCD. Optics accessories include a $3,500 B4 lens adapter and both Canon and Nikkor 35mm photo mounts costing $500 each. There are also several RED branded media accessories for CF, SATA disk, and something called the "RED RAM 64GB" for $4,500 -- extortionate if that's just a RED-branded SSD in an external housing. But hey, no one said that a 4k resolution and 60p frame rate would come cheap. [Thanks, Blayne G.]
