But, don't fret noble gamer, and don't lament about trading that console in for $15 store credit a few years back. Just buy a new TV! Sony's KDL-22PX300 LCD has a rather hunky base that conceals a fully working PlayStation 2. That console is fully backwards compatible with O.G. PlayStation games and naturally also plays DVDs but, if that isn't enough pixels for you, four HDMI ports await the clumsy probes of cables from sources that can better handle the ways of its 720p panel. The set can also serve up video from Sony's Bravia service over Ethernet or an optional wireless dongle. It's priced at Â£200 in the UK, which is just a tick over $300 and, honestly, not too bad a deal. No word on an American release, but it'll need a SCART-ectomy before that happens.
