Available in 4GB and 8GB varieties to start with (a 16GB model will be following in Q4), the drives are one-fourth the size of a standard 1.8-inch hard drive and boast all the low-power requirements you'd expect, which Intel says should translate to a hefty boost in battery life. There's no word as to how much the drives might add or subtract from the price of those aforementioned netbooks or "nettops" though, but it seems like we should be finding that out soon enough if Intel has its way.
