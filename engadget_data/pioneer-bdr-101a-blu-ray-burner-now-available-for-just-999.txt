  It's received some good reviews, can record 25GB onto a single-layer Blu-ray disc in 45 minutes, and now it's available for purchase -- if you've got a grand to spare. We're talking, of course, about Pioneer's BDR-101A Blu-ray burner, one of the first products of its kind to hit store shelves. The 2X E-IDE internal burner for PCs is now available from Tiger Direct for $999.99, and the etailer claims it will ship units in "7-21 days." Start clicking if you just can't bear to wait. And don't forget to budget an extra $25 a pop for those blank BD-Rs.[Thanks, Alex]
