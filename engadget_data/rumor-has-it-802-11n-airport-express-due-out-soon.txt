 MacRumors is reporting that a long overdue 802.11n version of the Airport Express should be landing soon, possibly as early as this Tuesday. Apparently it'll run for the same $99, so keep an eye out for Apple Store downtime in a couple days.Update: TUAW's reporting the 802.11n Express also appeared on the Swiss Apple site, lending credence to the theory.
