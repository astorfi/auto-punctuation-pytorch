  It's been well over a month now since Apple suspended push email from its iCloud and MobileMe services, and it doesn't look like it will be switching them back on any time soon. According to the Wall Street Journal, a German regional court has backed the ban, upholding Motorola Mobility's claims of patent infringements. The court agreed that Apple must also pay damages to Motorola, but has yet to agree on an amount. So, for now, users will need to stick to manually fetching updates, and hope a final agreement can be met further down the line.
