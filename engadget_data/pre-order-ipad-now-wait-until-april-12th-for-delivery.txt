Those who coveted the iPad and pre-ordered anytime before today can still apparently expect a delivery by the original April 3rd launch date. Anyone that orders a WiFi model today, however, can expect to wait a little over a week, April 12th, to get an Apple tablet of his or her own, while the 3G-equipped units are guesstimated for late April. Have patience -- on the bright side, that gives more time to see apps that justify your larger-screen iPhone purchase.
