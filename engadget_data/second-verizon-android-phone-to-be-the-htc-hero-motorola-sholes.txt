 
 digg_url ='http://digg.com/hardware/Second_Verizon_Android_phone_to_be_the_HTC_Hero_Motorola_Sh';  Google and Verizon were awfully coy this morning regarding the upcoming Android devices that'll be launching on Big Red over the next few weeks, but you know, that certainly looks like a Verizon-branded HTC Hero in Eric's hand there, doesn't it? And over on the right, well, that's exactly what the Motorola Sholes looks like, isn't it? Cat's out of the bag, fellas -- might as well push up those launch dates.

P.S.- This also jibes perfectly with that HTC Desire rumor from last month, but we'd bet almost anything the internals are the same as the Hero.
