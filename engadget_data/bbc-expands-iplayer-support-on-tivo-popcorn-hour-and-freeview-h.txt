That includes living room connected entertainment options that support HTML and Flash like the Virgin Media TiVo, Popcorn Hour players from Syabas, and new HDTVs from Panasonic and Sony. Other areas of increased availability include users with BT Vision set-top boxes and Freeview HD users; the latter thanks to a recent spec update that supports the MHEG-5 standard the app is built upon. Now it operates just like other Red Button interactive TV services, and the first device shipping with support is a Freeview+ HD DVR from Sony (as seen above.) It doesn't look like the Where to Get BBC iPlayer page has been updated with all the new devices yet, but it should be sooner rather than later, although we're still wondering when the Xbox 360 will join the crowd.
