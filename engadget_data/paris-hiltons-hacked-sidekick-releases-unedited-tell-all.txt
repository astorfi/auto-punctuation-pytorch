Dude, could someone buy Paris Hilton an
OGO or a
Treo already? She had that
Sidekick
hacked once, and whether or not it's happened a second
time, someone's finally pulled the data and posted it all up online. They managed to dig up dirty camphone shots (right
alongside shots of her holding a baby and hanging out with kidsâ€”oh, Paris), her notebook, and her address book, which
has had such high-brow, mover-and-shaker entries as: Christina Aguilera, Devo Aoki, Fred Durst, Jermaine Dupri, Vicki
Gotti, Stephen King, David Lachappelle, Avril Lavigne, Lindsay Lohan, Bijou Phillips, Ashlee Simpson, Twiggy, Usher,
and Vin Diesel. (We have a feeling she might not be getting some of those digits again once they've changed.) Anyone
care to guess which ones she hasn't done a tape with?


 P.S. Nudity warning on link! Cover your eyes (but maybe peek just a little)!
