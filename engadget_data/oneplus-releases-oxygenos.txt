After a pretty sizable delay, OnePlus has at last released OxygenOS, its in-house version of Android 5.0 Lollipop. As promised back near the start of the year, this Cyanogen replacement is all about a "back to basics" approach that keeps things stock unless the startup thinks a new feature would be genuinely useful. Right now, that's largely limited to features you already had on your One: you can draw Oppo-style gestures to trigger functions when the screen is off, switch between hardware and software navigation keys and customize your quick-access settings. OxygenOS isn't for the faint of heart at this stage, since you'll have to be comfortable with installing ROMs (and likely put up with early bugs), but it's worth a shot if you want to catch a glimpse of OnePlus' software future.
