  In a move similar to the ones seen at fellow struggling Japanese electronics giants Sony and Panasonic, Sharp has announced a change at the top, swapping out president Mikio Katayama (kicked upstairs to the position of Director, Chairman) for current executive officer Takashi Okuda.

According to his biography he's been with the company since 1978, although your guess is as good as ours about what he can do to turn around the company's fortunes -- although getting that 8K Super Hi-Vision LCD into production ASAP would be a great start.
