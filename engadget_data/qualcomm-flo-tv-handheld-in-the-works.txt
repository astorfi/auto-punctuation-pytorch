The handheld device is alleged to feature a capacitive touchscreen, a swipe and gesture-driven UI, 4GB of memory, built-in stereo speakers, and enough juice for five hours of video, fifteen hours of music, or three hundred stand-by hours. Currently, FLO TV is only available on a limited number of phones, from the likes of AT&T and Verizon in the States, although the company has said that they're planning on bringing it to other phones (via add-on peripherals) including the iPhone and WinMo devices. Can we offer one word of advice? You might want to go with a name besides "Personal Television." Really, it sounds so very 2006.
