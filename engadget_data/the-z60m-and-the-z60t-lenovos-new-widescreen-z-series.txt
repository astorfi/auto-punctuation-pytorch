We managed to score a first look at Lenovo's new widescreen Z-Series ThinkPads earlier today (and in the process
also confirm that those pics we spotted of a widescreen
ThinkPad a few weeks ago were the real deal). The purists won't like that they're offering an optional titanium
cover for these new ThinkPads ("If it ain't black, send it back"), but the new wider screens will hopefully win over
those of you who couldn't deal with IBM's stubborn reluctance to release a laptop with anything but a 4:3 display. The
models we played with had pre-production specs, but we did notice that the Z60m had a 15-inch, 1280 x 800 pixel
display, while the Z60t had a 14-inch, 1280 x 768 pixel display. Best part: both new Z-Series ThinkPads will have
optional EV-DO internal modules (specifically, a Sierra Wireless EV-DO PCI-Express card) so you can have integrated
high-speed wireless broadband. Click to see a few more pics:
