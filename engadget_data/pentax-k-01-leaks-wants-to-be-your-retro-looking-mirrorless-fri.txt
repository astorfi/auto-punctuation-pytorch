  Above is a purported leak of Pentax's upcoming K-01 -- a retro-inspired mirrorless camera which is apparently set for reveal soon. Divulged in a bevy of official-looking shots on Pentax Forums, the diminutive shooter will apparently be available in several colors alongside its incredibly-thin 40mm f/2.8 pancake lens. Also shown are closeups of a dedicated HDR mode up-top, alongside dedicated red and green buttons, and a curious signature by designer Marc Newson adjacent to its battery cover. Perplexed by the sum of its parts like we are? Well, until Pentax reveals all, get a acquainted with it in the source links below.[Thanks, Ben]
