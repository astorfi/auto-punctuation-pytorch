First up the Alpha A55, pictured above with an apparent articulating display. According to the DChome forums, there's a 16.7 megapixel APS CMOS sensor, a translucent mirror, 15-point AF, 1080 / 60i video, 10fps continuous shooting, an ISO range of 100 to 25,600, dual memory card slots (we'd guess SD and MemoryStick), and an eventual retail price of $900 to $1,000. Also pictured on the site is the A33 -- with an unmoving display -- spec'd at a reported 14 megapixels, ISO range of 100 to 12,800, and 1080i video. The expected launch is August 24th, but bear in mind this all is just a rumor for now -- keep your wallet and check and don't do anything rash, k?
