To be frank, this auction has spoof written all over it, but whatever the case, redferndesign is offering up a "limited edition" (one of four, supposedly) Wii system with a red CD input LED, an all black motif, Darth Vader imprinted on the side and a pair of black Wiimotes / nunchucks. Also of note, the Wiimote pictured must be one of the rarest ever, particularly when you consider the previously nonexistent "x" and "y" buttons and the rectangular power switch. Even if the console (alone) is indeed modded up, there's no way anyone in their right mind will cough up that much coin, but why not hit the read link and have a laugh at his / her expense?Update: Just as we suspected, this one's a fake -- but humorous, nonetheless.[Via Technabob]
