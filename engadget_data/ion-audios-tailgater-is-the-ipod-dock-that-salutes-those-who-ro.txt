It's a $199 iPod dock that, with a few scuffs and scratches and stickers, wouldn't look too out of place getting kicked around on-stage at the club. It works with any iPod (first- and second-gen users will have to made do with playback via the headphone jack) including the iPhone and Touch, has inputs for mics or other instruments, and even has an integrated battery for up to eight hours of rocking out when you're way out. Now all you need is a gaggle of roadies to carry it there for you.[Via iLounge]
