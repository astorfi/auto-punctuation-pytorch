We could care less about one of our predictions being wrong, but we are deflated about the fact that all the testers say they were shocked to get the news as we are because the beta seemed to have been going so well. No word on if the entire partnership is dead or just this iteration of the tuner, but the bottom line is everyone who contacted us doesn't believe we'll see a HD tuner for DISH Network for Media Center any time soon. Sorry to get your hopes up.
