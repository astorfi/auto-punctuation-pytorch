Pokken Tournament, the Pokémon-infused fighting game hitting the Wii U worldwide in the spring, will get a dedicated controller in Japan, as spotted by Tiny Cartridge. It's wired and doesn't include any analog sticks, instead opting for a directional pad, four action buttons, and "ZL" and "ZR" buttons on its face. Those final two buttons are traditionally placed as "triggers" on the backside of a gamepad.



The controller is meant to mimic the arcade version of Pokken Tournament, according to Pokémon-news website Serebii. It's due to launch in March in Japan -- a trailer posted today puts the Japanese release date for Pokken Tournament on March 18th.
