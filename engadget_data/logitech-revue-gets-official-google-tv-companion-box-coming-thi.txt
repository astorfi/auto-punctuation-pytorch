We knew from day one that Logi had been tapped to produce one of the first Google TV set-top boxes ever, and details on the little guy have been trickling out ever since. Described as a "Google TV companion box," the device is expected to "combine everything on the web, cable and satellite [with] apps, video calling and more." We're told to be patient for specs and further deets, so we suppose we'll do just that. While pouting. 

[Thanks, Tom]
