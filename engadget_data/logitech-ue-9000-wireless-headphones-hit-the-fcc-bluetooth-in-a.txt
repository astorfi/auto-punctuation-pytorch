As revealed by a recent FCC filing, the division -- best known for its pro-quality IEMs -- is working on a set of Bluetooth headphones dubbed as the UE 9000. There isn't much in the way of details or photos, however, a diagram detailing the location of the unit's FCC label reveals what looks like a full-size headphone -- new territory for UE for sure. We'll let you know when we hear any official word about the cans, but for now, feel free to scope the existing competition while reading about how much radiation these puppies might inject into your noggin.
