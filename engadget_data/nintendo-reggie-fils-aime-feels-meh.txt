With the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 due to hit shelves across the world soon, it's not exactly surprising to hear the competition openly sound off on the incoming consoles. Especially when it's someone as outspoken as Nintendo of America's COO Reggie Fils-Aime. "It's all about the games. The competitive systems have announced their launch lineups. I'm allowed to say 'meh," Fils-Aime said in an interview with IGN. The Nintendo head added that he feels confident in the Wii U's title lineup, noting, "We've got Zelda. We've got Mario. We've got Donkey Kong. In addition to great titles like Pikmin 3 and Wonderful 101, I feel very good about our lineup, and I feel very good about the value proposition we're putting out there for the consumer."


Both the Xbox One and PS4 will have more than 20 titles available at launch, which is on par with what the Wii U's launch was back in November of last year. The only problem is Nintendo's flagship has been seeing less and less support from third-party developers, making the console a harder sell for gamers worldwide. Perhaps, Nintendo's hoping to turn the tide with its recent announcement that the Wii U's going to be a little cheaper starting September 21st, though only time will tell how successful that strategy turns out to be.
