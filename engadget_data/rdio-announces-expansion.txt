Rdio may not be available in as many places as, say, Spotify, but the relatively popular music service is certainly doing all it can to get there. As such, Rdio today announced that it has now arrived in seven additional markets, bringing its total presence to 31 countries and making this the first time it's being offered in Asian territory. Hoping to lure folks in, Rdio's quick to point out its promise to deliver up to six months of free internet-based tunes, after which streamers can easily upgrade to one of its various plans (assuming they want to, of course). Fret not if Rdio isn't live in your hood; the company says it's constantly working on expanding its reach, so hopefully we'll see it pop up in more areas pretty soon.
