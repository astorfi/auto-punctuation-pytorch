Bad news, HTC HD2 owners: Microsoft has finally come right out and confirmed our suspicions that the mighty HTC HD2 won't be upgraded to Windows Phone 7 Series. Joe Belfiore just told us that the HD2 is "not compliant with the Windows Phone 7 Series hardware specifications," which should end any of the lingering doubt that's clouded this issue since MWC. That certainly puts a damper on the HD2's upcoming launch on T-Mobile, but hey -- every Microsoft employee here at MIX is carrying one, so it's clearly the WinMo handset to get until it's eclipsed by 7 late in the year. Pour one out for the king, friends.
