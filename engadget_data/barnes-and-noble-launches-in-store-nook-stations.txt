Barnes & Noble today announced the launch of a brand new Nook Tablet and offered up some nice discounts on its existing Nook Simple Touch and Nook Color devices. So, what kind of competitive advantages can old B&N possibly give over a mega-online retailer like Amazon? Stores! Hundreds of them! The company is harnessing its brick and mortar locations to give users a place to get friendly with its new devices. Check out some shots of the Union Square shop in New York City below.
