 The good news is that Nike is adding some new colors to its Nike+ connected FuelBand and SportWatch GPS lines so your wristwear can more closely match your kicks all winter. While the original translucent limited edition Nike+ FuelBand Ice won't be returning, at the end of October it will be available in new White Ice and Black Ice colors, with distribution expanded to more Nike stores in the US, Canada and UK. If you prefer GPS, precise timing and a multiplatform Nike+ Running app to LEDs, the TomTom-powered Nike+ SportWatch GPS is rolling out a new white/silver colorway. The bad news? If you were waiting for other updates, like a FuelBand with GPS, SportWatch that can pump out some MP3s while you run, FuelBand app for Android or really anything other than cosmetic changes, you're out of luck. We wouldn't let that get in the way of a workout however, check below for more details on each or return to customizing some NikeiD Lebron Xs -- your choice.

  Nike+ FuelBand "Black Ice" and "White Ice" launch with expanded availability across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
   Beginning October 31 the Nike+ FuelBand will now be available in two new colors, with distribution expanded across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The two new colors, "White ICE" and "Black ICE," will become the third and fourth versions following the "Black Steel" launch color and a limited edition run of the original 'ICE' FuelBand.

   Launched in February 2012, the Nike+ FuelBand is an innovative wrist-based device that tracks and measures the user's activity during any given day and designates a score for the activity in the form of NikeFuel. NikeFuel is a normalized score that awards all users of the Nike+ FuelBand equal scoring for the same activity regardless of their physical make up. The Nike+ FuelBand also captures and displays time, calories and steps. An intuitive mobile application allows the user to review all the activity captured by the product.

   The Nike+ FuelBand has previously only been available from select Nike locations in the United States and United Kingdom and via nikestore.com in those countries. Now a broad number of Nike stores across the US, Canada and the UK, along with nikestore.com, will carry the product.

   The Nike+ FuelBand mobile app is designed for Apple's iPhone 5, iPhone 4S and 4 as well as the iPod touch (third generation onwards) and allows you to view your progress against your friends and track your overall NikeFuel activity allowing you to see when you were most active.

  NIKE+ SPORTWATCH GPS COLLECTION ADDS WHITE/SILVER EDITION
   The latest colorway of Nike's running watch offers a stylish way for runners to track, share and compare their runs with NIKE+ technology.

   This holiday season, Nike's collection of Nike+ SportWatch GPS adds a new colorway: a sleek white band with silver detailing. The expanded collection now includes white/silver, black/anthracite, black/blue, black/volt and volt/black.

   The latest version of the running watch takes inspiration from one that was specially designed this summer for athletes such as Allyson Felix, world champion U.S. sprinter; and Mo Farah, world champion U.K. long distance runner. To celebrate the greatness that inspired these athletes' championship moments, Nike designed an ultra-premium version in white, crafted with gold details.

   The Nike+ SportWatch GPS Powered by TomTom offers the most dynamic and motivational running experience in the world, thanks to its unique functionality, beautiful design, and direct connection to nikeplus.com.

   It is designed for high performance, with a high-visibility backlit LCD display providing the runner with critical in-run metrics of time, average and instantaneous pace and distance. The Nike+ SportWatch GPS also has motivational features to enhance the running experience, including run reminders and messages that inspire you before and after runs.

   Nike+ Running allows runners to track, measure, share and compare their runs with the entire NIKE+ community, which has grown to include approximately 10 million members and has recorded more than 672 million miles run. Runners globally can access NIKE+ through the Nike+ Running App for iPhone and Android and nikeplus.com.

   Initially launched for Running in 2006, NIKE+ has expanded into a multi-sport ecosystem that includes Nike+ Basketball, Nike+ Training and Nike+ Kinect Training. Multi-sport users can visit the single-destination nikeplus.com to access all their data – including lifetime NikeFuel points accumulated from all NIKE+ devices – creating a globally connected community of sport.
