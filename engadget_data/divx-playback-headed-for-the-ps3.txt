 The press release is a bit short on details, but it's hard to miss the meat of the story: the PS3 is set to include DivX playback in the near future. Users will be able to add the feature for everyday media playback with a forthcoming update, and developers can start using DivX playback in their games with the latest version of the Development Kit. With all the rumors of DivX support coming to the 360 -- other Media Center Extenders already manage DivX and XviD -- it's hard to tell who will add the feature first, but perhaps we should instead be asking ourselves why it took this long for the both of them.
