It looks like they've gone and done us proud with a 2.5-inch SATA flash drive for notebooks with a whopping 64GB of storage, giving it a real claim to replacing that clunky old HDD in our laptop -- once we can scrounge up the $2000 this thing will be selling for. The best news is that the drive should be out in August of this year, almost even beating Samsung's $1000 32 gigger to the punch. Supposed transfer speeds are at a not-too-shabby 32MBs, but the real payoff for early adopters will be the reliability and battery life afforded by these things.
