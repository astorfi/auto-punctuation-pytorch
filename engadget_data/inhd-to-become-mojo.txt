 Ah, good 'ol INHD. Home of random sporting events, Howard Stern and Tour-de-Gorge, they have somewhat struggled to find a footing in this crazy world of HDTV but hopefully, a name change can make the differences. We kind of knew this was going to happen and as of May 1st, they are going to adopt the name of their primetime programming block: Mojo. This programming has apparently been very good to the male oriented station and now that there are more HD stations constantly throwing competition their way, INHD must feel that perhaps it will allow the station to regain some of its lost mojo. (you knew we had to drop the phrase eventually) All we know is that if they keep producing food-to-face cramming action, we will keep watching; mojo or no mojo.
