Thanks to some leaked training materials over on Howard Forums, we have a pretty clear idea of the next Galaxy S device to bow on that budget carrier's lineup -- the Lightray 4G. No, your eyes aren't deceiving you, we've seen this exact phone before at CES 2012 where it was part of Dyle's Mobile TV showcase. And that chassis you see above? It's a mostly unaltered version of Verizon's Droid Charge, although that formerly pointed chin seems to have gotten the Ashlee Simpson treatment. Spec-wise, the 4.3-inch device reportedly packs a Super AMOLED Plus display, 1.3-megapixel front-facing / 8-megapixel rear cameras, 16GB of included microSD storage (what it'll ship with onboard is unknown), HDMI-out and, bizarrely, that aforementioned TV tuner, replete with antenna. No word on when this unofficial fella's set to go legit nor which Google OS treat it'll run, but with a recently surfaced FCC doc and company slides to go off, we're sure to find out sooner rather than later.
