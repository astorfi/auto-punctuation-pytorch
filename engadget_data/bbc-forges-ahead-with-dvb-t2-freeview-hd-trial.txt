Thankfully, the Beeb is attempting to change all that, and it's moving forward with DVB-T2 tests. Reportedly, said standard is an advanced version of DVB-T -- the protocol currently used in the UK for digital terrestrial transmissions -- that provides an increase in efficiency and more bandwidth for more content. If all goes to plan, at least three high-def channels (one of which will be BBC) will be carried via DVB-T2 by the close of 2009, but it seems that ITV, Channel 4 and Five will have to cast lots for the remaining two openings.[Via Digital Spy]
