'Course, we suspect you'll think differently if you've been waiting for your backorder to clear over the past few weeks, but we digress. As of this moment in time, the handset -- which has been tough to get thanks to AMOLED shortages -- is in stock and shipping as early as today, with an unchanged $199.99-on-contract price tag. Better hurry if you're looking to buy -- who knows when those panels will hit yet another production snag.
