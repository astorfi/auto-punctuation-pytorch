We've been accustomed to having mobile access to the entire back catalog of our favorite Showtime series via the Showtime Anytime app since its launch in 2011. Users will no longer be limited to past episodes on their handsets and tablets, however, as both the Android and iOS apps were updated today with the ability to stream a live feed of whatever's airing on Showtime. All you need to do is install the update, choose whether Showtime East or West best suits your viewing preference, and you'll be able to enjoy Dexter perform his latest ritual on your mobile device every Sunday night.
