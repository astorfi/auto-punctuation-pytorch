The Redwood Shores-based company initially sought $6.1 billion, but eventually lowered that to $2.6 billion. The judge responded by suggesting a far more modest $100 million starting point for a settlement and sent Oracle back to the drawing board. Well, the company amended its complaint, and is now asking for only $2 billion. Judge Alsup has grown noticeably more impatient with both sides as the suit has progressed towards trial, which is still scheduled for October. We can't wait to see what sort of outburst Oracle's latest move inspires in his honor -- we're expecting a flying gavel or two.
