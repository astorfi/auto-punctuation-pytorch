 They're still miles away from T-Mobile's ridiculously cheap $10 for unlimited BlackBerry email, but Verizon's trying to reach out to a more personal, consumer-based audience as it preps to launch its own Pearl with a new data pricing structure of its own. Unlimited web and email will run you $29.99 when purchased with a voice plan, $34.99 without, offering support for up to ten POP3 and IMAP accounts. Again, T-Mobile's got these cats beat hands-down if saving dinero is the priority -- but then again, Verizon takes the cake for total coverage area and, of course, 3G speed. Pick your poison.
