   So the rumors about Huawei pushing out a duo of T-Mobile MyTouch devices just got a little beefier, now that the real deal has actually been given the Mr. Blurrycam treatment. Above and below are images grabbed by TmoNews that show off the non-QWERTY model, which are expected to come running on Android 2.3.6 and taking advantage of a WVGA display. While the two mid-range devices will be the next in line to bear the MyTouch name, they'll also be known as the U8680 and U8730 elsewhere.
