The camera is "in the final stages of Thunderbolt certification and internal testing" and manufacturing will follow as soon as that's done -- probably in the second week of August, according to the company. It will still hit the market with the $2,995 price tag, Canon lens mount, 15.6 x 8 mm sensor and built-in SSD recorder intact. In more positive news, the company has identified the cause of aliasing noticed by some viewers and blames it on the workflow used. It's posted a few new videos to back up the claim, which can be viewed at the source link below. Considering the company might soon have similar competition, it's probably best to work out any bugs before shipping a boatload out to finicky cinema clients.
