The Studio XPS 13 and 16, due in November, will be Intel Centrino 2-based machines with hybrid SLI support, slot-loading Blu-ray drives, edge-to-edge glass displays with optional LED backlighting, backlit keyboards, and WiMAX and UWB support. We're digging the funky woodgrain on the Studio XPS 16, but it'll be interesting to see how much these cost if and when they hit -- the Studio line was supposed to sit in between the Inspiron and XPS lines, so we're hoping these'll also come in below the current XPS price tags. Check the other four slides, including the Studio XPS 13, after the break.[Thanks, L. Rawlins]
