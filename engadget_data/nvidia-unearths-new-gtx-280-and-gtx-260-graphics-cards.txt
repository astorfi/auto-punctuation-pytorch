The GTX 280, NVIDIA's flagship model, is reportedly 50% faster than last year's 8800 GX2 when in its overclocked AMP! Edition, and it is loaded with around twice as many transistors as the 9800. The new single-chip processor packs some serious number crunching, such as a 142 GB/s memory bandwidth with a 512-bit memory interface. Other final specs look to include 1GB GDDR3 memory, two Dual Link DVI connectors, and, of course, an overclocked chipset. In short, it's the fastest graphics card you can get. Don't go nuts just yet, though -- the GTX280 with 1GB of RAM will run you a cool $649. The lower-end GTX 260 with 896MB is a more palatable $399. GTX280 availability starts tomorrow, and GTX 260s will hit the streets on June 26. And to finally put this joke to rest: Yes, they will run Crysis.[Via CNET]
