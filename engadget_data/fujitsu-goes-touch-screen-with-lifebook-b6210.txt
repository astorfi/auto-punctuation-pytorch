    This new LifeBook B6210 lappy from Fujitsu is targeted at the healthcare and field-force industries for filling out forms and other such boring things, so it's a little bare on specs, but we're liking some of the things that are going on here. The touch screen laptop works with Tablet PC Edition '05 or XP Professional, but either OS might feel a bit cramped on the 12.1-inch XGA display. With a Core Solo 1.2GHz processor, 512MB of SDRAM and 40GB HDD, Fujitsu makes it clear that this laptop isn't going for crazy performance, but the Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g and optional Bluetooth and fingerprint reader jazz things up a bit. It all comes in at 3.2 pounds, and you can make a recommended base configuration yours for $1,600 with XP Pro or $1650 with Tablet PC.[Via MobileWhack]
