 The first time we saw Verizon's FiOS Mobile app for the iPad, it was showing off the ability to stream live TV channels directly to the tablet. Unfortunately when it was released later in 2010 that feature was nowhere to be found, and it was limited to remote control. Today, an update (that we'd heard it was testing) has rectified that by allowing users to stream any of 75 channels, as long as they're connected to their home WiFi network. FiOS also offers similar features in its apps for the Xbox 360 and Samsung's Smart TV platform. The update also tweaks the remote control pairing process and notes iOS 6 support, subscribers can check it out at the source link, as long as they bring their My Verizon account details. Take a peek after the break for a picture of which channels are included, helpfully sorted by genre.
