We got this luscious piece of intel from a devoted Sling fan who acquired it after spotting the AV at a Best Buy in Augusta, Georgia, and then subsequently grilled the staff on the availability of the Pro and Tuner. As we mentioned previously, the FCC confidentiality agreement lifts on September 28, so perhaps this new release date is what we should be expecting from Blake & Co.?[Thanks, Dennis]
