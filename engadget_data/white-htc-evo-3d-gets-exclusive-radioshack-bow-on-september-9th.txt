This "rare and beautiful" unicorn from HTC's beastly, dual-core Android herd hails from the Hesse-led network, and will be available as a RadioShack exclusive on September 9th. The electronics retailer dipped more than just its toes into our 21st century ways (or more likely hired a new intern), getting the message out via its Twitter account, and snapping an Instagram shot of the bleached handset. Pricing for the phone has yet to be announced, but we'd be surprised if this gets a premium over its $199 on-contract twin.
