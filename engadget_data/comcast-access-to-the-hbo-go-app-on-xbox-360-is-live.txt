  After a short delay, Comcast subscribers are now on the list of users able to access the HBO Go streaming app via their Xbox 360s. Although some HBO content was already included in the Xfinity TV app, it wasn't all there however a change in the policy was rumored and then eventually confirmed late last week. We're still left to ponder what exactly cause the hold up, and why there's still no hint of streaming access on Roku or Samsung. The news was tweeted earlier from the HBO Go official account, you can head there and check out another one of those promotional teasers, or just take your Comcast account credentials to your Xbox and get to streaming.
