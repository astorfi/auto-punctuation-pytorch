Like the original, the SwiMP3 v2 uses bone conduction, rather than regular earphones, to transmit sound directly from your cheek bone to your inner ear (it all sounds a little creepy, but bone conduction is pretty much the best way to listen to stuff underwater). Version 2 of the SwiMP3 is a little smaller and sleeker than the original, though it still doesn't have all that much storage -- even after two-and-a-half years they've only managed to bump the SwiMP3 from 128MB up to 256MB. Still, with a specialized player like this you really only need enough music for your swim, right?
