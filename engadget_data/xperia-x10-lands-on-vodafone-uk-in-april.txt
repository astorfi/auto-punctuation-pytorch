This agrees with the release schedules for Japan and Germany, making the fourth month of the year seem like a certainty for the global launch of what is still a hotly anticipated device. Just why the X10 engenders such fervor, we're not really sure, but it still marks Sony Ericsson's most aggressive plunge into the smartphone shark pool yet. We'll just have to wait another couple of months to find out how well that Donut-based OS swims.
