In addition to outing the Nexus 7 tablet and Nexus Q media-streaming device, the Play store has a listing for $399 Triad bookshelf speakers "designed to optimize the sound quality of the Nexus Q." The listed specs peg each speaker at 14 pounds, with a 1-inch fabric dome tweeter and a 6.5-inch proprietary woofer. The speakers' range is 75 Hz - 20 kHz, and according to the page they will ship in two to three weeks -- only in the US.
