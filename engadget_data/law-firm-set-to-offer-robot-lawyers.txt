South African law firm Buys Inc. plans to introduce a trio of "robot" lawyers next year designed to offer online
legal advice to customers, Business Day reports.  We've got to admit we were a bit disappointed when we realized
the so-called robots (named Stacey, Dave and Nathan) were just AI software and not bona fide nuts-and-bolts bots ready
to bust out all Johnny Cochrane-style in the courtroom but, hey, you gotta start somewhere.  While the virtual
lawyers will initially be charged only with answering basic questions and presenting training material, the law firm
sees a bright future for the artificial attorneys, who may one day be able to offer quicker turnaround times and, most
importantly, lower legal fees than their human counterparts.
