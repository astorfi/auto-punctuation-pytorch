Still waiting for Google to make its often-leaked Nexus 5 official? Sit tight -- one leak suggests the device's unveiling could be just around the corner. The latest render from @evleaks shows a two-toned Nexus 5 with a white backplate, but the post's text is even more revealing: "In white," it says. "11/1." It's definitely a vague statement, but in light of Google Play's recent product page leak, an early November launch would be right on schedule. The latest rumors and leaks promise a device with a 4.95-inch 1080p display, a 2.3GHz Snapdragon 800 CPU and LTE available in both 16 and 32GB models and, apparently, in black or white. Reportedly starting at $349, it certainly has our attention. We'll let you know when we hear something official.
