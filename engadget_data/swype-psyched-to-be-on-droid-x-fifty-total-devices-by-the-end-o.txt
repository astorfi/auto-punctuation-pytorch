We've seen it on a few handsets already, and we know how eager the company is to get on the iPhone, but still it doesn't look like Apple's ready to bite. In the meantime, it seems that the company is more than happy to make due with the likes of HTC, Samsung, and Motorola -- the latter having gone with Swype for the Droid X. According to CEO Mike McSherry, this is the company's biggest coup yet, though certainly not the last -- he says to look for the app on some fifty phones by late 2010.
