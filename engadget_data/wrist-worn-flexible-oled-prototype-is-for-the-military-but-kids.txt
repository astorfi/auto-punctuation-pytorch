When that day finally comes, Universal Display Corporation thinks one of those gadgets will be something like the above: a wearable, flexible, 4-inch prototype screen that CES attendees will be able to check out and maybe even try on -- albeit uncomfortably. It's been developed with military applications in mind (they always get the cool stuff first), but bendy consumer devices are naturally envisioned as well. There's no word on when we'll start seeing them in passports or flexi-phones, but we're thinking we have a while to wait yet.[Warning: PDF link; via OLED-DISPLAY.net]
