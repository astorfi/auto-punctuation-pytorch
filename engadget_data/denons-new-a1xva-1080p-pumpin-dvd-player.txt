new 1080p TV and now realize that your local feed doesn't
support that level of quality. What to do? Well, looks like Denon will release a DVD audio/video/SACD player
mid-November which pumps glorious 1080p over HDMI. It also features Denon Pixel Image Correction technology and
Advanced AL24 Processing for the fire-sale price of about $4,000US. Chump change for you though, right big spender?
