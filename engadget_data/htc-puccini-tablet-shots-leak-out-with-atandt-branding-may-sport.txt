Only time will tell for sure, but BGR has some leaked shots that show the purported tab cozying up to a Flyer-like stylus, in addition to its AT&T branding. A glimpse of this Honeycomb-based 10-incher's backside also reveals an 8 megapixel rear-mounted camera accompanied by what looks like a dual-LED flash. There's also that dual speaker set-up we peeped in the tablet's prior filing. Of course, what lies beneath this LTE slate is still up for speculation, but a rumored dual-core 1.5GHz processor and 1280 x 800 display aren't beyond the realm of today's future specs. Hit the source for an extra shot.
