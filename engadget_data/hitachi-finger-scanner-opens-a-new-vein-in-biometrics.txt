We're guessing that someone has been watching a few too many
thrillers where the villian has used a spurious technique to fake a
fingerprint (invisible ink, a
meat cleaver to the hand, etc.). How else to explain Hitachi's vein scanner, a biometric security device that scans the
veins in your finger in order to provide secure access to a PC. At $365, this thing is significantly more expensive
than most consumer-level fingerprint scanners, so we hope it really works, and that the bloodless finger created via
the, er, hack mentioned above, doesn't show up as a positive match.
