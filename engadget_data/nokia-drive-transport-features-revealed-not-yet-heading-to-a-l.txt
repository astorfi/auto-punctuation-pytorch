After previewing the planned 3.0 refresh for us at Mobile World Congress, it appears Espoo's drawing closer to a finalized version of the Windows Phone app, bringing with it the ability to learn driving habits, display real-time movement and traffic on the homescreen live tile, as well as allowing users to manually adjust routes. The Finnish company's Transport app will also be seeing a bump up to version 2.0, letting users see nearby transit options based on their location, transfers and scheduling for 87 countries, amongst other features. There's no word on precisely when Lumia owners can expect to see this one-two navigation punch hit their handsets, but we're guessing sooner rather than later.
