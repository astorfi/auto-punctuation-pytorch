As promised, the complete list of 180 (no more, no less) fiberhoods which qualified for Google Fiber service has been announced. With it, the approximate construction schedule has also been posted online, confirming Hanover Heights in Kansas (October) and Crown Center in Missouri (Spring 2013) will lead off the deployment for their respective areas. If you live in a qualifying area and have not signed up yet, you will be able to sign up or change plans when installations actually begin, which will be October 2nd in Hanover Heights. All of the info about Google's gigabit internet service and how to get it is at the blog and if you're still waffling, remember -- it has ESPN now.


Update: If that wasn't enough, Google has also expanded its channel lineup a bit more with Boomerang, Cartoon Network, CNN, CNN en Espa√±ol, CNN International, HLN, hTV, infinito, MLB Strikezone (as part of an add-on package),TBS, TCM: Turner Classic Movies, TNT and truTV.
