Assuming their specs are on the mark, you can apparently look forward to this one packing a 13.3-inch LED backlit WUXGA display, 2GB of RAM, an unspecified 45nm Core 2 Duo processor, a 120GB hard drive, the usual integrated Intel graphics, and a built-in DVD burner -- plus the standard built-in webcam and fingerprint reader. All that'll set you back $1,999 (including an HP all-in-one printer). While there's no word on an exact release date, the bookstore will apparently have models on display in July, with units available for pick-up in time for the August move-in.[Via GottaBeMobile]
