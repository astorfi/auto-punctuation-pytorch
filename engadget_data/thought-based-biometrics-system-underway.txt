 Seems kind of old school if yourbrain interface doesn't provide extra-sensory enhancement or integration to robotic limbs, butresearchers at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada are working on a system for thought-based biometrics by scanningand interpreting each individual's unique brain-wave signatures that occur when they think of a certain thought or canidentify patterns uniquely -- kind of like that Peter Pan pixie dust thing, except in this case you get granted accessto your box. For a variety of reasons the system isn't without its doubts and detractors, and will probably continue tohave them so long as you have to wear an EEG cap on your scalp to get a reading -- though according to UCLA professorand BCI expert Jacques Vidal, rocking that headgear's the least of this system's problems. But if you expect us toshrug off any system that lets us interfacewith our gear via mind-link, you're sorely mistaken. So keep at it Carleton U, let's see some thought scanners.
