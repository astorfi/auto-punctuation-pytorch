The second 8th-gen facility -- dubbed 8-2 -- will begin pumping out glass from the South Korean city of Tangjeong in Q2 2009 in sheets up to 220cm x 250cm. 51% of the panels manufactured belong to Sammy while the rest go to Sony. Of course, Sony is also shacking up with Sharp on a $3.5B LCD plant in Japan ready to swing into production sometime in 2010. Oh Sony, you naughty, naughty minx.
