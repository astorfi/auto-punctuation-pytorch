RNGs and entropy collectors be damned, real men only trust one kind of randomness, the dice kind. And the
Dice-O-Matic rolls a hot hand in a dice game, baby, collecting 'em, rolling 'em, catching 'em, and scanning the face
values — up to 20,000 rolls a day. We're thinking of entering it in the World Series of Dice — talkin' 'bout
clikkity-clikkity-clack!
