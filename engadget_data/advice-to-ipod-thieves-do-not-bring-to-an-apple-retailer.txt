File this one in the "doh!" category: a UK iPod thief was caught red-handed when he brought the device to a local
Apple retailer looking for cables for it â€” unfortunately for the thief, the manager of the Nottingham-based store he
walked into was actually the guy he stole the iPod from. Adrian Smith, manager of Apple retailer KCRS, had had his iPod
stolen out of his car the weekend before. When the "customer" walked into the store, Adrian noticed the unit looked
rather familiar, and sure enough upon plugging it into one of the store's machines, it turned up as "Adrian's iPod."
Another staff member kept the thief occupied while Smith called the coppers, and the rest, as they say, is blog
fodder.
