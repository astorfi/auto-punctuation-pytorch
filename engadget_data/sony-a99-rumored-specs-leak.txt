According to Sony Alpha Rumors, it'll be a 24.3-megapixel CMOS Exmor sensor with an ISO range of 100-25,600, 14 bit RAW output and a 1/8000 maximum shutter speed. Other nuggets of interest include a 102 point AF system, full 1080p HD video recording (at 60fps) and a 921k dot LCD (like that seen on the A77 pictured). When might we see this come to market? According to the rumor-mill, sometime in October, with an official unveiling in early September. Along with everything else, it seems. Head on down to the source for the full spread.
