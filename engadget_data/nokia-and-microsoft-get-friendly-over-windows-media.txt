Never thought we'd see this happen, but the threat of
Apple fooling around with
Motorola (whether real or perceived) has thrown Nokia into the arms of Microsoft (again!). Earlier today Nokia
announced they were licensing Microsoft's ActiveSync, now
they've revealed their plans to add support for Windows Media Audio files, Windows Media DRM 10 and Media Transfer
Protocol to their handsets. They don't get too down and dirty with the specifics (like which phones will be compatible
or not), but from the looks of it this arrangement would let wireless carriers offer a download service (which
Nokia is developing with Loudeye) that could sync up with
Windows Media Player 10, and would also include the ability to transfer over DRM-protected WMA files from a PC. Not
sure whether this means we can expect a bunch of Nokia phones that work with
Napster To Go, but this is
something of a slap in the face for
RealPlayer. Just last week those
two companies were making nice, even issuing a press release about how they were
"extending their collaboration".
