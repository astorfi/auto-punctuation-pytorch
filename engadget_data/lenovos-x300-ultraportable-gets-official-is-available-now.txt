The 2.9 to 3.1-pound, LED-backlit X300 (that's the one on the left, you know) is indeed available today for those who've been drooling for weeks through "Lenovo's business partners," but of course, it'll take at least $2,799 $2,548 (on the firm's official webstore) to gain admission to this slim 'n trim party.
