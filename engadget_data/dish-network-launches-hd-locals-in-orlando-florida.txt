       While we knew Orlando, Florida was on the so-called list to get HD locals sometime during 2008, we had no idea residents would be able to indulge in them this early on. According to an ecstatic DISH subscriber in the area, users can now receive (in glorious high-definition): ABC (WFTV channel 9) on 5160; CBS (WKMG channel 6) on 5161; NBC (WESH channel 2) on 5162; and Fox (WOFL channel 35) on 5163. That'll take the sting of a botched satellite launch away for at least a moment, eh?[Thanks, Tom]
