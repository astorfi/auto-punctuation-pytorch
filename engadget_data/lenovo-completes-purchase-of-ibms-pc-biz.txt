Chinese-based Lenovo formally completed its purchase of IBM's PC division this past weekend, instantly becoming the world's third-largest PC manufacturer after Dell and HP. It's sort of business as usual over there-much of the old IBM management team is now running the show at Lenovo now, and they've already launched a US version of their website highlighting their newly acquired ThinkPad and ThinkCentre PC lines (still with IBM logos on 'em)-but it'll probably be a few more weeks or months until we see the very first models that are wholly a product of the newly merged company.
