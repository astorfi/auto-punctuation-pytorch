For starters, he didn't hesitate to exclaim that "a fair amount of customers" have been unhappy with the small screens and weak innards found in netbooks, which is definitely a perplexing comment to make when you're making ends meet (at least in part) by moving Minis. Of course, it sounds like the honest-to-goodness truth, but we digress. The money quote came when asked about Windows 7, as he noted that if "you get the latest processor technology and you get Windows 7 and Office 2010, you will love your PC again; we actually have not been able to say that for a long time." We're not trying to read too deeply between the lines, but that definitely sounds like a gentle jab at Vista, does it not? Hit the read link for the full schpeel.
