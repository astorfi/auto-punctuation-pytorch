Korean site ETNews claims to have heard the first legitimate confirmation of the Note III's existence, however, citing a Samsung official as its source. The insider apparently had much to say on plans for the camera, too. It's expected to be a 13-megapixel affair and could see other upgrades over its predecessor, including optical image stabilization and 3x optical zoom. According to the official, no final decisions on the camera have been made yet, but with less than four months to go until IFA (where the previous Notes have debuted), it's probably time to start nailing those specs down.
