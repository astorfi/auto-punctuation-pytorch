       They said they were gonna do it, and nowapparently they have (or are at least really close to it): Fujitsu's gearing up for a Q3 launch of the first 200GB2.5-inch drive, the MHV2200BT. We don't have any solid details on it (like whether it's the same 7200RPM 200GB drivethey were talking about before), but the Inq seems to think it'll take 1.6W of juice, have a 1.5ms seek time, and beSATA with NCQ. You know what we think? That's an awful lot of storage for a laptop, and you couldn't get it to us fastenough.
