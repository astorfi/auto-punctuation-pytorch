Developers can go nuts over the fine-tunings of it, but the takeaway for the consumer is that it allows Android devices to run on CDMA and in different resolutions and screen sizes -- should help to vary up the options currently available. Additionally, the update will add QuickSearch Ã  la webOS for scavenging through contacts, apps, and the internet in one text field, as we saw back at Google I/O, a text-to-speech API with translation capabilities, and that revamped market we spied earlier this month. Most interesting is an one-off line that from the official developer blog that says, "you can expect to see devices running Android 1.6 as early as October." That October launch applies to quite a number of upcoming Android handsets -- Sprint Hero, Motorola CLIQ, possibly even the InstinctQ and a Verizon-bound Sholes all fit the bill quite nicely.
