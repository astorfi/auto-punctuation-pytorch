We know the precedent has technically already been set by IFC's day and date HD on demand screenings, but this deal would actually revolve round mainstream titles, as opposed to art house sleepers, and supposedly justify the ridiculous "premium" rates. Hey, the studios have to make up eroding revenues from Blu-ray / DVD sales someway right? As expression goes though, we'll believe it when we see it, and meanwhile reassure our easily-teased home theaters that EPIX films on Netflix Watch Instantly are really coming September 1st.
