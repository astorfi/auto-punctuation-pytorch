 If you have been waiting for more titles to make the plunged into either HD DVD or Blu-ray, this might just be your week. This is by far the most number of titles released in one day. Warner is the resounding star with 12 titles between the two formats. Blu-ray still can't seem to catch up to HD DVD, when they add 11, HD DVD adds 12. When looking at the totals keep in mind that two of the titles from BCI last week never made it to the shelves, but Blu-ray is going to need more than 2 movies to catch up if they want to pass HD DVD by the end of the year. Love them or not, the Fast and the Furious trio are the big ones this week, but our personal favorite is Dazed and Confused, "You know what I like about high school girls?This brings the total to HD DVD 81 vs Blu-ray 56.Blu-ray
