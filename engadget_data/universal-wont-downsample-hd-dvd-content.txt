 Add Universal to the list ofstudios that won't downsample content for owners of non-HDMI HD sets. The company follows Sony and several others inannouncing its decision not to use the Image Constraint Token to force owners of older HD sets to watch their films at540p instead of the discs' native resolution. The decision mainly affects owners of older analog HD sets, and showsthat, at least as far as the studios are concerned, it's important to show some willingness to meet consumers(especially early adopters) half way in order to convince them to upgrade their gear to HD. Of course, Universal andthe others are under no obligation to maintain this position indefinitely, so we won't be surprised to see ICTimplemented across-the-board in a few years, after the format wars are over and we're all hooked on our new players.
