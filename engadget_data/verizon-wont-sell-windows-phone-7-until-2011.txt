That certainly ties right in with AT&T's claims that it'll be the "premier carrier" for Windows Phone 7 and the flood of Blue-tinted device leaks we've seen, but it also leaves Microsoft in a seemingly tough spot to start -- we haven't heard more than the slightest whisper about WP7 devices on Sprint or T-Mobile yet, and until we do it's going to be the iPhone and WP7 head-to-head on Ma Bell while Android continues to dig in everywhere else. We'll see -- this launch can't come quickly enough.
