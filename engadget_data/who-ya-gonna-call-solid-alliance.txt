But once wasn't enough; they've teamed up with Hong Kong firm Akkord International on a parapsychology device laboratory to produce a full array of "ghost radar" products to help you bust that slimer that's been keeping your kids up all night. If there were streams here we'd recommend they not be crossed -- not ever.
