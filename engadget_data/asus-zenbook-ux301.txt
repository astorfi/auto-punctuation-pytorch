The ASUS Zenbook Infinity first showed off its icy Gorilla Glass-clad curves at Computex back in June, and now it's resurfaced in a video that's making the rounds ahead of ASUS' press conference here at IFA. Incidentally, the video hints at a new name -- the Zenbook UX301 -- and also clarifies most of the main specs. According to the video, the UX301 will have a Retina-esque 13.3-inch, 2,560 x 1,440 multitouch display, a Haswell Core i7 CPU, 802.11ac WiFi and ASUS SonicMaster audio tech. The flagship Ultrabook will no doubt draw fans of thin design as well, thanks to the 15.5mm (0.64-inch) profile. We'll likely have a chance to play with it ourselves soon at ASUS's upcoming event, so stay tuned. In the meantime, there's a video after the break.
