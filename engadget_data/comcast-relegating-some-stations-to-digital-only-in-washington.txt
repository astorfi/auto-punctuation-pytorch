Nevertheless, Comcast will be bumping a number of channels -- namely the D.C.-area ABC / NBC / FOX / CBS affiliates -- to digital only. In other words, those relying on analog service will have to upgrade to digital cable in order to continue viewing the affected stations. Granted, some 80% of subscribers in Annapolis and Anne Arundel already have digital cable (so says Comcast), and the changes are being made to open up space for potential HD expansion. Unfortunately, Comcast isn't following in the footsteps of certain other carriers and offering free digital adapters -- but hey, progress has to happen eventually, right?[Image courtesy of Brent Nelson, thanks Harry]
