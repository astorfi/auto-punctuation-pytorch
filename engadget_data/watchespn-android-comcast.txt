 While the WatchESPN app for iOS got an update that opened up mobile streams for Comcast cable customers back in May, it's taken until now for Android devices to enjoy the same access. Along with unspecified bug fixes, version 1.6.0 worked on the Nexus 7 and Galaxy S II we tried it on, although we did need to log out and log in again with our account credentials to get the streams working the first time. The video streams we were able to pull in didn't seem to be quite as high res as those accessed on the iPad however, although all those with the right combination of services and hardware can grab the free app at the source link below and try it out themselves.
