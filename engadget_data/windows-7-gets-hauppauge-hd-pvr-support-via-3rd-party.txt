So it should come as no surprise that now that the Windows 7 Beta has been out for a bit, someone has figured out a way to get the two to play together. The DVBSBridge add-on is available now for those who can't wait for Hauppauge's drivers and are of course running Windows 7 -- Vista fans need not apply -- but we'll warn you; we just took a look at the directions and this is not for the faint of heart.[Via Geek Tonic]
