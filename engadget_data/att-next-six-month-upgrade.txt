AT&T is looking to make its Next smartphone payment plan a little more prominent. You'll be eligible to hop on-board the Next bandwagon in a mere six months and start swapping handsets sooner, if you were already under a two-year service agreement before January 18th. If you walked out of an AT&T store this morning with the carrier's typical contract, well, you're stuck with your handset for the next 20 months. We imagine that somewhere, surrounded by magenta, John Legere is smiling.
