You can buy almost anything from a vending machine
in Japan. So it's no surprise to find a machine fashioned
after the old UFO catcher crane-and-claw-based arcade games vending live lobsters in Sapporo. 100 yen (less
than a buck) is a
bargain price for a potentially tasty dinner â€” not to mention the hearty guffaws to be had watching children (and Alec
Baldwin) scream in horror.
