For those of you interested in Windows Media Center but who have no
interest in putting a PC in your living room (which we suspect is a lot more people than most nerds would like to
admit), Windows Media Center Extenders deliver the best of both worlds. Media Center Extenders are components that you
fit into your AV rack, and they do just what you'd think they doâ€”they extend Windows Media Center to that entertainment
center. You can install up to five of these on one Media Center PC server, and they come in a variety of configuations,
from small boxes to component-style rack pieces. The review points out that a few obvious things are missing, like a
DVD player and media card reader to make things a bit easier, but overall, they seem very positive on something we're
all likely to see a lot more of in the future.
