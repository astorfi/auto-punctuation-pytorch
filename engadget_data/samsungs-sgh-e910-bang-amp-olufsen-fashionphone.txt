Don't you just dig the intense irony that the fruits of
Samsung's and Bang & Olufsen's getting together on a
fashionphone rendered quite possibly the most busted looking piece of consumer electronics in recent memory? Mean,
c'mon, it is B&O, it's not like we were expecting design to counter The Toy in White or anything, but still, when
you bust out a Samsung SGH-E910, we have a feeling you're going to seriously get made fun of even by your metro bros.
Especially when they find out the thing only has a two hour talk time, and VGA cameraâ€”though it does try to make up for
that with a 2.1-inch QVGA display and Bluetooth.
