Yeah, Canada's Federal Court of Appeal had already
ruled against the special copyright tax on digital audio players that the RIAA lobbied to adopt in that country,
meant to compensate for the expected losses to the music industry from copyright infringement. Of course, the RIAA kept
beating a dead tax via the Canadian Private Copying Collective's continuing appeals. However, today the Canadian
Supreme Court has refused to hear any further arguments in the case whatsoever â€” meaning the RIAA walks away steaming
mad (and still clueless), and Canadians can continue to purchase products that don't pre-emptively tax them for being
potential criminals.
