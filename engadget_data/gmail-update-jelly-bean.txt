 Got a relatively recent version of Android on your smartphone? Good, because today, Google's giving Jelly Bean users another reason to be happy. In the company's latest update to Gmail, users will now find the ability to archive, delete and reply to incoming mail directly from the notifications drawer -- a small improvement, but we'll gladly take it. What's more, users of Ice Cream Sandwich and above will benefit from faster searches (online and off), along with a few performance improvements and bug fixes, too. So, time to tap that update button, eh?
