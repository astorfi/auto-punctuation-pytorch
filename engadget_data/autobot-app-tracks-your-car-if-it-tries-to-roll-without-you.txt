It can even be configured to automatically send a text to loved ones should you get into an accident, specifying your GPS coordinates and ruining any hope of hitting the body shop before dad finds out. The Mavizon-developed app recently won a startup competition at i-Stage 2010 and sadly isn't slated to be available until 2012, but we should be getting an early look at CES. When it does ship it'll cost $300 for the hardware and the software, though an extra fee will be required if you want to banish pop-up ads back to Cybertron.

Update: Hate to say we called it, but as of 12/29/2010 this is now called the Mavizon Mavia.
