While the carrier's register sheet isn't revealing many details (save for the teasing photo above), The Inquirer claims the handset's warming up for an eventual launch in May. Of course, don't count on this OS 7.1-packing Curve to change much in comparison to the Indian flavor, as it's still expected to ship with identical lower-end specs, including the 3.2-megapixel rear camera, a 320 x 240 screen and 512MB of RAM. No word on pricing yet, but we're guessing it'll fall somewhere between "mildly tempting" and "almost free."
