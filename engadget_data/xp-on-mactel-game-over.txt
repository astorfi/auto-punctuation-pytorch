And that last bit is really what has us thinking this may be more than just the latest Photoshop artproject. Sure, narf may be hoping that a share of the $12,000 he stands to win in the XP on Mac contest couldconvince some other Mac owners to help him perpetuate a fraud. But this is starting to look like it just might be real,blurry pics and all.
