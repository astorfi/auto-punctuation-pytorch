 While it's not exactly confirmation of a US-bound 80GB PS3, Sony is providing a glimmer of hope this morning for a beefier domestic release. Satoshi Fukuoka, spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. said that they are considering the 80 gigger specifically for the US and "other markets." He also shed light on the decision making process which includes the popularity of online gaming coupled with the availability of broadband connectivity. Fine, but considering the dismal performance of Sony's gaming division last quarter, you'd think they'd also be slathering some preferential treatment onto their largest marketplace(s). After all, gamers are nothing if not a fickle bunch and we wouldn't them feeling slighted now would we? Hey Sony, why not drop in a 120GB disk and we'll call it even.
