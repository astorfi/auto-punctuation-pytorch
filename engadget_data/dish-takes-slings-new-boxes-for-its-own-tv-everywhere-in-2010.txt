 At least one TV provider is taking advantage of Sling's veritable bounty of new hardware, and rather predictably it is Dish Network. The rebranding (instead of being SlingLoaded, the ViP 922 DVR is now "with TV Everywhere", the Sling Monitor 150 is dubbed the Dish Network WiFi Monitor and the Slingbox 700U has become the TV Everywhere Adapter) is enough to make your head spin, but at least we don't have to miss our stories, thanks to the recently released Dish Remote Access Mobile App for iPhone and iPod Touch with remote scheduling and remote control capabilities for most Dish receivers. All of the hardware is scheduled to arrive in the second quarter, we'll need at least that long to get our Everywhere and Anywhere TV straightened out.
