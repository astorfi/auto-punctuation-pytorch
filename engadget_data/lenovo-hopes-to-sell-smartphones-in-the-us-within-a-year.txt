While Lenovo is one of the fastest-rising smartphone makers today, many Americans wouldn't know it when the company has never officially sold handsets in the country. They might soon be well acquainted, according to CEO Yang Yuanqing: he wants Lenovo to be selling smartphones in the US within a year's time. Mobile is the firm's next growth machine, he tells the Wall Street Journal, and that entails having smartphones in big markets beyond China, India and Russia. Yang is under no illusions that Lenovo can simply waltz into the fiercely competitive US market, but he also doesn't see much choice -- when the PC market is slowing down, business as usual may not be enough.
