 
So, what would Steve Jobs do?We asked last week, and we took your answers in the form of over three hundred and fifty photoshopped mockups. We had acouple of Newtons, a ton of tablets, and a huge swarm of video iPods -- and a ton of miscellaneous stuff that bothamused and bemused us during the hours we spent judging. While it's always hard hard to pick winners in these things,we thought first place took it with a bullet -- but one entry was so good, we had to give out a second place prize forthe laugh.Thanks to everyone who entered, even if your entries aren't in the gallery (click on to check itout), and remember to check back tomorrow to find out what Jobs actually did.
