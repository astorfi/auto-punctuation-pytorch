Darth here's available in 1GB, 2GB and 4GB varieties, ranging in price from $79.95 to $169.95 -- a bit of a premium over your standard flash drive, sure, but what price can you put on having the dark side of the force guarding your data? (Yeah, we know -- sorry about that one.) While the remaining three Star Wars characters have yet to be announced, Mimoco's giving you a chance to win 'em all if you can guess them correctly, though we somehow doubt that our favorite fish-faced leader Admiral Ackbar will be among them.
