 Today in the "mind blowing" department, we have China Mobile -- the largest mobile carrier on the planet -- stating that its customer base of just over 301 million exceeds that of the entire population of the United States. Yes, all the people living in the U.S these days can't hold a candle to just the mobile subscribers with a China Mobile plan across the Pacific. Maybe one of these days, every man, woman and infant in these parts will be a paying mobile subscriber; until then, China Mobile has the goods. But, let's put it into perspective economically on how much the Chinese mobile subscriber loves telecom services: "Many Chinese spend a greater percentage of monthly income on pre-paid phone cards than Americans spend on food. This says a lot about the perceived importance of telecommunications in that society," says Julie Pohlig, senior analyst at Vital Wave Consulting. [Via textually.org]
