Daimler-Benz's diminutive SMART car is coming to America. Specialty vehicle company ZAP (for Zero Air Pollution) has
won approval from the U.S. government to distribute a version of the popular car that's been modified to meet U.S.
emissions and safety standards. Pricing is said to run from about $12,000 to $20,000. While we dig the car's fuel
efficiency (60 mpg!), style and size, we'd still be terrified to drive it on America's SUV-clogged highways. However,
it should be a natural for cities like New York, where it may even be able to beat BMW's Mini at squeezing into tight
parking spots.
