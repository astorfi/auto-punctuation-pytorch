Turns out, that forbidding glass wasn't as menacing as it initially appeared, and in we went to the pre-game show at CEDIA 2007. Granted, most setups were behind locked doors, but we were able to snag some sneak peeks at a few devices, booths, and tantalizing banners. And only time will tell what's underneath that off-site HD DVD tarp. Go on, check out the gallery to whet your appetite, and look for lots more where this came from when the show floor opens in the morning.
