 Let the speculation commence: Verizon's just sent out invites for a mysterious press event on Tuesday, hosted by Verizon Wireless President Lowell McAdam at New York's Lincoln Center. That's right -- a huge event in New York after CES. Obviously the natural speculation is that this will be where the long-rumored CDMA iPhone makes its appearance, and it definitely feels that way -- but we suppose it could also be any number of other things, and it's definitely odd that Verizon's in charge and not Apple. Either way, we'll be there live to let you in on the scoop, so keep it locked right here.
