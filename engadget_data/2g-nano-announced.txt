 As expected, Apple's hot-selling iPod nano has been given a big-time update with some mini-like colors, new capacities, better displays, better batteries, and new pricing. They all sport an even-thinner aluminum case and are available in (again, mini-like) green, silver, black, blue, and pink. However, the 2GB and 8GB version are available in aluminum and black only, respectively. As for pricing, $149 for 2GB, $199 for 4GB, and $249 for the 8GB model. Apple sez: "Double the storage for the same price," and they're available today. What's more, the new packaging is 52% less volumetric than the old iPod nano, making it "environmentally friendly." Expect to see tons of these on the subway by next week.
