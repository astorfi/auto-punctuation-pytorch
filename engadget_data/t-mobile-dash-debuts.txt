Quad-band GSM / GPRS / EDGE
WiFi and Bluetooth
128MB flash, 64MB SDRAM, microSD slot
1.3 megapixel camera
myFaves support

4.4 x 2.5 x 0.5-inch body (vs 4.57 x 2.5 x 0.47-inches on Q)

IIt's selling for $350 without contract, $250 with 1 year, and $199 with two years (and rebates, etc.), and will be available the 25th of this month. Want more on this sucka? Then peep our review!P.S. -Sorry guys, we like to run our phone reviews on Mobile (hey, that's what it's for!) but since it doesn't have the huge-ass pics like Classic does, we had to throw the review over there this time.
