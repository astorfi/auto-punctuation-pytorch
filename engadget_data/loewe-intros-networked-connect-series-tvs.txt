Containing television sets in three sizes between 32- and 42-inches, the Connect Series aims to "transform the TV into an intelligent, networked media center." Each display reportedly includes a built-in network media player, integrated HD tuner, a USB port, and Ethernet / WiFi modules; moreover, those opting for the Connect Media DR+ will even receive a built-in HDD recorder to archive OTA programming. Per usual, no word on pricing nor availability at the moment, but do click on for a shot of the Loewe Connect Home Cinema.
