 Rumors are rampant this morning that AMD is in the throes of a silent slash in global head-count. An estimated 800 or so employees are expected to hit the soup lines -- a number which reflects about 5% of its total work force. Not a surprise given the global downturn in the economy coupled with AMDs recent missteps in its epic battle with Intel. AMD has not made the layoffs official yet. However, the bad news is expected when their Q1 results are announced, if not sooner. [Via The Inquirer]
