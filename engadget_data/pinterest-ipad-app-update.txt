In order to fully flex its digital-collecting muscle on Apple slates, Pinterest has revamped its iPad app with new features for iOS 7. Redesigned navigation is said to gain a speed boost via a bottom-aligned menu and recent boards are kept handy for easy pinning. A press and hold on any board now will bring up a menu for viewing related repositories or sending its contents to your best mates. As you might expect, those extra secret boards that the outfit gifted users with last week will also be accessible, keeping those shopping ideas shrouded until December 25th.
