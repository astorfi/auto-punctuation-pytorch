 Friends, the age of SSD is upon is, and there's no better evidence than the upcoming 128GB 2.5-inch drive from A-DATA, which hooks up via SATA II, totally schools PQI's offering, and makes all your wildest dreams come true. A-DATA was showing this drive off at CES behind closed doors, along with a 64GB 1.8-incher and a most impressive 32GB ExpressCard. Mass production and availability is due for late Q1 and early Q2, and while there's no word on price just yet, with the way flash drives have been trending lately, we're hoping for good news when these hit the streets.[Via gizmag]
