Guidepoint Systems has upgraded their
OnStar-like service for usage with any WAP capable
device. You'll need to sign up for a service plan ($99-$149 a year) and have their system installed, but then you just
log onto their website with your phone or other wireless device and you can track your car's location, start the
engine, honk the horn, or unlock the doors to your heart's content. It uses the Cingular network for coverage and
should be available today.
