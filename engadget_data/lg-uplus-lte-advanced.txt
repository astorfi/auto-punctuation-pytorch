Not long after South Korea's SK Telecom launched the world's first LTE-Advanced network, its homegrown rival, LG U+, will be rolling out LTE-Advanced to its customers as well, according to Yonhap News. There's no word on what phones the new network will support, though we won't be surprised if LG's own Optimus G successor will be one of them. Now pardon us as we figure out a way to move to South Korea, as that's the only place to get a taste of the zippy speeds right now.
