A thorough review is currently underway, and you can contribute by filling out a survey over at the White House website. First, you'll be asked about how much you trust certain institutions with your data, with responses ranging from "not at all" to very much" (ha!), before the survey prompts you to rank your concern when it comes to certain types of content (like video and audio, or location info) and data practices in general. It's not clear what change, if any, may result from the agency's review, but if you feel strongly about sharing your opinions (and we know you do!), head on over to let the prez know what's on your mind.
