Keeping with the tradition of goofy "z" names (remember Nooka's Zot and Zoo from a couple years back?), the Zub Zayu is ambidextrous and eschews hands for something called the "time capsule" display. And if that isn't enough, it also goes into sleep mode to conserve juice. We just hope it comes back to life quicker than the iPod nano! Available now for $175.
