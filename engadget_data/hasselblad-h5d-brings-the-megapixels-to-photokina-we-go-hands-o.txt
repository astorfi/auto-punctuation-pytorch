The device looks a good deal like its predecessor, maintaining a similar video camera-esque form factor, with an optical viewfinder that extends from the front of the body to the back, above a larger, brighter, easier-to-read display. You'll also find a smaller, monochrome display on the top of the camera to the right of the optical viewfinder. The H5D's also a bit more ruggedized than its predecessor, with improved waterproofing and larger controls -- and it certainly does feel like a big, sturdy camera.

 As with the Lunar, the version we played with is still in prototype stage and wasn't quite functioning perfectly, much to the chagrin of the Hasselblad rep. When the camera hits in December (functioning properly, no doubt), it's going to start at a (perhaps not surprisingly) pricey €13,000 here in Europe, going all the way up to €30,000, depending on whether you opt for the 40-, 50, or 60-megapixel variety -- because hey, what's another €17,000, right?
