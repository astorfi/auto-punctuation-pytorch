The crew at The Verge recently scored some hands-on time with the device, and in the process, cleared up much of the speculation regarding Ma Bell's upcoming Atrix 2 -- also known as the Edison. First, we know the device will indeed have a qHD display, although unlike Moto's other 960 x 540 screens, this one discards the PenTile matrix and features properly proportioned sub-pixels, which delivers crisper text in the process. Additionally, there's now further evidence that the handset will not be a member of AT&T's LTE lineup, and thus will be limited to its HSPA+ network. Notably, this revision adds a shutter button along the right edge of the handset, although like the Photon, it's only a single-stage mechanism, which is quite a bummer. Similar to the Bionic, it features a dual-core 1GHz TI OMAP CPU and delivers comparable benchmarks in the process. Looks like it'll be a fine contender for battle with the biggies from Samsung and Apple, eh?
