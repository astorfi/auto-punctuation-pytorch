Well look no further than the "i-Bob," a shoddily built device (exposed screws? come on!) that does manage to one-up the nano with its video playback capability. Apple must have snatched up all of the available 2GB and 4GB flash modules, because the $119 i-Bob maxes out at 1GB, with cheaper 256MB and 512MB versions also available. Bonus points to the first commenter who picks up on the super-secret subliminal message on the ebay link.
