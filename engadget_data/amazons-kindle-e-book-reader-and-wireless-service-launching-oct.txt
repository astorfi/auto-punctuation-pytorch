 Amazon's little secret that could -- the Kindle -- looks to have a solid launch date. October 15th is the day thanks to Les Echos' press release issued at the launch of their "e-paper" digital newspaper. Of course, it's all just a rumor at the moment but it certainly matches the timeline reported by the New York Times just last month. Now please, Amazon, put some pretty lipstick on that beige pig and push her out the door already -- a year is long enough. [Via MobileRead]
