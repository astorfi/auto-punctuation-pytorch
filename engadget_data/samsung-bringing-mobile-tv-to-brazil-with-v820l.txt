The V820L pivoting flip is a capable 3G phone in its own right, complete with Bluetooth, a 2 megapixel cam, microSD expansion, and a front-facing secondary cam for video calls, but it also adds digital TV reception for Brazil's nascent ISDB-T spectrum. The relatively expansive 2.6 inch display should be a boon for watching your favorite Portuguese-language programming on the go, though it sounds like the limited coverage could be a big bummer at this point until broadcasters have the time to build out the network just a bit. It sounds like carriers might subsidize the phone a bit to knock down that stratospheric price tag, but even so -- just how much do we want to pay for a few square miles of entertainment?[Image via Abril.com, thanks Marcelo R.]
