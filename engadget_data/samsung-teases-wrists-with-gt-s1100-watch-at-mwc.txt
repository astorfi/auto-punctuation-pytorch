Not to be outdone by its crosstown rival, Samsung came to MWC this year with a timeline showing its nearly decade-long history of designing and selling watch phones -- and interestingly, the rightmost entry in the timeline was dated "2009." We couldn't get any solid information on the GT-S1100, but like LG's GD910, the device features a full touchscreen, Bluetooth, and a speakerphone (probably a good thing for a phone you can't put up to your ear without getting a lot of odd looks). 'Course, in all likelihood, this is just another chapter in the book of Samsung heartbreak -- it'll either never see production or get released by precisely one carrier in precisely one country, then promptly fade into oblivion -- but it's looking awfully production-friendly. Same time, same place next year, Sammy -- just make sure you guys bring something more than a dummy behind a glass case this time, k?
