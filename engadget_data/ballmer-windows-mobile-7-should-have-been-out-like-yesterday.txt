That initial word comes from venture capitalist Paul Jozefak (or @pjozefak), who also tweeted that "Ballmer says they screwed up with Windows Mobile," while another attendee, @beninato, directly quotes Ballmer as saying that Microsoft has "pumped in some new talent," and that "this will not happen again." Steve Ballmer's fists could not be reached for comment.
