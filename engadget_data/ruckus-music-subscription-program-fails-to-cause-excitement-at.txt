A number of colleges and universities have been flirting with the idea of providing music subscription services to
students as part of their cost of study, and almost none of them have garnered much enthusiasm. In the latest trial,
American University students were given a free trial of Ruckus, a movie and music downloading program. A full half of
them didn't even bother to try it, and a third of those surveyed said it should definitely not be offered in the coming
academic year. Many complained about the lack of Mac support, and were concerned about instituting a mandatory music
subscription fee as part of their tuition when clearly not everyone would be interested or able to use the service. Not
sure if this quite sank in to the administration at AU, whose response to the survey results has been to look into the
possibility of switching to Napster as an
alternative to Ruckus.
