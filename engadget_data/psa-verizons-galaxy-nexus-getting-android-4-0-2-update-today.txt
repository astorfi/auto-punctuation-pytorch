  Big Red confirmed as much in yesterday's under-the-radar announcement, but we're now receiving reports that some users are being prompted to update their LTE-enabled Galaxy Nexus to Android 4.0.2. It's taking around two to three hours after activation for the update to hit, with ICL53F bringing an optimized mobile hotspot when used with VPN, a few notification fixes and visual improvements to the lock screen. It'll also now automatically reconnect to known WiFi access points, and those wonky email attachment issues that a few folks were having are gone. Oddly, DivX support has actually been yanked, though the company promises to support it "in a future upgrade" -- we're guessing the support that was baked in simply had too many issues to go to market with. It weighs in at 10.7MB; let us know how your installation goes in comments below.
