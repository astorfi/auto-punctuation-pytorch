		Next up, Tim takes a spin around New York City on the Grace One electric bicycle, and we try to figure out whether it's worth the rather steep price tag. Brian pays a visit to the folks at Frog to discuss the company's long history and take a look at some of its industry shaping designs.

Keepon co-creator Marek Michalowski stops by the studio to discuss the creation of his little yellow robot and explain how the dancing 'bot made the journey from research tool to retail toy.

		We swing by the Maker Faire in New York to check out 3D printers, a life-size game of Mouse Trap and get stuck in the (Polaroid) Matrix. And Make: Live co-hosts Becky Stern and Matt Richardson join us in the studio to talk about some of their own favorite DIY projects.

		We close the show with an interview and a few songs from Jonathan Coulton. (Spoiler: he plays the song from Portal.)
