Assuming they are, and bearing in mind that they're already a few months old, then the key news is that the Trinity APU could swing into full production as early as January. This successor to the immensely successful Llano range of mobile APUs will be based on "Piledriver" CPU cores, which themselves are variants of the Bulldozer cores in AMD's imminent desktop refresh. Suddenly that Llano-powered laptop you've been ogling doesn't look like such an obvious purchase. Check out the gallery below for more slides, including intriguing references to post-Trinity "Kaveri" and "Kabini" APUs planned for 2013.
