This admittedly odd looking Nokia has been brought to our attention courtesy of Russia's own Mobile-Review, and while we're still trying to decide whether or not the QWERTY slide-out keyboard is a turn off or totally awesome (with its dot matrix-styled font), we figured it prudent to pass along the information, anyway. Said mobile sports a 2-inch QVGA screen, backlit keys, a 1,000mAh battery good for 4.5 hours of yappin', EDGE data, inbuilt GPS, 128MB of RAM, a microSD card slot, USB / Bluetooth and Symbian S60 running the show. We're told to expect it out in European markets this April for â‚¬220 ($289), though worldwide availability remains a mystery. Have a look in the read link for eleventy billion more images and a poorly translated preview.[Thanks, momchil]
