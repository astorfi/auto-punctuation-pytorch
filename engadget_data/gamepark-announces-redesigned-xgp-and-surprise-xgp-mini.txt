First isthe redesigned XGP (Extreme GamePlayer) handheld, which ditches the swivel screen design that we once opined "looks a bit like the bastard childof a PSP and a Sidekick," for a more traditional Game Gear / Lynx / Nomad-type form factor, while one-upping theGP2X in screen size (4-inches vs. 3.5), the addition of a DMB TV receiver, and a little standard known as WiFi. Thereal surprise, though,Â  was the XGP Mini, an obvious rip-off of homage to the Game Boy Micro,which like the GP2X and XGP, sports an SD slot and 64MB NAND memory, but 32MB less RAM than the 64MB found in itsbrethren. Although release dates are unknown for either model, the XGP will supposedly retail for around $300, whilethe XGP Mini (pictured after the break) will cost $150.[Thanks, Craig]
