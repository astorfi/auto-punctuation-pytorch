 

TiVo's results for the second quarter are here and there were a few tidbits that let us know where its products are going in the future. Despite reporting a net loss for the quarter, its cash position was up after receiving the first $300 million payment from its settlement with Dish Network. Things appear to be going well with Virgin Media in the UK where it reported 50,000 TiVo's live by the end of July and ONO is closing in on a launch in Spain, while closer to home RCN is almost ready to officially offer a whole-home DVR setup based on the quad-tuner TiVo Premiere Q. Charter and DirecTV are mentioned as "progressing towards launch", but the company seems particularly excited to see the current state of patent warfare going on, trumpeting its 210 issued patents and 389 applications.

Speaking of the DirecTivo, an apparent training video has leaked. ZatzNotFunny has more information, but it reveals the hardware and UI, which disappointingly harken back to the days of older Series3 hardware instead of the updated HD menus on the new Premiere boxes. Check out the video and Q2 press release after the break.
      

 

  		Show full PR text  TiVo Reports Results for the Second Quarter Ended July 31, 2011		-- Early success from new operator deals returns TiVo to positive MSO/Broadcaster subscription gains -- Service & Technology revenue up 18% year-over-year, exceeding guidance -- Adjusted EBITDA and Net loss both exceed guidance -- Strong early success at Virgin Media highlighted by more than 50,000 subscriber installs in first three months since launch -- Grande Communications deal showcases TiVo's leadership among small and medium sized operators -- Insignia Connected TV with TiVo Design rolled out at Best Buy -- Announced a stock repurchase program of up to $100 million 		ALVISO, CA, Aug 24, 2011 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- 		TiVo Inc. (NASDAQ: TIVO), a leader in advanced television services, including digital video recorders (DVRs), for consumers, content distributors and consumer electronics manufacturers, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended July 31, 2011. 		Tom Rogers, President and CEO of TiVo, said, "This was another milestone quarter for TiVo, highlighted by our successful execution on key strategic growth initiatives. On the heels of our historic settlement with DISH Network, in the second quarter we delivered better than anticipated revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and net income, exceeding our guidance. Further, the deals we have signed over the past years as a source of growth are now delivering a substantial number of subscribers, and we believe this trend should accelerate with more deployments later this year. Finally, we added yet another distribution relationship in the U.S., this time with Grande Communications. This agreement leverages our R&D investment from existing distribution relationships, highlighting our ability to provide a quick and cost effective advanced television solution for operators globally." 		For the second quarter, service and technology revenues were $49.6 million, compared to our guidance of $46 million to $48 million and up 18% compared to $42.1 million for the same period last year and $38.8 million in the fiscal first quarter 2012. TiVo reported a net loss of ($19.6) million, compared to guidance of a net loss of ($25) million to ($27) million and a net loss of ($15.3) million in the year ago quarter. Net loss per share this quarter on a basic share basis was ($0.17). Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of ($9.2) million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA guidance of a loss of ($14) million to ($16) million, and to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($6.5) million in the same period a year ago. 		TiVo ended the second quarter with approximately $628 million in cash and short-term investments, up significantly from the prior quarter due to the receipt of the first DISH Network settlement payment of $300 million. 		Rogers continued, "We recently announced that our Board has authorized a $100 million share repurchase plan. Both TiVo management and our Board concluded, at the time, that with our shares trading at unusually depressed levels which reflected little value beyond our cash and NOLs, a $100 million repurchase authorization could be a highly compelling investment relative to other uses of cash while also not limiting our ability to consider other strategic opportunities. 		"Our mass distribution efforts are now showing tangible results through subscription growth. We are seeing subscription growth from partners such as RCN, Suddenlink, and Virgin Media, while Charter, DIRECTV, and ONO are progressing towards launch, which we believe should provide further momentum. 		"Virgin Media is a perfect example of how we are executing with operators. As part of its second quarter earnings results, Virgin Media said that it had approximately 50,000 TiVo subscribers live at the end of July. This is a very strong indication of consumer demand in what are only the early stages of this deployment, and we are seeing this demand only accelerate in the third quarter. We are thrilled that Virgin Media has embraced our offering in such a meaningful way. A quote from Neil Berkett, Virgin Media's CEO on the company's recent earnings call said it all: 'I think TiVo will do to our video business what Docsis 3.0 did to our broadband business. I think it will significantly change our brand, our perception and our ongoing delivery... TiVo is the best connected TV certainly in the U.K. and I would argue in the world. It is produced by connected TV experts. It's all they do, that's why we've partnered with them. That's why it's actually launched on time.' 		"Further, we are continuing to focus on deepening current distribution relationships. For example, our relationship with RCN continues to expand as they are set to be the first to offer subscribers a TiVo Whole-Home solution based on TiVo's expanded product family that includes our non-DVR set-top box and 4-tuner DVR set-top box. Our non-DVR set-top box, in particular, increases our ability to significantly penetrate the subscriber base of service providers beyond the DVR, providing us with an even larger opportunity to grow. 		"We're also making steady progress with Suddenlink, as we've seen them accelerating deployments and increasing the TiVo footprint beyond Texas, most notably in North Carolina, where TiVo for the first time is being deployed with an Arris video-on-demand system. As for our deal with Charter, we continue to make progress and we look forward to initiating a trial later this year. 		"In addition, the success we're seeing in our current deployments along with the fact that we are the only mass distributed advanced television solution deployed to date, has led to additional operators taking notice. To that end, we announced earlier today a distribution agreement with Grande Communications, a broadband communications company based in the Southwest U.S. with about 150,000 video subscribers. Going forward, TiVo will be the exclusive provider of DVRs and whole home solutions for Grande. We expect Grande's initial launch to begin in October. It's worth noting that the speed with which we are able to launch with Grande is a great example of how our recent R&D investments enable us to bring on new customers with limited incremental cost to TiVo and the operator and then to move with great speed. 		"On the retail side of the business, Best Buy launched Insignia Connected TVs with a TiVo designed user experience. This is the first time TiVo has been available directly on a television as its primary user interface and highlights another way TiVo touches the consumer as well as represents another device in Best Buy stores with the TiVo experience. While we continue to be cautious with our investments in the retail business, we are confident that our retail offerings will benefit from having the TiVo Designed Insignia televisions at Best Buy. More importantly, by leveraging the R&D elements of our retail business into our operator business, TiVo is the only vendor that is in the unique position of having an array of operator products that benefit from more than ten years of direct interaction with retail subscribers and households. And by being in retail we continue to believe we are able to control our own destiny, innovate, and deliver the best product with a well recognized brand. That pedigree of innovation is one of the things operators find extremely valuable. 		"In terms of our intellectual property, and in particular our patent portfolio, since our inception we have been diligent in our efforts to file patent applications around the inventions we have created. We currently have 210 issued patents and 389 pending applications in our worldwide portfolio of media experience and connectivity intellectual property that extend to DVRs, set-top boxes, smart phones, tablets, and other forms of consumer electronics and processes. And much of this intellectual property extends well into the future. We are very pleased to see that patents and intellectual property in general are becoming increasingly more valuable, and we believe that, as a result of our creativity and engineering focus, we have one of the more significant advanced patent portfolios out there in these fields." 		Rogers concluded, "We are seeing momentum building around many elements of our business that we believe will drive our future growth. We have showcased to the pay-TV world that we have a unique advanced television solution that is being deployed in the marketplace today. We believe our current agreements with operators are just the tip of the iceberg, as we see significant potential in future deals driving accelerated subscription growth. The recent validation of our intellectual property, coupled with the growing value of patent portfolios in the market and the fact that we believe we have now become the leader in the expanding market of advanced television to operators, has put TiVo in a strong position today." 		Management Provides Financial Guidance 		For the third quarter of fiscal 2012, TiVo anticipates service and technology revenues in the range of $49 million to $51 million. TiVo anticipates net loss to be in the range of ($27) million to ($29) million, and an Adjusted EBITDA loss to be in the range of ($17) million to ($19) million. This guidance includes ongoing licensing revenue from the DISH Network settlement. 		This financial guidance is based on information available to management as of August 24, 2011. TiVo expressly disclaims any duty to update this guidance. 		Management's guidance includes Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Regulation G. TiVo has provided a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) in the attached schedules solely for the purpose of complying with Regulation G and not as an indication that EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA is a substitute measure for net income (loss).

TiVo's "EBITDA" means income before interest income and expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. TiVo's "Adjusted EBITDA" is EBITDA less expense for stock-based compensation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, which we refer to as GAAP. We have presented EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA solely as supplemental disclosure because we believe they allow for a more complete analysis of our results of operations and we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are commonly used to analyze companies on the basis of operating performance. In addition, because of the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, and the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, we believe excluding stock-based compensation enhances the ability of management and investors evaluate our operating performance over multiple periods. Management does not use EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of liquidity because, among other things, they do not exclude the impact of deferred revenues associated with the amortization of product lifetime subscriptions. We do not use stock-based compensation expense in our internal measures. A limitation associated with these non-GAAP measures is that they do not include any stock-based compensation expense related to hiring, retaining, and incentivizing the Company's workforce. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent, and should not be considered more meaningful than, or as an alternative to, measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with GAAP.

These lifetime subscriptions no longer generate subscription revenue. 		Subscriptions. Management reviews this metric, and believes it may be useful to investors, in order to evaluate our relative position in the marketplace and to forecast future potential service revenues. The TiVo-Owned lines refer to subscriptions sold directly or indirectly by TiVo to consumers who have TiVo-enabled DVRs and for which TiVo incurs acquisition costs. The MSOs/Broadcasters lines refer to subscriptions sold to consumers by MSOs/Broadcasters such as DIRECTV, Cablevision Mexico, Seven/Hybrid TV (Australia), Television New Zealand (TVNZ) (New Zealand), Virgin Media (United Kingdom), RCN, Suddenlink, and Comcast (under the prior agreement with Comcast) and for which TiVo expects to incur little or no acquisition costs. Additionally, we provide a breakdown of the percent of TiVo-Owned subscriptions for which consumers pay recurring fees, including on a monthly and a prepaid one, two, or three year basis, as opposed to a one-time prepaid product lifetime fee. 		We define a "subscription" as a contract referencing a TiVo-enabled DVR for which (i) a consumer has committed to pay for the TiVo service and (ii) service is not canceled. We count product lifetime subscriptions in our subscription base until both of the following conditions are met: (i) the period we use to recognize product lifetime subscription revenues ends; and (ii) the related DVR has not made contact to the TiVo service within the prior six month period. Product lifetime subscriptions past this period which have not called into the TiVo service for six months are not counted in this total. We amortize all product lifetime subscriptions over a 60 month period. We are not aware of any uniform standards for defining subscriptions and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies. Additionally, the subscription fees that our MSOs/Broadcasters pay us are typically based upon a specific contractual definition of a subscriber or subscription which may not be consistent with how we define a subscription for our reporting purposes nor be representative of how such subscription fees are calculated and paid to us by our MSOs/Broadcasters. Our MSOs/Broadcasters subscription data is based in part on reporting from our third party MSOs/Broadcasters partners. 		TIVO INC.

Management reviews this metric, and believes it may be useful to investors, in order to evaluate our ability to retain existing TiVo-Owned subscriptions (including both monthly and product lifetime subscriptions) by providing services that are competitive in the market. Management believes factors such as service enhancements, service commitments, higher customer satisfaction, and improved customer support may improve this metric. Conversely, management believes factors such as increased competition, lack of competitive service features such as high definition television recording capabilities in our older model DVRs or access to certain digital television channels or MSO Video-on-Demand services, as well as, increased price sensitivity and installation and CableCARD(TM) technology limitations may cause our TiVo-Owned Churn Rate per month to increase. 		We define the TiVo-Owned Churn Rate per month as the total TiVo-Owned subscription cancellations in the period divided by the Average TiVo-Owned subscriptions for the period (including both monthly and product lifetime subscriptions), which then is divided by the number of months in the period. We calculate Average TiVo-Owned subscriptions for the period by adding the average TiVo-Owned subscriptions for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. We calculate the average TiVo-Owned subscriptions for each month by adding the beginning and ending subscriptions for the month and dividing by two. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating churn and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies.

Management reviews this metric, and believes it may be useful to investors, in order to evaluate trends in the efficiency of our marketing programs and subscription acquisition strategies. We define SAC as our total TiVo-Owned acquisition costs for a given period divided by TiVo-Owned subscription gross additions for the same period. We define total acquisition costs as sales and marketing, subscription acquisition costs less net TiVo-Owned related hardware revenues (defined as TiVo-Owned related gross hardware revenues less rebates, revenue share and market development funds paid to retailers) plus TiVo-Owned related cost of hardware revenues. The sales and marketing, subscription acquisition costs line item includes advertising expenses and promotion-related expenses directly related to subscription acquisition activities, but does not include expenses related to advertising sales. We do not include third parties' subscription gross additions, such as MSOs/Broadcasters' gross additions with TiVo subscriptions, in our calculation of SAC because we typically incur limited or no acquisition costs for these new subscriptions, and so we also do not include MSOs/Broadcasters' sales and marketing, subscription acquisition costs, hardware revenues, or cost of hardware revenues in our calculation of TiVo-Owned SAC. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating total acquisition costs or SAC and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies.

Management reviews this metric, and believes it may be useful to investors, in order to evaluate the potential of our subscription base to generate revenues from a variety of sources, including service fees, advertising, and audience research measurement. You should not use ARPU as a substitute for measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes it is useful to consider this metric excluding the costs associated with rebates, revenue share, and other payments to channel because of the discretionary and varying nature of these expenses and because management believes these expenses, which are included in hardware revenues, net, are more appropriately monitored as part of SAC. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies. Furthermore, ARPU for our MSOs/Broadcasters may not be directly comparable to the service fees we may receive from these partners on a per subscription basis as the fees that our MSOs/Broadcasters pay us may be based upon a specific contractual definition of a subscriber or subscription which may not be consistent with how we define a subscription for our reporting purposes or be representative of how such subscription fees are calculated and paid to us by our MSOs/Broadcasters. For example, an agreement that includes contractual minimums may result in a higher than expected MSOs/Broadcasters ARPU if such fixed minimum fee is spread over a small number of subscriptions. 		We calculate ARPU per month for TiVo-Owned subscriptions by subtracting MSOs/Broadcaster-related service revenues (which includes MSOs/Broadcasters' subscription service revenues and MSOs/ Broadcasters'-related advertising revenues) from our total reported net service revenues and dividing the result by the number of months in the period. We then divide by Average TiVo-Owned subscriptions for the period, calculated as described above for churn rate. The above table shows this calculation. 		We calculate ARPU per month for MSOs/Broadcasters' subscriptions by first subtracting TiVo-Owned-related service revenues (which includes TiVo-Owned subscription service revenues and TiVo-Owned related advertising revenues) from our total reported service revenues. Then we divide average revenues per month for MSOs/Broadcasters'-related service revenues by the average MSOs/Broadcasters' subscriptions for the period. The above table shows this calculation.
