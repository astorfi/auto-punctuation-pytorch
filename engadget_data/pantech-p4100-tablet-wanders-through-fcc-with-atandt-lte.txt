Interestingly enough, the device also comes with support for LTE Band 5, an 850Mhz band currently used in South Korea. The P4100 has been sighted once before in a listing of Nenamark benchmark results, hinting that it will use a 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm MSM8260 CPU with Adreno 220 GPU, uses a 1,024 x 720 display and runs on Android 3.2. As always, this never guarantees it'll see the light of day in the US, but having compatible LTE bands on AT&T's network -- not to mention the carrier's friendly relationship with Pantech over the past few years -- definitely gives it a pretty high chance.
