Well, it just got a bump to 2GB and still includes MP3/WMA audio support, an integrated FM radio,built-in mic for voice recording, and itty-bitty OLED display packed into a 14.4- 0.63-ounce pendant.Not only that, but Wal-Mart lost their exclusive rights to sell 'em so go ahead, click the "read" link andstick it to the current whipping boys of the free-market by placing your $160 pre-order direct with Amazon. Mmm, feelsgood.[Via Anything But iPod]
