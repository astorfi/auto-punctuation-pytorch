The app's APK is now freely available on the web, though we'll warn you that it isn't good for much -- you can browse and add items to your queue, but should you try to play a video the app will inform you that it "could not reach the Netflix service." The question is, will Netflix simply flip a switch to turn streaming on, or is it waiting for DRM authentication from a Qualcomm MSM8655 processor?
