SHARP UNVEILS TWO NEW LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY SERIESWITH ADVANCED PICTURE QUALITY New Lines Feature Superlucent Advanced Super View Panel for Superior Image QualityLAS VEGAS, January 7, 2009 – Sharp today introduces the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) AQUOS E Series, including the E77U models and the E67U models, rounding out a lineup of new Full-HD 1080p LCD TVs that bring enhanced picture quality to the forefront. The E Series features the E77U models in 65- (64 33/64" diagonal), 52- (52 1/32" diagonal), 46- (45 63/64" diagonal) and 40-inch (40" diagonal) screen class sizes (LC-65E77U, LC-52E77U, LC-46E77U and LC-40E77U respectively), and the E67U models in 40- (40" diagonal) and 32-inch (31 35/64" diagonal) screen class sizes (LC-40E67U and LC-32E67U respectively). All E series models employ a new Advanced Super View (ASV) Superlucent Panel for a dramatically bright and crisp picture with reduced haze and reflectivity. Additionally, the entire series boasts a new elegant design with color accents at the bottom of the frame and a newly designed convenient swivel stand. "When consumers decide to purchase a flat-screen TV, their top priority is superior picture quality. With the AQUOS E Series, Sharp is giving consumers a powerful combination of image-enhancing features and a wide range of choices across several screen sizes," said Bob Scaglione, senior vice president and group manager, Product and Marketing Group, Sharp Electronics Corporation. E77U Series The E77U Series features Sharp's Fine Motion Enhanced technology for 120Hz Frame Rate Conversion and a fast pixel response time of 4ms, ensuring the LC-65E77U, LC-52E77U, LC-46E77U and LC-40E77U provide the ultimate medium for high-definition viewing of fast-action imagery. With Sharp's new 10-bit ASV Superlucent panel and 10-bit processing engine, the E77U models are able to achieve maximum expression of the Full-HD 1080p picture. The Superlucent panel applies an ultra-smooth finish that minimizes gloss while intensifying panel brightness and contrast. The ASV panel with Spectral Contrast Engine XD (Extreme Dark), UD (Ultra Dark) on the LC-40E77U, provides a high dynamic contrast ratio, enabling deep blacks and vibrant colors, and a special dejudder feature results in the smooth reproduction of film content. Not only does the E77U series provide a stunning picture, but it also features a new design sure to complement any décor. The black cabinet gives way to a soft gold hue that accents the bottom of the frame, befitting both modern and traditional design schemes. The series also comes equipped with a full array of connectivity options, including five HDMI™ (version 1.3 with Deep Color and 24p input capability) and two component video inputs, all of which are 1080p compatible, accepting signals from Blu-ray and advanced gaming devices. A dedicated PC input and RS-232 port for custom installations add to the feature set. With utility bills still top of mind, these units are compliant with new Energy Star standards and also offer energy savings through Sharp's OPC function, which automatically adjusts luminance to room brightness and lighting conditions. E67U Series Both E67U models incorporate Sharp's ASV Superlucent panel technology, providing the most detailed Full HD 1080p picture possible. Additionally, these models come fully equipped with HD inputs - four HDMI with 24p input capability and two component video inputs, all 1080p compatible. Like the E77U models, the E67U models include energy saving features with Sharp's OPC and adhere to the new Energy Star standards. The E67 models also boast a new design, with a subtle copper hue at the bottom of the cabinet and swivel convenience. The LC-32E67U also comes equipped with advanced gaming features to satisfy video gamers looking for superior picture quality. Sharp's proprietary Vyper Drive circuit reduces the lag time between the game console input and the TV display to imperceptible levels, ensuring video gamers a seamless gaming experience.Pricing and availability * LC-65E77U will be available in June for a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $4,499.99 * LC-52E77U will be available in February for an MSRP of $2,399.99 * LC-46E77U will be available in February for an MSRP of $2,099.99 * LC-40E77U will be available in March for an MSRP of $1,399.99 * LC-40E67U will be available in March for an MSRP of $1,199.99 * LC-32E67U will be available in February for an MSRP of $899.99  For more information on Sharp's full line of Liquid Crystal Televisions, contact Sharp Electronics Corporation, Sharp Plaza, Mahwah, N.J. 07495-1163, or call 800-BE-SHARP.
