If you were hoping to see more of Spartan 117 ahead of Halo 5: Guardians release this October, today isn't your day. Sure, there's a new trailer embedded below, but it isn't gameplay. Nor does it tell us much about what's going on with the game's story (Dr. Halsey working alongside Covenant Elites is intriguing, though). It's bombastic, pretty, and stars Nightfall protagonist Jameson Locke, but the clip ultimately rings a bit hollow. If you want to see what Nathan FIllion looks like after spending some time in the uncanny valley, however, you're in for a treat. Everyone else that's expecting some hot new footage of Master Chief on the battlefield will almost assuredly be disappointed, though.
