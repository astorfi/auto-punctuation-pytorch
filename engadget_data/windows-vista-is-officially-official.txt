Yep, it's confirmed: Longhorn = Windows Vista. They couldn't keep
the news from leaking out last night, but Microsoft just
made the official announcement a few minutes ago. Hope you're as pumped up about the name as these guys, because you're
going to be hearing the name "Windows Vista" A LOT over the next eight years or so.
