On the social network entry, it notes that the new series will have an "unexpected distinction", which is hopefully more than just a baffling screen ratio. Will it be ready for MWC in a few weeks? Or will the company go the way of other smartphone makers and just launch whatever it has at its very own event? Who knows? LG does, that's who.

 Update: Following that vague theme, LG's now got a teaser video for you to see, confirming that we'll be seeing their new stuff at MWC.
