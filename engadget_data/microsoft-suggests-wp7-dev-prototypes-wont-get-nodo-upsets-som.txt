Even though test units were given free to many devs, a few poor saps have reported buying them from third-parties. Without eulogizing, we'd like to remind everyone that these phones were born from the greatness of the i8910 only to give coders early access to the platform. Considering what's coming in Windows Phone Next, perhaps it's time to shed that prototype hardware and move boldly forward. That commemorative Taylor will look mighty fine in a display case, don't you think?
