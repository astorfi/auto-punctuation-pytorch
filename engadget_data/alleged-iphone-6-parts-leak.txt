Lately it seems like Apple can't build anything without a few prototype cases leaking into public view, and now we're seeing pictures of what could be the next iPhone. Posted by a Twitter user earlier today and addressed to several Apple-focused websites, the "iPhone 6" shells look very close to current models, but are thinner and have space for a larger edge to edge-style display, which has been rumored before. Sonny Dickson, who has previously obtained iPhone and iPad parts prior to the launch of new devices, has also apparently received the same pictures and tells MacRumors they came from a source in China. Based on the ports, MacRumors says the parts here are 2.6-inches wide, compared to the iPhone 5s which is 2.31 inches. Are these pics the real thing, and if they are, do they represent what we'll likely see from Apple later this year? Without any details to back them up we can't be sure, but you can check out a few more pictures for yourself after the break.


Update: Forum posters at MacRumors have taken a closer look at the images and found several reasons to believe they're rendered fakes, including textures that repeat and the usage of an out-of-date font.
