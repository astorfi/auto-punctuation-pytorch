The Soundfly portable speaker ($179 to $199), the OnBeat aWake iPad dock ($139), the OnBeat Venue Bluetooth loudspeaker ($199), and the J Series headphones (which come in a variety of styles and prices, from $39 to $149) are all now available. Sadly, despite the introduction of Apple's new connection port earlier this year, all of JBL's offerings this year are only compatible with the original, 30-pin connector -- something to consider when purchasing gifts for your early-adopter audiophile friends. Said wares can be had through JBL's website, as well as via your local brick-and-mortar.
