Described as "systems and methods for enticing users to access a web site," the patent credits Google co-founder Sergey Brin as the sole inventor, and it comes more than ten years after Google first filed the application. As you might expect, the patent seems to cover some fairly broad territory, although it's not clear how or if Google actually plans to enforce it -- either way, we can only assume that some other companies who enjoy having a bit fun with their logo from time to time might have something to say about it.
