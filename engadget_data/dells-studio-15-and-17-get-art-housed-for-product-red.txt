That's right: now you can have an arty Dell and do some good at the same time, with the choice of three different artists: Joseph Amedokpo, Siobhan Gunning and Bruce Mau. The custom designs will be available on Dell's Studio 15 and 17 models for $649 and $799 respectively, and a $20 contribution will be made to The Global Fund for AIDS programs in Africa for each one sold. Dell claims that the art is "permanently infused" on the casing and totally durable, so, just like when deciding on a tattoo, be sure you're really committed before the purchase. And if you're too cool for these designs, well, maybe your slightly hip, gaudy great aunt will be interested. Regardless, they're available now online.
