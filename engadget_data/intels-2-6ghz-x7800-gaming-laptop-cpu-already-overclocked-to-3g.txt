The other most notable addition is the 2.6GHz Core 2 Extreme X7800 with an 800MHz dynamic FSB and 4MB L2 cache -- Intel's first "Extreme" branded processor to make the leap from desktops to laptops. A 2.8GHz X7900 is expected later in the year. No worries though, the X7800's unlocked multiplier should allow for "easy" overclocking. In fact, some (vaguely insane) Belgian tinkerers over at Matbe have already dialed in a 3GHz speed on an X7800-equipped ASUS G2S gaming laptop. Niiice. Expect to see the first gaming laptops sporting the new $851 X7800 procs in the next few weeks.Read -- Overclocked ASUS G2S Read -- Intel's new processors
