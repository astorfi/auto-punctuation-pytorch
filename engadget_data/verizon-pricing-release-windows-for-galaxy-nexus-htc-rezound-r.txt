  One of our tipsters has forwarded this info from Verizon, with pricing and advertising dates for the supposedly Ice Cream Sandwich-ready Galaxy Nexus and the HTC Rezound (aka HTC Vigor). According to the leak we can expect both to sport on-contract minimum advertised pricing (MAP) of $299 when they launch. While their MAP period is pegged to start November 10th, as Droid-Life points out, they may not be released immediately. Still, it means you may have a couple more weeks to save up for one of these superphones and now that you have a target you can make sure your swear jar, piggy bank, or emergency slush fund is up to the task.[Thanks, Anonymous]
