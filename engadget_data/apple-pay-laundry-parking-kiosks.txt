Checking out at the super market with your phone is old hat. But topping off the parking meter, now that's kind of interesting. USA Technologies, a company that handles cashless payments, announced that about 200,000 of its points of purchase will accept Apple Pay. And we're not just talking about NFC vending machines here. This company is outfitting laundromats, parking kiosks and "other self-serve appliances" with the payment terminals. This means that on top of paying for your next tank of gas or grocery trip, you won't have to futz with loose change to do a load of whites or feed that meter.
