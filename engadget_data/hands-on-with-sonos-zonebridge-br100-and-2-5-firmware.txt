Sonos primarily sees the BR100 as a range extender, specifically solving the problem of some households wasting a ZP80 or ZP100 locked away in a closet with their router due to the requirement of at least one Zone being hard plugged directly into the network. The unit itself is smallish, light and of quality construction -- and that's really all there is to it. As for firmware 2.5, Napster is obviously the primary addition, but we're pretty partial to the new search function; text input is a chore, but there's really no better way to locate your own music or track down new tracks on the multiple music services available to the system.
