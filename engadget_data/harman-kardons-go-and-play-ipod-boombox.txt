Ok, we shouldn't be so cynical, Harman Kardon's Go and Play, unlike the rest, docks your iPod near-horizontally, reducing the chances that it'll jump out and take off, as it so often does. Besides the stainless steel handle, RF remote, d-cell or AC power playback, and S-Video out, you can also expect the Go and Play to feature a â‚¬349 (about $450) deduction in the bank accounts of its takers.
