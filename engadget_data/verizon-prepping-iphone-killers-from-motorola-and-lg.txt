       When Verizon passed on the iPhone, was it a bad business decision or was it a part of a much larger idea for The Network to bring a next-generation music device to market? Enter Motorola and what is being described as an "iPhone Killer" by employees of both companies. Code named the "M" and designed for the mediacentric user, it's likely to impress (if they really want to kill the iPhone, anyway). Details are on the slim side, but reports suggest a 3 megapixel shooter with a large QVGA display and lots of internal storage. In addition to the M, word is that LG is preparing a CDMA version of the popular -- but -- expensive KE850 (aka Prada) for release sometime in the 3rd quarter (this one's also a potential iPhone nemesis, if you ask us). Make sure you keep a lookout for more deets![Thanks, Roc a fella]
