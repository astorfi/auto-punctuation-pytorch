Of interest are those tiny left and right-eye microdisplays with 320 x 240 pixel transmissive color LCDs from Kopin Corp out of wicked Westboro, Mass. Also notable is the weight -- 118-grams -- of which, a good portion is from the cables. Plenty of lewd, techno-gore just beyond the read link. You know, if you can pull yourself away from your ohmmeter long enough.
