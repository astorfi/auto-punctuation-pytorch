Clearly testing a unit not afflicted withthe gradient bandingissues some users are reporting on forums, NF finds the 2007WFPto be a solid performer for video, gaming, and office uses alike (although the 16ms response time probably won't cut itwith hardcore fraggers in a world of 1ms options), offering good picture quality, plenty of connectivity options, andan intuitive GUI in an attractive package. Especially noteworthy are the variety of ports, with four USB 2.0, DVI, VGA,composite, and S-Video inputs ensuring that only component-equipped devices will feel left out. Best of all, this $530display -- with its HDCP-support -- will work with an HD-DVD or Blu-ray player when you decide to take the plunge,making the Dell that much more of a bargain.[Via Yahoo]
