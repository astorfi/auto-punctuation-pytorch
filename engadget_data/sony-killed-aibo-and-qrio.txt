At the risk of sounding terribly insensitive,somehow the prospect of AIBO and QRIO dying actually makes us more heartsick than the news of the 10,000 some-odd jobsStringer cut reorganizing the electronics giant. Sony, say it ain't so, say it ain't so!P.S. -When SonyAmerica wakes up this morning we'll be placing some calls.[Via AkihabaraNews]
