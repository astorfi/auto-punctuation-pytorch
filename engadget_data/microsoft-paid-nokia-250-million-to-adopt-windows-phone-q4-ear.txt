   Microsoft and Nokia have historically been pretty tight-lipped about the value of their Windows Phone partnership, but the cat leapt out of the bag this morning, courtesy of Espoo's Q4 2011 earnings report. As SlashGear's Chris Davies noticed, Nokia received about $250 million from Redmond during the fourth quarter of 2011, as part of the companies' "broad strategic agreement." Under the agreement, the manufacturer receives so-called "platform support payments" from Microsoft -- which, in turn, receives software licensing payments from Nokia. The $250 million Microsoft doled out last quarter is the first of these transactions. All told, Nokia expects the payments both to and from Microsoft to total "in the billions of US Dollars."
