 We may spend a lot of time staring at our computer display each
day, but the computer couldn't care less; looking at the screen is strictly a one-way experience. That could change if
a program called Navigaze, developed by developer Cybernet Systems, catches on. Navigaze, a free download for Windows
PCs, turns any compatible webcam into an input device, letting you control your PC with head movements and eye blinks.
Cybernet — which has produced gesture-based software for everyone from TV weathermen to gamers — sees Navigaze as a
tool to allow handicapped individuals to use PCs.
