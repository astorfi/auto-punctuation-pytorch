 Want to dig through 2.3 and see what all the fuss is about for yourself? Well, you're in luck, because Gingerbread has just hit the Android Open Source Project's repository, which means you can set up your machine to download the code. It's great news for hardware companies that don't care to get Google's certification to include Android Market access -- but it's also great news for casual and serious hackers alike who are looking to craft some seriously wild, wacky custom ROMs. So, what are you waiting for? Get to it, folks.

[Thanks, Mike]

Update: Eager coders are being asked to "wait a few hours or a few days" before downloading to balance out the server load -- and while you're likely not interested in doing that, it's probably in your best interest to heed the advice.
