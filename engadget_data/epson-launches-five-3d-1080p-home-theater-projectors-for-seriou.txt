They combine 1080p images with active 3D tech for a price that home theater builders shouldn't immediately dismiss. The flagship Pro Cinema 6010 and Home Cinema 5010 lines can output 2,400 lumens while maintaining a contrast ratio of 200,000:1. Both also include the ability to convert 2D content to 3D on the fly. The primary difference between the $4,000 6010 and $3,000 5010 (the wirelessHD-equipped 5010e will run about $3,500) is the included accessories and options: like ceiling mounts, 3D glasses and additional lens modes. The budget 3010 ($1,600) and 3010e ($1,800) models sport a more modest 40,000:1 contrast ratio and 2,200 lumen rating, but do have a pair of built-in 10W speakers. Oddly, only the 3010 package will include 3D glasses. The Pro Cinema 6010 and Home Cinema 5010 line will start shipping in November, while the 3010 series will land in October.
