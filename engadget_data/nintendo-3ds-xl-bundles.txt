For the minimalists: the Monster Hunter Tri G bundle complete with all-black 3DS XL (known as the LL in Japan), releasing November 1st for 21,800 yen (approximately $280). Following one week later (on the 8th) is the Animal Crossing: Jump Out bundle with white and pattern handheld, setting you back 22,800 yen (approximately $290). And, for the same price, the pièce de résistance of the trio -- a New Super Mario Bros. 2 bundle with black and embellished red XL, expected November 15th. If you're the importing type, or just want to see how good the Japanese got it, then check out the gallery below and pick your favorite.
