Now we've been hepped to the fact that the company is teaming up with Oceaneering International to overhaul NASA's space suit. The last that we heard, the project had been scuttled altogether, but you know how quickly things can be unscuttled when the White House changes hands. The Constellation Space Suit System (CSSS) will be designed in a modular fashion, so that the same suit can be used by the astronaut for all the different aspects of his / her mission. You can look forward to the stylish debut of these bad boys on the new Orion spaceship, currently planned to launch in 2015. According to Engineering TV, this will be the first major space suit redesign in over forty years. Can we make a suggestion? Please don't do anything to that iconic NASA logo -- some things never go out of style. Video after the break.
