The launch of a new Super Smash Bros. game for the first time in six years on 3DS was great news, but it left us wondering: when the heck is it coming to Wii U? Luckily, Nintendo has quickly answered that question. It'll arrive to the big console on November 21st in North America for $59.99, and in the UK on December 5th for Â£39.99 (see the new game trailer below). Being Nintendo, there's more, of course. You'll be able to pick up a set of 12 Amiibo figures for $12.99 (with six more coming by December) and even use a GameCube to control your Wii U too, thanks to a $19.99 adapter. In fact, if you want the whole shebang -- GameCube, Super Smash Bros. and the adapter -- Nintendo's also offering the complete bundle for $100.
