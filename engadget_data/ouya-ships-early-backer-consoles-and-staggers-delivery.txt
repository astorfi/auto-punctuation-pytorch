OUYA is true to its word: the company has confirmed to us that it's shipping the first units of its namesake game console to the many, many people who crowdfunded at a tier high enough to set aside a production system. If you've received a tracking notice, you should expect to have the cuboid at your door in five to ten days, depending on just which corner of the world you live in. Don't be surprised if your inbox remains empty for now, however. OUYA notes that it's spreading delivery over the "coming weeks," which by necessity will leave a few of us twiddling our (currently gamepad-free) thumbs.
