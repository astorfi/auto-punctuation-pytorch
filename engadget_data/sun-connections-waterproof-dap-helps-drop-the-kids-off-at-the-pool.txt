 There was a time when the display-less mp3 player was an item of ridicule and scorn. But with the second-gen iPod shuffle becoming Apple's number one seller, well, let's just say that the industry has taken notice. Starting today, the Japanese can pick up the Â¥2,980 (about $25) MUSIC+SC-MP512MWP from Sun Connection. Available in three colors, this MP3/WMA player packs 512MB of flash, a waterproof case, and just a hint of "BM" smeared along the bottom. What more could you ask for?[Via Impress]
