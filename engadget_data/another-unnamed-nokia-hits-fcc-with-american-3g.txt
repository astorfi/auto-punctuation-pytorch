It should -- it bears an uncanny resemblance to that of the RM-289, another unidentified Nokia handset that graced the FCC's hallowed halls not long ago -- but this is something entirely different. Like the RM-289, the RM-276 features WCDMA on the 850 and 1900MHz bands, suggesting that an American (read: AT&T) launch is at least a possibility -- and even if AT&T passes on this golden opportunity, folks might end up being able to snag 'er SIM-free. Whether the outline actually has any bearing on the device's shape remains to be seen, but if it does, it almost looks like a butterfly QWERTY model in the same vein as the E70, does it not?
