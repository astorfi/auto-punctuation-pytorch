We kind of figured anyone paying attention to our
reports on the
Cell processor would have gotten the jist of it by now
that it wasn't really being poised to compete with the x86 or PowerPC markets—afterall, for all its technological
advancements it's primarily a number cruncher, 8 of those 9 cores being vector units, which are perfect for
gaming and running codecs and predictable
processes—but Jon Peddie is out for blood over the Cell's already accumulating hype and misrepresentations. We can't
say we blame him, too (we're officially pointing the finger at Sony's notorious hype machine). Anyway, he wants you to
know: no, it's not a "supercomputer" (by definition, anyway), no, it won't do straight Internetworked grid computing,
and while it may show up in your TV, no, it's probably not going to change your life. In other words, the jig is up.
But thanks for playing Toshiba, IBM, and (especially) Sony, and we'll see you in 2007 for your next bull session of
hype!
