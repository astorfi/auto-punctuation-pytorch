While it didn't have any more to say than that, the company's Windows Phone summit does follow later that week, and there's been no shortage of Microsoft-related rumors as of late, including a possible acquisition of Yammer (reported today by Bloomberg), and long-running talk of Office for iPad, which was again revived earlier this month. Whatever it is, we'll be there to bring you the news as it happens.

 Update: Citing "sources outside the company," AllThingsD is reporting that the event will focus on Windows RT for ARM-based tablets, and that Microsoft will be showing off devices running the OS as well as some of the programs and services that will be available for them.
