So the dude who we have to thank for the "portable" Atari
2600 (not to be confused with the portable NES, or
any of the others), Benjamin Heckendorn,
apparently got busay again on a, uh,  pocketable N64 system he somehow wrangled into a custom enclosure. He then
pitted it in an all out battle against the
DS—he doesn't seem to think there was a
clear winner, but somehow we're pretty sure a homebrew deconstructed home deck wedged into god-knows-what trumps the
real deal. Plus, as he points out, you don't have to tap the screen just to get the thing going.
