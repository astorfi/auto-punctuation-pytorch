 It's not just the Android side of things that's getting a little love from Netflix, the iPhone app just got a refresh too. The new design brings the mobile version much more inline with the tablet edition that got a revamp last December. The update brings with it the ability to resume watching shows, right from the top of the app view, along with the sliding rows of titles, and custom recommendations that you may be familiar with from other versions. The new interface gets the official walk-through in the video after the break, but as it's available now, you might just want to fondle the source link directly.
