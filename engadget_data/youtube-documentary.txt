YouTube may be one of the big reasons to ditch conventional TV, but that isn't stopping the National Geographic Channel from putting YouTube on TV. The network is airing Generation YouTube, a documentary on the origins and cultural impact of the streaming video site, on July 11th (tonight, if you're reading this soon enough) at 10PM Eastern. As you can see in the teaser clip, the show underscores YouTube's very humble beginnings -- it was going to be an online dating site at one point, and it didn't take off until it embraced that upload-what-you-want philosophy. If you've wondered how YouTube got to the point where it's creating internet memes and supporting whole careers, you'll probably want to tune in.
