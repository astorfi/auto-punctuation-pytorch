Well, this was bound to happen: Korean MP3 player manufacturers are none too pleased with Samsung's decision to sell
out its compatriots and give archrival Apple a super
excellent discount on those 2GB and 4GB flash memory modules used in the new

iPod nano. Samsung gave Apple such a sweet deal (supposedly in the area of 50%) that now no one else can expect to
compete on price, with a spokesperson from ReignCom, the company behind the
iRiver brand, dejectedly declaring
that since they can, "hardly declare a price war with Apple. We'll counter Apple's challenge by releasing new concept
products." A Samsung Electronics exec defended the move, saying that volume buyers get better deals, and that his
company, "didn't mean to do any harm to domestic MP3 manufacturers." Hey, business is business, right?
