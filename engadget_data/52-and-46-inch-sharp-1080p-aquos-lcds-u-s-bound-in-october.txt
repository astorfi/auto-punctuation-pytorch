 Speaking of "reaching a broader customer base in a speedy and timely manner", Sharp has already announced US pricing and availability for two of the LCDs already shown this morning in Japan. The 52-inch LC-52D62U and 46-inch LC-46D62U 1080p Aquos LCDs will be available in October with MSRPs of $4,799 and $3,499 respectively. Couple that with their new next-generation ASV panel that provides a 2000:1 static contrast ratio (10,000:1 dynamic), 450 cd/m2 brightness, 4ms response time, two 1080p HDMI inputs, two component inputs, built -in QAM/ATSC tuners and Sharp's 4-wavelength backlighting system and you have a good product at a great price compared to Samsung and Sony LCDs of the same size. No word yet on the 42-inch HDTV shown earlier in Japan, but they may wait to announce it here since it is not due until November.
