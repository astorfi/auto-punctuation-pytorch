 When EE activated its LTE network part-way through its fourth-quarter, there was an assumption speed-hungry Brits would storm the company's numerous stores to get at that super-fast mobile data. The reality, however, seems to indicate that it takes more than a Kevin Bacon commercial to send the homeland into a frenzy. The company's financial results show that the network only added 201,000 customers between October and December 31st -- 49,000 fewer than in Q3 and 112,000 fewer than signed up in the same period in 2011. EE also isn't breaking out figures for how many of its existing customers made the change -- so for now we'll have to assume that the UK isn't as sweet on the guy from Footloose as Olaf Swanee had hoped.
