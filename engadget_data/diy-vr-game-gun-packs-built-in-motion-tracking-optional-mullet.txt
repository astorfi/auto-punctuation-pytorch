As you can see above, the rig consists of a toy gun with an LCD screen attached to it, but the real secret is a Gyration Air Mouse mounted on top, which allows for some full, seemingly responsive motion-tracking in any PC game. To really finish things off, our fearless modder also ripped apart a gamepad and wired it up to the trigger in the gun, which turns out to be just the thing for playing F.E.A.R.... on the highest difficulty setting. Must-see video after the break.   Update: As helpfully pointed out in comments, there's now a wireless version of the Game Gun and, of course, a new video. Check it out after the break as well.
