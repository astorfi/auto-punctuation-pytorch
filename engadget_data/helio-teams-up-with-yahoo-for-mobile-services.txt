 In a new partnership announced today, Yahoo is going to be launching a slew of services for Helio customers including search, mail, IM, news, sports and more. This is supposed to be one of the most extensive mobile offerings of Yahoo! services, and Helio seems to think it lines up well with that snazzy target demographic of theirs. Some of the more interesting integration includes Yahoo search straight from your phone's home screen and the display of news feeds there as well. There's no word as to when the Yahoo services will launch, but we're guessing they'll be available when Helio itself launches this spring.
