Now an Italian dude by the name of Fabio Mele reckons he's gotten hold of Verizon's ROM for the Vigor and extracted a ton of information, including tutorial videos (which yielded the render above) and key hardware credentials. And they're some credentials: a 4.3-inch screen with 720 lines of LG-rivalling HD craziness, a dual-core 1.5GHz processor, 1GB RAM and an 8MP rear camera. The reported ROM also contains HTC's much-hyped Beats Audio software, which we've experimented with on the Un-American Sensation XE. We're taking all this with a pinch of salt if you don't mind, Signor Mele, but we want to believe you, we really do.

Update: That elusive Vigor tutorial vid has popped up online and shows the handset from all angles, including what lies beneath its battery cover (hint: it's a SIM slot for what we presume to be LTE access). Check it out after the break.

Update 2: And now some real photos of the Vigor have shown up online, too. Check out a couple after the break, and get the full spread over at Android Central.
