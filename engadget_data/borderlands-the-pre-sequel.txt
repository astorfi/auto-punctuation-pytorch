The hugely popular first-person shooter series Borderlands is getting a new entry in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, a game set between the story of previous two games. Not exactly shocking, but neat nonetheless. What's shocking is where we'll play Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel when it arrives this fall: Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Despite the Xbox One and PlayStation 4... ya know, existing, the next major Borderlands game apparently isn't headed their way. That said, there's one other platform that fans can snag it on: PC. And given the PC-like architecture of the new consoles, you'll forgive us if we don't feign surprise when the game eventually arrives on newer platforms.


The game's development is being handled by both the series creators at Gearbox Software and 2K's Australian arm. Thus far, the only footage available is pre-Alpha (read: early), but, well, it looks an awful lot like the Borderlands games you already know and love. Perhaps you don't already know and love the series? We've got a trailer below the break that'll help get you up to speed.
