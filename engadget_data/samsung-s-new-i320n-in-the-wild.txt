The re-designed GSM device rocks a different keyboard shape than the original, but boasts similar specs, including a 1.3-megapixel camera (with flash), QVGA screen, stereo speaker, Bluetooth and EDGE support. Still no info on pricing or availability on this Windows Mobile powered hotness, but we've got our fingers crossed that this makeover won't drive the price tag through the proverbial roof. With all these Q knocks (like TechFaith, for one) making it out though, we imagine competition in price is gonna be pretty stiff.
