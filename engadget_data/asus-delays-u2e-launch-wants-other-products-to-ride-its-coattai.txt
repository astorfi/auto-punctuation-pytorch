There's apparently no production delays or other problems with the laptop, however, with Asus instead rather frankly fessing up that its holding back on the laptop simply so it can launch some other products alongside it. In case you missed it, the U2E (also known as the U2) boasts an 11-inch LED-backlit display, a Core Duo ULV processor and a 32GB SSD drive, all of which combine for some expectedly strong battery life while still maintaining some decent performance -- and no doubt a lofty price tag as well.
