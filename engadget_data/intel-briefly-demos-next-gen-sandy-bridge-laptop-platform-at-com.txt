The demo was quite brief, but showed off the power of the future Intel integrated graphics with a side by side comparison with a discrete graphics system. It's all in the video after the break, but don't get your hopes up about seeing these new processors anytime soon -- Intel's Dadi Perlmutter confirmed that they won't hit the market until 2011.
