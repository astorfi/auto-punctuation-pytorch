 
Infinity is looking to clip that lonely cable that snakes from your audio rack to the subwoofer with its new lineup of PSW310W, PS212W and PS210W subs. The top model PSW310W (pictured) gets treated to a 10-inch ceramic-metal driver and 10-inch passive radiators, a 400-Watt amp and room tuning to tame nasty modes. The other two models make their way with 12- and 10-inch metal-matrix drivers for the PS212W and PS210W, respectively. Most importantly, though, all three models share the ability to beam your bass from the equipment rack to the sub via 2.4GHz transmitter. All models are available now for $1,199, $679 and $549 for the PSW210W, PS212W and PS210W, respectively.
