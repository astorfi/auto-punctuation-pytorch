 Who makes the most plasmas in the world? Matsushita/Panasonic or Samsung? Nope...Hitachi/Fujitsu...Nope. LG shipped the most plasmas last quarter. They claimed 31 percent of the market share while Matsushitas Panasonic brand fell a to the second spot and claimed 24 percent of the market. Samsung then dropped their second place spot and fell to third. The bad news in all this is that plasmas are not doing so well. Plasmas had a great last quarter but shipments are down 11 percent. Come on people. Buy some plasmas!
