 
Well, it looks like Venue Pro owners will be getting not one but two software updates in the near future. Dell has just confirmed that the much-anticipated NoDo Windows Phone 7 update has begun rolling out to devices today, and also announced that a separate update of its own will be "coming later." NoDo, of course, adds copy and paste functionality among some other updates and tweaks, while the Dell update is only said to have "more fixes." Feel free to let us know how the update works out for you in comments.
