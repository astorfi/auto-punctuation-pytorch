Starting with the big boy, you're looking at a 10 megapixel sensor, 2.8-inch vari-angle LCD, 5x optical zoom, RAW support, a hotshoe and an MSRP of $499.99 when it lands in October. Moving on, we've got the $429.99 PowerShot S90, an all-business point-and-shoot model with a 3-inch LCD, 10 megapixel sensor, DIGIC 4 processing engine, RAW support and a 3.8x optical zoomer. Moving right along, there's the SX20 IS megazoom ($399.99), which packs a 12.1 megapixel sensor, 720p (30fps) video mode, an HDMI output, 20x zoomer and a 2.5-inch vari-angle display. The SX120 IS is a simpler beast (albeit bulkier), sporting a 10 megapixel sensor, 3-inch LCD, 10x optical zoom and AA battery support for $249.99, while the $329.99 SD980 IS Digital ELPH snags a 12.1 megapixel sensor, 3-inch touchscreen, 720p movie mode, 5x optical zoom lens and four different colors (silver, blue, gold and purple). Finally, the $299.99 SD940 IS offers up most of the SD980's amenities save for the LCD and zoom, which is replaced by a non-touch 2.7-inch version and a 4x lens.
