 
Believe it or not, Toshiba has been toying around with dual-screen tablets at least as far back as 2006, and it looks like it might be trying its hand at the idea again now that it's catching on a bit -- DigiTimes is reporting that company has a new dual-screen "GuideBook" device on track for a June launch. Unfortunately, the only other details at the moment are that the device will apparently pack two 7-inch displays, and that it will supposedly be manufactured by Toshiba in-house. We're also assuming / hoping that the company has managed to refine things a bit from the circa-2006 device pictured above.
