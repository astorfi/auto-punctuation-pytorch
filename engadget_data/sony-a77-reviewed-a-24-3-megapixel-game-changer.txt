Sure, the $1,400 cost of entry (body only) will weigh heavily on even the most enthusiastic cameraman conscious. But, what's a few hundred dollars when it comes to a camera that Popular Photography says has "radically changed the world of DSLRs"? It seems only the rival Canon 7D holds a candle to this would-be king, besting Sony's latest when it comes to noise and performance at higher ISOs. However, the A77 wins on its all-around charm, with a 24.3 megapixel Exmor APS-C sensor, articulated LCD screen, world-first OLED EVF and impressive video-shooting chops. Video-wise, that top dollar gets you a high-end performance of 60fps at 1920 x 1080 with the fast phase-detection auto-focus we've also seen on its predecessors, the Sony A55 and A33.

Popular Photography does add a single caveat to the largely very positive conclusion: video enthusiasts should probably hold tight to see what Canon and Nikon counter with. Especially if you're in possession of multiple lenses. Aside from that, what's stopping you? Dig in to all the nitty-gritty details below, and we'd advise cutting down on those impulse eBay purchases -- this magnesium-alloyed beauty will certainly make a financial dent when it lands, if not a physical one.
