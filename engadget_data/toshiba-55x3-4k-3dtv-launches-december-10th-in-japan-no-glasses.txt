The 55X3 (ZL2 in Europe) still doesn't have a North American ship date, but we can still drool over its high res display and autostereoscopic (no glasses) 3D screen that adjusts for its viewers' location based on face tracking technology, although that results in a resolution drop down to 720p. Our last time getting eyes-on with a prototype panel was at CES and we probably won't see it again until we're back in Las Vegas in a few weeks, let's hope all that CEVO Engine technology Toshiba's plugged in for image processing makes it worth the wait... and the price.
