Online TV streaming service Aereo is going Manifest Destiny and headed westward, specifically to the fine state of Utah. The service is set to launch statewide on August 19th, just ahead of its September launch in Chicago. "Whether you live in Salt Lake City, St. George or Ogden," the company's PR announcement reads, indicating that the service isn't localized to any one major metropolitan area (like with previous rollouts).
