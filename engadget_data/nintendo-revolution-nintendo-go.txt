Supposedly itcould be announced later today byIwata-san at GDC in San Jose, but until one of our faithful readers wants to translate what little text is visiblewe're by no means prepared to comment on the validity of this shot -- if anything, we're inclined to call hoax, sincethey quite often are, particularly with Apple and Nintendo. We do think we know of one person who could probably sortthis one for us though: Qbert, where you at? This looks like your gig, dude.[Thanks, Helmut]Update: Engadget Japan editor Ittousai let us know that there's too little information to tellexactly what's going on here, but the text contains fragments like "the brand (reflects)," "containssystem-level," and "-technology in latest info." Well, at least we know it's not completely fakeJapanese.

Update 2: another(anonymous) user has stepped forward with another mysterious image, which we were told is of a product brochure of theNintendo Go. Is it real? We don't have any more reason to think this is any more authentic than the first image -- butit's got our attention, that's for sure.
