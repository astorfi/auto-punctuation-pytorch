As with some other lucky folks that have gotten their hands on the not-quite-a-DSLR, Bloom seems to be mightily impressed with it, saying that the image out of the camera is "utterly terrific," and that it's "a dream to use operational wise." He also found that the built-in mic was "way better" than the ones found on comparable, or even higher-end, Nikons or Canons (like the 5D Mark II pictured alongside the GH1 above), although it's obviously made even better by the optional top mic. Of course, it's the sample footage really tells the story, and you can find somewhat compressed version after the break, and an even higher quality sample at the link below.
