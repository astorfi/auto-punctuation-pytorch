According to Sony, it's "conducting a technological investigation" as to the possibility of this, but claims there's "no plan for the market launch of this at this time." It makes sense that many titles -- especially ones designed with widely divergent game engines -- would be incompatible with a simple software update, but details are slim on how Sony is adding this function to its own games in the first place, so we'll have to wait to find out more. We do know the PS3 is going 3D in 2010, but as for available titles it looks like we're going to be in the dark for the time being -- though Ubisoft's upcoming Avatar game, along with a couple of Sony racing titles, are already shoe-ins for 3D presentation of some form.
