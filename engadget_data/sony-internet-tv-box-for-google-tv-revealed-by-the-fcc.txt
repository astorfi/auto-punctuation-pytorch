Sure seems to be: the 25 x 33-cm (9.8 x 13-inch) device is called the "Internet TV Box" in the FCC documents, similar wording to Sony's already announced "Sony Internet TV" with integrated Google TV thingamaservice. The Foxconn-built settop box with 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi radios just cleared the FCC en route to an apparent US launch. The when is the big question -- presumably on or around September 1st, the date that Sony's short-term confidentiality request expires -- that's considered Fall right? A few notable document images after the break.
