We're going to have to wait eight long months (at least) for this one to surface, but some details have popped up
about HTC's answer to the Nokia
N91 and the Samsung i300 â€”
a new musicphone called (sorta lamely) the HTC Muse that runs on Windows Mobile 5.0 and has a 4GB of NAND Flash memory
for storing media files, a 240 by 240 pixel display, triband GSM/GPRS/EDGE/UMTS (and possible HSDPA), WiFi, Bluetooth,
an integrated FM tuner, built-in stereo speakers, 64MB of RAM, 64MB of ROM, a microSD memory card slot, a 416MHz
processor, a 2.1 megapixel digital camera with flash, and a second VGA camera on front for video calls. Anyone else
feeling a little out of breath right now? Apart from that disappointingly low-res display, the Muse's specs seem pretty
tight. No word yet on pricing or availability.
