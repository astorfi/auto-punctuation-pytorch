We'll bet you didn't wake up this morning wanting to experience what a particle goes through as it zooms along the massive tunnels of the Large Hadron Collider. Oh, wait -- you did? Well, game development studio Funktronic Labs is waaay ahead of everyone. The firm has already created a trippy first-person virtual reality journey through the LHC, as an homage to the Higgs boson-like particle it found back in 2012. You can interact with the kaleidoscopic world and control your virtual trek by waving your hands (and using pinch-and-pull motions) over a Leap Motion detector, which triggers visual changes on screen. But, if you're lucky enough to have an Oculus Rift at this point in time, you can use one for a more immersive (and very, very trippy -- because this needs to be said more than once) experience. Don't have either? Don't worry: head after the break and watch a preview video to at least get a glimpse of the psychedelic experience.
