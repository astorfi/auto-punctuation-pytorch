Got 120V power in your garage? No problem, you can charge off of that easily -- if you don't mind waiting 20 hours. A Level 2 charger will drop that down to between three and four hours, but it requires some hardware installed in your home. If you want to do that for the Leaf or the Volt you're looking at $2,000 installed, and that installation is permanent.

Ford is making things much easier, and much cheaper, with a $1,499 charger made by Leviton that's not only cheaper than the competition but completely modular. It hangs on the wall and simply plugs into a 240V outlet, handling the necessary electrical wizardry to quick-charge your Focus without burning down your house or singeing your cat. Ford is partnering with Best Buy for installation, which could be a good or bad thing depending on your propensity for Geeks in Squads.
