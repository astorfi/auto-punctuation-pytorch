Following up an attempt earlier this month to create the world's smallest stop motion animation, the company recently (temporarily) erected what's apparently world's biggest cinema screen -- at 1,428 square meters, it just barely edged out the previous record holder that measured 1,338 square meters, although that screen was wider. Of course, the N8 wasn't able to project the Prince of Persia movie all by itself, so Nokia took advantage of the phone's HDMI output to connect four 140-kilogram XLM HD30 projectors -- no doubt another first for a cellphone. Head on past the break for the video.
