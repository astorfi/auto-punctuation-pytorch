There's no word on where it'll be hawked outside of the States, but it looks like T-Mob's Lumia 710 is about to get upstaged. We're told to expect more information here on Monday, and in case you had any questions, Elop was quoted as affirming that no Android plans are in the pipeline. Shocker. As for rumored specifications, there's a 4.3-inch WVGA capacitive touchpanel, half a gig of RAM, Windows Phone 7.5 (Mango) and an 8-megapixel shooter. Keep it locked here for more details as we get 'em.
