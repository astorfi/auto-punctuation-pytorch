More Garminfone than PND, the device features the same 3.5-inch touchscreen, 3 megapixel camera and Garmin UI as its call-friendly counterpart, but without the front buttons, 3G data connection and subsidized price. That means you'll have to hoof it to a hotspot to send email, perform Google Local Search and upload geotagged photos -- all of which this unit can do -- but at least you'll have a dedicated GPS to help you get there. $280, available May 16th, see it in action after the break.
