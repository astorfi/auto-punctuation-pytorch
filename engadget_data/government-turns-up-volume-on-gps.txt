 The US governmentflicked the switch today on a new GPS signal, known as L2C. The signal, according to the government, is transmitted ata higher effective power, allowing it to "work better in urban areas and indoors." The new signal, beingtransmitted by the IIRsatellite launched in September, can also be received using less power, potentially allowing better GPS receptionby smaller devices such as cellphones. However, most current devices may not be able to make use of the new signalswithout upgrades.[Via PhoneScoop]
