IFA and CES will also get the full 3D experience, with the company still planning to put hardware on shelves in 2010. It expects HDMI 1.4 and Blu-ray 3D spec standardization to have the market primed and ready, and while 3D may not be for everyone, we're sure those interested are just waiting to toss those silly two-color glasses in the trash to get with this stereoscopic solution.
