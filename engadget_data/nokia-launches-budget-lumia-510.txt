With the notable exception of the 4-inch (480 x 800) screen, which is a tad larger than its slightly more accomplished Windows Phone sibling, the other specs are very much in line with its low-cost stance: there's a single 5-megapixel shooter at the back (no front-facer), a lowly 800MHz Qualcomm processor, 256MB RAM and 4GB of non-expandable storage. We'll be bringing you further details as the story unfolds. In terms of the OS, it'll ship with WP Mango but we're told it will be upgraded to Windows Phone 7.8 at some point in the future.
