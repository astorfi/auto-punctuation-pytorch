If you're looking to boost the resolution of your workflow, Dell took the opportunity to unleash one such display during the proceedings at SIGGRAPH this week. The UltraSharp 32 is a 32-inch Ultra HD unit that wields a 3,840 x 2,160 IGZO panel sorting 1.07 billion colors. An aluminum stand has replaced the plastic-draped one from previous models, but the same height adjustments reside around back. The UltraSharp 32 also houses both full and mini display ports (with the requisite cable included), HDMI jack, a built-in USB hub and an SD card reader along the left side. We had a chance to take a quick peek at the device and we can confirm the image quality -- especially when it comes to handling rich blacks. We also enjoyed gazing upon a matte finish rather than a glossy surface and we're told Dell has actually made some tweaks there to reduce any grainy results that may creep in. There's no word on pricing just yet, but the display is set to arrive during the fourth quarter of this year. A smattering of images from our brief eyes-on session await in the gallery.
