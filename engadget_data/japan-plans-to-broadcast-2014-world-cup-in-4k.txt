 While NHK's Super Hi-Vision 8K TV is still some distance away from becoming an everyday presence in our living rooms, we may get the next best thing soon. Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications expects to broadcast the 2014 World Cup next July in 4K, using free capacity on its communications satellites rather than the usual delivery methods -- the bandwidth required is reportedly too much for conventional sources. The 4K airing is still coming two years earlier than originally planned, however, and should eventually spread to broadcast satellites and terrestrial networks. The fortunate ones who can tune in to the ultra-sharp futebol will need an exorbitantly-priced 4K TV set to watch, but it's safe to presume that they'll have some of the best viewing parties around.
