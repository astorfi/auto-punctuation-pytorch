 Seventeen-year-old Garyl Tan Jia Luo has the distinct honor of being the first person charged under Singapore's new Computer Misuse Act. The alleged crime? Piggybacking on his neighbor's WiFi connection without permission. This apparently wouldn't have gone so far had the neighbor (we'll call him Mr. Wilson) not lodged a complaint against the teen. While Tan was released on bail after a grilling by police, he's facing some serious consequences for enjoying his free ride, including up to 10,000 Singapore dollars ($6,425) in fines and up to three years in jail. Given Signapore's plans to blanket the entire country in free WiFi, however, you'd think they'd go a little easy on him for jumping the gun.[Via The Register]
