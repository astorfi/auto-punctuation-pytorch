That's Halo's Master Chief venting the console with his trusty assault rifle, sending chunks of circuit board, capacitors and LEDs out the other side. According to its eBay seller, the PAL system's still fully functional, and ships with controller, cables and a full warranty. Auction lasts till April 24th; bidding is presently at $810 AUD.
