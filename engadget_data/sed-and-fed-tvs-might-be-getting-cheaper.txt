       Just because Canon announced it's no longer working on ways to make SED televisions a reality cheaper, doesn't mean no one is. RD&IP recently announced new technology it has developed that could be used to reduce manufacturing costs on both SED and FED TVs. While squeezing old-school CRT technology into every pixel of a flat panel display is a tantalizing ideas, so far it's still too expensive for the mass market. RD&IP's tech claims to cut costs by allowing manufacturers to use cheaper cathodes instead of expensive carbon nanotubes. We'll have to wait to find out if anyone ever actually uses this, but we're sure SED fans are more than used to the waiting.
