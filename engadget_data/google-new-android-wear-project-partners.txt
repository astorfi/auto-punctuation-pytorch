Last week at SXSW, Android and Chrome head Sundar Pichai said we'd be hearing more about Google's foray into wearables in two weeks' time. And it looks like the company's delivering quite early on that promise.


The newly announced Android Wear initiative, which makes a Google-approved SDK available to developers eying the wearable space, will initially focus on smartwatches created by the likes of industry heavyweights like LG, HTC, Motorola, Samsung and Asus. While Qualcomm, Intel, Broadcom, Imagination and Mediatek will also be pitching in on the chip side. Fossil's inclusion in this Android Wear partner mix is the most interesting, and will, from the sound of it, mostly be a fashion play for the nascent wearable category. As for when we'll actually see the fruits of these wearable partnerships, Google's only committing to the very vague "later this year." Which means news on these Android Wear smartwatches could land anytime. But for now, at least, LG's giving us a look at what to expect from the project with its recently unveiled G Watch.
