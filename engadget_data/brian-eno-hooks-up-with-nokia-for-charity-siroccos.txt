Sho' nuff, Roxy Music's own Brian Eno (and creator of the Windows 95 "Start" sound clip -- betcha didn't know that, either) is blessing ten of the high-end Nokia sliders with his engraved signature, which will then be auctioned online with all proceeds going to the Keiskamma Aids Treatment Program and The World Land Trust. Look for the bidding action to kick off January 8 and run until February 12 at nokiacharityauction.com. (And yes, Mr. Eno composed the Sirocco's music, too.)
