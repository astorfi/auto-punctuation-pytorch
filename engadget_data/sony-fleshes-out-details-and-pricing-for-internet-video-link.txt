Providers will include AOL, Yahoo!, Sony Pictures, and Sony BMG music, along with user generated videos and RSS feeds. Now we've got more detail on the IVL box, along with a glimpse at the first sets to support it. Apparently the unit will display its wares in Sony's XMB Xross Media Bar format, as seen on the company's PSP and PS3 consoles. The IVL module will be sold separately for $300 starting in July, and it attaches to the back of a "majority" of Sony's 2007 BRAVIA sets -- currently including the new KDL-46S3000, KDL-40S3000, KDL-32S3000, KDL-26S3000, KDL-46V3000, KDL-40V3000 and KDL-32XBR4 LCDs, and the KDF-37E3000, KDF-50E3000 and KDF-46E3000 micro-displays. Looks like a regular ol' USB plug will do the honors, and the IVL saps power from the TV while sipping internet off of an Ethernet plug, so added cable clutter will be fairly minimal.
