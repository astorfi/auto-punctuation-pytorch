Well these sure are a lot less goofy looking than some
surround sound headphones we've seen. Tritton says these'll give you "true" 5.1 sound, not a simulated effect,
thanks to the eight speakers jammed in next to your ears. And as you can tell from the microphone and totally zoned out
headphone model, they're aiming these mostly at gamers, athough Tritton also says they're perfect for Internet calling
(well, maybe if you want to pretend you're talking to God). Retail price is $74 and it looks like they're Windows
compatible only.
