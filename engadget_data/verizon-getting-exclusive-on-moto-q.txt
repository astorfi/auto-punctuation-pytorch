 We've been hearing for some time now that the Motorola Q would be coming to Verizon and Sprint first, with versions for other carriers out later in the year. Now, it looks like Verizon may have scored a coup, and shut Sprint out of that initial launch. According to a teaser that's now up on Verizon's site, the long-awaited smartphone will be available "exclusively from Verizon Wireless." We don't know how long that exclusive is going to last; we still expect Sprint to roll out a version pretty quickly. In the meantime, though, if you absolutely must get your Q next week, it looks like you now know where to go.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
