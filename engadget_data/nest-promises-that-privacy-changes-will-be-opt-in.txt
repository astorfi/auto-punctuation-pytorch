Google's acquisition of Nest prompted more than a few privacy concerns, legitimate and otherwise -- will you have to share temperature data with advertisers? You won't, as long as CEO Tony Fadell has his way. He told those at the DLD Conference that there aren't any plans to change Nest's current privacy policy, and any changes will be both transparent and opt-in; your smoke alarm won't start posting Google+ updates without permission. It will be a while before we see how well the company lives up to its promise, but it's good to know that Nest's ideal connected home won't be too connected. Check out Fadell's privacy remarks in the video below at about the 12:49 mark.
