For starters (because we know you're rummaging through looking for this very fact right now), critics found that this particular PDP "exhibited the deepest shade of black [they had] seen from any Panasonic plasma, deeper than any display [they had] reviewed except for the Pioneer and the OLED-based Sony XEL-1." As for color accuracy, it did seem to lag behind other rivals, but its anti-reflective screen was noticeably better than most. Overall, the panel managed to impress -- but not floor -- the eagle-eyed reviewers that were watching intently, but if you've been toying with the idea of ordering this very unit for your own living room, why not give the linked review a read through before pulling one trigger or the other?
