After all, the idea of tethered35-foot rotors, floating 35,000 feet in the air and drawing endless power from the jetstream at a cost of less than 2cents per kWh seems pretty far-fetched. But as winter drags on and we take another glance at our heating bills, we'rerooting for Sky WindPower Corp. and its dream of Floating Electric Generators. Here's hoping they aren't just tiltingat windmills. [Via BoingBoing]
