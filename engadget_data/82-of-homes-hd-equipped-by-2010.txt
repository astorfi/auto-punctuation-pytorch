 But
where is my flying car is the question Kagan Research needs to be
answering. That notwithstanding, they've crunched the numbers, pored
over the data, called the Psychic Network and come up with a few
figures about where high definition TV adoption is going in the next
few years. HDTV penetration stood at 10% at the end of 2004 and will increase to 17.5% by the end of 200586% of homes had access to HDTV via cable by the end of 20043.8 million est. cable HDTV subscribers by the end of 2005, increasing to 30 million by 2010
Other
than that that, the report apparently also breaks down the sticky
subjects of how much bandwidth your cable/satellite/OTA provider is
really using and how new compression techniques will affect that,
whether 1080p is justified or not and more. Anyone got a spare $1545.00
so we can buy a copy?
