After 14 years of partnership, Verizon now has full control over its cellphone business. The telecom giant has officially completed its buyout of Vodafone's 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless, giving it both more independence and leaner operations. The American provider isn't saying just what it will do now that the $130 billion deal is done, but it at least doesn't have to worry about the tensions that sometimes defined its relationship with Vodafone. It's business as usual if you're a subscriber, although we wouldn't rule out changes in the long run.
