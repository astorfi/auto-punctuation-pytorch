Watch as Veronica and I make total fools of ourselves playing Wii Sports (Bowling, Tennis, Baseball, Boxing, Golf); we generally tried to stay out of the way of the camera, but weren't always successful. Also, we've got the first ten or so minutes of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess on tape. It's a pretty slow moving start, so only Zelda fans need apply.
