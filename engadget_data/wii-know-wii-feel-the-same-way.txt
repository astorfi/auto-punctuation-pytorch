Sure, we get that whole community-ish thing they're goingfor, and we're happy for our friend, the letter "i," which has had quite a few successes in the consumerelectronics industry, including a slew of popular Apple products and a double role in Intel's Viiv platform, but we'rejust not feeling "Wii." Turns out we're not the only ones, and between the comments on our Wii post earlier, Joystiq's informal poll, and theinsightful commentary of our editorial staff...Ryan: "Eh, I thought the iPod was a pretty stupid nametoo. We'll just have to wait and see."Evan: "Just let me know when I can emulate the console on myphone."Marc: "Why?"Paul: "What do you want? Leave me alone! Can't you see I'm talkingto Zelda right now?"Ross: "Sometimes, even hardcore gamers need to stop and take a Wii."...it's not looking like a home run for Nintendo marketing. Of course, the DS didn't get a lot of love at first, and in that case Nintendo clearlydemonstrated that it's all about what you do with it. But with proponents of the console already facing an uphill battlein evangelizing the strange control scheme, Nintendo sure isn't helping out much.Read - Game Informer interviews N's MattAtwoodRead - Joystiq's WiipollRead - Joystiq's firstimpressionsRead - RevolutionFanboyRead - Go NintendoRead - GameSpotRead - IGNRead - 1UPRead -Straight from the horse's mouth
