They've dabbled in e-ink and the like, but this time they're powering a good old fashioned pocket calculator LCD with a pocket calculator solar panel. The good news about this is that the proven tech should allow them to get these 128MB to 1GB drives out the door before long, the bad news is that it looks pretty lame, and you can't tell all your friends that you own an e-ink display. Not to worry, Adata was showing one of those as well, along with a USB key with a retractable headset for all your VoIP needs.[Via The Raw Feed]
