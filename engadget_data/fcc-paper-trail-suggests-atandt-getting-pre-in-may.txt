The company's Pre with North American 3G -- model number P100UNA -- is already in use by Telcel in Mexico, but confidentiality in its US FCC filing doesn't expire until mid-May. Why does that matter? Historically, Palm's US releases have come very close to their FCC confidentiality lifts, meaning that we could see this thing on AT&T by the time Summer rolls around. Of course, in light of the Pre Plus, it'd be pretty sweet if AT&T just moved on to the next big thing in Palm's pipeline, but we certainly wouldn't put it past 'em to launch outdated equipment.
