On mobile devices, Photoshop Express is one of Adobe's most crowd-pleasing applications. Now, to make things better for Android users, the software maker has released a completely revamped version of its handy app. Aside from being friendly with the latest flavor of Android, KitKat, the Photoshop Express app's been tweaked to access/process images from an SD card in much faster fashion. Adobe states that the goal of this update was to bring the most popular features front and center, including things like Looks, Corrections, cropping, red eye reduction and a bunch of other useful tools. There's also the debut on Android of Adobe's new engine for rendering photos (which the company says is great for handling large files), as well as integration with its own photo service, Revel. And hey, above all, it still won't cost you a dime to download it to your device.
