The 64MB cards will drop from $39 to $29 MSRP, which is kind of funny considering how much more memory you get for buying in bulk. Especially good for those wanting to wait it out for that 80-to-120-some-odd-GB drive that's due any month now. Oh yeah, and Live Arcade games had their download cap lifted to 150MB, so no longer will you be stuck playing games no larger than 50MB.
