 Remember the LG Optimus G? Then the Optimus G Pro, headed exclusively Japan? Well how about another iteration? Apparently bound for the Korean homelands, this one's still called the Optimus G Pro, but expands to a 5.5-inch 1080p display, as well as getting a battery bump-up to 3,140mAh. According to the leaked spec sheet sent to Phone Arena, this will join a 1.7GHz Snapdragon processor, alongside a healthy 2GB of RAM and a whopping 32GB of storage -- plus microSD expansion. Is LG readying something similar for its global fans? We'll give them a few more weeks to fill us in.
