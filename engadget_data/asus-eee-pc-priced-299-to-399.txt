  Yeah, we hear your moans and feel your pain: $299 for an Eee PC with 2GB SSD, 256MB RAM, Linux (presumably), and no camera. It's certainly not our (admittedly too-hopeful) expectation following the June announcement. If you're still with us, the fully-spec'd 8GB model with 1GB of memory, camera, and 3.5-hour battery will sell for $399 when Best Buy and NewEgg receive their stock at the end of the month. Well, there's always Eee PC version 2.
