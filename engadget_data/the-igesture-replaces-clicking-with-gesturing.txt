It's definitely not for everyone (and at $130, you'd better really want it), but we can't help but be intrigued by
the iGesture Pad from FingerWorks. Unlike a conventional mouse, trackball or touchpad, the iGesture relies on "finger
gestures," an approach the company claims is more ergonomic than clicks and drags. While the method seems less than
intuitive, the company provides animated examples of common gestures on their site, and many do seem fairly
straightforward (though tapping with three fingers to represent a double-click just seems wrong). And for fans
of mouse gesture plug-ins for programs like the Firefox browser, the iGesture could be a natural extension. We just
wish FingerWorks would consider calling the movements something other than "finger gestures." For us at least (we're
from New York, remember), that phrase conjures up some very specific images, and they ain't the ones FingerWorks would
like us to see.
