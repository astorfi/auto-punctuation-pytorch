Even more enthralling is confirmation of our wildest dreams: there will be two custom guitars available for purchase on top of the Special Edition bundle (the game itself, HÃ¶fner bass and Ludwig drums microphone and mike stand). The guitars -- a Gretsch Duo-Jet and a Rickenbacker 325 -- will retail for $99.00 each when the game arrives on September 9th. Until then, may we suggest you use the video after the break to work on your harmonies.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
