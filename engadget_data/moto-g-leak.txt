Motorola may have already spoiled the Moto G launch, but it didn't reveal everything. GSMArena has posted a leaked Phones4U promo card that gives a better impression of the Moto X's budget sibling. The Moto G will reportedly be just a bit smaller, at 4.5 inches, and there's no mention of hands-free voice commands or other Moto X party tricks. The Android 4.3 device would likewise step down to a slower (if quad-core) 1.2GHz Snapdragon processor, a 5-megapixel camera and 8GB storage. However, it would be exceptionally cheap -- at Â£135 ($215) off-contract, the Moto G could be a champ among entry level devices. The promo card's holiday theme suggests that the starter handset could be available in the UK before the end of the year, although we wouldn't plan our gift shopping around the leak. There's also no word of a corresponding US release, so Americans wanting a Moto G may simply have to be patient.
