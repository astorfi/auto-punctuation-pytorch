Dengeki Online (courtesy Siliconera translation) reports that the two games have already attracted over a million pre-orders in the island nation alone.

For those keeping score at home, that puts Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire - remakes of the 2003 GameBoy Advance hits Pokemon Ruby and Pokemon Sapphire - on a pace to beat the pre-order tallies for 2013's Pokemon X and Y. Both of those games sold like gangbusters even months after they first debuted, and Nintendo should be pleased with the hype its latest Pokegames are generating.
