 At first glance this week looks pretty decent, but when you take a second look you'll notice the biggest release of the week is MIA. We'd hoped that Paramount would be ready to release Blu-ray titles in time for There Will be Blood, we now know we'll have to go without -- guess Paramount will just have to wait to get our money. Sony's leading the way this week with four releases though, two of which include BD Live content as well as TrueHD sound. Something also interesting to note is that the super hot, I Am Legend hits HD DVD this week, so we'll be interested to see how well it sells on next week's VideoScan numbers now that some retailers have eliminated its HD DVD shelf space.
