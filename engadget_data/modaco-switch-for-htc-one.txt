Not sure if you want the regular HTC One or its Google Play Edition? MoDaCo's newly detailed MoDaCo.Switch ROM should let you have both. The custom firmware lets the indecisive run either the Sense interface or stock Android (AOSP) using only one set of data. It's not an ideal experience, even considering the usual risks of unofficial code: users have to reboot to change interfaces, and two ROMs in one will chew up additional storage. However, Switch could still give One fans the best of both worlds when it launches. MoDaCo tells us that a public beta could arrive early next week.
