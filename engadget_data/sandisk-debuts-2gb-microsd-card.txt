       Now that you've picked up that sexy little bit of Chocolate from Verizon, you're probably looking for a hefty storage option to load up all some of your tunes, and luckily SanDisk has got you covered with its new 2GB microSD card. First to market with a two gig flavor of this type of card, SanDisk has given VZW a 60-day exclusive for selling it in the US, while the rest of the world should be able pick it up at any number of locations. Available immediately, this card -- with its 1,000 VCAST song capacity -- will set you back an even $100, and probably less if you can find one of the OEM versions that SanDisk also announced.[Via Aximsite]
