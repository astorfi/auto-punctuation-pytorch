It's been a while since a USB toy excited us as much as these compressed-air darts — available through Marks &
Spencer, of all places, for a mere £19.50 ($33.43). The USB-powered darts come in a set of
three, are, uh, Mac and PC-compatible, and can be controlled via a mouse. We're already making plans to figure out how
to control a set over VNC so we can deploy these against the dude in the next cube while we're a safe distance away.
He'll never know what hit him.
