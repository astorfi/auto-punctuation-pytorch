It's provided Wired with a complete teardown of its own that breaks the Made in the U.S.A. device down piece-by-piece with attention to every little detail. Hit the source link below for a closer look at what's inside the orb.

 Update: There's no pictures to be found, but the Q has now coincidentally just hit the FCC. Those curious can peruse the listing here.
