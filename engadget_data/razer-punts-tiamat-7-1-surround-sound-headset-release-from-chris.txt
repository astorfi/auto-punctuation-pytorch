Originally expected in Q4, its new release date is sometime in January. To recap, $180 will get you an unusual five drivers in each ear, including three dedicated left and right ones, along with a subwoofer and "center" channel on each side. There's the obligatory mic, along with an inline control that lets you adjust volume levels for each channel. So, will the extra drivers make much of a difference during your next Modern Warfare 3 firefight? Let us know.
