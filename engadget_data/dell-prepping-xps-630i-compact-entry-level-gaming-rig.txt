Although no specs or images have been posted yet, Dell's teaser release calls this new model a "middleweight contender with heavyweight power," promising that while it's "more compact than the powerhouse XPS 720 family, it won't compromise on performance." Expect the XPS 630i to be announced this spring, along with the requisite pricing and configuration deets.
