Then it looks like your buying decision just got a tad tougher, with another round of official and not quite official announcements affecting four more models among the company's many offerings. Those include the dv6 (pictured above), which is now available with lower-cost Intel Pentium Dual-Core T4200 or Core 2 Duo T6400 processors and ATI Mobility Radeon HD4530 or HD4650 graphics, and the considerably higher-end HDX 16, which gets a boost in the graphics department courtesy of NVIDIA's GeForce GT 130M GPU with 1GB of on-board RAM. What's more, while HP isn't saying anything about it just yet, Notebook Italia seems pretty sure that the 18.4-inch HDX 18 will also be getting a similar graphics upgrade in the coming days. Lastly, it seems that the 17-inch Pavilion dv7 laptop has also seen a mild update in the form of the dv7-2000, which now packs ATI's latest Mobility Radeon HD4000 series graphics, and a Core 2 Quad Q9000 processor on the top-end configuration.Read - Notebook Italia, HP Pavilion dv6, HDX 16, HDX 18Read - Notebook Italia, HP Pavilion dv7
