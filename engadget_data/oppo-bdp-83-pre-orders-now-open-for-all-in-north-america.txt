Our tipster Mike gave us the heads up that those not on the initial list can now go ahead and lay down $499 to pre-order one of the universal players, expected to ship sometime between July 1 - 3. All you have to do is check out our hands on or the comments from some previous owners to see why this fast loading, SACD & DVD-Audio playing box is so highly regarded already.[Thanks, Mike]
