Since the file was hosted and available on Apple's servers around the time it was expected for release, it seemed safe to assume that it was legit -- and indeed, it (for the most part) works fine and plays well with the newly-live App Store. But a few of us here have had persistent problems on our first-gen iPhones: interface lag, crashing apps, hard resets, you name it. On top of that, we're hearing whispers that the .ipsw in question was meant only for 3G phones and not first-gen units -- and bizarrely, the build number of what we've got is 5A347, while our launch iPhone 3G is running build 5A345 on them. So until Apple stops being, well, Apple, and clears this all up, we're putting it to you: how are things going? Any problems, or smooth sailing? Happy you took the early plunge? Let us know in comments!
