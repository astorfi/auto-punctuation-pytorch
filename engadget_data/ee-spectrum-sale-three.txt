It follows Ofcom's controversial decision to let the latter network queue-jump to offer LTE services in the UK before the official auction process begins. Three won't be able to use its new toy until its frenemy has vacated it, which could be as late as September next year, but could start preparing 4G internet shortly after. The sale was made due to merger requirements by the European Commission, but still needs approval from Ofcom, but given that it's already handed the company an unassailable head-start, we hardly think it'll be too concerned by the deal.
