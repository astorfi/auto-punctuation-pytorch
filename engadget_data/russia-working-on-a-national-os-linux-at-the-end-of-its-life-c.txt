And then Microsoft went ahead and gave a unilateral software license to all the NGOs and media outlets in the country? And then Putin wrestled an alligator? Well, it seems like the software giant and the land of Dostoevsky and Rasputin have been at cross-purposes for quite a while now. Indeed, Glynn Moody's Open... blog has been tracking the country's progress in developing its own Linux-based Open Source OS (similar to efforts by Cuba and North Korea) for some time, although as of yet it doesn't look like there has been much success. At any rate, Microsoft Russia president Nikolai Pryanishnikov doesn't seem to be threatened by the prospect: "We must bear in mind that Linux is not a Russian OS," he is quoted as saying in an article at cnews.ru. "And, moreover, [Linux] is at the end of its life cycle." Oh, really? Please don't tell Tux just yet... the news would break his heart.
