You now have an easy way to follow your favorite Twitch game streamers on a big screen without splurging on a console or Fire TV. The live video service has just launched a channel for Roku players, helping you keep up with tournaments and "let's play" sessions on a cheap and cheerful media hub. The interface will seem familiar if you've used Twitch's other apps, but that's not exactly a major gripe. Give it a spin today if you'd rather watch a DOTA 2 match than Don Draper.
