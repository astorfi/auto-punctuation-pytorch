Well now the R2H gets officially doubly real-deal official, given that DigiTimes reports that it's hit the streets for over $1,000. To recap, this little guy has a 7-inch screen, GPS, Bluetooth 2.0+ EDR, 802.11a/b/g, fingerprint reader, a 900MHz Celeron M ULV, and can store up to 60GB worth of whatever it is that you so badly need to carry around with you. We're not going to lie, we can definitely say that as usual, Asus delivered one of the single best designs in this form factor we've yet seen.[Via TG Daily]
