If you've already had enough lamenting over Pioneer exodus from the plasma industry, then you might want to skip this episode completely -- or check out or ACC version so you can easily skip the boring parts. But we'll warn you, you'll be missing some good stuff as ol' friend Ryan Block joins us to clear up once and for all what his predictions for the future of plasma are, and how they differ from ours. But Ryan doesn't just join us for one or two segments, but for the whole show and while it still isn't the old Engadget podcast of yesterday, we had a good time chatting up new Blu-ray hardware, the origins of our love for Media Center, Hollywood and piracy and lastly the apparent death of S-Video.
