During the past day, we've seen the company's M15x, M17x and OptX AW2310 hit the shipping stage, the latter of which is the firm's first-ever 3D monitor. Checking in at 23-inches and boasting a full 1080p panel, this one also packs a 3 millisecond response time, 120Hz refresh rate and stereoscopic support when NVIDIA's GeForce 3D Vision Kit is utilized. It's up for order right now at $469, but if you follow that Logicbuy link down there, you'll be able to snag it (for a limited time) for $449.10. Too bad that 3D kit will set you back another $200, but hey, no one said that witnessing the third dimension was cheap. Or remotely interesting. But mostly cheap.
