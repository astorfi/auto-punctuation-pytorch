Available in your choice of three different colors, the Aviators sport a foldable design and an "optics-inspired" polycarbonate speaker housing, along with a pair of 40mm full-range mylar drivers with neodymium magnets, and a tangle-free nylon cable complete with an in-line mic and controls. Still no word on a price just yet, but Skullcandy says the headphones will be available sometime in June. Oh, and envy had absolutely nothing to do with the creation of these.
