Google Hangouts just jumped a full version number on Apple hardware -- the first major update since it added voice calls late last year -- and 2.0 has more than just a new iOS 7-ready look. The new app is "fully optimized" for iPads, with a "two-pane" conversation view. On all devices, it's ready for animated stickers -- look out Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger -- 10-second video messages for when your friends are offline, and can send a map of your current location with a few button presses. It's rolling out on the App Store now, assuming you prefer the matchup of Google services and Apple devices.
