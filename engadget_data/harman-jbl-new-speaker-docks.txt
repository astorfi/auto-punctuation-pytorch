 Harman announced a fair amount of JBL-branded speakers back at IFA, but that wasn't all it had to announce before the year goes out. Today we met with in the company in NYC, where it was ready to show off even more of its upcoming wireless and dock speakers. In fact, don't tell Harman that the 30-pin connector is on its way out, as its $199 OnBeat Venue (seen above and $139 OnBeat aWake are ready to pair up with your last-gen iOS devices. The Venue is rated for a peak output of 30-watts and features a stow-away dock a tweeter and woofer combo for both stereo channels, component outputs for use with TVs, an obligatory 3.5mm jack and Bluetooth if you'd prefer to go wireless. The aWake shrinks things down to about 13 watts, and features a digital clock so that you can use it on your bedside night stand -- despite its small size, it'll easily dock an iPad. Both systems also work with free JBL apps for iOS that'll enhance the experience. According to the company, it's also working on solutions for the Lightning connector, but wouldn't reveal any hard details.
