Like its recently unveiled siblings, the Zenbook UX32VD still packs a 1920 x 1080 IPS panel and "the latest Intel Core processor" -- likely something from the Ivy Bridge family, although ASUS is keeping schtum on the details for now. Graphical horsepower is delegated to NVIDIA's GT620, while the UX32VD also had a hybrid HDD on show at the event, not the standard SSD -- explaining why this new model is slightly thicker than the UX31A. Alongside a lack of processor specifics, there was no info on prices or release dates at the Taiwan press event but for now, Engadget Chinese have posted their full impressions at the source below. Ultrabook and graphics mavens can hit up the Google translation for a few more details.
