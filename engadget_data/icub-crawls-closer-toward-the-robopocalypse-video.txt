The cute (in a Demon Seed sorta way) robot is designed to replicate the trial-and-error learning process of a three year-old. We've already seen it learning how to speak and shoot arrows, and now it wants to show off it's... erm, recently improved crawling abilities. Head down after the break and you can see it slowly navigating the dangerous carpets of the convention floor. That's iCub, SkyNET drones, Cyborg Rats and Robotic Bulls all in the last month. Does anyone else think the Robopocalpyse will hit before Christmas?
