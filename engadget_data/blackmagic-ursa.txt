Consumers may not be familiar with Blackmagic Design, but the firm's cameras are all the rage with filmmakers at NAB, drawing enormous crowds within seconds of the show floor opening up to attendees. This year's flagship is the URSA, a relatively massive 4K camera with an enormous 10-inch 1080p flip-out display. There are also two 5-inch monitors on each side, displaying everything from camera settings to a duplicate preview. Another highlight is the Super 35 image sensor (the same used in Blackmagic's existing 4K cam), which is upgradeable should you wish to swap in a refreshed version down the line. You also get plenty of SDI inputs and outputs, XLR mic jacks and either a Canon EF or PL lens mount.





We spent a few minutes shooting with the EF version with a Canon 85mm f/1.2 lens. The preview looked fantastic -- with such a large, high-res display, it's easy to confirm focus without enlarging, though you'll want to take extra care when capturing in 4K. There's definitely no shortage of readouts, with the secondary LCDs providing all the necessary info. The EF version will retail for $6,000, while the PL flavor is set to ship for $6,500 (though you can swap lens mounts later on if you upgrade the sensor module). Both models are expected in stores this June or July. Check 'em out in our hands-on video.
