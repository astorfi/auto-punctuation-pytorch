       In an attempt to obtain "virtually unlimited" HD capacity, Time Warner Cable will deploy Switched Digital Video to 50% of their markets before the end of 2007. While it is great news that TWC will have the bandwidth to provide as many HD channels as they can get carriage deals, every TiVo Series3 fan will have to live with the fact that these channels will be inaccessible by the best DVR available. It doesn't make sense for any provider to switch all their channels to SDV, but it is likely that a new HD channel you'd otherwise love to watch won't be available. The good news is that you probably won't lose any programming, but rather just be unable to enjoy new HD channels. Sure, if CableCARD 2.0 ever makes it and everyone upgrades their Series3, this will be a non-issue, but at the rate CableLabs moves we have little faith this will happen in the next five years -- if ever.
