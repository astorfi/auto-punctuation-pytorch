 
We knew they were coming, now Canon's VIXIA family of HD camcorders is official. All the new VIXIA cams feature a Genuine Canon HD Video Lens, HD CMOS image sensor for Full HD 1920 x 1080 image capture, DIGIC DV II Impage Processor, Instant AutoFocus, and SuperRange Optical Image Stabilization. The HF10 (pictured above) main claim to fame is Dual Flash Memory -- it records to both 16GB of internal flash and removables SDHC cards. It features a 12x HD Video Lens, 3.3 Megapixel Full HD CMOS Image Sensor, 2.7-inch LCD, microphone terminal, 24p Cinema Mode, and 30p Progressive Mode once limited to pro-level camcorders for fast action events sporting events and the like. The HF100 model is pretty much the HF10 without the on-board flash. The HF10 dual flash and HF100 flash models should rollout in April for $1,099 and $899, respectively. A $999 HV30 model brings all the VIXIA goodness to MiniDV cassettes.
