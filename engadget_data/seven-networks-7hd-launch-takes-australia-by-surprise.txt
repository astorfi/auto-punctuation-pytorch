 Australia's Seven Network took its competitors and its customers by surprise yesterday when it officially launched its HDTV channel, six weeks ahead of the original December launch date. 7HD's plan is to "blitz" its competitors, according to executive David Leckie, and it seems to have worked, with Channels Ten and Nine still waiting 'til December to go ahead with HD broadcasts. No word yet if they have resolved the 1080i compression problems noted during testing in July, but some forum posters are complaining that the advertised 5.1 surround sound is still just regular stereo.
