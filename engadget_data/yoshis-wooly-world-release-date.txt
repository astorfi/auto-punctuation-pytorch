Yoshi's Wooly World races to the Wii U in the fall, Nintendo announced during its live-streamed presentation today. A set of amiibo figures made out of yarn will launch with the game, even though that level of cuteness shouldn't be legal. Yoshi's Wooly World is an adventure game with a two-player co-op mode and an emphasis on exploration and using adorable, yarn-based abilities. It comes from the team behind Kirby's Epic Yarn, another fluffy Nintendo platformer. Nintendo revealed Yoshi's Wooly World in January 2013 -- so we hope no one has been holding their breath.
