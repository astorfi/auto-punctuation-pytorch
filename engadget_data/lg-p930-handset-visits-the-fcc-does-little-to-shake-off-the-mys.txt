We still don't know that much about the Android-packing device, but at least it's now real enough to have earned FCC approval. There are a couple of interesting tidbits revealed in the documentation here, however -- first and foremost is the fact that it's referred to as an "LTE phone." Also on-board is Bluetooth and WLAN, 802.11n and WCDMA band V. As you can see from the above drawing, LG and the FCC aren't really giving us much to work with on the image front.
