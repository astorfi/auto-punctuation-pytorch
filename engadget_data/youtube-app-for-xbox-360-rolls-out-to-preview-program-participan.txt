Beta participants should be now able to download the app from the console's new Apps Marketplace, and find all the usual personalized features you'd expect from YouTube, plus the Kinect controls you'd expect from an Xbox app. Still no word about a roll-out to everyone else, nor is there any word on a firm release date for all those other new video services slated to hit the console (they're still just promised for "later in December").
