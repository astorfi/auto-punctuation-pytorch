 In addition to outing two new all-in-ones today, Lenovo is introducing the Erazer X700 gaming desktop. This $1,499-and-up setup is for big spenders, with dual graphics support -- up to two NVIDIA GeForce GTX660 chips or ATI CrossFireX, or up to dual AMD Radeon HD 8950 graphics -- and Onekey overclocking to increase processor speed by just clicking a button. The highest-end configuration will ship with a Core i7 Extreme processor, and users can add up to 4TB of storage thanks to hot-swap external drive bays. Of course, there's also an optical drive, and gamers can connect up to six monitors at once thanks to AMD Eyefinity technology. Finally, let's say a word or two about the design: the diamond-cut shape and blue accents look pretty dang sweet, if you ask us. Look for the X700 to drop in June.
