Reportedly, a new Landmark Theater in Greenwood Village will boast six-screens (one of which utilizes a 4K projector), stadium seats upholstered in leatherette and the ability to pay more for VIP love seat-sized couches and food delivery. If you couldn't guess, Landmark Theaters is hoping to attract the upscale movie viewer, but ticket prices are said to be between $9 and $12 including free popcorn / sodas, which doesn't sound too bad compared to some alternatives.
