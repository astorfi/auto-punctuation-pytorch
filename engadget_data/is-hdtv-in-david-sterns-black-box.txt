A mysterious black box is on NBA.com, accompanied by the cryptic message that when David Stern unveils its contents it will "change the way you see the game". A big and unusual promise. Of course, we hope it contains high-def skycams for every NBA arena, or maybe a Bill Walton verbal restraint device. We certainly hope something 720p or 1080i is coming this way, but unfortunately we will have to wait. June 28th 11:30 a.m. all will be revealed (and likely be wildly underwhelming, but we're still excited).
