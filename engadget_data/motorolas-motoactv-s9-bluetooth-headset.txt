 
Introduced at Ed Zander's CES keynote, Moto is positioning the A2DP-compliant MOTOACTV S9 as a shout out to the athletes (and fitness freaks, and... uh, pretty much anyone that works out once in a while) by making it fairly robust -- by wireless headset standards, anyway -- while phone controls and a mic will let you take that critical call without getting off the Stairmaster. The inner part of the device seems to be available in black or red, though the outside (that is, the only part others will see) will only come in black when it rolls deep later this half.
