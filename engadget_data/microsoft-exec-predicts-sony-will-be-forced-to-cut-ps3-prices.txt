 After a couple weeks in which the 360 posted better sales numbers than the PS3 and it was revealed that Sony inadvertently funded Microsoft's next-gen development efforts, you'd think Microsoft execs would be getting a little cocky, but it sounds instead like they're expecting a renewed offensive from Sony based on price. That's direct from the 360's director of product management Aaron Greenberg, who told Edge that MS "absolutely expects" a PS3 price cut in the next few months, and that the team is "frankly surprised it's taken this long." Of course, we've been hearing tons of PS3 pricing speculation from all corners lately with no change to that $399 MSRP, so we'll see how it goes.[Via Xbox 360 Fanboy]
