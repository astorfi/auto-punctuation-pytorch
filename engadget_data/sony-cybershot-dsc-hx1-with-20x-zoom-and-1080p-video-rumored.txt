       The rumor mill seems to be coalescing around a new CyberShot DSC-HX1 camera from Sony in the run-up to the big PMA camera show next week. In fact, on-line camera shops are already adding placeholders for Sony's new flagship, super-zoom with 1080p video and HQ sound. If true, we're just days away from seeing the official launch of a 9 megapixel (CMOS) camera with 20x zoom, 2.7-inch (possibly 3.0-inch like the DSC-H50) LCD, optical SteadyShot with anti-motion blur, and a 10fps burst rate at unspecified resolution. Rumor also has it priced at Â£400 which directly translates to $571 -- though it'll likely be priced between $400 and $500 (pre-tax) Stateside as these things generally go.
