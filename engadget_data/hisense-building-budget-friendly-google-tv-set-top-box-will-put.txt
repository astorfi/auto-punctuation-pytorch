 Looks like consumers are about to get another option in their search for an affordable connected TV solution: Hisense is building its own Google TV set-top box. The product doesn't have a price -- let alone a name -- but will sell for under $100 when it hits shelves later this year. "Hisense adds even more innovation to the growing list of Google TV-powered devices available around the world." Says Google TV partner manager Mickey Kim. "We're working closely with partners like Hisense to bring services from Google and multiple other providers to your TV with an experience tailored for the living room." Details are scarce, but the outfit promises to reveal more at IFA next week. Can't wait? Check out Vizio's Co-Star.
