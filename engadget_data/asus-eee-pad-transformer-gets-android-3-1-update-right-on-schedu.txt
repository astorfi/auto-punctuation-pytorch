We first caught wind of the Android upgrade at Google IO less than a month ago, and just one week later ASUS was boasting of a June rollout on its Italian Facebook page. If you need a quick reminder, 3.1 brings resizable widgets, support for a slew of USB devices, and new Movie and Books apps. Now isn't that refreshing?
