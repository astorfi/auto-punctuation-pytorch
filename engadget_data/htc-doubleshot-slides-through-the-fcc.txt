But, before consumers can turn in that paper they've been stackin' for one, the handset has to make it by The Man. Well, the FCC just cleared an HTC phone with a QWERTY keypad and a 1700MHz radio inside, and there's a good chance it just so happens to be that Sensed-up, dual-core Gingerbread slider we've been waiting for. Sadly, regulators don't have any teardown pics for you to ogle but, hey, we've got an FCC tag -- that's gotta count for something... right?
