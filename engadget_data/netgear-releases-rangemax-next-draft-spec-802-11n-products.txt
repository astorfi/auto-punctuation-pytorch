But that's not stopping Netgear fromreleasing a new line of RangeMax Next wireless products, which tout 300Mbps speeds and HD video streaming power. TheWNR854T router supports gigabit Ethernet, while both the router and WN511T use MIMO (multi-in, multi-out) to reachthose 802.11n speeds. It seems we've waited so long for 802.11n products that it has lost a lot of its appeal, butwe're sure Netgear will find a way to keep busy.
