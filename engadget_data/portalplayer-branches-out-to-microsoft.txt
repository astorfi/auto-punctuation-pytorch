Apparently they've gotchips on the way to power those Vista-enabled external / auxiliarylaptop displays (aka "personalmedia displays") we've all been so stoked about, which are basically small, independent embedded systems, nottoo different from an iPod, we'd imagine. Careful now though, PortalPlayer, you don't want to go pissing off Stevie J.-- it's his checkbook that's putting most of the food on your table.
