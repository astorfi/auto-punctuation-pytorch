Right on time, AT&T has launched its 300 Mbps GigaPower internet service in Austin. The fast U-Verse tier is available now to residents in "eligible" neighborhoods, while others can vote fiberhood-style for a deployment in their area. A free upgrade to 1 Gbps is still due sometime in 2014. Just don't expect a traditional approach to pricing. To get GigaPower service at a Google Fiber-rivaling $70 per month, you'll have to let AT&T target its web ads based on your browsing and search histories; Austinites uncomfortable with such tracking will have to shell out $99 per month for otherwise identical speeds. We imagine that some won't like the ad-subsidized business model, but it may be a small price to pay for locals who aren't willing to wait for Google's take on high-speed fiber.
