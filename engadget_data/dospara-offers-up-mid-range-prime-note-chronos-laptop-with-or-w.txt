Hot on the heels of its 13-inch NW2 and 15.4-inch Prime Note Chronos NR2, the forthcoming (and yet-to-be-named) successor sports a typical black / silver enclosure and gives you the choice of having an operating system pre-installed or not. Beneath the hood lies a 1.66GHz Intel T5500 Core 2 Duo processor, 1GB of DDR2 RAM, a 100GB SATA hard drive, NVIDIA GeForce Go 7600 256MB graphics card, dual-layer DVD burner, built-in 802.11a/b/g, and a 4-in-1 flash card reader. Additionally, the unit boasts a WSXGA+ widescreen LCD and a bevy of ports including PCMCIA, 4-pin FireWire, VGA / S-Video output, Ethernet, 56k modem, audio in / out, and four USB 2.0 ports to boot. The 6.4-pound machine will reportedly only last "three hours" on a single charge, but it's not like we expected a gaming-centric laptop to carry you through the workday anyway. Nevertheless, the impending Chronos should be available soon for around â‚¬1,000 ($1,282).
