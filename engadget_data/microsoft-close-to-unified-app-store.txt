Microsoft is apparently far closer to bringing together its disparate stores than many thought. The company has reportedly already demoed a single app portal for both Windows and Windows Phone behind closed doors at its annual company meeting in Seattle, according to ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley. One of her sources tells her that the new unified store will likely launch alongside the next iteration of Windows, version 8.1, although other sources were less certain on this. In any case, the gossip tallies with comments by Microsoft's Terry Myerson last week, who said that he sees the unification of Microsoft's platforms and APIs as a priority.
