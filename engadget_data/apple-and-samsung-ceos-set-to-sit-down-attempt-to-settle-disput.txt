Thankfully, they'll be getting the chance to do exactly that (with lawyers in tow, naturally) at some point over the next 90 days, according to FOSS Patents. Both sides are apparently "willing to participate" in a sit down overseen by a magistrate judge. Clearly a ruling of hugging it out is needed in this case.

 Update: Here's Samsung's official reply on the matter: "At the direction of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Samsung and Apple have agreed to participate in a Magistrate Judge Settlement Conference. This settlement conference will take place within 90 days, with the presence of each party's chief executive officer and general counsel."
