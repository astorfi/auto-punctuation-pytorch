Wealready saw most of these on show at CeBIT including the 8-cell power bank (for about 10-hours op), USB keyboard,organizer bag, optical disc drive (a DVD-CDRW combo), car cradle, and variety of cases and sleeves. Thanks Expansys,now how about some prices on these and those optional GPS and DMB modules while you're at it so we can see just how farthat already steep Â£799.95 (about $1,400) price tag is gonna tick.[Thanks, Todd]
