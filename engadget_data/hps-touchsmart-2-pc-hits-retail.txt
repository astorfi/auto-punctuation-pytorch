 
Face it, the whole point of buying a touchscreen anything is, um, touching the thing, so it's usually nice to get a bit of touching in before the sale, just to make certain sure it's throwing off the right touching vibes. Touching. Well, HP's TouchSmart 2, which started shipping late last month from HP's online store, is now ready to get smudged up at a retail store near you, and will be available in $1,299 (IQ504) and $1,499 (IQ506) editions, the latter of which sports a TV-tuner.
