BMW's created a new concept version of its i3 electric vehicle, which dedicates the rear half of the car to housing a pair of BMW's fold-up cycles. When docked inside the vehicle, the bikes can be recharged, although the car maker hasn't released specifics on how many charges the electric car prototype can dole out. With a top speed of 16 mph and a range of up to 25 miles (depending on the amount of assistance needed), around 200 of these i Pedelecs will join BMW's vehicle fleet for next month's Olympics in London. While there's no sight of pricing for high-earning cyclists in need of some electric oomph, the prototype car will set eco road-warriors back around $56,000.
