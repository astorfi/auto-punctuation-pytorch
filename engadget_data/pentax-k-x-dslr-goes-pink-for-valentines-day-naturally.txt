Bitterness and shame aside, it looks as if Pentax has decided that too few people were using its custom color shop to craft completely pink K-x DSLRs, and in the honor of Saint Valentine, the company has decided to roll out another stock hue to sell alongside the red, white, black and navy blue versions. It'll set you back around HK$5,990 (or $770 in greenbacks), but trust us, your honey is totally worth it.
