It's on ThinkSecret, which means, of course, that we can't verify the information or its source, but now the rumor
on top of the pile for things we might see at
Macworld in January is that the
Mac mini will be given a second life as a Front
Row 2.0-bearing digital media hub — complete with DVR features. Apparently it'll also be an Intel Mac, and feature an
iPod dock, in addition to receiving a larger (physically and logically) 3.5-inch drive — all of which would undoubtedly
result in a more corpulent Mac mini. There are a lot of things we could (but won't) get into here, but we would like to
take a moment to say that if Apple did want to get their foot in the door to the living room really quick n' easy, an
Intel Mac mini + Front Row + DVR + iPod dock would be the way to do it. In fact, the only thing they'd probably have to
worry about would be the low-margin mini really cannibalizing thes sales of their non-Intel, non-DVR higher-margin iMac
and Power Mac products (at least for the time being). But again, this is all unconfirmed, so we'll ease up on ya.
