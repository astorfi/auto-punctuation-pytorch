At the Tokyo Game Show today, Shuhei Yoshida announced that Sony will soon launch a library of PlayStation 3 titles via its Gaikai cloud-gaming service. Yoshida also confirmed that the games will be available to play on the PS4 -- as previously rumored -- as well as on the PS Vita and Vita TV. Given that the PlayStation 4 won't natively support PS3 titles when it launches stateside later this year, the cloud-based options should come as a huge relief to those looking to pick up the company's latest console and, you know, have something compelling to play. Look for this service to hit the US in 2014 -- no word yet on when it will launch in Europe.
