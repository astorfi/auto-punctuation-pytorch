The guns cost $260,000 each and can mounta variety of lethal weapons. Currently around 15 CROWS units make it to Iraq each month, but the Army is hoping for 9000of them, partly due to their success with all the gamers currently serving in the infantry. The joystick operated gun,while much safer, is obviously limited in field of vision in comparison to a man mounted turret gun, but former FPSplayers have found plenty of success with the weapons. We're glad to know all those hours spent in front of the screendidn't go to waste, now we just wish there was a better use for short-form tech prose in the service of the country.[Via The Raw Feed]
