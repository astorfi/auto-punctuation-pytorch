These could turn out to be some very famous last words, but at a press conference earlier today Sim Wong Hoo, the
CEO of Creative (the company that makes all those Zen MP3 players like the
Zen Touch and the
Zen Micro) literally declared war on Apple, announcing
plans to try to out-spend and out-market Steve Jobs next year with a $100 million advertising and marketing designed to
dethrone the iPod, and that "the MP3 war has started". Might be tough, given that over 90% of new hard drive-based
players sold in the US sport an Apple logo, but we're always game for a down and dirty gadget war.
