 
And here it is, everyone, iRiver's hot new hard drive-based E10 portable audio player. Unfortunately itdoesn't have Bluetooth / A2DP as we might have hoped, but it does have a 1.5-inch color display, video playback, FMtuner, IR blaster (apparently it can be used as a remote), a 32 hour battery (yeah, that doesn't sound quite right),and a 3.7 x 1.7 x 0.55-inch footprint. (Our previous report also had it pinned with six gigs of storage.) MisticRiverquotes the price -- and the mentioned specs -- at about $240 US, but we'll all have to sit tight while we wait for USlaunch plans and a proper formal announcement.
