Getting acquainted with Windows 8.1 has been a slow process that started early this year, but it looks like it'll finally hit shelves in roughly two months. According to an unnamed source cited by ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley, the RTM build of the operating system is still on track to hit manufacturers by the end of August, and the OS -- along with new hardware carrying it -- will be publicly available come mid-October. Those hoping to get their hands on the near-final software ahead of time via MSDN or the sunsetting Technet are out of luck, however, as the outlet's tipster claims the final portions of 8.1 won't be obtainable through those means until general availability. If you need something to help pass the time until then, you can always dive into our in-depth hands-on with the update formerly known as Blue.
