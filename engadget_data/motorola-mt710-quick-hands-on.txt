The MT710 is running the Android-based Ophone OS on some pretty sweet hardware including an 854 x 480 FWVGA resistive touchscreen display -- to help with Chinese handwriting recognition we'd bet -- replacing HSPA 3G with TD-SCDMA for 3G, and a pretty slick housing accented in reflective and red metals. Of course the MT710 isn't meant for our market, but we're still encouraged to see how many Android sets are cropping up here at the show and indeed from Motorola.
