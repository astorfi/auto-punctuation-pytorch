As that name implies, this Android ICS tab's of the 7-inch variety and, thus, lends itself well to one-handed use for busy on-the-go types. Considering this isn't part of the outfit's top shelf portfolio, its mix of specs have been kept quite modest: there's a single-core 1.2GHz Cortex A8 CPU underneath that 1,024 x 600 IPS display. But before you knock it for falling short of even 720p territory, bear in mind this device's being marked at a 229 Euro price point -- so it's affordable and geared squarely for the budget segment.

 Loaded up with a mostly stock version of Android 4.0.3 and global radios for 3G / WiFi, this humble tab's made for mobile use, as the OEM's VP of Euro operations assured us repeatedly. Performance-wise, its lack of a dual-core setup is heavily apparent, since there was a considerable lag between our touch input and onscreen effect. The tab also sports 8GB of internal storage, a rear 3.2-megapixel camera and VGA front facer -- helpful if you're out and about and want to video chat -- in addition to a 4,100mAh battery.

 As for the MediaPad 7 Lite's build, well, it's a bit disappointing especially given the attractive design of the Nexus 7 which is comparably priced and higher specced. In all, it feels rather chunky in-hand, but it does feature a metallic back bordered by solid white plastic. It's set to be released this August in South Africa, China, Russia, Philippines and Taiwan, followed by Germany in October for 249 Euros.
