For the mathematically challenged, that works out to one a month on average -- a pretty aggressive pace and a sign that Android's showing no signs of slowing down in terms of carrier and manufacturer adoption. Though the hardware looks great, none of AT&T's Android announcements so far here feature a stock UI experience -- sure, nothing they've done in the past year suggests they're keen to offer a stock device, but with 12 in the pipe, surely just one of 'em can go skinless?
