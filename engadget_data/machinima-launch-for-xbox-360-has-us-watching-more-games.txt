When Microsoft piled on the Xbox media channels last year, we didn't realize just how long it would take for some of those channels to come to fruition. We're quite possibly on the cusp of new hardware, and Machinima's app is just now making its Xbox 360 debut. Still, it might be worth the wait for those who live and breathe gaming even after they've set down the gamepad. The app includes the full suite of Machinima channels and their associated videos, ranging from regular shows and specials through to game blooper reels. Machinima is available everywhere Xbox Live is active; if that isn't enough to tide you over, Microsoft is teasing the reveal of a OneBeat electronic music app next month.
