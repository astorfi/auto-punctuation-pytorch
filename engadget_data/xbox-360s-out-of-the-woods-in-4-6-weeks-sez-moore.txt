       Feels like we've been hearing this since the get go, but Peter Moore (who we interviewednot long ago) wanted to let everyone at DICE and elsewhere know that apparently Microsoft's nicked their componentsupply problems, and that "within the next four to six weeks, anybody will be able to walk into a store and buy anXbox 360." Just like that, Mr. Moore? Well, we'll let you know how Microsoft's really doing in, oh, say four to sixweeks, yeah?[Via Xbox360Fanboy]
