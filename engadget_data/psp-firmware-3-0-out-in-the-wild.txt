 
As expected, to accompany its spankin' new PS3 console, Sony has a bit of a "refresh" for the PSP, in the form of a 3.0 firmware update that packs a fair bit of functionality. The biggest news is that PlayStation Network downloadable games are now supported, previews of which (pictured) included fan faves like FFVII and Metal Gear Solid, so hopes are high there. The PSP should also now be able to access media stored on your PS3 via WiFi. Other functions include Remote Play, a visual music player, a Camera option under the Photo menu, and an option to disable UMD Auto-Start. A few other options might spark your interest, but you might as well just find 'em out for yourself -- the upgrade is available now via Network Update.
