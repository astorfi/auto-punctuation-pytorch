 When Nintendo's Wii U launches this November in the US and EU, it's bringing "more than 50" launch window games -- what that "launch window" means, exactly, is another question altogether. Nintendo's leading the lineup with a variety of its own games, though publishers Activision and Ubisoft are certainly leading the charge in terms of sheer number of games. A variety of high-profile cross platform ports are heading to the Wii U, from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 to Madden NFL 13. And yes, Nintendo's bringing plenty of its stalwart franchises to the launch, including New Super Mario Bros. Head past the break for the full list shown during today's New York City press conference.
