It's no secret that Google and Samsung need each other given that Samsung dominates Android device sales. It only makes sense, then, that the two companies have just struck a deal to license each other's patents for the next 10 years. In addition to accelerating product research, the agreement should reduce the chances for future patent lawsuits. The move suggests that Samsung isn't keen on burning any bridges -- even if it starts drifting  away from Android, it should remain in Google's good books.
