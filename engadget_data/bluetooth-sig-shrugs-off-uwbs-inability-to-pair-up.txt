 It seems that the vendors whocomprise the Bluetooth Special Interest Group couldn't careless that the warring factions over at rival short-range wireless technology ultra-wideband finally abandoned all hope of reaching a universal IEEEstandard last week. According to Michael Foley, executive director of the SIG, they will work with whichever flavor ofUWB triumphs in the market to ensure interoperability with Bluetooth, but will essentially pick one side over the otherin "helping the market determine the most advantageous solution." The group will take into account suchfactors as universality, power consumption, and mobile integration when deciding which proposed standard to cheer andwhich one to jeer.[Via wireless]
