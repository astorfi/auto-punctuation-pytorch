        Because that 50GB Blu-ray disc just won't be big enough of course. Oh no, what you really need is a 200GBHolographic Versatile Disc. Luckily for you, Optware will be giving you much more of what you're looking for in 2006,which they announced yesterday. Of course, at $30K a drive that might be a bit expensive for your tastes,but I mean hey, you read Luxist every day right? You're a baller, go buy three, andsome of the $100 discs they expect to sell while you're at it. Maybe Toshiba should throw in the towel on this HD-DVDthing and focus on lowering costs on this technology that they have already invested in, just a thought.
