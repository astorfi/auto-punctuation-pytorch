Over six months ago, a joint venture between AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon called Isis launched a trial of its nascent mobile payment service in Austin and Salt Lake City. Not only was its debut already delayed, we also haven't heard more than a peep from the company since. CEO Michael Abbott, who is the keynote speaker at ETA 2013 in New Orleans, has opened the discourse but still isn't giving many specific details on the future. When we asked him about his company's expansion plans, Abbott simply told us that "when [we're] ready, we'll start putting it out in different places and see where to go from there." In essence, he views progress in the mobile payments field as a constant evolution, which often involves taking smaller steps to accomplish a greater purpose. You can find the full quote below the break.



"The way we look at it is 'does anyone in this room remember the date the iPod was launched?' What do you remember instead? You remember a constant iteration that got better and better. So what you'll see from us is a constant evolution as we go farther and farther out in this over time. But it won't be one big end date, it won't be one point in time. I believe we should be constantly working to make the consumer experience better. So when I'm ready, we'll start putting it out in different places and decide where to go from there.
