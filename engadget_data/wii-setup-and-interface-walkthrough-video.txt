Hit it for initial setup, configuration, and a complete interface and menu walkthrough, including the creation of a Mii. (Sorry, online stuff is disabled for the time being, we'll hit you back on that asap.) We know it's a tad excessive, but we're hoping to keep the Nintendo fanboys in the house pleased while we silently and lovingly admire our congregation of consoles.Download videoMP4 (h.264) - VGA, QVGAAVI (DivX) - VGA, QVGA
