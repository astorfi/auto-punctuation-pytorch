  Turkcell subscribers looking to make a purchase from their favorite Istanbul bazaar now have one extra payment option -- if they're a BlackBerry Bold owners, that is. Research In Motion and Turkcell have announced the availability of touchless NFC payments for the BlackBerry Bold 9900 via Turkcell's Cep-T Cüzdan mobile application. Interested parties can visit their local Turkcell retailer to trade-up to an NFC-compatible SIM, load the Cep-T application and begin swiping their Berry wherever (worldwide) MasterCard PayPass is accepted. Purchases under 35TL (around $20) won't require any additional verification, though procurements over that threshold will require you to enter a PIN on the handset or tender your signature. Hopefully, with MasterCard, Visa and Google all aboard the NFC bandwagon, 2012 will see a major push towards the technology here in the US.
