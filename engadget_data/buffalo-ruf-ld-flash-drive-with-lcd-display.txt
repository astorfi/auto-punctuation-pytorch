If you're not sure how much space you have left on that USB flash
drive, you now have another option in addition to the Memorex
TravelDrive ID. The RUF-LD, from Buffalo Technology, is an LCD-equipped flash drive, which can display the amount
of available storage and the name of the drive, which can make it easier to figure out which drive has the info you
need if you've got a bunch of them lying around. The drives will be out in December, in capacities of 256MB and 512MB,
which seems a little skimpy, given that Memorex's drive is available in sizes up to 2GB.
