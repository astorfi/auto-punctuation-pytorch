Ah, we're just kidding guys! We suppose this new Eco-Fueler American Roadster does have a certain cutesy, almost mutant charm, and that 70 mpg figure is hard to argue with. The new three-wheeler sweetens the deal by running compressed natural gas, which goes for around 62 cents a gallon, and works out to about a penny a mile. Speed tops out at 120mph, and the Roadster has a sound system, heater and a hard-top for all the comforts of home. Production starts next month, and Eco-Fueler hopes to build about 150 of these a month for the $20,000-ish asking price.[Via AutoblogGreen]
