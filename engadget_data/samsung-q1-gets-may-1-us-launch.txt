 Samsung is setto officially launch its Q1 UMPC in the US on May 1, with an eventin San Francisco. We're assuming (or at least hoping) that this will be a real launch, with an announcement of pricingand availability (Samsung has already launched the Q1 in Korea, with a priceofÂ  about $1,200). Of course, if Samsung decides to hold the event in the Moscone Center and starts sending outcryptic invitations, all bets are off.
