Sony seems pretty excited about the new Digital Motion Reality TV Tuner in their latest
all-in-one
multimedia desktop, the
Vaio V (VGC-VA200RB, VA200B, VA170B, VA200DS, VA170S).
Apparently the tuner significantly increases video quality (huzzah), while the rest of the box rounds out with a
Pentium 4 630 (3GHz), 20-inch 1366 x 768 display, dual 200GB drives, dual-layer DVD burner, and multiple tuners. Still,
you're not paying quality here, friends, you're paying for that sweet, sweet 8-inch bezel. Aw yeah.
