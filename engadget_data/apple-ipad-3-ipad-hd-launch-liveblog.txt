  Got plans for tomorrow? Of course not -- you canned 'em a week ago. For those still unaware, Apple will be unveiling its next iPad at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater in San Francisco tomorrow, and as always, we'll be there live to bring you the news as it happens. Feel free to get caught up on the latest from the rumormill right here, and bookmark this page for our liveblog. We'll be on the scene early, with Tim and myself livestreaming (just like we did for WWDC and the iPhone 4S launch last year) a pre-event rumor wrap-up as well as a post-event round-up of what all goes down.As for the liveblog? It'll get going at 10:00AM PT tomorrow, and you can find how that translates to your neck of the woods below. See you then, rations in tow!
