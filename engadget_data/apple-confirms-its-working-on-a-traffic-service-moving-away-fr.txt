The company says it "is now collecting anonymous traffic data to build a crowd-sourced traffic database," and that it's hoping to provide iPhone users with an "improved traffic service in the next couple of years." It didn't divulge much more than that, unfortunately, but that little detail lines up with some other navigation-related developments out of the company as of late. It acquired web mapping firm Poly9 last July (in addition to Google Maps rival Placebase in late 2009), and just last month a couple of job postings revealed that it was looking for folks to "radically improve" the iOS Maps experience. Add all those together and it's starting to look an awful lot like a shift away from Google Maps in favor of an all-Apple solution -- much like how the company relied on Skyhook until it could roll its own WiFi geolocation service.
