 Keep in mind that nothing is set in stone until the official unveiling of BlackBerry 10 on January 30th, but it seems that a lucky soul in Vietnam has captured the clearest look yet of the device that'll "reinstall faith in RIM." These seemingly legitimate snapshots of the L-Series reveal an attractive touchscreen slab that features a removable back cover -- complete with an NFC antenna -- which also provides access to the phone's micro-SIM and microSD slots, along with a removable 1,800mAh battery. Fans of the unique play / pause toggle will find it happily sitting within the metallic volume rocker, and you'll also notice micro-USB and micro-HDMI ports occupying the left-hand side. With such a clean design, we can only hope that RIM can keep the carrier's requests for customization at bay -- some of 'em straight up don't have a knack for aesthetics. Be sure to follow the break for a couple extra peeks of this oft-leaked device, or hit up the source link for the full gallery.
