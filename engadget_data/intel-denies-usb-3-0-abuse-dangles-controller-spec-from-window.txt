 Nothing captures the public's attention faster than a sensational accusation. Pit industry heavyweights like AMD and NVIDIA against Intel and you've got yourself an LA-style courtroom drama. On one side of the bench we see AMD and NVIDIA, stamping their feet and insisting that Intel is keeping the USB 3.0 spec under wraps in order to lock vendors into Intel chipsets. On the other, Intel, tonguing a bittersweet no we're not raspberry right back at the pair. In a lengthy retort, Intel claims, (1) it's not its spec to hide -- it's owned by the USB 3.0 Promoter Group consisting of HP, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, NXP, and TI; and (2) the "gazillions of dollars and bazillions of man hours" Intel has spent developing the royalty-free USB 3.0 controller spec (a 3.0 "dummies guide") is meant to ensure that the industry can start building the USB 3.0 spec into their silicon as quickly as possible after its release later this year. Of course, Intel offers plenty of verbiage to support its claims. But in a case of he-said, she-said, the truth may never be known to the titillated outsiders who've likely made up their minds anyway. [Via PCWorld]
