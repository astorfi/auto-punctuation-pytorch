We didn't see much going on in terms of the operating system, but they did have a couple of Mac Pros on display for us to handle and smudge. Guess all that talk about a radically redesigned tower system isn't going to be, but hey, if you're down with the cheese grater then this is the machine for you. Dual drives, quad processors, loads more ports, plenty of video options -- well, you know what it's got, you just came for the pr0n, and the pr0n you shall get. Click on for loads of pics!
