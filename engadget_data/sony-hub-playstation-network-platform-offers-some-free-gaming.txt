The service-formerly-known-as-Sony-HUB is actually beingcalled the PlayStation Network Platform, and unlike Xbox Live, will offer owners some free gaming at the basicsubscription level as well as connect to the regular Intenet and allow members to host their own game servers. Kutaragialso confirmed that games will be bootable from the PS3's hard drive, making it likely that Sony will be selling titlesfrom the original PlayStation and PS2 catalogs for retro gaming fun. Among the usual slew of video chat, avatarcreation, ranking, and other community functions we've come to expect from online play is the interesting addition of a"matchmaking" feature, which we're presuming is of the romantic variety, and which you can probably expect Philadelphia's ABCAction News to issue an "important warning" to parents about in the near future.[Via Joystiq, thanks Luke]
