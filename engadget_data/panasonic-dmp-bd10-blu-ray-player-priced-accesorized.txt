  Panasonic officially announced their first Blu-ray player, the DMP-BD10, still due in September. They also announced the retail price of $1299.95. It will (of course) play back Blu-ray discs and upconvert all other video content to 1080p via HDMI. They also mention their proprietary P4HD technology to improve 1080/720p output over the analog connectors, but we don't see anything else specific on the spec list that justifies the price premium over other Blu-ray offerings. It does include their Viera Link HDMI control technology so it can work well with the matching $999 SA-XR700 receiver. The 7.1 channel receiver also has two HDMI inputs and one output to pass 1080p through. Just to round things out, the $2999.95 SB-TP1000 speaker system with "Twin Center Speaker" technology that they claim gives a center channel, without a dedicated center speaker.
