Well, capping off a wild day of BlackBerry leaks and rumors over at BGR comes news of a Torch 2 in the works that might just make good on those shortcomings (and a whole lot more) thanks to a 1.2GHz processor, 14.4Mbps triband HSPA, a VGA display at the original Torch's same 3.2-inch size, BlackBerry OS 6.1, and -- like some of the other leaks we've seen -- integrated NFC, which suggests the Nexus S may have started something good here. Specs aside, yeah... the phone itself is nearly a dead ringer for the model it replaces, adding some chrome accents and calling it good. If BGR's sources are on, you can look for this in the third quarter on AT&T.
