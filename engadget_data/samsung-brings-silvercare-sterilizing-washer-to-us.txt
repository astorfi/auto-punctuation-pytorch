 Ifyou've been waiting for a chance to use the power of silver to sterilize your laundry in cold water (and we know youhave), Samsung has your number. The company will be bringing its SilverCare washer to theUS this month, at a price of about $1,399. The washer uses silver ions to sterilize laundry, and Samsung claims that itkills 99.9% of bacteria on clothing. Once this catches on, we suspect Samsung will spring an even more upscale versionon us, which will use gold or platinum to wipe out the other 0.1% of bacteria, and impart a metallic sheen to ourclothes in the process.
