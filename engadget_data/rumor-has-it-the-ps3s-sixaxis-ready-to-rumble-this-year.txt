According to a GameFAQs posting, the new issue of PSM itself is supposedly publishing what they too identify as a rumor that Sony's set to announce SIXAXIS rumble for the PS3 at E3 in July, which will have new controllers land on November 13th. So hey take this rumor within a rumor how you will, but Sony's got to announce something at E3, don't they?[Via Joystiq]
