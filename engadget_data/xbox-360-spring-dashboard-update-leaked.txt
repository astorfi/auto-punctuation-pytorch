The update hits May 7th
Your contact list will now integrate Windows Live Messenger, and show joinable session status
Messenger contacts can see what game you're playing, and your gamertag
Marketplace will now have its own blade, which will be skinned independent of your theme
Users will now get inline achievement updates
Low-power download mode and auto-shutdown
You can watch partially downloaded movies
You can text chat messenger six friends playing games watching movies
Multiple tweaks on the user interface

YouTube video after the break. What say ye?[Thanks, Sherveen]
