  Wireless companies love suing one another -- well, maybe they don't "love" it, but in an age when it's virtually impossible to assemble a cellular device without extensive licensing agreements in place, it's basically an inevitability. Microsoft has hit up the ITC over a total of nine alleged patent infringements by Motorola in its Android devices, specifically relating to "synchronizing email, calendars and contacts, scheduling meetings, and notifying applications of changes in signal strength and battery power." This should be interesting -- will it result in a quick cross-licensing agreement, or a protracted court battle spanning multiple years? Hard to say, but in the meantime, follow the break for Microsoft's brief press release.
