 
Hang on to your hats, ladies and gentlemen -- we've got a preposterously large helping of ThinkPad news coming at you tonight. We're talking details and photographs of the forthcoming X200, SL, T, and R series laptops, so without further adieu, let's get to know the X200 a touch better. Preliminary slides are hinting at the following hardware:

12-inch WXGA panel
45nm Core 2 Duo CPUs up to 2.4GHz
Intel Centrino 2 with vPro technology
SSDs up to 64GB
WiMAX / WWAN / GPS / WiFi / UWB / Bluetooth
Magnesium alloy top and bottom covers
9.6-hours of battery life on the 9-cell pack
DDR3 RAM
1.3-megapixel camera
DisplayPort connector
3 USB ports
Starts at 2.93 pounds

If we've already got you hot and bothered, you should probably grab a dry towel before heading on past the break. There's more where this came from.
