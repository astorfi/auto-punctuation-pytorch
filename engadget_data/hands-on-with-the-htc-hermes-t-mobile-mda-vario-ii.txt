But you'd never know it -- no name on theshell, no display card detailing what the device is -- nothing. Just sitting there hoping for someone like us to comealong and give it some love. Destined to appear with T-Mobile Germany thisMay as the MDA Vario II, this UMTS / HSDPA flauntin' Pocket PC still sports the specs we heard before: 300MHz Samsungprocessor, 128MB flash and 64MB memory, 2.8-inch display, 802.11b/g, Bluetooth 2.0, MicroSD, 2.1 megapixel camera, anda secondary videoconferencing camera. The MDA Vario II wasn't on the HSDPA network while we were giving it awalk-through, but then again it's always good to leave wanting just a bit more. Way too many snaps after the break.
