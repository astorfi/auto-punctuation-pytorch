launch since the PSP, but here it is. The Apple iTunes phone, the Motorola
ROKR E1, will feature a 100 song capacity via random
autofill (ala the shuffle) or manually loaded music via USB, a color display (duh) with album art support, stereo
speakers, headphones with a mic for calls. Cingular will be the sole US carrier. Of course, if you've been following
the development, none of the above should surprise you. We had the first known authentic pics of this thing
way back in July, and have followed their more or less
open-secret engagement with Cingular for
the duration.


UPDATE: A few more details. It's going to sell for $249.99 with two-year service agreement. It's
tri-band GSM/GPRS (850/1800/1900 MHz), it has a 176 x 220 pixel, 262,000 color display, weighs 3.77 ounces, isÂ 
4.25 x 1.81 x .80-inches in size, has a talk time of 9 hours, a VGA camera, and Bluetooth.
