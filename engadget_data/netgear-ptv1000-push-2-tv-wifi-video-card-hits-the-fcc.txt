It's apparently built on an upcoming Intel standard called Wireless Display that requires a Core i3, i5, or i7 processor with integrated GMA graphics and Windows 7, but nothing's been officially announced yet -- and what little info we have isn't great, as the docs warn users that Wireless Display is unsecured and won't play all DVDs or Blu-rays. That's not a huge problem, we suppose -- all we want to do is beam a Hulu window to our TV simply and easily. We're assuming we'll find out a lot more at CES next week, stay tuned.
