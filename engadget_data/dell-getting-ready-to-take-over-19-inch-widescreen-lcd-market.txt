 Since Dell is already the number one vendor in the LCD market, and they've wowed more than a few eyes with the gorgeous 3007WFP, why not jump right in the lucrative 19-inch widescreen market and scare away the competition? Apparently the Texas powerhouse appears to be doing just that, as DigiTimes reports that the world's leanest company has sent out requests for quotations from well-grounded panel manufacturers AU Optronics and Chi Mei Optoelectronics. While the 1907FP currently stands as Dell's top-end 19-incher, it's supposedly hoping to grab an even bigger chunk of the profitable sector, as "54.6 percent of the total second-quarter widescreen LCD market" came from folks not quite ready to make the 20-inch leap. While it's likely the company will not stick to a sole supplier should it look to trample all those same-sized alternatives, we'd guess Michael and Co. wouldn't send out RFQs to the world's largest and most prominent 19-inch panel manufacturers on a whim -- but hey, we've seen zanier things fly from Dell's doors.[Via TGDaily]
