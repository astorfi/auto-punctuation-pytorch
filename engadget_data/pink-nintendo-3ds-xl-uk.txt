 If the adorable patterns on the Animal Crossing special edition 3DS XL didn't tug at your heart (and wallet) strings, perhaps this English rose will. Set to arrive in the UK on May 31st, there's no software tie-in to mark the occasion, just the vivid hues of an entirely pink handheld. For the international purveyors of all things kawaii, there's still a pearl-finish pink and white 3DS XL listed on Amazon. Regardless of the shade, both options should pair really well with your vast collection of Hello Kitty tat goods.
