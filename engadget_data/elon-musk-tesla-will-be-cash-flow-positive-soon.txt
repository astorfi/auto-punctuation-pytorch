 After Tesla Motors' recent SEC filing painted a picture of production delays, revenue shortfalls and stock sales to raise cash, CEO Elon Musk has gone on the record to say everything's a-okay. The omnipresent executive said that "if the calendar were simply shifted a few weeks to the right" Tesla would have actually exceeded its vehicle delivery targets for the quarter, and said that the share release was merely held to mitigate risk from suppliers. He also claimed that the Department of Energy's request for early repayment was not a poor reflection of the EV maker's financial state, but actually a hearty endorsement -- the government branch expects Tesla to make loads of cash, and wants it to repay the loan early rather than hoarding it. As such, Musk announced the Model S builder had initiated its first early payment today and would pay off the principal loan prior to its March 2013 due date. We'll have to see if that's enough to keep the automaker's name out of any future presidential debates.
