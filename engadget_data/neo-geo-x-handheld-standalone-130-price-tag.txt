While the forthcoming handheld was expected to arrive bundled with nostalgia-tinged hardware, a lower-priced solo handheld is also on the cards. Priced at $130, the makers aren't divulging any more detail on 4.3-inch handheld's precise launch date, but we'd guess that the single unit will match the pricier bundle's December launch date.
