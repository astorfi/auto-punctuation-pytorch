Now Businessweek has a complete behind-the-scenes look at Lenovo's 20 month journey to build the perfect laptop. A journey which saw Lenovo's Senior VP in charge of laptops, Peter Hortensius, screaming to his assistant, "Phyllis! Get me one of those interoffice mail envelopes!" upon the dramatic introduction of the MacBook Air. A worthy read into a product Lenovo hopes will provide them with the same halo effect as that other Apple product. [Thanks, Jacob L.]
