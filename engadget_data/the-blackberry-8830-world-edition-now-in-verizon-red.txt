Seems a bit strange then to launch the 8830 in a shockingly casual, let-your-hair-down shade of red -- but hey, we're glad they've taken the plunge, and we imagine it'll actually sell quite well against the original silver. Verizon's red 8830 features the same specs as its blander brother, including GSM / GPRS on the 900 and 1800MHz bands for international roaming and EV-DO for when you're on home turf. Look for it to hit Verizon's online store tomorrow for $299.99 on contract after rebate.
