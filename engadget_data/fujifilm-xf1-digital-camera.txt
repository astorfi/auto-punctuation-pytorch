 Fujifilm has been making some really handsome, retro-styled shooters lately, and the latest is the XF1. It's a compact camera that's 4.2 inches wide, 2.4 inches across and a scant 1.2 inches deep, and comes covered in either black, red or tan faux leather. There's a 2/3 inch 12-megapixel sensor inside with a retractable, manual zoom, 25-100mm f/1.8 - f/4.9 lens that's optically stabilized. You turn the thing on by twisting and pulling out the lens (like its elder brother, the X10), and you can shoot 1080p 30fps video using the 3-inch 460,000 dot LCD on the back. The XF1's ISO range is 100 - 12,800 and it's got a pop-up flash for shooting in poorly lit locales. Additionally, the camera has a jog dial with a full manual setting, six buttons dedicated to primary functions and a separate, programmable key to tailor the UX to your liking. The XF1 goes on sale for $500 next month, though should you be unable to wait that long, head on over to Cologne, Germany and you can see one in person at Photokina later this week.




  Show full PR text   FUJIFILM Unveils the Head-Turning XF1 Digital Camera  New XF1 has a bold design, advanced technology and amazing F1.8 lens that brings excitement back to compact cameras
   VALHALLA, N.Y., Sep 17, 2012 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- FUJIFILM North America Corporation today announced a new, distinctive premium digital camera that blends advanced technology with an unforgettable design to its flagship X-Series line, the FUJIFILM XF1. With its perfectly matched lens and sensor, careful attention to detail on appearance and design, and accessible technology, the XF1 extends the X-Series range to a much wider audience.

   The FUJIFILM XF1 combines an amazingly fast and newly developed FUJINON F1.8 wide angle lens with 4x manual zoom with a large 2/3-inch 12 Megapixel EXR CMOS sensor that delivers extraordinary image quality, all in a remarkable design that is unlike any other camera.

   The compact FUJIFILM XF1 will be available in three luxurious designs: a dimpled synthetic black leather, a smooth synthetic tan leather and an elegant synthetic red leather. Each new XF1 will begin shipping in October 2012.

   "The FUJIFILM X-Series is known by photographers for their outstanding image quality, precision build and stellar performance," said Go Miyazaki, president and chief operating officer, FUJIFILM North America Corporation. "And the FUJIFILM XF1 lives up to that reputation, while adding a new level of portability and style with its unique retractable F1.8 manual zoom lens along with lightweight and durable aluminum body covered in synthetic leather for a bold, retro look."

   First class lens for razor-sharp results

   The FUJIFILM XF1 features a newly-developed, high-definition FUJINON 25mm wide angle F1.8 lens (25mm-100mm) with 4x manual zoom lens that consists of 7 glass lens elements in 6 groups, including 4 aspherical glass lens elements and 3 extra-low dispersion lens elements. The FUJINON lens as has new HT-EBC (High-Transmittance EBC) coating on all lens surfaces that dramatically reduces flare for crystal clear images, as well as optical image stabilization to eliminate camera shake without compromising resolution around the edges of the image.

   The XF1 also incorporates Optical Image Stabilization, which shifts one group of four elements to minimize camera shake without compromising resolution around the edges of the image, a common problem with conventional stabilization systems. With this extraordinary lens, the XF1 can shoot in low light without boosting sensitivity, keeping noise to a minimum, by using high shutter speeds to prevent camera shake and stop subject motion - all without the need for flash.

   The XF1 is also capable of Macro photography at ranges as close as 3 cm, and can capture images with a beautiful "Bokeh" depth of field effect (for crisp subjects set against out-of-focus backgrounds) by taking advantage of the XF1's fast lens and six diaphragm blades.

   Fast AF in dark scenes with EXR processor

   With its EXR CMOS sensor and EXR processor, the FUJIFILM XF1 offers fast Auto Focus no matter what you are shooting, even in dark settings. The speedy read time of the CMOS sensor, coupled with the high-speed EXR processor, accelerates all operations; quick response, start-up in just 0.55 seconds, focus acquisition in as little as 0.16 seconds, and a minimum shot-to-shot time of just 0.8 seconds. Additionally, the EXR processor offers high-speed processing for hassle-free HD movie recording and burst-mode photography.

   Manual feel with all-new GUI

   The FUJIFILM XF1 has an all new on-screen menu dial that allows users to gain full control of the camera's extensive manual shooting controls. The on-screen menu dial is fully customizable, and allows for quick setting adjustments and selections. The programmable E-Fn button can be assigned up to six functions, allowing for smooth manual control via the bright, 3.0-inch (460k dot premium clear) LCD monitor. The XF1 also features a programmable function button for fast one-click setting access.

   Newly developed hardware design

   The FUJIFILM XF1's new hardware design introduces a fresh way to carry, turn on and use the travel-ready digital camera. There are three modes for users to choose from when using the XF1:

   -- "Travel Mode" for a compact fit with the lens retracted and camera fully powered down

   -- "Standby Mode" with lens extended but in power saving mode for quick startups

   -- "Shooting Mode" for when you are actively photographing

   Getting started is as easy as 1 - 2 - 3. From "Travel Mode," turn the zoom ring to either move into "Standby Mode," or bypass and move directly into "Shooting mode." And beyond just powering the camera, the manual zoom lens provides a very fast and precise 4x optical zoom range plus 2x intelligent digital zoom for a total of 8x zoom.
