It sure is good that Microsoft's Xbox One controller doesn't have a "Share" button dedicated to pushing live broadcasts of gameplay to the internet, because that functionality is being delayed beyond the console's November 22nd launch date. Microsoft confirmed as much this morning in a cursory footnote in a larger piece about the Twitch.tv app, which reads, "We are working to ensure the initial Twitch on Xbox One broadcasting experience meets the expectations of the Twitch community." It sounds like, as it stands now, broadcasting via Xbox One isn't up to snuff for release.


"While this feature won't be available right away, we'll let you know as soon as it is ready," the note continues. "Our goal is to deliver it during the first part of 2014." We've yet to use the Xbox One's broadcasting since first hearing about it during the console's debut event last May. To be clear, the Twitch.tv app is different from the ability to broadcast gameplay through Twitch.


In addition to the delay news, Microsoft released a video of Twitch.tv's app in action, which enables viewing of gameplay broadcasts (it's below the break). Hilariously, this will allow Xbox One players to watch live gameplay from other game platforms, just not the one they're using. Womp womp.
