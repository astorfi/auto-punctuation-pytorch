According to information obtained by 9To5Mac, Best Buy may begin selling the Pebble smartwatch as early as this Sunday. The outlet's sources claim management briefed them that their stores would start selling the watches, and one supplied the above image. This picture of Best Buy's internal inventory system clearly shows an in stock date of July 7th, or, this Sunday, when the firm's weekly circular goes out and its new sales start. If this news is correct, it would mark Best Buy as the first -- and at this time, only -- brick-and-mortar retailer of the "appcessory." Also gleaned from the submitted photo is news that the smartwatch won't be eligible for home delivery, but we can't imagine not being able to order online and then pick-up in-store. We've contacted Best Buy for more info and will update if we hear back.
