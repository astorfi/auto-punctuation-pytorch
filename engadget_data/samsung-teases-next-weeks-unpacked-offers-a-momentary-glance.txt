   See that image above? It's Samsung's way of being sly. The company put out a teaser video for its "Google Episode" of Unpacked occurring on October 11th (we'll be there live, by the way), stating that "something BIG is coming." And if you're not looking close enough, you may completely miss the brief glimpse it gave us of a device with a curved screen. The vid doesn't go so far as to loudly exclaim that this mystery device is the Nexus Prime, of course, but c'mon -- we're picking up what Sammy's putting down. Check out the video below to do some sleuthing of your own.  Update: Samsung amended the end of the video to add the words "Ahead of the curve." Discuss.
