They have a few legitimate bargains, certainly, peppered in amongst the tripe, including a 2GB Element MP3 player for $22.99, a 19-inch Sony Bravia M Series LCD HDTV for $374.99, and a GE A835 digital camera for $79.99, all for your consumin' pleasure. The sale starts Sunday, and runs through the actual Black Friday, or until the economy collapses and we move to a bottle-cap-based currency, whichever happens first. Simply not enough bargains for you? Hit the read link for the full rundown. [Via I4U News]
