 Samsung, one of the biggest and baddest LCD makers anywhere, is stating that LCD TVs should continue their downward price trend for sometime. It wasn't that long ago that 32-inch panels could easily cost you more then two grand but now even Radio Shack sells 'em for less then $900. Who knows when we are going to see them in-line with CRT models - 19-inch around $150, 27-inch around $275, 32-inch around $500. Everyone needs a flat screen around their homes and maybe if flat screens continue to drop, our idea of HDTVs in the bathroom could become come place.
