 It must be the season for Android-native makeovers within our apps. RunKeeper has just pushed out a 3.0 update to its exercise tracker that brings the interface in line with Google's Holo concepts from Android 4.0 and beyond. There's more to see once acclimated to the look and feel, however. The 3.0 revamp now has a dedicated tab to show all of an athlete's progress in one area, such as goals and recent history. It also displays both intervals and pacing in mid-activity while making easy to set a reminder for the next run while cooling down. Runners wanting to modernize just need to hit Google Play to give RunKeeper a makeover that could very well improve their health in the process.
