The rules:

Leave a comment below. Any comment will do, though we'd prefer to hear who you think will win this year's Slam Dunk contest.
You may only enter this specific giveaway once. If you enter this giveaway more than once you'll be automatically disqualified, etc. (Yes, we have robots that thoroughly check to ensure fairness.)
If you enter more than once, only activate one comment. This is pretty self explanatory. Just be careful and you'll be fine.
Contest is open to anyone in the 48 continental US States, 18 or older! Sorry, we don't make this rule (we hate excluding anyone), so be mad at our lawyers and contest laws if you have to be mad.
Winner will be chosen randomly. 25 winners will receive two (2) tickets to the Live 3D HD showing of the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in cinemas. Approximate value is $18 to $22 per ticket.
Entries can be submitted until Tuesday, February 10th, 11:59AM ET. Good luck!
