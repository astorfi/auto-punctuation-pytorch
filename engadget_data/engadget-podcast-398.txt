Terrence takes the time to detail the recent bill that passed in the house, which makes steps in the right direction to rein in the NSA's snooping, but fails to make a serious impact. There's also Microsoft's new "slate-top," a combination of tablet and laptop that's much improved over the previous Surface generation, but at a wallet-busting price. We have plenty more fun and news packed into this edition -- and at least one office dog -- so join us at the streaming links below for our slightly delayed, but worth-the-wait episode of the Engadget Podcast.
