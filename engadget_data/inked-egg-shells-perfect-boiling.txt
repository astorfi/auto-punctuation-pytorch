 For the culinary gurus out there, you can probably boil an egg to a desired hardness in your sleep. But for the rest of us, we'll take all the help we can get while manning a stove. Lion Quality, a UK-based company, has devised a tattoo of sorts to be placed on the shells of eggs that remains invisible until dropped into boiling water. The temperature-sensitive "thermochromic" ink displays three different visuals depending on the taste you prefer and the carton you buy: soft, medium, or hard-boiled logos will appear to advise the chef when enough's enough. Apparently there's been an overwhelming quandary in Britain on how to perfect this subtle art, and Lion Quality inked a deal to provide the helpful logos and remove the guesswork previously involved. So if your clientele (or significant other) gets their feathers all ruffled when breakfast is overcooked, these specially marked eggs can get you out of hot water in the next few months.[Thanks, Stu]
