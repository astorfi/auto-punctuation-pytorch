This week, though, the company announced EyeTV Mobile, a TV tuner that plugs into the iPad 2's 30-pin connector, allowing it to pull in broadcast television. We just happened to stumble on Elgato's booth here at IFA and treated ourselves to a short TV break. The tuner, which fits easily in the palm of your hand when the antenna is collapsed, only allows you to draw in signals using the DVB-T standard, so make no mistake this is a product just for our European readers. (Although Elgato says it hopes to release something similar in Japan.) Even more than the hardware or the programming selection (fútbol, anyone?), we remain impressed by the free EyeTV iOS app, whose interface is pretty much the same as the HDHomeRun for iPad app, with the ability to swipe the screen to change channels and, in this case, save your location. It'll be available across the pond for €99.95 / £99.95 at the end of this month. Until then (or if you're just stuck in the states), check out our hands-on photos below and a video demo after the break.
