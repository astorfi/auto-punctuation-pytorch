 Macworld Expo 2007 is only a few weeks away, and so the Apple rumors are starting to fly, although this one apparently won't come to fruition until closer to February. According to MacScoop, "sources believed to be very reliable" say that Apple is currently working on a super-slim widescreen 12-inch MacBook Pro (17-inch model, pictured), which would still contain the optical drive and that dual-core processor action we've heard so much about. The details on this particular rumor are similarly skimpy -- all we've got is a potential price point of somewhere around $1,700 or $1,800, and that if this product exists, it apparently won't be out until February 2007. As usual, folks, we suggest that you remain as skeptical as we are about this bit of gossip for the time being. Believe it or not, the rumor mill's been known to be wrong from time to time.
