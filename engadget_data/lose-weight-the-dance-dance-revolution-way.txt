CNN writes about the weight-loss wows of DDR (Dance Dance Revolution), the arcade game from Konami which is sorta
like a combination of SuperSimon and the old school Nintendo PowerPad. Apparently portly schoolchildren, used to
sitting on their asses while playing video games, have found DDR's workouts so beneficial that they're actually
losing weight — and some schools have even been incorporating it into PE classes. All of which seems truly
sad if you're a critic (aren't we all?), but super fun if you're the lucky fat kid.
