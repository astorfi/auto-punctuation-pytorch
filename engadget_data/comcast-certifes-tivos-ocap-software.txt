  In a statement that makes us scream, it's about time, Comcast has certified TiVo's OCAP software. The two companies originally announced an agreement over two years ago. TiVo was giving tours at CES and has been testing for some time, but there is still no word on when customers can expect to see the service. This is going to be a good indicator of what we can expect from the OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP) that CableLabs is promoting. We can also finally find out if it is the hardware or the software that motivates so many to complain about their DVR.
