  
We've never had a guest on The Engadget Show that inspired quite as much excitement as Steve Wozniak -- the crowd was pumped and the Woz was in full effect. Josh and Woz talked for a full 40 minutes about everything from Woz's white iPhone to the future of server storage to anecdotes about Apple, and it's all topped off with a little creative currency manipulation, as Woz promises us his custom $2 bills can get us "arrested, but not convicted." 

Then it's on to the roundtable, where Josh, Paul, and Nilay talk over Sony's new NGP, PlayStation Suite, and even play with a super-secret unannounced prototype of the PlayStation Phone. This is one you absolutely should not miss. What are you waiting for? Watch it now! Hit up the video stream after the break or download the show in HD below!
