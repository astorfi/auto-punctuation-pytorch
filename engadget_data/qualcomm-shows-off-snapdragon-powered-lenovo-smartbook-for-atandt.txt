Unfortunately, neither Lenovo nor AT&T is saying anything about the device just yet, and Jacobs doesn't seem to have offered much more than what was already known from the standard smartbook specs. There is the requisite low-res photo captured from the webcast, however, and all parties involved should be doing plenty more talking when this one makes its official debut at CES in January.
