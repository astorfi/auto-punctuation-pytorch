As seen in the graphics, ESPNews' traditional BottomLine now frames the top, left and bottom of 16x9 main video space. Everything's been tweaked -- it appears ESPN has learned much from the launch of its first two HD networks -- from a more moderate (and hopefully less prone to burn-in) steel blue color scheme, redone music with an orchestra-performed theme and all-new set backed by ESPN's multimedia newsroom. Called a "milestone concept" and "must have" for its exclusive HD content (a first for ESPN) ESPN VP Bryan Burns thinks it's hot, check more pics after the break then decide for yourself at 8 a.m. Sunday, March 30; if your carrier isn't up to speed, check out the simulcast on ESPN HD for the first hour, then ESPN2 HD in 30 minute chunks at 11:30 a.m. and p.m.
