We knew Canon's new HDV camcorder was en route, so
it's not really much a surprise that they announced it in time for their Canon Expo 2005 here in New York. Their new
HDV High Definition XL H1 does 1080i (but not 24p) for less than we expected: $9,000. Outside that, the triple 1/3-inch
CCD camera packs a 20x zoom lens, 24fps mode, 2.4-inch display, and their new DIGIC DV II processor. We're gonna
venture that the two of you out there who're gonna put your cars in hock will probably be getting your money's worth on
this one.
