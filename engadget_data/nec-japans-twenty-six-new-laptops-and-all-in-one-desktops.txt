This cornucopia ofhardware comes in both laptop and all-in-one, media-centric desktop flavors, and can be further divided into theirrespective series: the LaVie 15.4-inch L, T, and 12.1-inch A laptops, and Valuestar W/X, L, and R desktops. More specifically, the W lineupcome in four different configurations (VW970/FG, VW900/FH, VW770/FG, VW700/FG), with displays ranging from to 20 to32-inches, either a 2.8GHz Pentium D or 3.06GHz Celeron D processor, and RAM and hard drive capacity ranging from 512MBto 1GB, and 400GB to 800GB, respectively, while the only X model, the 20-inch, 2.80GHz VX780/FD, seems to differ fromthe W's in that it utilizes a tower configuration and sports a nVidia GeForce video card (all the rest of the desktopsfeature integrated graphics). For pics and details on the rest of the desktops and all of the notebooks, keep onreading after the jump...
      

 

Meanwhile, the slimline, detached CPU L series comes in seven different varieties (VL970/FG, VL700/FG,VL590/FG, VL570/FG, VL500/FG, VL370/FD, and VL300/FD), with 17 or 20-inch monitors, 2.8GHz Pentium D, 3.06GHz CeleronR, or hyper-threaded 2.93GHz Pentium processors, 512MB or 768MB of RAM, and hard drives ranging from 250GB to 400GB.Finally, at least as far as the desktops are concerned, the three members of the R series (VR570/FG, VR500/FG, VR300/FG) seem like younger siblings to the W/X models, as they all sport just a 17-inch screen,but still pack some good processing power with either those Celeron D's or HT Pentium 4's from the L series, and alsorock just 512MB of RAM and a maximum hard-drive capacity of 400GB. Many of these all-in-ones, as well as most of thenew laptops, come with TV tuners, remote controls, DVD burners, and the always-important VIIV certification.Incidentally, NEC also announced that PC's with built-in HD-DVD drives will begin shipping in the fall.On the portable side, the LaVie L series consists of eight models (LL990/FD, LL900/FD, LL790/FD,LL770/FG, LL750/FD, LL700/FD, LL570/FD, LL370/FD), with either a 1.60GHz Celeron M, 1.73GHz Pentium M, Mobile Sempron3100 , or Turion 64 Mobile processor, 80GB, 100GB, or 160GB hard drives, and 256MB to 1GB of RAM. Like the all-in-onemodels, gamers will find nothing worth their time, as the video here is also powered by rather unexciting integratedgraphics.To round things out, the LaVie T comes in 1.6GHz Celeron M (LT900/FD) or 1.73GHz Pentium M(LT700/FD) flavors, sport 100GB or 160GB hard drives, and both come standard with with 512MB, upgradable to 2GB (aswith most of the other new models). The sole member of the A family, the LA500/FD, can only muster a pokey 1GHz CeleronM chip, 80GB hard drive, and 512MB of RAM, but its claimed 5-hour battery life completely schools the rest of today'sannounced lappies, with one even advertising less than an hour of juice.All of the new machines will beavailable by the end of the month (released on either the 14th or 21st, specifically), in Japan only. Oh, and if youwant prices on all twenty-six of these, well, you're gonna have to do the conversions yourself -- so maybe ourdedication to you isn't as complete as we originally claimed.Read-Valuestar W/XRead-Valuestar LRead-Valuestar RRead-LaVie laptopsRead-Desktop specsRead-Laptop specs
