 McLaren isn't a brand that most would associate with eco-friendly motoring. That very nearly makes it a surprise to see the supercar builder throw itself wholeheartedly into performance EVs with a new deal for Formula E racing: it's supplying all the motors, electronics and transmissions for Spark Racing Technology-made cars to be used in the pure-electric league's inaugural 2014 season. Full technical details await, but the championship's choice of noise-sensitive urban racetracks guarantees that we won't hear attempts to recreate an F1 engine's high-RPM buzz anytime soon -- we're more likely to hear the tire noise. We'll deal with any lost romanticism if it means giving Formula E, and performance EVs, a healthy dose of credibility.
