 It looks like Samsung's snazzy YP-P2 just became even more attractive, as folks still on the fence (and even those that aren't) can reportedly look forward to a number of upcoming firmware updates that promise to add even more functionality. Apparently, the P2 will be hit with an update this December that enables a Bluetooth connection to one's mobile phone, BT file exchanges and the addition of an e-dictionary (saywha?). In late January of 2008, you can expect an upgraded Touch UI along with FM recording / playback. The elusive "Third Wave" update is set to land next March, but as you can tell from the photo to the right, Sammy's just lettin' your imagination run wild with this one. Check out the full spread after the jump.[Via YeppYepp]
