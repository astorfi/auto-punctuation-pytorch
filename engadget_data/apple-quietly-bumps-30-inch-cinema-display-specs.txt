 In an another sterlingexample of Apple-related PR oddities, it appears they have recently made a minor bump in the specs of their 30-inch CinemaDisplays -- without bothering to tell anyone about it. The revised LCD now more closely mirrors the specs of Dell's3007WFP, with 400 cd/m2 brightnessand a 700:1 contrast ratio, as opposed to the former 270 cd/m2 and 400:1 specs. The price remains the same, at theever-astronomical $2500, but at least you're getting a little bit more bang for your buck. This spec bump comes noteven a week after the display barely edged out the 3007WFP in a heated battle,we'd love to see how it fares now[Via Pocket-lint]
