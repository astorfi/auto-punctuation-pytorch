Amazon is rolling out the Dash Button, a physical device that allows customers to re-order items like toilet paper, diapers and laundry detergent as soon as they run out, with a simple press. The Dash Button is adhesive, and when pressed, customers receive a smartphone notification with options to cancel or continue the order. This initiative builds off of Amazon's previous device, the Dash, which scanned barcodes and had a microphone, allowing customers to simply say which items they wanted to renew. It's all one more way the company is trying to get customers to ditch the grocery store. Amazon will start sending email invitations to select Prime Members with offers to try out the Dash Button today, limited to three devices per household.
