Concerned there's not enough to watch on Netflix, or that the big studios and networks might hold stuff back for their own streaming services? Rest easy, the video streamer has plans for a slew of exclusive content over the next few years, and this week it revealed details about two more shows to go along with its latest Canadian project. First up is the new show we'd heard about from Todd A. Kessler, Glenn Kessler and Daniel Zelman, who were the creators of Damages. That show has a name now -- Bloodline -- and an appropriately creepy teaser trailer (embedded after the break). 



Also in the works is F is for Family, an animated series created by comedian Bill Burr that's about a different (funnier) kind of family than the one in Bloodline and is set in the 1970s. The show is executive produced by Burr and Vince Vaughn, and will feature voices from Laura Dern and Justin Long. Before that arrives though, Burr will premiere his new stand-up special I'm Sorry You Feel That Way on Netflix December 5th. Of course if you just need something to watch this weekend, Netflix just launched a comedy special from Wyatt Cenac on Tuesday, and today it premiered E-Team, a documentary about people who investigate allegations of human rights abuses.
