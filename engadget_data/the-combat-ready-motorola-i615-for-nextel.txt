The trend continues with the military-spec i615, a candybar (though the term doesn't really seem to do this thing justice) that makes up in ruggedness what it lacks in appearance. It comes packing Bluetooth, a speakerphone, and what appears to be a pretty healthy-sized display, but lacks Direct Talk for off-network walkie talkie action. The i615 can be had immediately (before you go and break another handset) for $250 on contract after discounts.[Thanks, Reemusk]
