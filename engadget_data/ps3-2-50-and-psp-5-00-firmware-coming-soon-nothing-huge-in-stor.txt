Nothing terrifically major for the PS3 apart from support for the SOCOM Bluetooth Headset's High Quality mode, as well as some trophy tweaks and power management options, but the PSP gets a WiFi version of the PlayStation Store, with downloadable games, trailers, and demos. No word on when these will actually become available, but we'd guess it'll be relatively soon.
