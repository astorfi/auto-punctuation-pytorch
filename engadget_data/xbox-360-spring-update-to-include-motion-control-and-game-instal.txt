What if the Xbox 360 were to get both of those "features" in its Spring dashboard update? According to a supposedly leaked list for the upcoming dashboard update, both a "motion sensor device" and HDD installation will be supported. The first item listed, "Calibration options for motion sensor devices" certainly makes it seem like a waggle stick is on its way to the 360. The other, "store installation data on Storage Device for faster loading" sounds a lot like the PS3's proclivity for keeping an HDD cache handy. PSWii60, anyone?
