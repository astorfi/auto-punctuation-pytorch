The commission took a close look at the Portal of Power peripheral for the upcoming Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure title. The circular device lets users store game information across platforms using plastic figures, so progress made on, say, the 3DS version of the game will transfer over when they boot up the PS3 version. The plucky dragon and his pie-like Portal of Power are due to arrive in October.
