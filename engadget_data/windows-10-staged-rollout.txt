We hope you didn't book off July 29th to celebrate Windows 10 launch day -- depending on your circumstances, you might be disappointed. Microsoft has detailed its rollout plans for the new operating system, and it notes that only Windows Insiders (aka beta testers) are likely to get Windows 10 on day one. If you're a regular user who reserved an upgrade, you'll likely have to wait as Microsoft deploys the new software in gradually larger "waves" until everyone can hop aboard. Big companies and schools who pay for Windows licenses in bulk, meanwhile, won't get their copies until August 1st. In either case, you'll get a heads-up if your system isn't quite ready. The cautious approach is understandable given the sheer scope of what Microsoft is doing ("millions" of people are going to get a major OS for free), but it's not so hot if you want to be the first on your block to make the leap.
