Over a long enough period of time Pong might
well be
re-visioned into just about anything, but our new
favorite to date is the Pong clock. It plays a random game of Pong that goes on for 24 hours at a time — right side
wins every minute, left side wins every hour. We're scratching everything else off our list this year — this is the
only thing we want.


 P.S. Don't forget to check out the movie [MOV].
