 
As excited we are that Zac Efron's summertime flick Charlie St. Cloud is coming to Blu-ray November 9 (and we're really excited) the main reason we're mentioning this one is it's the second flick by Universal to offer buyers their choice of bonus movies viewable through internet streaming. Lorenzo's Oil and What Dreams May Come (also like the Get Him to the Greek deal because both films have not yet been released on Blu-ray) can stream to viewers TVs via their BD-Live connected Blu-ray player or to another device on the pocketBLU app for iOS, Blackberry, Android, Windows and Macintosh hardware. We're still not sure what to make of streaming video as the new big thing for BD-Live, but if these implementations work better than the buggy implementation included on the Wolfman Blu-ray, then free extras are always welcome.
