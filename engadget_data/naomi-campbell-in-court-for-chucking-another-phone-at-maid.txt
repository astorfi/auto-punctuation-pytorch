 Naomi Campbell isback in US court for allegedly chucking her (unspecified, dambit) cellphone at her housekeeper. Now this isn't thefirst time she's been accused of such nastiness, mind you. One year ago to the day, in a case which is apparently stillpending, Ms. Campbell was accused of smacking her PAaround with a Blackberry in LA even after pleading guilty to bashing another assistant with a telephone in Torontoback in 2001. Tsk tsk. Naomi claims that the housekeepers' 4-staple wound on the back of her head was self-inflicted(right honey, we've heard thatbefore) in retaliation for being fired earlier in the morning for suspected theft. The maid, on the other hand,claims the super-duper-model was in a tail-spin over not being able to find her favorite jeans to wear on Oprah.Whatever the truth is, it's hard to feel any sympathy for a woman who argues that her $3,500 bail was an"insult" due to her extraordinary wealth. Anyone taking bets on how long it will take before the purported weapon finds its way to eBay?
