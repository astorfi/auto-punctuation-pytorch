While Microsoft has long had its own retail chain, the success of those string of retail outlets has been occasionally debated -- just like the dancing moves of its employees. Still, the company has continually pledged to continue their roll-out and, today, that effort got a major boost. Microsoft and Best Buy are partnering to launch over 600 instances of a "store-within-a-store," 1,500 to 2,200 square-foot installations within BBY's big boxes that will host Microsoft specialists to "create a superior customer experience at scale." The first stores open today in some markets, with the rest opening by September. This includes 500 through the US and a further 105 in Canada (some in Best Buy, some in Future Shop). Can the Geek Squad cadets buck up and handle these new responsibilities? Stay tuned to find out.
