The folks at This is my next got a blurry picture of a new handset that may be the Within, Sprint's variant of Sammy's flagship device. The shot shows a phone with more rounded corners than the GS II, and a vertical camera / flash alignment instead of the side-by-side configuration found on the original. We can't say for sure if this is Sprint's next star in the Android universe, but here's hoping it means that the finest Galaxy S phone is landing stateside soon.
