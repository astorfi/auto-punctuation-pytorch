Even better, however, is the little trick to dismount the drive sled and replace the 20 or 60GB 1.8-inch drive with another more capacious model (as we heard you would be able to). One adventurous modder upped his unit to 120GB; see, maybe that $500 model can be of some use to us after all.[Via PS2-SCENE and Engadget Japanese, thanks Christofer and Anno]Read - dissectionRead - drive upgrade
