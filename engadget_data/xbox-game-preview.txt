Microsoft has announced a new early access program for independent titles, called Xbox Game Preview. With this service, you'll have the ability to play games that are in active development and provide feedback about them to their creators -- similar to what Steam currently does with its community. Xbox Game Preview is expected to roll out later today on Xbox One, featuring indies such as The Long Dark, Sheltered, Elite: Dangerous, Day Z and more. This is yet another move by Microsoft to further support the ID@Xbox program, which it's been focused on growing since its introduction in 2013.
