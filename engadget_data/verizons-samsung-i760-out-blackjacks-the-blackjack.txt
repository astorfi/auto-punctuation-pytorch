Roc A Fella and HTC Kid have again hooked us up with some details on the CDMA rendition of its i760 Pocket PC phone, taking on a decidedly different appearance from its GSM cousin by pushing the keypad to the right and the directional pad to the left. It looks like Verizon is all lined up to get this bad boy come Q2 of next year, packing a little next-gen Windows Mobile action in the process (though what we've seen so far suggests it ain't much more than a reskin). Specs (for those who can't be bothered to peep the image) include 128MB of ROM and 64MB of RAM, 802.11b / g, microSD expansion, and a sliding QWERTY keypad. Mix in just a touch of that glorious EV-DO broadband, and it looks like we've got yet another winner in Verizon's '07 bumper crop -- if Crossbow stays on schedule, that is.[Thanks, htckid]
