Their new S7 shares roughly the same dimensions as the S10, but trims down just a bit to 42 x 30 x 9.6-mm / 15-grams by doing away with the screen in favor of a full-panel D-click interface. So instead of buttons, or gawd forbid a display, you get a virgin white face plate which you can cover with any sticker of your choosing -- including chicken-goats and pissing dogs if that's how you roll. The S7 brings 1GB of flash, FM radio, 9 hour battery, and support for MP3, ASF, OGG, and all the WMA you can throw at it -- yeah, PlaysForSure too we presume. The S7 hits live for Korea (only in brown) starting tomorrow for an estimated 89,000KRW or $96. [Via Akihabara News]
