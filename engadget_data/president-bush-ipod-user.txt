Half of you are going to be stoked and half of you are going to be outraged to discover that George W. Bush is an
iPod owner (we're talking about Apple peeps versus non-Apple peeps, what'd you think we were referring to?). We know
you can't see his face in that photo, so you're going to have to take it on faith that's him, or at least check out the
photo essay by Christopher Morris about the Prez that we link to below.
