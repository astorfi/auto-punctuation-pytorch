 
You may not remember the Motorola ES400 announced back in June; it's the first device to run Microsoft's Windows Embedded Handheld platform, after all -- an offshoot of WinMo 6.5.3 -- and doesn't have a whole lot of relevance to the average consumer. Well, let this be your refresher: Sprint has revealed that it intends to launch its own version of the phone, the ES400S, through a variety of Sprint sales channels next month, marking the first time an enterprise-oriented Moto has been branded and offered directly by a carrier. It meets a variety of standards for ruggedness and includes a 3-inch VGA display, full QWERTY keyboard, 3.2 megapixel camera (which actually performs the barcode scanning duties, not a traditional laser scanner), 802.11a / b / g, GPS, and both CDMA with EV-DO Rev. A and GSM / HSPA for international use. You get a 1540mAh battery in the box, but a whopping 3080mAh unit is available separately if you plan on enterprisin' away from a charger for days on end. "Qualified" businesses will be able to get in on the ES400S starting sometime before the end of October for $499.99, while average Joes will have the option of paying $549.99 on a new two-year deal. Follow the break for the press release.
