Now it's the Korean outfit's Galaxy Stellar making the internet rounds yet again, though there's a little more information attached this time around. Per Droid Life, Sammy's purported Verizon-bound Galaxy Stellar will be joining the carrier's LTE-equipped smartphone lineup with a $100 price tag (of course, that's assuming you sign a two-year deal) and is, as you can see above, said to be carrying an "easy-to-use" Starter mode to help folks get started, plus a compact design that "fits comfortably in hands." Most notably, however, are the tidbits flaunting Amazon apps rather than, say, the Android maker's Play offerings -- an interesting plug, to say the least. At this point nothing's quite set in stone, so we'll have to wait for more details to spill before making any assumptions.
