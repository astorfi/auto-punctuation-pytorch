Sure, the year might be winding down, but the folks at Evernote have still managed to sneak in another update for their Android app. By wielding the upgraded application, users can edit notes without fear of losing text styling they've applied in the program on other platforms, and view attachments in-line with their digital scrawlings. External keyboard support has been baked in as well, alongside recognition for key shortcuts for creating notes, bullets, numbered lists and to-do entries. With the refreshed software, enterprise users can even access their business notes from the home screen and select a preferred notebook for new jottings they create. To grab ahold of the app, head to the bordering source link.
