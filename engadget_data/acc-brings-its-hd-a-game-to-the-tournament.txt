 Pundits may be calling men's basketball in the ACC "weaker" this year than in the past, but the conference will be bringing the HD to you strong during its tournament. Between Raycom, ESPN and ESPN2, all the conference tournament games will be available in HD. This is a great way to start off the season that is March Madness, so consult the listing of local Raycom affiliates and the ACC Tournament schedule after the break and start planning your "sick" days early, folks!
