If recent smartphone launches have you reconsidering your carrier options, here's some 4G rollout info to throw into the mix. Unlike its rivals, Three is actively advertising its full LTE roadmap, focusing first on London, Birmingham, Manchester and Reading, which it hopes to switch on before the end of the year. Its plans for 2014 are much more expansive, however, with a total of 42 cities set to go live, covering 98 percent of the country by 2015. Although it'll launch some months after its rivals, the carrier may scoop up customers with a promise not to charge extra for 4G data. Finally, as to whether Three will eventually change its name to Four, the company still isn't saying.
