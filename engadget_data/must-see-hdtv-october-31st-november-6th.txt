 

The World Series is finally over and TV schedules have settled into their normal fall pace. Fox has its lineup set and is finally ready to air new episodes of Bones again, while those waiting more Blu-ray 3D movies have several to choose from. Both the Toy Story and Shrek series come home in the format this week along with the debut of Cars 2, and Uncharted 3 offers 3D support on the gaming side. Look below for the highlights this week, followed after the break by our weekly listing of what to look out for in TV, Blu-ray and videogames.

Update: Commenter Bervick reminds us the Steve Jobs - One More Thing special airs on PBS November 2nd. Check the official site for airtimes on your local station.

Burn Notice
If you listen to the HD podcast, then you know this is one of our favorite shows. Michael Westin is a "burned" spy who bides his time trying to get back into the CIA by picking up odd jobs helping people around Miami Macguyver-style. Throw in a best friend played by Bruce Campbell and a health assortment of explosions and gunfire, and you've got everything we could ask for -- except better picture quality, but you can't have everything.
(November 3rd, USA, 10PM)

LSU vs. Alabama
This is what we like the most about college football. We're deep enough into the season that a 1 vs 2-ranked matchup actually means something and we couldn't have two better teams ready to face off. Both have won national championships, both are incredibly talented and well coached. Who will win? we'll have to watch to find out.
(November 5th, CBS, 8PM)

Hell on Wheels
So far AMC's switch from broadcasting classic movies to mixing in original programming has had its standout successes (Mad Men, Breaking Bad), and disappointments in The Killing and The Walking Dead. Sunday night it launches its latest effort, Hell on Wheels, which follows a former Confederate soldier hunting down the Union soldiers responsible for killing his wife. The name comes from the Nebraska town he ends up in along his quest that follows the construction of the railroad across the country. An interesting concept to be sure, but we'll have to lay our eyes on it to know which category this one falls into -- check out a trailer embedded after the break.
