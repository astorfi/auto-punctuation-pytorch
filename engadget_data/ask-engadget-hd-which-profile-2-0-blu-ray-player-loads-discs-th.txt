We're hoping Mick's question enables us to compile some pretty meaningful data, so break out the stopwatch and contribute! "Which current Blu-ray player (Profile 2.0, of course) has the quickest load time? I'm looking for something that loads much faster than my BDP-S300. Manufacturers don't bother listing load times on their decks, so I'm looking for some help from the audience." You heard the man -- we want model name, startup time and disc load times, along with any other tidbits you feel like tossing in. Get to it, partners.Got a burning question that you'd love to toss out for Engadget HD (or its readers) to take a look at? Tired of Google's blank stares when you ask for real-world experiences? Hit us up at ask at engadgethd dawt com and keep an eye on this space -- your inquiry could be next.
