 This morning, Yahoo brought out a pair of new mobile apps to help broaden its mobile presence and fall in line with its recent redesign campaign. First up on the list is Mail, which currently is no stranger to smartphones but is now available in all its tablet-optimized glory on Android slates and iPads. Also added to the Yahoo portfolio is a Flickr-integrated Weather app for iPhone and iPod touch, which allows you to look at user-submitted pictures of the weather in the city or region you're checking out. Want your image to be gazed upon by millions of admirers? Upload them to the Project Weather Flickr Group and there's a solid chance you'll get featured. Head below to the source for the full scoop.
