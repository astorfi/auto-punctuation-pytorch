 
Still pining for one of the best Windows 7 tablets we've seen to date? Yeah, we're talking about the 11.6-inch ExoPC. Well, we've got nothing but good news: the company's still on track for a September release and has been putting the finishing touches on the Windows 7, Intel Atom-powered slate. According to some new videos posted by the company, the tablet's been upgraded with a new LCD that appears to have much better viewing angles than the one we checked out at Computex. Additionally, the Canadian team's been doing some stand-up work on an e-book app. As you can see in the video beyond the break (more can be found there in the source link), it's got a simple interface, snazzy page flip animations and it looks fairly easy to import a book on your own. It's all lookin' quite good to us. Not that we're trying to rush this heat wave or anything, but is it September yet?
