Is a particular email experience reason enough to switch smartphones, or even platforms? For me, the answer was yes. I recently retired my iPhone 4s and began using the native Android Gmail app on an HTC One. Why? Here are just two reasons: I can archive or respond to emails from the lock screen (thanks, Jelly Bean), and the One's 4.7-inch display allows for a more encompassing view of my 70-some-odd labels. Needless to say, email is super important to me. So when Acompli launched last week with the tagline "iPhone Email Just Got a Promotion," I decided to wipe the dust off my 4s and take it for a spin.





 The fundamental difference between Acompli and Mailbox or Gmail is that it has three integrated hubs: "Calendar," "Files" and "People," each with its own tab at the bottom of the screen. Pull up the calendar and you're greeted with a quasi-agenda view, similar to what you'll find in iOS 7. There, you can add dates to any imported calendar without leaving the app. Switching between tabs isn't much faster than bouncing between different applications, but I've noticed the pure convenience causes me to glance through my schedule much more than before, which is a wonderful thing. From the People and File hubs I can sort through -- you guessed it -- contacts and files included in recent email conversations. Essentially, they both provide a clean approach to filtering through the content of your emails. For example, earlier this morning I shared several sheet music PDFs (originally sent from my wife) with other band members without having to dig through the email itself. Nifty.
