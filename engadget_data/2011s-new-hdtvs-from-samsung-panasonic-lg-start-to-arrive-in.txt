CNET's David Katzmaier has tweeted about finding a few Samsung and Panasonic models at various retailers already, though as usual it's the lower end models that are coming in first -- if you want a top of the line Panasonic VT30 instead of a 720p 3D Samsung D490 plasma (51-inch, $969), you'll have to wait. Still, it's good to ballpark what you'll have to budget and while HDGuru has followed up on previous Panasonic pricing leaks with MAP and specs for most of Samsung's line, cj1319 on AVSForum has early details on minimum advertised prices on LG's Nano LED lit LCDs & plasmas. Check the source links below for all the details, but don't expect any help from us while you're scraping together 10 g's for the 72-inch 72LZ9700 LG LCD pictured above.
