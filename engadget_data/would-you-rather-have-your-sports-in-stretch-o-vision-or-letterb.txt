 Going back through the files,we noticed that Canada's The Score announced last week they werelaunching the nation's first HD sports channel that is widescreen 24/7. They're achieving this by stretching any 4x3 SDcontent to fit a widescreen frame, much like TNT does, no word if its the exact same technology.They will beunveiling native HD content (no stretch-o) during the NBA playoffs, but till then, do you prefer the way ESPN (andpresumably TSN also?) does SD. or do you want full frame upconversion, no matter what the distortion?
