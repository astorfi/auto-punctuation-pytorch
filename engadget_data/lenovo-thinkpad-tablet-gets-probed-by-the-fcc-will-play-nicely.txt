When it arrived, it was dragged into the FCC's underground bunker and subjected to horrifying experiments by our boys in blue lab coats. Turns out they were looking to see what kind of gear it was packing. They stumbled upon a Qualcomm Gobi 3000, which will happily connect to AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile's 3G internet (nothing faster, though). To show there were no hard feelings, the FCC approved the Tablet and handed it a carton of juice before sending it on its way.
