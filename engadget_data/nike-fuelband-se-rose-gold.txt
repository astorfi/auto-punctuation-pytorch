The Nike+ FuelBand SE is still a pretty young product, having only been officially released earlier this month. Now, as part of its new Metaluxe Collection, Nike is introducing a special edition model in a Rose Gold hue. This shiny but subtle FuelBand SE will be up for grabs beginning on November 21st for $169, making it $20 pricier than the Sports Pack, which includes the Total Crimson, Pink Foil and Volt colors. Those of you interested should be grabbing one stat -- Nike says the Rose Gold FuelBand is set to be available "in limited quantities" when it goes on sale next week. And hey, we know at least one person who will want one.
