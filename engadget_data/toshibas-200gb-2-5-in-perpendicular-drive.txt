In the last month, Seagate dropped that big bad 750GB 'cuda while Hitachi slipped us their 5400RPM, 160GB 2.5-incher. Now, Toshiba announces their MK2035GSS which packs in 200GB of 2.5-inch SATA disk spinning at 4200RPM with a 150MB/sec transfer rate and 12-millsecond mean seek time. No word on price, but you can expect 'em to drop for mass production in August hitting your favorite laptop soon thereafter.[Via Impress Watch]
