Well, they've gone ahead and confirmed that the camera's coming to the US and were even kind enough to bless us with a date and price for their new "mainstream" DSLR. The $700 DSLR-A200K kit comes with the body and a DT 18-70mm f3.5-5.6 3.9x zoom lens, while the $900 DSLR-A200W includes the camera body, the aforementioned lens, and a 75â€“300mm f4.5-5.6 lens. Strangely, there's no mention of a body-only option. Both models ship in February but you eager beavers out there can place your pre-orders online starting tomorrow. Go on, git!
