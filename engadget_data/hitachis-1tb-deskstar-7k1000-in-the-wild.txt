 There are many things in life you can't ever have enough of; money, gadgets and of course hard drive space. In the ever going space race Hitachi dropped the next big step in storage capacity last month. With this much storage space you can store 250,000 songs or 1,000 hours of SDTV or 250 hours of HDTV or 333,300 photos or even 520 iTunes music store movies, of course they don't have that many and if they did who could afford all of them?
