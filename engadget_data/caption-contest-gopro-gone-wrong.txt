 Don: "GoPro Hero." Darren: "Amateurs gonna hate." Billy: "I see your 3D and raise you another 5D. 8D is where it's at." Jon: "I'm so liveblogging this. And Instagramming this. And..." Brian: "Someone take a picture of my weird helmet thing! What do you mean you don't have a camera?" Brad: "Hey bullies! I'm now twice the four-eyes you thought I was in high school. What have you done with your life?" Edgar: "From now on, you shall call me GoProusa." Tim: "Anybody have an SD card I can borrow?" Mat: *BATTERY LOW* Jamie: "Patent pending..." Christopher: "A&E Presents Helmet Hoarders: The GoPro Edition" Sharif: "HQ, are you seeing this?!" Myriam: "Go-Go-Gadget GoPro!"
