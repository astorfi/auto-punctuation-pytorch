You won't actually be able to see any of them at this very moment -- as it seems the website's images are down -- but the publication liberally praised the sharpness and lack of noise afforded by that F2 Fujinon lens, calling the X100 "right up there with the best APS-C sensor cameras on the market" in terms of image quality, and with "the best build quality of any camera that we've ever tested," too. Strong words, to be sure, but the camera's not without its quirks, including an obvious one -- that 23mm lens is fixed to the camera's front. Without a zoom, you'll need to get up close and personal with your subjects to get that perfect shot, and yet it also lacks a mechanical focus ring (it's a focus-by-wire affair here), which can make it difficult to quickly get your bokeh on. The publication remarks that both autofocus and manual focus are fairly slow, there's no manual option at all when recording videos, and focusing macro shots requires switching to a separate mode that switches off the optical viewfinder. Still, if you weren't sold at first sight, you probably are now. Kiss your tax refund goodbye, folks -- it's been spoken for.
