BTI is rolling out another in the very long line of iPod accessories. The Tunestir adds FM radio reception to the
iPod â€” the first accessory to do so. You can program in five of your favorite FM stations, and five stations to which
to transmit iPod audio, as well. The unit comes with an inline remote control with cable management features because,
for some reason, things that are portable also still need remotes. Tunestir is compatible with all iPod models hip to
the Dock Connector: 3G and 4G ipods, iPod minis, and the iPod photo. They'll ship out later in April for $69.95.
