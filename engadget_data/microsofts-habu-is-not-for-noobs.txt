The big news is that they've teamed up with Razer for this one, and the result is the Habu, a high-precision, 2,000 dpi laser mouse with interchangeable side button panels, high speed motion detection, and the ability to adjust DPI on the fly. Oh, and it's wired, too, doesn't sound like they're doing a wireless version, at least not yet. Should retail for $69.95 when it hits stores in October.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
