There's always hope for progress in this business, however, and given that LG already hinted at a new L-series phone in its earnings report, we're inclined to believe a leak that's just come in from Russian site Hi.tech.mail.ru. The pictures show a much softer-edged design with a dedicated SIM-switch button down below, in both black and white. In terms of specs, we're looking at a 2,460mAh battery that is said to last for two days, an 8-megapixel rear camera capable of 720p video and a 1GHz dual-core chip powering Android 4.1 with LG's custom UI on top. The Russian price of 12,990 rubles equates to around $430, which is a lot more than the $300 SIM-free price of the first L7 (not to mention a Nexus 4) -- but then these currency conversions are often wayward.
