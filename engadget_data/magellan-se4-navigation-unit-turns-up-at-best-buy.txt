Better still, Best Buy also looks to have knocked a full $60 off the MSRP right of the bat, bringing it down to just $119.99. That'll get you a 4.3-inch touchscreen, NAVTEQ maps of the 48 contiguous states, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, six million POIs, and text-to-speech and turn-by-turn voice prompts, but seemingly few other notable features to speak of -- not even so much as a memory card slot or MP3 playback, if Best Buy's listed specs are right.
