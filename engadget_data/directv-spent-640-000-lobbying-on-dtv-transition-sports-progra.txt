 Admit it -- you're curious as to how DirecTV plans on spending / investing that $363 million in pure, sweet net profit that it just raked in, aren't you? If Q3 is any indication, it'll spend at least a snippet of it lobbying Congress. A rather vague report from the AP indicates that the satcaster spent $640,000 last quarter lobbying "on the digital television transition, sports programming, taxes and other issues." Unfortunately, the details about what exactly it was lobbying for on those issues were casually left out, so we suppose it's up to our imaginations to figure out the rest. Or, you know, wait until something decisive goes down.[Image courtesy of DayLife]
