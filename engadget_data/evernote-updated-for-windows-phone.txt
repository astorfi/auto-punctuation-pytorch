 While some app developers seem to forget about Windows Phone, Evernote definitely has not. The tiled version of the cloud-based note taking app received an update on Thursday that brings an arsenal of new features, including an updated tile layout for note lists, a redesigned login / registration screen and user help tips. Perhaps the most anticipated new additions here are an improved note editing settings that adds more space to jot things down and a much welcomed performance boost. If your memory isn't quite what it used to be and you're looking for a helpful tool to take notes while on the go, you can snag the latest version of Evernote from the Windows Phone Store now. That is, if you can remember which tile to tap when trying to get there.
