 We've been hearing rumors about a possible Dell Tablet PC pretty much since the day the first Tablet PCs went on sale, is it finally going to happen now? None of this is officially confirmed or anything, but jkOnTheRun (which has tons of cred when it comes to this stuff) reports that Dell is probably going to roll out a Tablet PC sometime around September or October of this year and that it will most likely be a convertible-style Tablet based on the Latitude D420 and come with a widescreen display and optional WWAN.
