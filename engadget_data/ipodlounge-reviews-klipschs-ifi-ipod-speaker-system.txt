iPodlounge has a review of the
iFi (not "iffy", ya dig),
Klipsch's 2.1 channel iPod sound system thatÂ  combines an iPod dock and remote control with an eight-inch
subwoofer and two RSX-3 satellite speakers. Even though the unit they tested was just a pre-production version,
iPodlounge says that the iFi's audio quality is better than that of pretty much every other iPod-specific speaker
system. For $399, it better.
