Nintendo has just revealed its consolidated results for the April-June quarter, and they show a significant 3.8 percent decline in sales compared to the same quarter last year -- despite (or perhaps because of) the release of the semi-next-gen Wii U. This console sold just 160,000 units during the quarter, or less than half the number of units shifted between January and March. The company's original sales projections for the device, and its hope of selling nine million units by March 2014, are now a distant dream -- we're looking at a lifetime total of just 3.61 million sales. On a more positive note, however, it still managed to sell a million Wii U games, and 1.4 million 3DS handhelds. In addition, the year-over-year fall in revenue was much smaller than the one Nintendo suffered in Q2 2012, and its operating loss was much smaller too -- just under five billion yen in the red. Factoring in all the company's various sources of income, it managed to eke out a net profit of 8.6 billion yen, or $88 million, so there's some life in this playful old outfit yet.
