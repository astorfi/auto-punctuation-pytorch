The semi-pro body is significantly more sturdy and somewhat heavier than our in-house D90, though the rear LCD sure looks awfully similar. We're planning on giving the 12.3 megapixel CMOS sensor and 720p movie mode a go, but for now, feel free to peruse the gallery below to see exactly what a penny under $1,800 gets you in the DSLR world these days.
