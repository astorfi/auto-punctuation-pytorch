  With the retail launch of the Vita hardware comes the arrival of three augmented reality games, using a set of six cards that look an awful lot like the ESP test cards Dr. Venkman used in Ghostbusters. I downloaded them all from the PlayStation Store today, carefully set up a camera between my face and Vita (keeping the table in view) and demonstrated all three.Of the three, Fireworks is the definite standout. And by "standout" I mean "one I could foresee playing a second time."[Music: "Shanghai Moon" by USK]
