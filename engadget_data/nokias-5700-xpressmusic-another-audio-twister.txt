This UMTS S60 twister brings a 2 megapixel shooter with up to 2GB of MicroSD storage. The focus here, though, is music so it packs WM DRM support with a "dedicated audio chip" to keep the music flowing, integrated stereo speakers, Bluetooth A2DP, and 3.5-mm adapter to fit your favorite headphones. Hitting Europe in Q2 for a pre-VAT price of â‚¬350.
