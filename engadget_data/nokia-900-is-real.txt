It looks like the rumors were true: the AT&T exclusive phone is packing a 4.3-inch ClearBlack AMOLED 800 x 480 capacitive touchscreen, 512MB RAM and Mango. Camera-wise, there's an 8-megapixel camera 'round back with a 28mm f/2.2 Carl Zeiss lens (likely the same as on the Lumia 800) with a dual-LED flash and a front-facing f/2.4 wide-angle lens that's great for wide angle shots. The polycarbonate-bodied 900 has a single-core 1.4GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU inside, but the big surprise is that it's packing an LTE modem for all that high-speed internet goodness. There's a 1840mAH battery rated for seven hours talk and 300 standby. It'll arrive stateside in the next couple of months in those lovely black or cyan colors we've come to love from the 800 and no -- there's no word on pricing yet, but Stephen Elop did say Nokia would be "aggressive," make of that what you will folks. After the break we've got the full press release and the introduction video.
