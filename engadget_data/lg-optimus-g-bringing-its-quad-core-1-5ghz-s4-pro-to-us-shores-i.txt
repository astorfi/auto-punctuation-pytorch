 When it comes to LG's latest flagship, it appears there can be no shortage of official announcements. So, while the news from overseas may not be quite so fresh, there's certainly nothing stale about the Optimus G. Today the company held a second celebration in honor of its powerhouse -- the first to pack Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4 Pro: a quad-core SoC clocked at 1.5GHz. Buffered by a heaping 2GB RAM and an Adreno 320 GPU this absolutely beastly device is officially coming to American shores in the fourth quarter of this year. The 4.7-inch phone may ship with some slightly different specs, depending on carrier, but they'll still find a home for the 1280 x 768 True HD, in-cell, IPS display. There's no specifics about carriers or pricing as yet, but we'll let you know when we do.

 Update: Hit the break for LG's Optimus G PR video.
