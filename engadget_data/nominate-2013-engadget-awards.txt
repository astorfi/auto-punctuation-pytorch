No, 2013 isn't a typo. With CES 2014 already behind us, it may seem silly to take a look back at the previous year in tech. But let's not get too ahead of ourselves -- 2013 brought plenty of innovative products, and we want to hear which were your favorites.


It's time for the 2013 Engadget Awards, so submit your nominations for the 12 categories below. You don't need to fill in a pick for each one, but make sure your selections are from the 2013 calendar year. (Helpful hint: just disregard anything from CES 2014, and you'll be good.) Nominations will be open until 11:59PM ET on Friday, March 7th, and then we'll narrow down your submissions to the most popular picks for final voting. Now, get to it!
