Apple could be looking to buttress its iPhone range considerably over the next year by adding larger 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch models and a cheaper, $99 handset with a wider range of colors, according to sources from Reuters. The media outlet added that the moves are still under discussion, but represent an attempt to gain back share from arch-competitor Samsung, which has flooded the market with so-called phablets like the Galaxy Note II along with a wide range of inexpensive handsets -- neither of which Apple currently makes. That jibes with earlier rumors of a budget, plastic-bodied iPhone, and CEO Tim Cook didn't exactly deny it when asked if the company was interested in large-screen phones. Still, the manufacturing sources said it's unclear whether the company will actually proceed with any of those plans -- meaning the information should be taken with a very large dose of salt.


Update: We reached out to Reuters for a little more clarification on the $99 price for the lower-end device. While they're unsure, they believe that to be a subsidized price.
