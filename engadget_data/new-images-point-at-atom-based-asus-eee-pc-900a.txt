As confident as we are that ASUS wouldn't dare hesitate to dilute its once meaningful Eee moniker even further, we're still taking this with a morsel or two of salt for now. Spotted on French site Blogeee, a host of new images depict the Eee PC 900 (with a design occasionally preferred over the 901) with an "A" bringing up the rear. It doesn't take an Intel engineer to guess what that might mean, now does it?[Via thegadgetsite, thanks K.C.]
