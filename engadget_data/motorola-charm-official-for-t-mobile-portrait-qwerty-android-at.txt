The phone features a full portrait QWERTY keyboard placed directly below a 2.8-inch landscape touchscreen, but for most operations, you don't have to touch it if you don't want to because you've also got a touchpad mounted on the back of the phone (the so-called "Backtrack") much like AT&T's Backflip. Not only is this the first widely-launched Android phone to employ such a form factor, it's also the first to run Android 2.1 with Blur -- and interestingly, they've carried over the old version's general look and feel rather than going with the Droid X's updated skin. It's got a 3 megapixel camera (with Kodak co-branding, something we haven't seen on a Moto in a long time), WiFi, and a noise-canceling second microphone. Pricing and availability haven't been announced, but T-Mobile customers can expect it "this Summer."
