Nuance isn't letting SwiftKey's customizable keyboard layouts go unanswered. The company has just launched Swype 1.6, a big update to its Android add-on that provides a similar amount of control. Users with giant phones can choose separate mini keyboards for both landscape and portrait views, and exacting typists can either fine-tune the dimensions or pick a secondary language. There's also a pair of upgrades for those who don't like to type at all -- Swype now offers both continuous dictation as well as support for voice recognition in a different language than the keyboard. Whatever your input preferences, you can buy a fresh copy of Swype 1.6 for $4 from either Google Play or the Amazon Appstore.
