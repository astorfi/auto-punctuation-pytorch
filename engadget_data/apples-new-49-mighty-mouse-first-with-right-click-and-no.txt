It's been a couple of years since Apple had any
significant updates to their peripheral line, but it looks like they've finally bumped that Optical Pro Mouse and
changed a few key things. Namely that after more than 20 years they've released their first two button device. (Man,
Jobs must be feeling rather risky in his advancing yearsâ€”or maybe it's two buttons to match their new x86 processors.)
But it's actually a "no-button" device, since the input on the Mighty Mouse is done with capacitative sensors, like a
touchpad; they didn't just stop there. You've got a "scroll ball" up on top, and left and right "squeeze" buttons, too.
$49, friends, and it'll play on your PC just as nicely.
