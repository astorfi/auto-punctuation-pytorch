All these dozens of images purport to show the future of the platform, netbooks and nettops with HDMI outputs, but there's not a single blinking LED showing signs of life. For all we know these devices could be empty shells holding only the crushed hopes and dreams of hardware engineers worldwide. The laptop pictured above is especially discouraging, showing a misaligned HDMI port peeking out of a distinctively VGA-shaped hole, partially blanked with white plastic. We want to believe in ION, but it's going to take a little more than this.
