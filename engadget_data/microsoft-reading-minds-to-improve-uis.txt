According to the patent application, Microsoft believes that "human beings are often poor reporters of their own actions," and that properly filtered and classified EEG data provides a "less interruptive and more informative technique of determining   user interface effectiveness." The patent also describes using the brain state data in real time to adapt the interface to the user, which sounds like it could be a revolution or a terrifying mashup of Clippy and the Lawnmower Man. No word on whether Redmond is already using this tech, but that new Zune interface certainly looks pretty slick, doesn't it?[Via New Scientist]
