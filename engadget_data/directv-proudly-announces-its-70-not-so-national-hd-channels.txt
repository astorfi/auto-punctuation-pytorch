But we still feel the need to continually de-spin their press releases. We'll be the first to admit we're splitting hairs, but important ones at that. The problem lies in the word National, especially when they count channels that are considered local in just about every other context -- including on DirecTV's own website. How can a channel be considered national when it's only available in certain markets and not nationally? The other point of contention is counting regional sports networks and eight HD PPV channels. So while we're not complaining about all the HD goodness, we're sticking with our count of 47 national HD channels, which is really crazy when you think about it.
