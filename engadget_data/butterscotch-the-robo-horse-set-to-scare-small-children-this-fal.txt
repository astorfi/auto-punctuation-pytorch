 So you might not be able to afford a real pony for your little princess this year, but you can get her thenext best thing in Hasbro's $300 Butterscotch My Furreal Friends Pony, a robotic pal due this fall that likes slumber parties and having its hairbrushed. The pony can whinny and snort in appreciation, move its eyes, ears and head, and swish its tail, and even goesfor a bit of carrot munching. She's even semi-ridable, by bouncing up and down when sat on. Unfortunately Butterscotchdoesn't go for the whole Mr. Ed talking shtick, but we're sure your 5 year old will find plenty to love, and you'llfind plenty to be creeped out by.[Via MobileMag]
