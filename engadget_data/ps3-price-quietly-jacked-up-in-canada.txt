 It looks like the not insignificant price break Canadian gamers have been enjoying on the PlayStation 3 may have abruptly come to an end, with Future Shop, Best Buy, and other retailers now listing the 60GB console at $699.99 Canadian ($593US). The console had previously been selling for $649.99 Canadian which, at the current exchange rate, made it a full fifty bucks cheaper than the console's US retail price. While the new price is still a relative bargain compared to the premium our European friends have to fork over, given the unlikelihood of any price cuts in the near future, it looks like those that have been holding off on a purchase may well find themselves regretting their patience.
