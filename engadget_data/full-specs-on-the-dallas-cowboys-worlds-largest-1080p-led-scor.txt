 
It's been far too long since we heard about the Dallas Cowboys' new stadium w/ accompanying gigantic four-sided HD scoreboard (and far too long before the 2009 season when it opens). Mitsubishi apparently thinks its the one to drop in new details, since it's their Diamond Vision technology (also soon to be seen at the new Yankee Stadium) powering the worlds largest 1080p LED displays, and we're in no position to argue. What can we say, exact specs on HD screens totaling nearly 13,000 sq ft make us weak. Check after the break for the full details before they're scheduled to turn on June 1, 2009.
