 We've already seen hints that Sony wants to rejuvenate its entry-level interchangeable lens cameras. Purported press images snagged by Digicam Info, however, support talk what could be an evolutionary yet meaningful refresh. The Alpha A58 you see above appears to only have minor ergonomic tweaks, but introduces a truly standard hot shoe and a new 18-55mm, f/3.5-5.6 II kit lens. The sighting backs earlier Sony Alpha Rumors claims, which also had the A58 carrying a roughly 20-megapixel sensor. A second set of pictures from DI (an example of which is after the break) also validates a previous live leak of the NEX-3N mirrorless cam, whose centerpiece is still its motorized zoom control. Neither Sony camera has a leaked release date, although the increasing flow of details suggests there isn't much more of a wait.
