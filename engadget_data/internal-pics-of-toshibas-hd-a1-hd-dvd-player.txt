 There is a bit of curiosityin all of us. Even if you don't know how the heck it works, you still would love to see the insides of one of the newToshiba's HD-A1 HD DVD players. AVS Forum user Zerokills just got his hands on his player and cracked it open as soonas he could. (original AVS Forumthread) There are some sweetpics. Got to tell you that we learned somethings from these pics. First off, it seems to be very well built. TheHD-A1 also has 1 gig of DDR2700 and the main processor has a heat piped cooling system. Check 'em out. Let us know your firstimpression.[Thanks for the tip Mark]
