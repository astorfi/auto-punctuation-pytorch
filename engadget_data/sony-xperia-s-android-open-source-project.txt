According to Sony, AOSP Technical Lead Jean-Baptiste Qu√©ru considers the effort a success, but the device is being taken off the project's roadmap so Mountain View can focus on its own hardware. Currently, an AOSP build boots on the Xperia S hardware with support for SD-Cards, Wi-Fi and its built-in sensors. Audio and the phone's modem are also operational, but they require proprietary binaries Hirai and Co. can't publish just yet. Work on polishing the handset's vanilla Android experience isn't over, however. Sony has moved the code to its GitHub account and is welcoming developers to pitch in and help with the open source effort.
