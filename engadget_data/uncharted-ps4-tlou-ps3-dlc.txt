Sony didn't waste any time at its PlayStation 4 launch event, coming right out of the gate with news from Naughty Dog about two of the biggest franchises. Uncharted is coming to the PlayStation 4, and while not much information has been revealed, there is a short teaser trailer complete with vengeful voiceover and treasure map for you to watch. For your PS3 gaming needs, the developer also showed off new "Left Behind" single player DLC coming to its hit The Last of Us, with Ellie apparently taking over the lead role. There's a video for that one too, check out both embedded after the break, or head straight for the live stream to see what else is coming up.
