The company has just launched the Lou Reed X10i Signature Edition headphones ("coming soon"), a glittered-up version of the X10i that we already feel head over heels in love with. Outside of aesthetics, there's nothing significant changing here, but the extra $50 will net you a purple inline remote (compatible with Apple's iOS devices), a screened Lou Reed autograph, a 360-degree mic and a sense of gratification that could only be matched by being elected president of the free world. Or, something like that. Hit the source for a full helping of specifications, but it's on you to find a safe and legal method for acquiring $399.95.
