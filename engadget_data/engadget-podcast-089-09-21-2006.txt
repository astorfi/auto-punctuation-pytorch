             Welcome to the new Engadget everyone! We're sure you've all gotten well acquainted with the new site by now, but if you're at all interested in hearing Pete and Ryan ramble on about the back story and new features, you've come to the right podcast. Oh, but there's news, too. Puh-lenty going on in the portable media world as last week Apple announced their new slew of iPods, Microsoft finally announced the Zune, and SanDisk got together with Real. Oh, and videogame news, too: Nintendo announced the Wii, and Microsoft made their announcement of the Xbox 360 HD DVD drive. Yeah, it was a busy week over at Engadget HQ, which is why we're looking forward to our meetup in Boston. Come on out, kick back a beer with Engadget, you know you want to!
