 
Want some of that colorful, homescreen-juggling, Android 2.1 Sense UI that HTC has prepped for the HTC Desire? Well, the previously promised hacked ROM is ready for your Nexus One's consumption. It's in alpha right now, so install at your own risk, and does indeed support Flash 10.1, so also beware of the risk of browsing the real internet. What more danger, excitement, and grassroots handset support could you possibly want out of life? Hit up the source link for the full instructions, video of the ROM in action is after the break.
