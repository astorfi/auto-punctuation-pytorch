When we received an invitation for a Samsung event "around health" a few weeks ago, our thoughts immediately leapt to a potential health-centered product, perhaps either a new wearable or an updated app. Since then, we've heard tell that there would be no such announcements at all. Which, given that the event is set up by Samsung's Strategy and Innovation Center -- known more for components and partnerships -- is not entirely surprising. Still, the fact that the event is now dubbed "Voice of the Body" and will be held at the SFJazz Center makes us intrigued as to what Samsung has planned for the "future of health." Thankfully, the company has provided us a livestream of the event, which starts at 10:30 a.m. PT/1:30 p.m. ET. You can tune into it after the break.
