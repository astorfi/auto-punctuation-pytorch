 It's been almost four months since we first (and last) heard about Marshall's special edition Hanwell HiFi speaker, but today the renowned amp maker announced its sleek system is finally ready to hit shelves in various areas around the globe. The Marshall Hanwell amp / speaker combo's set to be available in Europe, Japan and the US for a cool $800, which will give interested at-home rockstars a package that's a "carefully crafted machine, designed to attain that trademark Marshall tone" and that produces "super lows, and hi-fi tweeters yield sharp extended highs, rendering the sound sharp and clear, like sitting in the front row." You'll have to tap on the source link below quick if you're looking to snag one for yourself, though, as Marshall has already said it'll only have about 10,000 units up for grabs.

   THE SOUND OF HANWELL

   Delivering a sound that resonates with the presence and power of live music, the Hanwell is a carefully crafted machine, designed to attain that trademark Marshall tone. Its dual long-throw woofers produce super lows, and hi-fi tweeters yield sharp extended highs, rendering the sound sharp and clear, like sitting in the front row.   HOW IT LOOKS

   The Hanwell is housed in a wooden cabinet and clad in black vinyl. It features an analog power switch and controls for volume, bass and treble. The fret cloth and gold logo on the front are borrowed from vintage Marshall amplifiers. The body is outlined with gold piping for a celebratory effect.

   As a tribute to Marshall's 50-year legacy, each Hanwell is branded with a numbered anniversary edition commemorative badge.   TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
