Following up on months of leaks and rumors, we've got yet another snippet of evidence pointing towards a VZW release of the so-called Motorola Shadow. Spotted here in the carrier's inventory database, the MB810 moniker aligns perfectly with that WiFi certification we saw earlier in the month. Combine that with the fact that this is definitely some sort of Motorola smartphone, and you've got everything you need to start pinching those pennies for a June / July debut. Oh, you already threw down a Benjamin for Memorial Day grub? Good luck with that return policy.
