The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Meyer's hesitation, particularly towards tablets, may have cost him the job, and that the company pressured him into resignation after he showed disinterest in mobile devices at this year's CES. Sounds familiar to us, but we still don't expect any sex scandals or fraudulent reports out of this one.
