These pictured tablets give us a better look at the rear-facing buttons we heard about last week, which appear to be a power button and a volume rocker. The smaller sibling sports the same "Fleming" moniker we saw in yesterday's images, the same 8.2-inch screen size as previously reported, and appears to be about as thick as a 9.3mm iPhone 4. Combining with This is My Next's intel, it appears that both tablets are of very similar thickness. Around back? A few stickers, again spelling out the smaller tablet's codename and outing LTE compatibility.

Interestingly, our tipster tells us that both slates share the Fleming codename, along with Android 3.2 goodness and five-megapixel HD cameras on the rear, though both prototypes are also "buggy as all hell, with frequent reboots and crashes." This could mean that we're still some time away from seeing the original Xoom's successors, so for now, check out our gallery below to get an eyeful for yourself.

Update: Our tipster has confirmed LTE for both devices.
