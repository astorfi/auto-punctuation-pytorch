Beyond the security of our personal information, the most important question is when service might be restored and he reiterates Sony expects to have "some services" up and running within a week from yesterday. When it comes to the most important personal information like credit card numbers, there are assurances that the credit card database was encrypted and there is no evidence anything was taken, but that's a possibility that still cannot be ruled out completely. To keep things secure, Gamasutra reports game developers are getting new SDKs with updated security features as well. When the service comes back up, expect a mandatory system update that requires a new password before getting back to your Mortal Kombat or Portal 2-related plans.

Update: Sony posted Q&A #2 with a few more details addressing custom compensation. Regarding a "goodwill gesture," Sony says, "We are currently evaluating ways to show appreciation for your extraordinary patience as we work to get these services back online." The company is also working on a "make good" plan for gamers with a subscription to the PS3 MMOs DC Universe Online or Free Realms, details of which are coming soon.
