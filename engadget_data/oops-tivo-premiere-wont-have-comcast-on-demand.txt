And double-oops: that other interesting screenshot with "Friends Recommend" on the Browse screen is also a mockup, meaning our hopes for some social-media integration have also been dashed, at least for now. Oh well. Let's hope our forthcoming Premiere review units can somehow turn these frowns upside-down.
