Computer Choppers started working on the project a few months before the movie premiere last year, and while they missed the launch by about a year, we wholeheartedly forgive them. The steel case includes room for four HDDs, and powers the large black LCD that the modder seemed to find "necessary" to complete the look. We're sure the Dark Knight would be proud.
