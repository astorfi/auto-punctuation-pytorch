We've seen a lot of big time box office hits this holiday season on Blu-ray, and while some of them were science fiction movies, not many of them have an IMDB score of 8.4 like District 9 does. This is one of those movies we wish we would've caught in the theater and we won't wait any longer to enjoy this one at home in HD.
