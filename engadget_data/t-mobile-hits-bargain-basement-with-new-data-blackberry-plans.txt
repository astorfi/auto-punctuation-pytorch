Unlimited mobile Internet and T-Mobile HotSpot service now totals just $19.95 a month on top of your voice plan -- a boon for just-unlocked iPhones, we'd say -- while BlackBerry pricing has taken a similar plunge, running just $10 a month for unlimited email on what T-Mobile is apparently positioning as an "entry-level" plan. Bring on the HSDPA 1700, T-Mobile, and we're so there.[Via RCR News, thanks Mike B.]
