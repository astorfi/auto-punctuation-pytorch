Of course, we've already seen the unit acquire Bluetooth and rave lights, but the latest edition doubles as a Bluetooth dongle and provides an extra two USB 2.0 ports to daisy chain your favorite USB-powered gadgetry to your PC. Not a whole lot of reasons to upgrade to this one if you're a proud (or shameful) owner of past iterations, but if you've been looking for the least expensive way to convert your non-BT-enabled machine into one that speaks Bluetooth, all while finding a device that reads and writes to T-Flash, IBM MD, MAGICSTOR, and SDHC (just to name a few), Brando's whiz-bang conglomerate will run you just $29.
