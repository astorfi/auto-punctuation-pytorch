 By all accounts, Samsung's Galaxy Note II has been a massive success. The oversized smartphone has now made its way into the hands of more than one million consumers in South Korea, just a month after Samsung announced that global sales had exceeded five million units. At that pace, the smartphone maker is reportedly on track to move 10 million Note IIs within four to five months of its late-September launch, compared to the nearly 10 months that it took to meet that milestone with the device's predecessor. LG is also reporting similar domestic sales for its aging 5-inch Optimus Vu, so if you've taken the plunge on either 5+ inch behemoth, it looks like you're in good company.
