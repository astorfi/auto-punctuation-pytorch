 Working to be an even more pocketable pocket camcorder, Sanyo's shrunk the front of its latest Xacti model to measure just 1.06 inches at its widest point while still recording 1080p video. The VPC-CS1 captures in MPEG-4 AVC / H.264 and is currently undergoing official certification to support iFrame. Images tout 8 megapixels, zoom up to 10x, and storage via SDXC cards. Release date and price? Let's just say February and a penny under $300.
