  The path to the executive apologies is paved with good intentions -- like the one issued today by Dave Morin. The Path CEO / co-founder posted a note apologizing for the contact sharing functionality that got his iPhone app in hot water. The letter titled, simply, "We're Sorry," outlines the company's focus on security (which it takes "very, very seriously") and the intended use for the feature, which uploaded user contact info to help connect people on the service. As a sign of good faith, the company will be deleting all of the uploaded information and making available version 2.0.6 of the service, which allows users to opt-in or out of contact sharing.
