Call it an ultramobile PC, call it Origami, whatever, it's a 779g (1.7 pound) 9 x 5.5 x 1-inchmini-tablet with a 7-inch touchscreen LCD, Celeron M ULV processor, 40GB drive, 512MB RAM, 802.11b/g, Bluetooth 2.0,GPS and DMB options (of course), and Windows XP Tablet with Touch Pack. Westill don't yet know a price or expected release on this, so expect yet another post on the Q1 in the near future, orat very least an update to this one.
