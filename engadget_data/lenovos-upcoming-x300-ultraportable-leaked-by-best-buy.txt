 Nothing much "official" at the moment, but Lenovo is prepping a laptop based on a low-voltage processor similar to that of the MacBook Air, which can only mean one thing: skinny laptop celebrity deathmatch. Lenovo's X300 will run on a SL7100 chip, which is apparently a 1.2GHz Core 2 Duo that fits into the same form factor of the 1.6GHz / 1.8GHz chip options for the MacBook Air. However, Lenovo saw it fit to squeeze a DVD-RW drive inside this 13.3-inch laptop, along with 64GB of SSD, all for a "reasonable" price of $2,744 -- at least, if Best Buy's leaked spec sheet is to be believed. The screen is also WXGA+, which we're assuming means 1440 x 900 instead of the 1280 x 800 MacBook Air. No word on a release date, but we hope it's soon -- that kid in Starbucks with the MacBook Air is giving us dirty looks.  [Via Electronista]Update: Looks like CDW is listing it "around" Tuesday, February 26th, if you want to take that into account. Thanks, Brendan.
