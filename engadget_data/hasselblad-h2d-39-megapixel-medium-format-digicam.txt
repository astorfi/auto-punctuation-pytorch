For pros that are usedto medium-format gear, an upgrade may well mean finding a way to justify buying a Hasselblad H2D-39, a 39-megapixelbehemoth that we assume is based on Kodak's previously announced 39-megapixel CCD(no CCD provider is listed in the specs, but Kodak makes other CCDs for Hassy and, really, how many 39-megapixelimagers are there?). The new camera includes new color-correction technology, a 2.2-inch OLED display and the abilityto work with tethered hard drives (after all, the RAW files this shoots are a whopping 78MB each). Hasselblad has alsoannounced three digital backs based on the same CCD, for use with Hasselblad H2 cameras. One version, the CF-39MS(Multi Shot), uses multiple exposures to improve color accuracy. Pricing on the H2D is expected to be about $31,000,with the backs going for similar prices, with the exception of the CF-39MS, which will go for close to $40,000. Allmodels are due out later this year. Start saving those pennies.[Thanks, Fino]
