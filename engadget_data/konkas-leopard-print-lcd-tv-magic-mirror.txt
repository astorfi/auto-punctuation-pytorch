 While we've seen a variety of magic mirrors in our day, we've yet to come across one with such a nifty premise, only to be completely and utterly ruined by a leopard print motif. Sure, the off-kilter design scheme might attract a few people still stuck in, well, whatever era leopard print was marginally acceptable in, but generally speaking, we're guessing most folks won't give it a second glance. Konka's Magic Mirror isn't a mirror by trade, but its vertically-mounted 42-inch LCD TV is directly wired to a webcam in the bezel, which can display whatever stands in front of it, theoretically accomplishing the same task as a tried and true mirror. Additionally, it can be used as a normal TV for viewing television, movies, etc., but considering its upright alignment, it's probably best reserved for digiframe duty. For the folks (read: one or two) out there wondering about the price, unfortunately we're not sure, but we'd suspect that you could darn near steal these things from Konka if you just let its stockpile collect a little dust for a few months first.[Via Uber-Review]
