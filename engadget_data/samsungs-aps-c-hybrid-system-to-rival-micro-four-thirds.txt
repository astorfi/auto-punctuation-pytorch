 Just weeks after Olympus and Panasonic launched the potentially revolutionary Micro Four Thirds system, in flies word that Samsung is looking to steal their thunder with a sure-to-be-incompatible alternative. Speaking at IFA in Berlin, Samsung Techwin executive vice president Byung Woo Lee confessed that the company was gearing up to introduce a new "interchangeable lens 'Hybrid' digital camera system." The first model in the still unnamed system would reportedly carry Sammy's own 14-megapixel APS-C sized CMOS sensor and a new lens mount, and while exact size specifications weren't disclosed, you can rest assured that the end product will aim to deliver DSLR-like results in a much more compact frame. As with the aforementioned Micro Four Thirds, this method will also utilize electronic viewfinders and a live rear LCD for framing, though we won't see anything on store shelves until early 2010. Talk about testing our patience.[Via 1001 Noisy Cameras]
