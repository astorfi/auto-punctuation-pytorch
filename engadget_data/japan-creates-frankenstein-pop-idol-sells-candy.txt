Nope, still creepy -- but at least its a new kind of creepy. Eguchi Aimi, a fictional idol girl created for a Glico candy ad, is comprised of the eyes, ears, nose, and other facial elements of girls from AKB48, a massive (over 50 members) all-female pop group from Tokyo. Aimi herself looks pretty convincing, but the way she never looks away from the camera makes our skin crawl ever so slightly. Check out the Telegraph link below to see her pitch Japanese sweets while staring through your soul.
