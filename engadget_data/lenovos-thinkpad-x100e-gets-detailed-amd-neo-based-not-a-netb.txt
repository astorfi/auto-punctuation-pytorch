Contrary to previous speculation, this one's not, it seems, a ThinkPad netbook, but an "entry ultraportable," which apparently means that it is small, thin and light just like a netbook, and has a "netbook-like price point" -- it's just... not a netbook. Less nebulous are the device's specs, which include an 11.6-inch, 1366 x 768 display, an AMD Athlon Neo processor, support for up to 4GB of RAM, up to a 320GB hard drive, optional 3G and GPS and, of particular note to some particular folks, a distinctly ThinkPad keyboard, trackpad and trackpoint. Still no indication of a release date just yet, but it looks like you will at least be able to get this one in your choice of black, red or white, despite its distinctly business-minded nature.
