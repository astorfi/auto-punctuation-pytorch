 It's close to a yearsince we first heard about Logic 3'splanned keyboard for the PSP. In that time, we naturally began to wonder if the product would ever see the light ofday, and now we have an answer: Logic 3 announced today that the product was being canceled, blaming Sony for notproviding information needed to produce it. Conspiracy theorists will no doubt have a field day with this one, and ifSony comes out with its own PSP keyboard in a few months, will certainly feel vindicated. In the meantime, if you werehoping for an easy way to enter text if you use your PSP for web surfing or other keyboard-heavy activities, your waitjust got a lot longer.
