We caught wind of the new XBR6 line at CES, along with the KDL-40Z4100 and the KDL-46Z4100, but apparently things are going to get much more interesting in August when the KDL-46XBR8 drops. New features include "Triluminos" RGB LED backlight, Advanced Contrast Enhancer PRO and BRAVIA Engine 2 PRO 1080p video processor. The XBR7 panels measure as large as 70-inches, and will launch in October, but sport features more in line with the XBR6. Everything is naturally 1080p and 120Hz.Update: We just got ourselves sent a UK version of this roadmap. It's after the break.
