As attractive as they are, we can now all cast aside our tinfoil hats and keep safe from skimming attacks by merely
donning a bit of origami, thanks to Japanese printing company Toppan, who've developed paper that protects RFID data.
The 0.2mm thick paper contains a thin layer of metal, and essentially functions as a Faraday Cage — wrapping an
RFID-equipped train pass, corporate ID or RFID payment card is like wrapping it in a metal sheet that shuts out
electromagnetic fields. They'll be rolling out the technology commercially this fall, presumably in Japan — as long as
we can get our mitts on it in the States by 2008, please?
Thanks.
