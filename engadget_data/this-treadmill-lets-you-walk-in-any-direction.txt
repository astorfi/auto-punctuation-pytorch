No, that's not a detached tank tread you're looking at, it's a treadmill -- and it doesn't care which direction you're walking. It's called the Infinadeck, and we found it hiding in a dark corner of the Silicon Valley Virtual Reality Expo. Each of its tank-like treads is covered in a moving belt which, when used in tandem, gives the user the ability to stroll in any direction. The omni-directional treadmill has apparently caught the attention of CBS too, as a possible prop for filming on green-screen sets, but it isn't ready: the prototype still requires an active operator to change directions. It's also quite loud. Infinadeck says its trying to secure funding to build a more compact version with motion sensors, which should automate the process. Want to see how it works? Skip on past the break, videos await.
