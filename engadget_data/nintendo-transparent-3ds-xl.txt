Unfortunately, don't expect this transparent beauty to show up at retail stores when the supersized 3DS launches later next month, as it's nothing but a mere demo unit. The see-through XL was recently used by Nintendo to showcase the handheld's guts during a Q&A session on its website, and while it's currently just an extra-large test dummy, it could potentially be a sign of big things to come. We wouldn't hold our breath, though, so for now you'll have to be satisfied with one of those opaque options you have to choose from.
