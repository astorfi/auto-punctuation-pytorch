It's only been a day since HP announced its intention to discontinue production of webOS devices, and it looks like the outfit's already throwing its flagship tablet in the bargain bin. PreCentral reports that HP sent out a memo to its affiliates asking them to cut the price of the ill-fated TouchPad to $99 and $149 for the 16GB and 32GB editions, respectively. The date apparently put forward by HP is August 20th, but at least two Canadian retailers (Best Buy and Future Shop) have already made the cut -- though both outlets show the sale ending August 22nd. As proof that being fashionably late isn't always a good thing, the white 64GB edition has surfaced on HP's US site, sporting a $600 asking price, leaving us to wonder, well: why now? If all of that isn't enough to turn your smile upside down, webOSroundup is playing the bearer of bad rumors, with what they say is an internal memo from AT&T stating that the carrier's launch of the Pre 3 has been "completely cancelled."

Update: Looks like the SlickDeals forums folks have discovered a way to bring those Canadian prices down south, and are reporting that they will be official in the US on Saturday morning. Hit up the link below for details.
