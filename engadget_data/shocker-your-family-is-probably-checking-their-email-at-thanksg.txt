As anyone who has ever been at an Engadget team dinner can attest to, the tendency of people -- even in social situations -- these days is to stay connected no matter what. In fact, a recent survey conducted by Harris Interactive suggests that people find spending time with their family on holidays to be stressful enough that they consider checking work emails to be a welcome distraction. Some other choice nuggets surfaced in the survey: about 67 percent of men and 50 percent of women say they check their email during holidays, and a small number -- about 10 percent -- said they "feel pity" for those who send email during off times. Yeah, seriously... losers.
