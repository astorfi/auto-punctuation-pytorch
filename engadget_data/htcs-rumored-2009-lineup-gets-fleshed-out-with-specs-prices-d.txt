Apparently somebody has trickled a few more details about the sets out, as we get a better look at the when, the where, and the all-important how much. Of course, we have to preface the info on the following six sets with the fact that we've no way to know the absolute truth or if we'll see them land as things have a way of changing. So until you hear it from HTC, consider the following leak a thing of dreams. First up, the Firestone, a 3G set that replaces the Touch HD with a 3.6-inch WVGA display, an 8 megapixel -- HTC's first -- camera, runs Windows Mobile 6.5, and is slated to appear in August this year. Next, a slate-style set called Whitestone with the same display as the Firestone, a 5 megapixel camera, Windows Mobile 6.1, and is apparently a dual-mode GSM / EV-DO number due to launch with Verizon in the September timeframe. The Thoth -- Athena's replacement -- is also present with a 4.8-inch display, a 5 megapixel shooter, the Qualcomm 8250 CPU at 1GHz, and will also run Microsoft's newest Windows Mobile 6.5 when it lands in September. HTC's Twin is another dual-band candybar set with a 3.2-inch VGA interface (no date), the HTC Maple is an HTC Cavalier successor with a 2.4-inch screen, 2 megapixel camera, Windows Mobile 6.1 device that appears in May. Last up, the HTC Cedar, which was originally touted as debuting on Verizon in June and has potentially been canceled. OK, that potentially sorts Windows Mobile for the year with HTC, so now lets get some details on Android sets, mkay HTC?[Via WMPoweruser]
