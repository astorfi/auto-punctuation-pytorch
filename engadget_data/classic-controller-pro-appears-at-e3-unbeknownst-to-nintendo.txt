Those eagle-eyed folks at Joystiq caught sight of a pair of Classic Controller Pros for the Wii at Nintendo's E3 booth, which wouldn't be so unusual if not for the fact that it still hasn't been announced for release outside of Japan. Adding to the intrigue, the Nintendo reps at the booth apparently know nothing (or weren't talking) about a planned release, and there's no official word to speak of on the E3 press site either. Yet the controllers were there for all too see, which leads Joystiq to rightly speculate that a release 'round here is now decidedly more likely than not.
