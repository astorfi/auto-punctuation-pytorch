 Here's the latest rumor on the flash Zune: once known by some as the Pyxis, it's now supposedly going by the codename of Draco (not to be confused with any Harry Potter or Dolph Lundgren characters), and is supposedly going to be released in 4 and 8GB capacities, and have the usual nigh-unusable WiFi and, thankfully, video playback (unlike l'nano). Zunescene also seems to think it'll be out later this year, and we say bring it on, Microsoft. We know at least one dude who you owe some killer 2nd gen hardware.[Thanks, Nate and Aaron]
