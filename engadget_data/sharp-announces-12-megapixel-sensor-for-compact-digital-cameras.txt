While we've already seen less-than-stellar results from the bevy of compact cameras touting unnecessarily large 10-megapixel sensors, Sharp is apparently preying on any remaining clueless consumers by unveiling a sure-to-be-disappointing 12-megapixel 1/1.7-inch sensor for wee cameras. The prodigiously small photosite (just 1.88 microns) generally means "less sensitivity, higher noise, and an even higher requirement on the lens optics" than current 2 micron models. Nevertheless, Sharp is hoping to ship these sensors en masse starting January 2007 at a cost of Â¥7,500 ($64) each.[Via PhotographyBLOG]
