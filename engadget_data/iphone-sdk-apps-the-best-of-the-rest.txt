It probably wouldn't be much of a stretch to call AIM the most requested app for the iPhone, and while we would've liked to see it included out of the box, it's better late than never, right? Epocrates is a medical app, which sounds very very interesting for all five people out there planning on using it. Touch FX is quite a bit more fun, developed by Apple in a couple days and featuring realtime picture manipulation with multitouch.
