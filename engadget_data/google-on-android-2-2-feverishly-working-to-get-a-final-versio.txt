So, where is it? The company hasn't committed to a firm date for a global roll-out yet, but there's official word from an Android employee over on the Nexus One's support forums this week that FRF72 is not the final update and that a release "will only happen once a release candidate meets [their] quality criteria." Korean versions of the phone were pegged to launch with 2.2 this week, so any way you slice it, it can't be long now.
