 Feeling that Samsung's Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 could use some more grunt? There's a chance you'll get your wish. An unannounced Galaxy Note GT-N5100 has popped up in benchmark scores with what looks to be a 1.6GHz Exynos 4412, better known as the Exynos 4 Quad variant that's used in the speedy Galaxy Note II. We don't know that it's a small tablet, but the 1,280 x 800 resolution matches that of the Galaxy Note 10.1 -- it's not very likely that Samsung wants to duplicate its recent design efforts. Whatever the dimensions, the testing shows that the slate is using Android 4.1.2, and it may be a cellular-equipped model with that "kona3g" codename. If the GT-N5100 is more than just a set of benchmarks, the real question may be when we'll see it; there's no guarantee of a tinier Galaxy Note in Las Vegas.
