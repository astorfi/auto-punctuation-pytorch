If you're looking to buy a cheap streaming dongle, now might be a good time to reconsider Amazon's Fire TV Stick. Today, the company dropped the price of its Chromecast and Roku Streaming Stick competitor to £25 in the UK, which is £10 less than before. As we noted in our original review, there's a lot to like about Amazon's HDMI dongle. Unlike Google's Chromecast, it comes with a dedicated remote and a fleshed-out TV interface, which should appeal to homeowners looking for a traditional set-top box experience. It also comes with a 30-day Prime trial, which is just enough time to binge-watch the best movies and TV shows on Prime Instant Video. It's not clear yet if this is a temporary or permanent price-cut, so if you're interested, best order now just in case Amazon jacks it up again.
