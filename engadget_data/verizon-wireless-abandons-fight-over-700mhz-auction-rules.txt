 Worried that Verizon's complaints about the open-access rules in the upcoming 700MHz spectrum auction would shake things up in a negative way? As of now, your anxiety is apparently unfounded. According to The New York Times, Verizon Wireless has "abandoned its legal challenge of the Federal Communications Commission's rules for its auction of radio spectrum, removing a potential obstacle to the much-anticipated sale." Interestingly, there's not a lot of backstory as to why the carrier suddenly decided that pressing on wasn't in its best interests, but we'll accept the white flag, regardless.[Via ZDNet]
