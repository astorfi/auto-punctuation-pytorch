That's the promise behind Art Haines' SUNN solar car kit, which'll let you build your very own DOT-approved electric car using only standard hand tools. Completed, the car can hit 35MPH and has a range of 20 miles before the batteries give out and you've got to take a little solar siesta (or find a plug outlet.) Five of the kits have already been sold, including a new pickup-style version, but you'll need time and some extra cash on hand before you go electro-cruising: the kit itself costs $4,500, not including batteries or solar panels.
