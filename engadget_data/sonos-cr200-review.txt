 It's here Sonos fans, finally. The new touch-screen CR200 controller is announced and ready for purchase. After making an appearance at the FCC on its way to being leaked in full, the new CR200 controller for Sonos' multi-room wireless music system is everything we heard including a 3.5-inch, 640 x 480 pixel (VGA) capacitive touchscreen with on-screen keyboard, beefier processor, and relatively tiny 2.9 x 4.5 x 0.7-inch / 6 ounce footprint with scaled-down charger to match. Those changes make the new CR200 pocketable, faster, and far more useful than the CR100 ever was. Not that the CR100 was a bad device, it wasn't, but the $399 controller (plus $40 for the charging cradle) was definitely beginning to show its age as the only dedicated handheld controller available since Sonos launched back in January 2005. What really made the CR100 archaic though, was the 2008 release of the free iTunes App Store controller for the iPod touch and iPhone. It was faster, more graphically rich, and offered an on-screen keyboard unlike the CR100.

 Fortunately, the price of the CR200 has dropped a bit to $349 / â‚¬349 list, a price that now includes the charging cradle. Still, we know what you're wondering: is it worth it when an iPod touch can be purchased new for $229, or closer to $170 refurbished? Having used the CR200 for a week now, we found that the answer's not as obvious as you'd think. Click through to find out why.



 Hardware Although it may resemble a rather thick, portable media player, the CR200 is a one-trick pony that does one thing and it does it very well: it controls the music in any room where a Sonos ZonePlayer is installed. The new controller also features a user-replaceable, 1850mAh Li-ion polymer battery; a seemingly odd choice for a device that never leaves the house. That is until you consider that you'll use the CR200 controller almost daily for a long, long time (the CR100 is already pushing 4.5 years in some homes). Making the battery removable allows for an easy, $30 swap when you finally hit the lifetime recharge cap of the CR200's battery. By comparison, CR100 owners must send in their controller as part of a battery replacement program offered by Sonos at a cost of more than $100 per controller.

 
 As much of an advance as it is, it's worth pointing out a few things the CR200 can't do in comparison with the older CR100. First, the deep-sleep battery saving mode found on the CR100 no longer exists on the CR200 -- it's instant-on or nothing which is fine by us. And while the CR100 was splash-proof (not waterproof, big difference), the CR200 is not as a result of the changes required to make the battery user-removable. Having said that, the new design introduces just a slim strip of buttons along the front-side of the device and the seams between the glass, aluminum, rubber, and plastic are tight throughout. While steering clear of calling the device splash-proof or water-resistant, Sonos did indicate to us that the CR200 design was tested to withstand casual spills prior to approval for mass production. In other words, don't use it in the shower but don't worry (too much) about setting it on the kitchen counter while cooking. If you're concerned by this change then we'd suggest stocking up on the more rugged CR100 controllers and docks that have now reached end-of-life; they should be available at discount soon enough.
