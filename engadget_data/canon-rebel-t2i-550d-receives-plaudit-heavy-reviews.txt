Starting off with image quality -- still the bread and butter of any DSLR -- Camera Labs informs us that "the EOS 550D / T2i delivered images which were essentially the same as those from the EOS 7D," describing them as highly detailed and exhibiting no greater noise than can be found on Nikon's 12 megapixel competitors. An impressive feat, you will agree. Further appreciation is meted out for the newly improved LCD screen on the back, whose 3:2 ratio matches the sensor's dimensions, but there's also warning that the 7D retains a significant advantage in terms of ergonomics, weatherproofing, continuous burst mode, and autofocus. Even so, both reviews were happy to pin their "highly recommended" badges on the T2i, and you can discover the more nuanced reasons for doing so at the source links below.
