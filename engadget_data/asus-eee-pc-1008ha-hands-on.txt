After taking the wraps off of its downright stunning 10-inch Eee PC 1008HA yesterday, we spotted the bugger sittin' pretty today at the outfit's booth. Needless to say, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to snag a few snapshots and share 'em all with you. Much like the S101, the so-called "Shell" has very little "Eee" in its blood. In fact, you'd barely know it was part of the family without that descriptive placard sitting there beside it. ASUS engineered this one for fashionistas who'd like a little PC with their next style accessory, and everything from the glorious paint job to the ultra-clean lines screamed "gorgeous." Really, take a look below and see for yourself.
