One million units in a day was a pretty good start, and SCE's Andrew House has just announced that the company's now sold 2.1 million PlayStation 4s as of December 1st. That combines sales from the US, Europe and parts of Asia, although the Sony console hasn't reached every corner of the globe just yet. Perhaps everyone's read our recommendation...


Update: Microsoft issued its own numbers missive this afternoon, instead choosing to tout various game stats of the Xbox One rather than sales numbers. The piece says "over 3 billion" zombies were killed in Dead Rising 3 and that "over 90 million miles" were driven in Forza Motorsport 5 by December 1st. It doesn't say whether or not the Xbox One bested 2.1 million consoles sold by December 1st, and we're betting it doesn't because the Xbox One still hasn't bested 2.1 million consoles sold as of December 1st. Read into it what you will -- the Xbox One launched seven days after the PlayStation 4, albeit in more markets, and both consoles are on-track to sell out everywhere this holiday. We're just glad the next-gen is finally here!
