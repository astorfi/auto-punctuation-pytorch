Now-former CEO Dirk Meyer has resigned in what the company is a calling a "mutual agreement" between him and the Board of Directors. Interim CEO will be CFO Thomas Seifert, who has asked not to be considered as a candidate for the next chief. A search committee for the next CEO is currently being led by Board Chairman Bruce Claflin. The circumstances behind Meyer's departure remain a mystery, but something tells us they can't be as ridiculous as the last major CEO resignation we saw around these parts.
