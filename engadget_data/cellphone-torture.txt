No, we're not talking about happy slapping — we're
talking about actual cellphones being tortured in the name of rigorous product testing as set forth by Siemens. To make
sure their handsets can withstand "the demands of popular SMS messaging," they strap 'em down on a lab bench and hook
them up to these crazy gizmos that depress the keys up to 400,000 times
(this guy could have a lucrative career waiting), one of
about 20 basic quality assurance tests — we were too scared to ask what the other 19 are. They also apparently have
some of the more sadistic members of the Siemens staff document the whole works and publish the pics to their
website.
