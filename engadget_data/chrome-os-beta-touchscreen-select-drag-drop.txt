We don't know when Google plans to release another device like its Chromebook Pixel, but Chrome OS support for touchscreens is continuing to improve. A new update in the beta channel brings support for both touch enabled text selection and touch enabled drag and drop on touch based devices. Right now the Pixel is the only Chrome OS laptop that supports it, but who knows what could be around the corner. Google "Happiness Evangelist" Fran√ßois Beaufort noted the new feature in Chrome OS' dev channel a couple of weeks ago and recorded a demonstration video, which you can check out after the break. Otherwise, Chrome OS users living on the not-quite-bleeding-edge can also expect tweaks like an audio source selector in the tray menu, ability to share folders and files from the Files app and an improved UI for the release channel switcher.
