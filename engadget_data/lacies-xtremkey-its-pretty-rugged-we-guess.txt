But after that... alright, the time with the mud, and the thing with the ocean. Oh, and when we dropped 2GB of Word documents into a black hole. Still, we hardly deserve to be treated like children. LaCie has stepped up the condescension to new levels with its XtremKey, a drive that's waterproof up to 100 meters, temperature proof from -58 degrees Fahrenheit to +400, and resistant to 16 foot drops. This ruggedness is accomplished by screwing the USB drive into a 2mm thick metal pipe that can withstand the pressure of a 10 ton truck rolling over it. Like that would ever happen that one time. The drive ranges in capacity from 8GB to 64GB, and will be out in August for some exorbitant, as-yet-undisclosed cost. Check out a needlessly abusive video of the drive after the break. 






Show full PR textLaCie XtremKey: The World's Most Adventurous USB Flash Drive13. juli 2010 LaCie announced today the LaCie XtremKey – offering industrial-strength protection for your data. With capacities up to 64GB and an impenetrable shell, the XtremKey is a truly rugged USB key that stands up to the elements. LaCie, originator of the flat, award-winning key-shaped USB flash drives, shields the XtremKey's premium flash memory modules inside a 2mm metal pipe casing. Sealed with wear-resistant screw threads and a rubber O-ring, it is watertight up to 100 meters. The LaCie XtremKey is also resistant to 5-meter drops, fierce heat and bitter cold – it holds up in any environment, no matter where you take it (+200°C / -50°). XtremKey is constructed with zamac, a metal alloy composed of zinc, aluminum, magnesium and copper that's so strong, it can withstand the pressure of a 10-ton truck. Less than three inches tall, this flash memory drive puts strength, security and storage right on your keyring. "The XtremKey offers extreme durability and capacity in a convenient, well-protected and fun form factor," said Alexis Kobassian, Product Manager, LaCie. "Despite the robust, industrial-strength protection we've added, it's still a LaCie key that brings ease-of-use and reliability to customers looking to keep their data secure while on the go." Equipped with the Hi-Speed USB 2.0 interface, XtremKey offers instant compatibility, outstanding transfer speeds and cross-platform convenience to all PC and Mac® users. With writing speeds up to 30 MBp/s and reading up to 40 MBp/s, you don't have to sacrifice performance for protection. Designed by Constance Guisset exclusively for LaCie, XtremKey works relentlessly to keep your data protected, all while being portable, powerful and perfectly suited for your life's adventures. The key, when placed on a desktop, even shows some playful personality with a perfectly balanced wobble effect. AvailabilityThe LaCie XtremKey comes in capacities from 8GB to 64GB and will be available in August through the LaCie Online Store, LaCie Corner, and LaCie Reseller+.
