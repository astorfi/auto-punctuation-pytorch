 Going on a Pinterest spree isn't always easy -- not when there's been extra work involved in exploring someone else's board, or figuring out what else is similar. The company may have licked both of those problems with a redesign that's exiting its testing phase today. As of now, visiting a pin will show others from the same board or company, as well as items that fellow explorers have pinned alongside the one you're viewing. Lower-profile changes are in store as well: the pin content itself is bigger, and the site will finally remember your place when you step back from a curious click. Web-based Pinterest fans should soon get an invitation to use the discovery-friendly revamp, while the Android and iOS apps will eventually see the new tricks through updates.
