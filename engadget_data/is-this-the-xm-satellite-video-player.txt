According to OrbitCast, such a device wasapparently recently shown off by XM to analysts, which would use On2's tech for video with 256kbps data streams foreach of at least 20 broadcast video channels. Yes, it's all very off the record unofficial can't comment, butif asked for the official Engadget opinion, we think it's at least plausible -- just know that we find its similarityto some of those Helix press shots (especially the reflection off the antenna, for example) a little unsettling.[Thanks, David]
