According to Tech Radar, Samsung's head of product planning, WP Hong, has said that "moving forward, with Honeycomb, that will be used in the next generation tablet, as it is specifically optimized for different type of tablet, and will be used on another product only." Not only is that the most official word we've had so far of a Galaxy Tab followup (curiously described as a "different type of tablet"), but it's also seemingly the first time that an ODM has publicly referred to a future Android version as "Honeycomb" -- a name that Tech Radar had previously heard from "multiple sources." It seems that Honeycomb won't be making it to the current Galaxy Tab, however, but Hong did say that "depending on our international partners, we'll be working to upgrade from Froyo to Gingerbread."
