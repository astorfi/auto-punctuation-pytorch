Could it be possible that all those juicy rumors of a refreshed, resized PS3 package are actually coming to fruition? Maybe -- or maybe Sony is just downsizing big time... but we doubt it.[Thanks, Jason]Update: Reader Chris points out that the 80GB PS3 is still on the site, accessible and purchasable through the 40GB model's page. Still, seems a little suspicious to us.
