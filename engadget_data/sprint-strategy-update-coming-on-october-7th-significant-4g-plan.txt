We just received an invitation to quite the atypical event -- a "strategy update" for the press to cover in New York City. All we're told is that presentations by senior management will be on tap, with a sure-to-be-lively Q&A session to follow. 'Course, this may all be a ploy to waste our precious time on a precious Friday in autumn, but something tells us Sprint ain't exactly in a position to be blowing cash on a Hot Air session. So, what's on deck? Let's count the possibilities: more details on its side regarding the iPhone 5? A full-on acquisition of Clearwire (plus a shift to LTE-Advanced)? More details on that elusive LightSquared arrangement? A merger with AT&T&T to create the largest telecommunications provider this side of Pluto? We'll be there to find out, but for now, hypotheses are being accepted in comments below.
