It's always refreshing when a product catches us by surprise, but thanks to several leaks, the Acer Iconia W3 definitely didn't fall into that category. So, when it was unveiled at Computex 2013, we were ready for it in all its 8.1-inch 1,280 x 800, dual-core Intel Atom, Windows Pro 8 glory. The wee slate also ushered in Microsoft's temporary offer of Office for free on 10-inch or smaller Windows Pro tablets, and you can now pre-order the 32GB version at Staples for $380 or $350 from Office Depot, while a 64GB version from Amazon will run you $430. An optional keyboard should arrive soon for $90, so if you've been coveting a small form-factor Windows tab -- RT-free -- hit the source.
