       The key to success of any new technology in this country is to drive the price down so much that it becomes affordable for everyone to own, and while Blu-ray still has a long way to go to hit that level, it looks like they might be on their way. Recently in a financial report from Funai, -- a Chinese manufacturer who brings us value products like Sylvania, Emerson, and Magnavox -- they announced plans to launch a Blu-ray player. While the details were left out for the most part, we'd expect to see them within the next year. Either way we will have to wait and see if these show up next to Fuh Yuan's HD DVD players at a Wal-Mart near you.
