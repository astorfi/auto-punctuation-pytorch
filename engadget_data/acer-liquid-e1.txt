 Acer just added another smartphone to its Liquid E line of mid-range handsets, and it's called, unsurprisingly enough, the Liquid E1. Device specs aren't bad for a phone of this caliber: you get a 4.5-inch qHD (960 x 540) IPS display, a dual-core 1GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, 4GB of built-in storage, a microSD card slot, a 5-megapixel camera and a decent 1,760mAh battery. It ships with Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean, though we would've preferred the latest Android 4.2 on board instead. While the specs didn't wow us, the curved design does look quite handsome at first blush -- it measures 132 x 68.5 x 9.9mm and weighs in at 4.59 ounces (130g), so it appears quite lightweight as well. We'd be inclined to like it even more if the price was low enough, but Acer hasn't announced that just yet. We hope to get a closer look at this smartphone at Mobile World Congress, but until then you'll just have to make do with the picture above.
