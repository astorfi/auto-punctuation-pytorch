With summer just about over, we're already starting to look for
solutions to that winter chill, and the first thing that comes to mind is heated clothing. And while battery-operated
heated jackets like the Grado Zero Space sound pretty
tempting, but we'd sort of like something that isn't dependent on a power supply to keep us toasty. That's where the
Airvantage vest comes in. Pump it up by breathing into a tube, and your breath acts as an insulating layer between you
and the elements. If you're too hot, you just let out a little air. Sounds great. Just be careful not to let that air
out to quickly if you've had the garlic soup for lunch. You'll really heat up the room, and not in a good way.
