Sure, if your Xbox 360 is crashing you could call up
Microsoft tech support and get your new toy repaired or replaced — or you could take design flaws matters into
your own hands and source out the root of the problem. And according to one Gamespot forumsgoer, apparently what's
causing these overheating Xbox 360 crashes isn't the Xbox itself, but rather that monstrous power supply. So what's a
gamer to do? Increase the airflow over the thing by getting it up off the floor, and suspending it in the air with
string — or if you're not feeling like making a trapeze act out out of the thing, stick it on an open box so it can
better emanate heat. Apparently this has been doing some good, but hey, remember that if it can't sit on the ground as
intended, it's defective, so make sure you call 'em up and get it sorted!
