       PulseLink is showing off its gigabit-rate Ultra Wideband technology, designed to allow wireless and wired streaming ofHD video, games and multimedia applications. The technology, based on PulseLink's CWave PLK23300 chipset, is beingdemonstrated at CES by wirelessly streaming games from an Xbox 360 to an HDTV, and from a PC to an HDTV.
