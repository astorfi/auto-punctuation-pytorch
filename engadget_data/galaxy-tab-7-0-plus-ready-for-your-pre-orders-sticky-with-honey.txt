	Having passed the FCC's critical eye, and hot on the heels of Samsung's now official love-in with Google, the Korean manufacturer's pint-sized tablet refresh is now up for pre-ordering. Priced at $399 for the 16GB model (or $499 for 32GB), Amazon remains tight-lipped on release date info, but is more than happy to tell us what we'll get for that wad of notes. That includes Android Honeycomb 3.2, and a dual-core 1.2GHz processor -- a substantial jump up from the single 1GHz processor we had with the original Galaxy Tab. If Samsung can promise a swift Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade, we could well be sold.
