 Former Miramax heads Harvey and Bob Weinstein have decided to joinUniversal in exclusively supporting Toshiba's HD-DVD format. Our friend Warren Lieberfarb (he of the "Sony isusing tactics from the Art of War" statement) is a consultant to their distribution company, Genius, so this isnot entirely surprising. No word on what titles to expect or exactly when, but apparently they willprobably release in summer rather than spring with the launch of the first HD-DVD players. Also, Studio Canal haspledged to release 30 titles in europe, while Toshiba is expecting more than 200 HD-DVD discs available before the 2006holiday season. Will that be enough to stave off the Blu-ray/PS3 behemoth bearing down on them?The Passionof the Clerks, Sin City 2, Scary Movie 4, Michael Moore's "Sicko", all on HD-DVD only apparently.
