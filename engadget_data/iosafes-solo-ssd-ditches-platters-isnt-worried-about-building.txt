This year, the company is introducing the Solo SSD, which is hailed as the planet's first solid state external drive built to protect data from a building collapsing on it. Yeah, a building collapsing on it. It'll be available with capacities as large as 256GB and will get connected via eSATA or USB, and if you care to know, the ruggedness is due to the firm's own proprietary ArmorPlate steel outer casing. As for specifics, said tech helps the drive survive 5,000 pound crush forces, 20 foot drops onto rubble and blazing infernos to boot. It'll be available next month in the US for $499 (64GB), $749 (128GB) or $1,250 (256GB), with the full details / press release hosted up after the break. As soon as we catch some benchmarks on this thing, we'll be sure to pass 'em along.
