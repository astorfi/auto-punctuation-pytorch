 We know you've got questions, and if you're brave enough to ask the world for answers, then here's the outlet to do so. This week's Ask Engadget inquiry is from Nikunj, who wants to produce his own apps for both sides of the smartphone war. If you're looking to ask one of your own, drop us a line at ask [at] engadget [dawt] com.
  "I'm a C++ student and I was wondering what's the best language to develop apps in both Android and iOS? Is C++ enough, and if not, could you all suggest some other languages? Thank you."

 Your humble narrator isn't a developer, but has scratched out the knowledge that neither platform's SDK is that germane to C++. iOS, for one, uses Objective-C or Cocoa, while Android at least does provide a C++ developers kit, it's apparently not as nice to use as the Java equivalent. Beyond that? That's where we'll turn this question over to those developers who proudly call themselves members of the Engadget fraternity.
