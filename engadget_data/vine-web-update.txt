You could peruse Vine clips on the web since early January, but now the app's browser-based presence is getting more of what its mobile companion offers. The new version of the site allows you to scroll through channels and curated playlists and feature clips alongside what's trending. What's more, you'll be able to access the site if you haven't logged in, sending six-second links to anyone for full-screen viewing in TV mode. Once you do log in, you can gaze at your feed, populated with content from the folks you follow. Unfortunately, there's no word on when you'll be able to use the web cam for your next selfie. Bummer.
