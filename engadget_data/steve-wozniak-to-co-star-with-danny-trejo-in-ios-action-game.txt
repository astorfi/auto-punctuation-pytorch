 No, it doesn't entirely make sense to us, either. And yet, here it is: Apple co-founder (and Segway enthusiast) Steve Wozniak is going to feature in an iOS game with action star Danny Trejo. ITN FLIX's and React Games' lengthily-worded Danny Trejo's Vengeance (Woz With A Coz) will have Woz trying to rescue his wife with Trejo's help, plowing through enemies with guns and, naturally, machetes. We're working to find out just what prompted the use of Woz's image for an out-of-character role -- other than an attempt at drumming up press for the game's Thanksgiving launch and a somewhat related 2013 movie, of course. There's no telling whether the title will be as fun as its concept is outlandish, although we might be swayed if Vengeance goes full circle with Woz and includes a Breakout mini-game.

 Update: We got in touch with Woz, who notes that both he and his wife Janet offered themselves on a volunteer basis for the game, including voice work. A friend who knows the producer recommended the involvement, he says. As to how well it plays? While Woz can't say much before the game arrives, his top-level view is that it's "entertaining and FUN." That piques our interest, at least a bit.
