Pair the iHome Mobile with your Bluetooth musicphone or computer and drift off to sleep in a cradle of weak radiation. Hell, it'll even double-up as a speakerphone for all your dirty little, "hands-free" calling needs while alone in bed. And while it might look like it features a charging cradle for your Chocolate, or other capable cellphone, we highly doubt it -- more than likely we're just looking at a cup to hold the phone or other Bluetooth device. No worries, you'll wake refreshed with a dead cellphone battery ready to take on the day without interruption.
