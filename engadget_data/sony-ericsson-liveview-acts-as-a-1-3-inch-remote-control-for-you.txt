The 1.3-inch OLED screen above is a new Bluetooth accessory for Android 2.x phones that's said to function very much like a desktop widget. There's an app you can install on your phone that'll get it to communicate with the 128 x 128 pixel grid, which can then be used to read messages, find your phone, control music playback, and receive those precious social networking updates from your friends. We know by now you'll be crying foul over Sony Ericsson releasing an Android 2.0 accessory when its handsets are stuck somewhere below that marker, but the plan is to dish this "micro display" out in the last quarter of the year, after that messianic Android 2.1 update has arrived. Fingers crossed.
