  Got both an Xbox LIVE Gold membership and a Netflix account? Well, you'll be treated to a slightly revamped steaming video app on your 360 today. The tweaks are nothing ground-breaking, but they'll certainly deliver some welcome changes. New navigation options allow you to skip around movies much quicker during playback and even jump immediately to the next episode of a show. If you're one of those folks that's still rockin' a 4:3 screen you can use zoom to transform your letterbox video into a fullscreen clip. There's also a new single sign on feature for easily accessing your Netflix account across multiple consoles and improved contrast to make movies more vivid. Go fire up Netflix on your Xbox 360 to get the update now.
