Anyone who has ever been hit by another driver who then fled the scene knows how frustrating hit-and-run accidents
can be; unless you have a solid witness or some good forensic evidence, most of these crimes are never solved. Well a
patent application slithering its way through the patent office approval maze proposes a unique solution for catching
automotive scofflaws: install RFID chips
that contain VIN information in every new car. The propsed system incorporates chips with a maximum range of eight
inches, to allay privacy concerns, and are only activated during an accident. So even if a hit-and-run driver speeds
away, their VIN number will have been recorded by the victim's RFID tag reader, which can then be read by police. Guess
this means that we're gonna have to start leaving windshield notes every time we "brush up" against someone else's ride
from now on.
