For all you punks too lazy to build your
own robotic companion based on the Kondo KHR-1 robot kit
that KYOSHO was so kind to produce for you, KYOSHO has made a ready-to-go version called MANOI. Billed as an 1/5 scale
athlete humanoid, MANOI stays in shape,
but somehow manages to keep his smooth curvy figure. Being built on the Kondo KHR-1 skeleton means MANOI has all those
snazzy physical abilities such as standing up after a fall, standing on one foot, and being an all around track star.
Based on the schematics we've seen, MANOI's head and hands are mostly hollow, perfect for housing some instruments of
death and destruction. KYOSHO should start selling the little guy in June next year for around $1400 USD, and we'll
leave it to you to see that your cute and cuddly athlete humanoid doesn't stay cute and cuddly for long.
