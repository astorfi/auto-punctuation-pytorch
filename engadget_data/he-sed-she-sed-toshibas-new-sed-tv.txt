We hate to drop yet another acronym on you, but we really have no choice now that Toshiba has just unveiled their
first flat-panel TV that kicks LCD, DLP, LCoS, and plasma to the curb and instead uses a new technology called
surface-conduction electron-emitter display, or SED, which is supposed to have the brightness and contrast of CRT
displays, but use one-third less power than of plasma TVs. First ones could go on sale as early as next year.
