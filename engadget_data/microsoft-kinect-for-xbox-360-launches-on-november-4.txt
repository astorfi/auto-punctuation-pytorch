Kinectimals - Nintendogs but with wild and impossibly cute animals
Kinect Sports - Soccer, bowling, track and field games, a bit like Wii Sports
Joyride - "Thrill of high speed kart racing, with the joy of controller-free gaming"
Kinect Adventures - Jumping around and stuff
Your Shape: Fitness Evolved - most amazing looking fitness game we've seen yet, from Ubisoft
Dance Central - an actual, honest to gosh dance game without stupid pads -- from Harmonix

So far Your Shape and Dance Central are looking the best, but Microsoft is still showing us more, and we're thinking a few of you are going to like that Star Wars game from Lucasarts. Interestingly, no price was announced, meaning Microsoft seems to be waiting to see how many US dollars the competition decides to charge. Your Move, Sony.

Update: We have the full list of 15 titles after the break, courtesy of Joystiq. , which includes a new EA Sports Active.
