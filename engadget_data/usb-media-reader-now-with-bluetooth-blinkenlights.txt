       From the city that brought us such delicious items like dim sum and old school Chow Yun-Fat movies, we now have what may be the most amazing memory card reader in history. In fact, one might even say that its card reading fu is better than yours. This reader supports 52 types of memory cards (switch 'em up every week!) and also features an integrated Bluetooth adapter. As you can see in the semi-annoying animated gif at right, it comes in "multi moody colours" -- is that like a mood ring?
