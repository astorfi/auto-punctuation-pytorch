 Next time you sit down to write your Great American Novel, perhaps you should consider tapping the opus out on your Wii with Logic 3's weird and somewhat awful -- though excellently named -- Wii Keyboard. There's not much meat on these bones -- it's simply an add-on for Nintendo's console that allows you to type on a QWERTY pad rather than light-sabering all over your apartment to name your new Mii "Death Bringer." The 'board is due out July 18th (in the UK at least) and will nab a tidy Â£14.99 (or about $30).[Thanks, John]
