 Itseems DirecTV is getting the MPEG-4 AVC party started a littleearly. We knew New York and LA were going to get local channels in high definition, but we thought it would take untilJanuary, we were wrong. Starting today, both cities can enjoy their local programming via satellite as long as you have the rightequipment.Subscribers who already get their local channels in HD via MPEG-2 equipment don't worry,nothing has changed (yet) for you.New Yorkchannels:

WABC/Channel 7 
WNBC/ Channel 4 
WCBS/Channel 2
WNYW (FOX)/Channel 5

LAChannels:

KABC/Channel 7 
KTTV (Fox)/Channel 11 
KCBS/Channel 2 
KNBC/ Channel 4
