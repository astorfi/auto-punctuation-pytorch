A NenaMark2 report clearly shows what claims to be the Verizon phone with a Qualcomm Adreno 225 GPU. Not the most exciting plot twist, but this does, by association, reveal that it's a 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 running the show, as rumors have been suggesting. The resolution (1196 x 720) and Android version (4.0.4) also got an outing, with an overall score on the test of 59.1. Ready for the next chapter? We guess we'll just have to wait.
