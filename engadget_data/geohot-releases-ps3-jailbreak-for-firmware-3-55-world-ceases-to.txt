Well, it looks like that video wasn't a random crack, but full custom firmware, and not just for show -- he just released it to the world. Believe it or not, we didn't bring our PS3s with us to CES 2011, so we can't actually test it for ourselves, but if you have faith or enjoy living on the edge, you're two clicks, one USB stick and a manual System Update away from potential freedom. Now, let's see him keep his original promise.
