Last week we rocked around the couch with the TV
Remote watch, this week we ask, Where's our frickin' watchphone already?




What is it? Samsung?s been telling us we?d all be wearing a 2.8 ounce, GSM, voice activated, OLED displaying (Organic LightEmitting Display), Bluetooth syncing watc phones since 2000. They might have thought we forgot, but we didn?t and wewant our watch phone already.  Why we like it This is up there with a Daisy Youth Red Rider BB Repeater, yet this Christmas, we think the tree will still be empty.It?s cool to show this off, but to never offer it up? C?mon, that?s just cruel.   2000   2001    2003  Where to get it and how much Samsung, since 2000 you?ve been taunting us each year with a new watchphone model, usually at a trade show with theflurry of accompanying press releases. You best represent at CES in January.
