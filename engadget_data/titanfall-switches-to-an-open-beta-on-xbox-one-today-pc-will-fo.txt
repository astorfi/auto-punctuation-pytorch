Xbox One owners furiously refreshing their inboxes (or Respawn founder Vince Zampella's Twitter feed) looking for Titanfall beta codes can step away from the F5 button -- it's switching to an open beta. According to Major Nelson, it will appear on your console under the new game demos section, although it may take some time before everyone sees it. PC owners aren't entirely left out of the fun either, as Zampella indicates that version will follow "maybe tomorrow."


The beta was originally scheduled to run until Tuesday night at 9PM ET, but that's going to be extended at least one day after server issues kept players offline most of Friday night. The plan is to "max stress" the all-multiplayer game's servers before it launches March 11th, but if you just want to find out if the former Call of Duty team can successfully blend a 6v6 shooter with mech action (a: seems like it) then it should work for that too.



 Great news: The @Titanfallgame Beta will be opening up to all Xbox One users. Details on my blog http://t.co/Do12xhSsK6
