We'd prefer an exact calendar date to Panny's vague "mid-November" timeframe, but we're sure we'll live. Alongside the camera Panasonic will be launching the Lumix G Vario 45-200mm / F4.0-5.6 / MEGA O.I.S. telephoto Micro Four Thirds lens for $350. Panasonic's also still chatting up a G1 followup for 2009 that will include HD video capabilities, which probably should've made it into round one if you ask us.
