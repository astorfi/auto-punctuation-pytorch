We actually saw much of what's new teased on Twitter's test channels a couple of months ago, including the larger, G+-like header photo and bigger, Facebook-esque profile pictures. There are several changes to how tweets appear on your user page, too. You can pin a tweet, forum-style, to the top of your ramblings as a sort of extension to your bio, which is less visible under the left-aligned profile pic setup. Furthermore, your "best tweets," defined by how much other users have interacted with it, will be enlarged to draw attention to them. Also, when you're scanning the profile pages of others, you can now filter out tweets that don't contain any visual media, or those that don't have replies. New accounts get the redesign straight away, and all others will see their profile pages change in "the coming weeks." There are various celeb profiles that've received preferential treatment you can peek at right now, if you'd like to see what your profile's in for. What's the big deal with Channing Tatum, anyway?
