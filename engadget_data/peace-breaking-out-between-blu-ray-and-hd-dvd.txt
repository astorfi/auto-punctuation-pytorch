Could the war between
Blu-ray and
HD-DVD be over before it even begins? Nothing's 100% yet, but a Japanese newspaper is reporting that Sony and
Toshiba have managed to set aside their differences and are very close to compromising on a single next-generation DVD
format (which we don't have to go through another one of those VHS vs. Beta things). The plan, which reportedly
involves combining Sony's recording technology with Toshiba's software for data transfer and copy protection, could be
unveiled as early as Monday. No word on what the new unified format might be called, how long we'll have to wait for the first
players and recorders that are compatible with the new format to hit stores, or what happens to everyone in Japan who
already bought a Blu-ray disc recorder.
