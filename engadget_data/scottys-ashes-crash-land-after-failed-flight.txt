 It's no surprise to Trekkies that James "Scotty" Doohan's final wish be that his ashes be launched into space. Apparently Space Services Inc., the company tasked with the "memorial spaceflight" gave her everything they got, cap'n, but the rocket carrying Scotty's ashes just couldna teek namoore, and crash landed in treacherous New Mexico terrain. Apparently the search for Doohan's ashes (as well as the 200 some-odd other peoples' spacebound remains) continues, as SSI insists the 20-foot rocket will be recovered, and its passengers will be delivered to the final frontier. In a manner of speaking, that is.
