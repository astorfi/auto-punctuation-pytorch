It's still got some good looking specs, including Silicon Optix Realta video processing, DTS-HD MA and Dolby TrueHD; but somehow another pricey Profile 1.1 player leaves us feeling a little empty. We're really hoping that the announced pricing doesn't carry straight over (it usually doesn't) -- the Â¥336,000 ($3200) sticker would be a 50-percent markup over the already-steep $2100 tag we saw just a few months ago. We'll definitely hold off judgment until we can put our eyes on the performance, but even accounting for MSRP-to-street adjustments, the pricing will keep this baby off of most short-lists (our included).
