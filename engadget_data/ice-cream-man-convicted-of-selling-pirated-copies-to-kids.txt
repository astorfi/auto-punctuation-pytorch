 If only we'd thought of selling pirated DVDs,CDs, and PlayStation / Xbox / PC games out of the trusty Engadget ice cream truck to the impressionable youth we'velong since been pushing sweets on, but alas that scam has apparently already landed one William Agnew in the slammer.Dude got busted and fessed up to selling such wares (warez?) by the truckful -- literally -- after being caught withfour thousand pirated discs. So to all you would-be software copiers out there looking to get in on the racket,remember: intellectual property theft may well get you put away, so stick to the straight and narrow and just keep onpeddling sweets to increasingly sedentary obese kids with type b diabetes, ok?[Via Joystiq]
