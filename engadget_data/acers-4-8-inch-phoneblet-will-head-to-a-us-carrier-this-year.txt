Well, Acer's brought the phoneblet -- yes, we're calling it that -- it to CES, and while it wouldn't power on, we did notice that the back of the device was marked with a "WCDMA: US band sticker". Acer confirmed for us that the "100 percent phone, 100 percent tablet" will be heading to the US in April with Froyo or Honeycomb and that carrier partnerships are in the works. Obviously, this WCDMA unit would be destined for AT&T or T-Mobile, however an Acer's spokesperson also hinted that it could be coming to Verizon like the Iconia Tab A500. The metal device felt really nice in hand, but we couldn't turn on the unique 1024 x 480-resolution, 21:9 aspect ratio display. We're imaging that its 1GHz Snapdragon processor will provide a pretty snappy experience, but it looks like we'll be waiting a few more months to check out the entire package.
