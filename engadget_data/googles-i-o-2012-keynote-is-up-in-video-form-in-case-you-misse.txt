We got Jelly Bean, the Nexus 7, the Nexus Q and some extreme Project Glass action. Check out the full video after the break.

 Update: And just like that, it's gone again. Google has apparently made the video private. We'll add it back in when it goes live again.

 Update 2: As promised, we've embedded the newly-available keynote video where it belongs... right after the break. [Thanks, Onel]
