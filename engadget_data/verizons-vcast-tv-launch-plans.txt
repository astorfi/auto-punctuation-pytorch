       Psst, we have a secret to tell you: Verizon has a service coming out where you can watch TV on your cellphone. OK, well it's really not a secret thanks to a few friends of ours but we have some more details on the launch for you. The Network intends to launch their own branded MediaFLO product (aka VCast TV) March 1, 2007 with the Samsung U620 instead of the LGVX9400 due to the device having trouble in testing. It's expected to cost $15.00 per month and will initially launch in such cities as Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Chicago. Word on the street is that Verizon even has an exclusive on the product through October. [Thanks, HTC Kid]
