Designed to see just how much Gates' touchscreen can take, this lady bot uses 80 compressed air-driven probes, six motors and a robotic moving head to apply maximum stress to the display. It works as such: by giving Patty a command, engineers can move probes across the screen at 25 inches per second -- mimicking the movement of fingers, hands and whatever else it might encounter IRL. With so much multitasking, it's no wonder she comes with a giant red emergency stop button -- just in case. See Patty do her thing by hitting the source link below.
