The last of the 3G phones they announced today, the A1010. This is another one that everyone pretty much already
knew about last week because of some leaked photos that
turned up, but we didn't know the gory details until today. It's a quad-band 3G cellphone that runs on Symbian
7.0/UIQ 2.1, is compatible with both WCDMA and GSM networks, and sports Bluetooth, a VGA quality digital camera for on
the front for making video calls, a two megapixel digital camera around back for snapping still shots (which screws up
our theory that Moto was leapfrogging straight to three
megapixels), a 208x320 pixel LCD screen, and a TransFlash memory card slot. Like the other new 3G handsets Moto
announced today, this one won't be out until Q4.
