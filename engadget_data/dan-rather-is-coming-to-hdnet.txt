 The rumors were right. Dan Rather is in fact entering the deep pockets of Mark Cuban and his personal high-def media outlet, HDNet. There isn't much info about the new contract but we do have the name of his new show: Dan Rather Reports. Apparently the show will feature "hard-edged field reports, interviews and investigative pieces." Sound good to us. Mark Cuban has a press announcement scheduled for 4 p.m. Pacific Time so check back later for more info.[via the LA Times]
