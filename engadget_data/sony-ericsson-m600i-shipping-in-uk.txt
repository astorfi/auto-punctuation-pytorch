The "i" variant that Expansys UK now appears to be shipping is intended for Europe and sports triband GSM with UMTS 2100 -- not the most useful setup for us poor, smartphone-starved Americans, but we're not naïve enough to believe that'll stop every last one of you from importing this beauty for the £415 (roughly $766) Expansys is asking. If you get your hands on one of these, be sure to drop us a note on the key layout, ya hear?[Thanks, Soven]
