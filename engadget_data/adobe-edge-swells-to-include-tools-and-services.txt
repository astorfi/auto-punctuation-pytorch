 Adobe really wants web designers to kick things up a notch. Not satisfied with where Edge has gone so far, it just released a full-fledged Edge Tools & Services suite to cover the bases for polished desktop and mobile pages on most any modern platform. Motion tool Edge Animate (formerly Edge Preview), automated previewing tool Edge Inspect (formerly Shadow) and mobile app packager PhoneGap Build have all arrived in the suite as version 1.0 releases, and come with both Edge Web Fonts as well as TypeKit to spruce up text. A pair of pre-release utilities, Edge Code (Brackets) and Edge Reflow, are also joining the group to tackle the nitty-gritty of editing web code and layouts. Any of the apps will readily cooperate with third-party software, although they won't always be cheap: while most of the Edge suite is free to use in at least a basic form as long as you have a Creative Cloud membership at any level, Edge Animate is only free during its initial run and should eventually cost either $15 per month or $499 in a one-time sale. For pros that want to burnish their corner of the web to a shine, the result just might be worth the expense.

Adobe also demonstrated a sneak peek of Adobe Edge Reflow in anticipation of a preview release expected by the end of the year.
  Adobe also announced that the first release of Edge Animate, normally priced at $499, will be made available for free in order to encourage Web designers to create using the interactive capabilities of the modern Web. Edge Animate has already proved a runaway hit with over half a million preview downloads. Edge Animate and the other Edge Tools & Services are available today with a free membership to Adobe Creative Cloud™.

  "We are excited to put a powerful new set of HTML5 tools into the hands of Web designers and developers and can't wait to experience the beautiful websites, digital content and mobile apps they'll create," said Danny Winokur, vice president and general manager, interactive development at Adobe. "We are passionate about enabling creative people to do anything they can imagine with Web technologies, which is why we're contributing to the Web platform and making the Edge Tools & Services available for free, including the first release of Edge Animate."
  At the keynote, Adobe also outlined a number of recent contributions it has made to the Web platform in cooperation with the standards and open source communities. These contributions are helping to advance the Web by making it a more expressive platform in key areas, including:
  · Layout: With CSS Regions and CSS Exclusions, Web designers and developers will be able to create responsive magazine-like layouts on the Web.
  · Foundational graphics: The proposed CSS Transforms specification will make it easier for authors to apply geometric transformations to HTML and SVG content consistently. The proposed CSS Compositing and Blending specifications will give Web designers the option to use blend modes they are already familiar with from Photoshop.
  · Cinematic visual effects: CSS Custom Filters, now available in Chrome Canary, enables sophisticated visual effects, for a richer, more engaging experience on the Web. Adobe also announced CSS FilterLab, a new experimental tool for Web designers and developers to create their own custom filters, available today at http://html.adobe.com/webstandards/csscustomfilters/cssfilterlab/.
  · Typography: Adobe has open sourced two beautiful new fonts used by Edge Code and Edge Reflow – Source Sans Pro and Source Code Pro.
