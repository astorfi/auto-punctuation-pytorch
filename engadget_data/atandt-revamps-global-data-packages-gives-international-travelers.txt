Thankfully for you, said decision just became marginally less terrible thanks to a handful of plan revisions from AT&T. The new international data package tiers are slightly less galling than the ones they're replacing, but they're hardly what we'd consider a bargain. Folks looking to roam overseas in around 100 qualified nations will see $24.99 / month net them 50MB of global data (up from 20MB), while $49.99 / month gets 'em 125MB (up from 50MB). The $99.99 monthly package provides 275MB (up from 100MB), while the $199.99 / month tier offers 800MB of data (up from 200MB). Even still, the avid jetsetter can blow through 800MB in a single workday abroad, and none of these new options hold a candle to an unlimited rental from a firm like Xcom Global. Still, it's a huge relief to see a major US carrier moving international data rates in the right direction, and hopefully we'll see sensible figures published in our lifetime. The world ain't gettin' any smaller, you know?

P.S. - We're still waiting to hear back on whether your existing global data plan will include a higher amount of data per-dollar.
