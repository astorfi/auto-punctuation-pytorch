We won't be seeing it until summer according to Motorola CEO Sanjay Jha, which is also when we'll be seeing the Bionic, a delay that we were already sulking about. Jha was a little vague about what the "issue" was that is causing the delay, only that whatever quality concern there is applies to both devices, and it could simply be that the company is waiting for its LTE rollout to get a little further along. Net result: one less G for Xoom owners until the summer, and no Bionic at all until then. Bummer.

In terms of the numbers: Motorola says that it shipped over 250,000 Xooms in the first quarter of the year, and managed net revenues of $3 billion. That's up 22 percent from this time last year, which brought losses down to $.27 per share -- much nicer than the $.72 in Q1 2010. Mobile device revenues were up 30 percent and 9.1 million total mobile devices were sold, of those almost half (4.1 million) were smartphones.
