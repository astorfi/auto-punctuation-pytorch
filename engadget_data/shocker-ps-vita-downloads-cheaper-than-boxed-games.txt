   Digital copies of games that you download bypass the time-and-money-consuming manufacturing, logistics and retail processes. It's only natural that we as consumers expect some of that saving to be passed along to our own wallets. There's a fair chunk of evidence to suggest that downloading PS Vita games over PSN will result in a ten percent saving on the boxed edition (that you'd have to drive to a store for, and everything). Of course, it would be unseemly to point out that those few dollars will spell the death-knell for thousands of jobs, so we won't.
