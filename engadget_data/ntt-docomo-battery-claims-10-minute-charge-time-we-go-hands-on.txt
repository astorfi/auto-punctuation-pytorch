And we're definitely not alone. NTT DoCoMo, one of Japan's largest carriers, has developed a prototype battery that's capable of achieving a complete charge in just ten minutes. NTT reps weren't willing to get into much detail about the new technology, which currently employs an external lithium-ion battery sleeve and is only designed to support NEC's super-slim Medias Android (Japan only) smartphone. They did let us take a look at the battery sleeve's AC adapter, which supports output of up to 6.0 amps, but otherwise appeared to be fairly generic.

A pair of amp meters compared the power draw of a standard battery with that of the ultra high speed charger, which pulled 0.55 amps and 5.86 amps, respectively -- at least according to the demo equipment on hand at NTT's CEATEC booth. The model we saw definitely looked very much like an early prototype at this point, and the carrier didn't seem to have any idea of when it may begin to be implemented in handsets and other devices, only committing to a release "as soon as possible." Still, we're pretty excited about the potential here (imagine being able to charge your phone completely with only a quick stop at an airport kiosk), and wouldn't hesitate to pick a battery up -- assuming of course that the final version is a bit more refined.
