Nintendo's had some success with approximating the mundanity of real life in the past, but its latest attempt looks like it'll amp up the crazy rather dramatically. In Tomodachi Life  you import a collection of Miis (Nintendo's avatar system) and watch as they interact with each other on an island. We know what you're thinking, but trust us, it's the opposite of boring. For example, one scene from its recent unveiling involves Nintendo's senior product marketing manager Bill Trinen professing his love for Samus Aran on a beach when a shirtless, musclebound president Reggie Fils-Aime runs down the shore to do the same. And then, CEO Satoru Iwata emerges from the water and joins in on the action. Yes, really.




 Nintendo promises that the game is full of (sometimes) awkward social situations like this, and that come June 6th, you'll see how the fun comes from watching your Miis interact for yourself. The whole video presentation feels like a fever dream, with Nintendo possibly being more self-aware than we've seen before. Seriously, do yourself a favor and watch the clips below.
