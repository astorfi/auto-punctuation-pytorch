One of Philips's more peripheral health-technology projects that managed to slip past undetected is their Herbarium,
an RFID-enabled herb greenhouse. The Herbarium detectsÂ which herb you've planted in its tagged pots in order to
produce ideal growing conditions, so you can easily and conveniently harvest your own fresh parsley, sage, rosemary,
and thyme without those annoying trips to Scarborough Fair (or Whole Foods).
