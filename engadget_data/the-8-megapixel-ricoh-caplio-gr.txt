We're not sure if it's just based on or adapted from their GR series 35mm cameras, but Ricoh's got yet another new
Caplio on the way, the GR digital. It shoots
8 megapixel shots in RAW or JPEG while managing to be less than an inch thick, has a 2.5-inch screen, and will be
available in Europe next month for Â£399.99 (about $730). As per usual with these guys: yum.
