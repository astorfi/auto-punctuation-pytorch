 
 The new 2013 lineup of Panasonic plasmas will be available starting in February, with 16 new models ranging from 42-inches to 65-inches -- nothing to compete with the 70 and up LCDs. The new flagship series is the ZT60. Only available in 60 and 65-inches, it is the only one in the lineup that offers "Beyond the Reference" level of picture quality and ultimate black color with its Studio Master Panel. The bulk of the new cool features of the ZT60 are also available on the VT60. Things like Voice Guidance and Voice Interaction -- which fall short of full blown voice control -- integrated camera and WiFi, TXH for both 2D and 3D and ISFccc Calibration Mode and include a touch pad controller. Every new model, except the X60, also supports an optional Electronic Touch Pen accessory. The ZT60, VT60, and ST60 set themselves apart even further with a personalized home screen, Viera Connect with Swipe & Share for transferring photos and videos from your smartphone or tablet with a flick of the finger. While the lineup detailed in the press release below certainly features some new features worth clamoring for, as well as an attractive new design, the lack of any sets larger than 65-inches, and no Ultra HD, gives the competition an indisputable edge in the large TV market.

"The series' enhanced VIERA Connect IPTV functionality, superior picture and sound quality, and advanced connectivity capabilities have completely transformed the TV viewing experience. With the 16 new models, Panasonic has set the bar for years to come."

   The new VIERA® ZT60 Plasma Series is equipped with a master studio panel, producing deep black levels for stunning picture quality. The new design maximizes the natural properties of glass and metal to visually express the superb performance of display and color. With the addition of a new Louver filter, the ZT Series line delivers improved external light shading, clarity and light transmittance. The new panel reduces reflections to create sharper pictures with higher contrast in bright environments.  Building on last year's "Glass and Metal" design concept, the 2013 VIERA models continue to focus on sleek designs while delivering pristine picture display and superior sound quality. The VT60 Series includes built-in side speakers, and a thin metal pedestal with one sheet of glass featured on the ZT and VT Series models delivers a minimalist aesthetics and design. The ZT60 and VT60 Series models are also equipped with a Dual Core with Hexa Processing Engine.  ZT60 Series  The ZT60 series is Panasonic's Full HD 3D Plasma flagship series and is available in two screen sizes - the TC-P65ZT60, 65-inch class and the TC-P60ZT60, 60-inch class.  With 1080p resolution, the ZT60 series comes with advanced features for connectivity including My Home Screen, Swipe and Share 2.0, Touch Pad Controller, three HDMI and three USB connectors, along with VIERA ConnectTM, allowing consumers to connect to applications through the internet via built in Wireless LAN and Web Browser. 2D-3D conversion transforms 2D content to 3D images in real-time. The ZT Series also includes two pairs of Active Shutter 3D Eyewear.  The VIERA ZT60 Series offers a "Beyond the Reference" level of picture quality. Ultimate black color, contrast and crystal crisp picture are achieved thanks to the new Studio Master Panel with newly developed panel driving method and panel structure with direct glass layer. The front glass is directly attached to the Plasma panel itself by Panasonic's exclusive crafting methods. As a result of the improvement, dim and double images are cut off by eliminating the air gap layer between the front glass and Plasma panel. The ZT60 series enhances compatibility between ultimate picture quality and stylish design. The quality of the ZT60's 3D images is greatly enhanced, with clear, natural Full HD 3D images because of reduced crosstalk. 3000 Focused-field Drive also produces image resolution of 1080 lines for 2D images, to provide crisp, clear image motion. A wider color gamut (DCI 98% Color Space) is achieved thanks to a newly developed pure red phosphor. The ZT60 features THX in both 2D and 3D modes *1 as well as ISFccc Calibration Mode with Advanced Calibration. Calibrators adjust the detailed picture setting with calibration software (CALMAN™ ) provided by SpectraCal Inc.  In addition to picture quality, operation and usability of the VIERA® ZT60 Series is also refined with Voice control and easy web search are achieved based on voice recognition technology in combination with new touch pad remote controller with microphone. Also, text to speech function offers voice guidance for convenient usage of the web browser. In addition, the painting and retouching function based on Panasonic's newly developed Touch Pen technology offers a fun and new experience for using your TV. (Touch pen accessory is optional)  The ZT60 Series offers advanced network functions via VIERA ConnectTM -- Panasonic's exclusive cloud-based IPTV function. Multi-tasking allows simultaneous use of apps from seven categories, including YouTube, Skype and Facebook. Web browser capability makes it easy to use the Internet from the TV. DLNA, Wireless LAN and Bluetooth are also supported for a high level of convenience.  The ZT60 Series display panel is free of mercury and lead. A newly designed phosphor process and rear panel process give the Plasma panel longevity of up to 100,000 hours before the brightness of the panel decreases to half. This is more than 30 years of viewing when watched 8 hours a day. The stylish design of the ZT60 Series is based on the concept of "one sheet of glass", which accentuates the superiority of the panel's picture quality and the unique pedestal structure with a thin metal plate gives the TV an elegant glass and metal aesthetics.  VT60 Series  The VT60 series includes three screen sizes – the TC-P55VT60, 55-inch class; TC-P60VT60, 60-inch class; and TC-P65VT60, 65-inch class.
