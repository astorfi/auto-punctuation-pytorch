 We're not exactly sure why, but we never really had a feeling that Asus wouldn't be able to move a copious amount of these things. Nevertheless, DigiTimes has it that Asus actually sold through 350,000 Eee PCs in a single quarter, beating industry expectations by a solid 50,000 units. Also of note, the report mentions that Asus is planning to launch the little bugger into Best Buy stores in the US while also kicking off sales in Japan next year, so there should plenty of opportunities to grab one if you've somehow missed out thus far.
