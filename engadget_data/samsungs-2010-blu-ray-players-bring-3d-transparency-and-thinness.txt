If your guests aren't thrilled by Full HD 3D and funky glasses they can always peek through the transparent cover and watch the disc spin. Also coming this year are the BD-C6500 with a promised 15-second boot time and disc load time, a new slim blu-ray champ with the BD-C7500 (after the break) and the low end BD-C5500. No word on prices or dates, but we're sure these should be appearing on shelves around the time the weather warms up.
