Both the nuvi 200 and nuvi 250 are set to hit Europe in "candy pink and powder pink" hues, and while the nuvi 200 seems to be exclusive to Halfords, the limited edition nuvi 250 should be more widely available. Aside from the color options and the "matching accessory case," the duo looks to remain unchanged from their less vivid siblings, and both are slated to land next month for £169.99 ($347) and £199.99 ($409), respectively.[Via Pocket-Lint]
