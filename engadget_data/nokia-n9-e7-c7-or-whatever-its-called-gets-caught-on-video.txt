The phone -- labeled "C0" but more likely a member of the Nseries or Eseries -- gets poked and prodded over the course of four-odd minutes, revealing a number of ports protected with plastic flaps (micro HDMI included, it seems) along with a good, close look at that expansive QWERTY keyboard. Performance looks reasonable but not mind-blowing -- and we don't want to pass judgment on a software build that's likely got months of work left before retail -- so this could be a reasonable option for N97 and N97 Mini owners looking for an upgrade with a capacitive display and some ultra-mild UI rework. Follow the break for the video.
