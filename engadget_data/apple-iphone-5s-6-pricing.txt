Sure, the brightest stars in Apple's smartphone universe may be the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but what if you want a big-screen iPhone on a (relative) budget? Don't worry, you're covered: Apple has dropped the prices on its older iPhone models. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus now start at $99 and $199 on 2-year contracts ($23 and $27 per month on typical installment plans, or $549 and $649 outright), making them much more palatable. The iPhone 5s is sticking around, too, and you can pick it up for free on a contract, $19 per month on installments or $450 up front.



As you may have gathered, this means big things for the broader iPhone lineup. All iPhones are now 64-bit, so it's more likely that developers will write games and other apps that take advantage of the more powerful architecture. Also, you'll notice that there's now just one 4-inch smartphone in the mix, and that the plastic-bodied iPhone 5c has gone the way of the dodo. Clearly, Apple believes that bigger, metal-clad phones are the way going forward.
