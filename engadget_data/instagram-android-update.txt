Well, no more. The latest Android app update, which should hit Google Play sometime today, brings that much-needed functionality to previously overlooked shooters. Additionally, the refresh enables sound and data usage controls, for folks using the tool to capture video clips as well. The new version hasn't popped up on our devices just yet, but stay tuned to Play to get your hands on the latest variant later today.
