  The mobile revolution has been good to Qualcomm. Its Q4 2011 earnings were impressive enough, but the company is kicking off 2012 with even more staggering numbers. The Snapdragon creator pulled in $4.68 billion in revenue during Q1, a 40 percent increase over the same time last year and 14 percent higher than last quarter. Profits were also way up, hitting $1.4 billion, a 20 percent increase over last year and a whopping 33 percent higher sequentially. The company appears to have roundly beat analyst expectations, earning 97 cents per share. It's also worth noting that this doesn't include any boost from the spectrum deal with AT&T. Sales of its MSM chips were, of course, the big star here shipping 156 million units -- an impressive 23 percent more than last quarter.
