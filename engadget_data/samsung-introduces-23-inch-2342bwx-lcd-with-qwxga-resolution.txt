If so, point your retinas to Samsung's latest marvel, the 23-inch 2342BWX. The LCD monitor boasts a thin black bezel, 5-millisecond response time and a memorizing QWXGA (2,048 x 1,152) resolution. Just to put things in perspective, that's enough pixels to view two A4-sized sheets side by side with room to spare for Vista's sidebar. Sammy's expected to loose this in South Korea soon for ???399,000 ($315), but trust us, the challenge won't be procuring one, it'll be making sure your GPU can handle it.
