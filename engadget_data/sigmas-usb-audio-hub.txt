In addition to three USB 2.0 ports, the device includes jacks for headphones, speakers, and a microphone, along with a button that'll let you switch between them on the fly. What's more, if Google's translation tools are to be trusted, it appears that the device effectively acts as a sound card as well, which may be good for some people, but probably not those who've invested in a high-end card for their PC. On the upside, the device doesn't require any drivers, although it'll only work with Windows.[Via Fareastgizmos.com]
