       It looks like those playing along with Intel's roadmap at home have a bit of updating to do to their scorecards, with HKEPC Hardware revealing a few new details on the chip maker's plans for the new year. The biggest bit of news this time around concerns Intel's new 45nm dual-core desktop processor, now codenamed "Wolfdale," which will have a thermal design power rating (TDP) of 65W, in line with current Core 2 Duo processors. Look for it to launch sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. Intel has also firmed up a few more details on its quad-core Yorkfield processor, with it clocking in with a 95W TDP and apparently still on track for a (late) Q3 release this year.[Via Reg Hardware]
