The most notable change appears to be the inclusion of Office, but we've also got dialer and in-call user interfaces, call history, call notifications (using Windows Phone 7's standard notification paradigm, of course), and a method for uninstalling apps. Clearly, we're still a long way from going final with this thing -- and fortunately, Microsoft has given itself basically the rest of the year to get it good and solid. Andale, ladies and gentlemen.
