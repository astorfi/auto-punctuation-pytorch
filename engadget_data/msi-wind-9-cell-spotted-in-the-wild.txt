Well, only two days in and November's apparently brought some of us something besides that rain we're always hearing about: at least a few lucky Brits seem to have scored an MSI-sanctioned 9-cell for Â£70 (about $115) on the UK's eBay. Photos of the battery submitted to the MSI Wind Forum show it to be totally gargantuan, but the juice times customers are reporting -- 7.34 hours by one account -- are impressive if accurate. We'll give them this: it's definitely handsomer than the DIY version.Update: As some commenters have pointed out, it looks like this battery is manufactured by Medion, who also happen to produce a clone of the Wind.
