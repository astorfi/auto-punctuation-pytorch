Come December 1st, the as-of-yet unnamed version will hit its first alpha and transition into its second testing stage on February 7th. After touching the beta milestone on March 7th, the release is just a small stretch away from its proposed April 25th launch. If the wait feels entirely too long, you can spend time perusing potential pseudonyms for the OS at the more coverage link below.
