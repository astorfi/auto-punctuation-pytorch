 
Got a new ones from Toshiba today, folks: the Satellite AW5 15.4-inch WXGA (1280 x 800) laptop, which features a Celeron M or Core Duo processor of your choice, up to 2GB RAM, 60GB drive, dual-layer DVD±R drive, PC and ExpressCard/54 slots, 4-in-1 media reader, 802.11a/b/g, and graphics up to a 128MB GeForce Go 7600 if you want to plunk down ¥189,800 for the higher end model (about $1,700 US). Nothing too out of the ordinary, but stay tuned for the eventual US launch.
