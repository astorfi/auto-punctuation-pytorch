 
Given the company's focus on 3D this year, it's not at all a surprise to see Sony's 2010 line of ES receivers (and lone Blu-ray player) touched up with a dash of 3D support and HDMI 1.4-compatible features, but it may be a shocker to see their sale restricted to "specialty AV retailers and custom installers." That means no Amazon.com or other online retailers, but wherever one finds the STR-DA5600ES, STRA-DA4600ES, and STR-DA 3600ES, they'll include IP, RS-232 and IR control support for easy home automation integration, iPhone remote control (Android -- and of course we'd expect Google TV -- version coming soon) as well as working as an Ethernet hub and DLNA streaming device. At the top of the line the STR-DA5600ES ships in September for $2,000 and is able to automatically calibrate audio for speaker types (like last year's), plus locations and angles, function as a DLNA Live Audio server itself and stream audio and video to other rooms via HDMI (six in, two out) or CAT5e. While the remaining models do a bit less, for a bit less when they all ship in August, the STR-DN2010 is a new model for 2010 at just $800. As for the Blu-ray player, the BDP-S1700ES ships with 3D movie play back, BRAVIA Internet video and Qriocity streaming WiFi and Gracenote database browser for $400 this August, check for a picture and specs on all after the break.
      

 

Show full PR text SONY ELEVATES THE STANDARD FOR 3D HOME THEATER WITH NEW ES AV RECEIVERS AND BLU-RAY 3D PLAYERCompany Supports Specialty AV Channel With Focused Distribution StrategySAN DIEGO, July 6, 2010 – Driving the innovation of 3D, Sony today took another step to strengthen its industry leading 3D home product line with new Elevated Standard (ES) AV receivers including the STR-DA5600ES, STRA-DA4600ES, and STR-DA 3600ES and a Blu-ray 3D™ player, the BDP-S1700ES.In addition to Sony's latest 3D capable BRAVIA® HDTVs, the new ES components represent the best audio and video quality Sony has to offer. Designed with custom installers in mind, ES models integrate seamlessly with multi-room, third-party control systems."By focusing on seamless integration with custom home theater control partners, Sony is working to deliver products that support the custom and specialty retail business like no other manufacturer," said Brian Siegel, vice president of Sony's home audio and video business. "Because Sony is involved in every stage of the 3D ecosystem, specialty dealers and installers can rest assured that our AV components leverage that deep expertise to deliver the most technically advanced experience possible."Focusing on the needs of custom home theater installers, Sony's ES line represents an enthusiast-level AV experience featuring some of the company's most advanced technology. The value of the products is best demonstrated by dealers and integrators qualified to engage an advanced consumer audience. To that end, the company is focusing its distribution strategy to include only specialty AV retailers and custom installers. ES products will no longer be offered for sale online or through telesales.AV Receivers with Custom ControlSony's 2010 ES AV receivers feature IR input jacks and two-way serial control. They also offer control over IP which allows installers to easily integrate the receivers into the leading home automation systems including Control4®, Crestron, AMX®, Savant, Ultimate Remote Control, RTI, and others. Sony has worked closely with leading control companies and is a Control4 Certified Partner, an AMX Device Discovery Partner, Crestron Integration Partner, and a Savant Excellence in Audio and Video Partner.The new models offer 3D pass-through and flexible multi-room features. They can connect to a home broadband network through an Ethernet port offering easy access to digital photos, music and videos from Digital Life Network Alliance (DLNA®) sources. They also function as an Ethernet hub featuring four ports that connect other network devices.Additionally, the Ethernet connection provides access to both Shoutcast® Internet Radio and Rhapsody® Music Service, and offers easy access to firmware upgrades via the Internet. The STR-DA5600ES model also functions as a DLNA Live Audio Server that can stream music to other DLNA clients.Users with an iPhone® or iPod® touch device can control the models using a free app that transforms your mobile device into a full ES receiver remote. The app features zone control, full GUI menu, and Sony's Quick Click remote function which allows users to control source components (such as Blu-Ray player, set-top box) in the main home theater room to be controlled from a second zone.The STR-DA5600ES and the STR-DA4600ES offer the ability to distribute audio and video to multiple rooms via the second HDMI output and video to a second zone via CAT5 output. They can both also up-scale all sources to 1080p in the main zone and 1080i in a second zone via the Faroudja chip® ensuring a consistent, sharp picture. The connected video zones feature a high-grade, icon-driven menu system that allows for simple device and content navigation.All three models feature Digital Cinema Auto Calibration (DCAC) with Automatic Phase Matching (APM). Without changing the front reference speakers, APM corrects for phase differentiation between front, center, and surround speakers, ensuring an ideal sound stage regardless of speaker type. The STR-DA5600ES also offers DCAC EX which includes speaker relocation, not only adjusting for the distance but also the angle of the listening position to create an optimal listening environment.The receivers also feature Sony's innovative new HD Digital Cinema Sound® that was developed together with Sony Pictures Entertainment. Incorporating high-mounted front speaker placement, HD DCS was designed to transform and replicate both the sound quality and acoustics of a movie theater in the home environment creating an unmatched home theater experience.All of the models support 1080/24p video signals and x.v.Color™ and Deep Color™ video codecs, as well as all advanced audio formats (Dolby® Digital Plus, Dolby® TrueHD, dts® Master HD, dts® ES, Dolby® Digital EX, Dolby® Pro Logic IIx and 8 channel Linear PCM). They also feature audio return channel allowing network content originating from the television to be played through the receiver without additional cables.The models feature Sony's Digital Media Port™ for simple connection to an iPod and other digital music players, and are both XM® and Sirius® ready.The 7.1 channel network multi-room STR-DA5600ES AV receiver features a 130-watt power amplifier x7 (8 ohms, 20 Hz – 20 kHz, .09 percent THD) With six HDMI 1.4 inputs (five rear, one front) and two switched or simultaneous HDMI outputs, the model will be available this September for about $2,000.The 120-watt x7 (8 ohms, 20 Hz – 20 kHz, .09 percent THD) STR-DA4600ES features four HDMI outputs and two switched or simultaneous HDMI outputs.
