So far, we've only come across beyond-1080p panels in a couple of Chinese phones, like the Oppo Find 7 and the Vivo Xplay 3S. But the spec is definitely about to go mainstream, as LG has just confirmed to us that the successor to the G2 will deliver a "Quad HD" resolution, with four times as many pixels as 720p (that's 2,560 x 1,440, if you want to count 'em). Based on earlier leaks, it's likely that the G3 will have a 5.5-inch display, which means we'll be looking at a pixel density of around 530 ppi -- not far off double what you'd get from a printed glossy magazine.



          
 
 
 What's the point? Well, with the Chinese phones it was all about the rendering of the complex character set, which really benefited from the extra detail, but on global phones we're not so sure. Onscreen photos also tend to get a boost, to the point where they look almost analog -- a bit like the way 35mm prints used to look on a lightbox -- but ultimately we'll just have to wait and see how well LG implements the technology. Based on last year's schedule for the G2, we might see an official launch in the summer, with availability by the fall.
