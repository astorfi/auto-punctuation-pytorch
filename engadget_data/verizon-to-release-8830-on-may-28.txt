       There appears to be light at the end of the proverbial dark tunnel for customers of Verizon Wireless -- non-business channel ones, anyway -- who attempt to satisfy their "Crackberry" addiction. Sources suggest that The Network should be ramping up for consumer launch of the globe trottin' BlackBerry 8830 for Monday May 28. Yep, that's only a few short days from now. Better start saving those pennies now, especially at the $400.00 price with a two year contract..[Thanks, HTC Kid]
