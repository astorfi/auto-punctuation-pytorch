PVI's LCD products using its fringe-field switching technology will be sold under the brand Hydis. We guess it makes sense given PVI's dominance in the ePaper industry, but we can't help but question the merits of such a move with the world lusting after multi-purpose, transflective or IPS LCD tablets capable of displaying both text or full-motion, color video... imagine if Sony had renamed itself to Betamax in the early 80s, for example.
