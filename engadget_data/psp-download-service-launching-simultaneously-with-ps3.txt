In addition to featuring PSone games that'll be playable with an emulator, the download service will also include movies, though no mention was made of a certain music service. All that content will find its way to your PSP via a WiFi-enabled PC or PS3, but it looks like we'll still have a to wait a bit to find out just how much it'll cost.[Via Joystiq]
