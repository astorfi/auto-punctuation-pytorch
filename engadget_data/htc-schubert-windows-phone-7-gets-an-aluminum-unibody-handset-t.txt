 
And the Windows Phone 7 leaks just keep on flowing. After that mysterious ASUS pre-production unit we saw late last week, today we're being treated to the first sighting of the HTC Schubert. Purportedly a device planned for "day one" of the WP7 revolution, the Schubert is said to have been built using a single piece of aluminum (just like the Legend) with plastic cutouts in the back allowing for that all-important wireless connectivity. Not much else is known for now -- hell, there's no way to even confirm this phone is who it says it is -- but the video's right after the break.
