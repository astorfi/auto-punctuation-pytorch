 UK defensecontractor QinetiQ has filed a patent for an explosive ink that could allow fuses to be designed on a computer and thenprinted directly onto ordinary paper. The ink is stable when wet, and only becomes active when a current is fed througha metal strip placed on top of the printed fuse. Once the fuse is activated, it can be used to trigger just about anykind of explosive device, from fireworks to munitions. (We don't even want to know what happens if you get a paperjam.) Somehow, we expect the defense industry to do its best to keep this one under lock and key, and we sort of hopethey succeed, if only so we can avoid having to wait as TSA officials disassemble our portable inkjet every time wepass through customs.
