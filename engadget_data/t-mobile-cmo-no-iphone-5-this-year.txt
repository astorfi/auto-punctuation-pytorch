We've had a sneaky suspicion all along that T-Mobile would likely be the only major network not playing host to an iPhone 5 launch party this year, but we still kept our heads high because no official denial had been given from the company's C-level. That's now changed, since T-Mobile CMO Cole Brodman slammed us back into reality at a town hall meeting stating: "we are not going to get the iPhone 5 this year." It's a hard pill to swallow in such a short summation, but there might be a glimmer of hope -- technically Brodman only referenced one specific name. Since there's always a possibility that Apple will choose a different title for its fifth-gen device (or even add a lower-priced option), T-Mobile fans can still grasp onto one last Hail Mary of a chance; just don't set yourself up for more disappointment, okay?
