 
Well folks -- it's official. The Everex / Packard Bell / FIC Nanobook / Cloudbook / CE260 (phew) that we recently got some face time with is actually coming Stateside... to Wal-Mart. That's right, the Eee crown-threatener will be available on January 25th of this year, featuring a 1.2GHz VIA C7-M CPU, 512MB of RAM, a 30GB hard drive, and a 800 x 480 display for the extra-affordable price of $399. The system will be sporting Everex's gOS Rocket, the Google-ified version of Ubuntu which powers the company's cheapo desktop. Watch your back, front, and sides, ASUS.
