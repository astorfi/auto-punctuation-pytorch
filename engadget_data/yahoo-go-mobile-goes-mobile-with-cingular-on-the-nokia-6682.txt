And how they'vepartnered with AT&T and Cingular to bring this mobile Yahoo vision to life, despite the fact that no one reallyseems to get what it is they're doing besides embedding some Y channels in cellphones? Well, it's live and officiallyannounced now, everyone, so soon in addition to MusicID and the load of other crap Cingular wants loaded up on yourNokia 6682, you'll have access to the integrated Yahoo web portal with mail, YIM, your addresses, photos (which we hopeincludes Flickr), and the like. Start your banjos everyone, it's time to go mobile with Yahoo Go Mobile.
