An admittedly creative video over at Sarcastic Gamer highlights the pitfalls (presumed or otherwise) of the unique invention, and spares no mercy in thoroughly blasting a Microsoft promotional spot in perfectly brash form. So if you've found yourself a bit too enamored with the Surface of late, be sure to leap on through for a impetuous reality check (or at least a good chuckle).[Via GamerTagRadio]
