We're not saying that the idea of 3D isn't cool, or that this is as bad as our father's 3D. What we're saying is we're not interested in wearing glasses that fit awkwardly and seeing various flickering artifacts on the screen. We can most definitely see the potential though if somehow the technology can evolve. But for now, even if anyone was actually announcing anything other than a proof of concept, we'd pass.
