We'd argue that an e-paper display is one feature you can use to make that distinction, which is exactly what Sony's added to its "lifelogging" SmartBand. A display isn't the only thing new about the SmartBand Talk, because as the name suggests, you can also make/take calls on the wearable thanks to an embedded microphone and loudspeaker. You can only do this when paired with a smartphone, of course, which will also respond to a limited number of other voice commands barked through the wearable. There's an ARM Cortex-M4 32-bit processor to power the whole thing, with 2MB of flash memory and that 1.4-inch black-and-white display to keep you updated on progress. As you might expect, a Core is at work here as well, with edge-mounted volume and menu buttons to round out the onboard controls. And yes, you can swap out the band as the need arises. The IP68 waterproof and dustproof wearable connects to any Android 4.4 (and above) device via NFC and Bluetooth to wrangle tasks for up to three days before needing a charge. If you're looking to get a bit more active, â‚¬160 (around $210) will be the cost of admission when the SmartBand Talk arrives this fall in four different color options.
