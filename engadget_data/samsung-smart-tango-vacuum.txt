 There's no doubt that Samsung's holding its juiciest bits for the stage in Vegas, but the company has been letting a few items slip on by, with an update to its robotic vacuum line representing the latest pre-CES tease. The Smart Tango Corner Clean maintains a traditional circular design, but includes the "world's very first pop-out brush," which enables the bot to whip debris out of corners and otherwise inaccessible spots along its mapped-out path. On the navigation front, the new cleaner appears to include Samsung's camera-equipped Visionary Mapping System, with a front-mounted lens. There's also a built-in LCD for programming and error code readouts, along with a handful of controls on the top and a standard removable dust bin in the rear. There's no hint of pricing or availability -- or even a model number to speak of -- but if you're in the market for an autonomous vac, you might as well hold out on your purchase for one more week.
