ASUS' ARES II features two AMD Radeon HD 7970 GHz Edition GPUs, and has a slimline two-slot design. The manufacturer claims it's the fastest graphics card available, outperforming the GeForce GTX 690 reference card by some 13 percent. There's 6GB of video memory, 1,100MHz boost clock, 1,050MHz base clock and 2 x 384-bit memory interface. If this sounds like something you just gotta have, then you'd better keep them eyes peeled, as upon release (no exact details on this just yet) it'll be a limited edition. Also limited are the details on price. Spin up the source for more info.
