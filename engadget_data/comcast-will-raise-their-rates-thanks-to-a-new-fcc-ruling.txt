Most industry experts were wondering how this was going to affect the current subscribers and just as we feared, rates are going up. Comcast is reporting via Multichannel News that instead of charging $2-$3 more for their digital subscribers, the company is going to spread that cost over their entire subscription base resulting in slight increases for everyone. Digital subscribers should like that idea but it sure sounds like the analog subs are taking one for the team. Here's the good news though, these costs will not hit your bill till 2008.
