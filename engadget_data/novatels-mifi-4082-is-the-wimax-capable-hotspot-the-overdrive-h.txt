Novatel, which took the mobile hotspot concept mainstream with its venerable MiFi line -- has been absent from the 4G race so far... but it looks like that's about to change. We just witnessed a so-called MiFi 4082 earn an FCC filing a few minutes ago, offering both CDMA / EV-DO and WiMAX in a single package, presumably prepping for a launch on Sprint to either replace or supplement the Overdrive. Considering the Overdrive's size, stability, and boot time, another entrant would be more than welcome -- and if Novatel can stuff all these radios into a package no larger or heavier than the original MiFi, we'll submit that they probably have a winner on their hands. Stay tuned for an announcement on this one -- CES, perhaps?
