  It's been nearly a year since Samsung first announced HBO Go access would be coming to its Smart TVs, and today the company announced on all forms of social media (Twitter, Facebook, Google+ -- there may be a YouTube video out there somewhere) it's finally available. Most should be familiar with HBO's TV Everywhere offering that opens its archives to users on various internet devices and has already been well received on iOS, Android and Roku platforms. The official HBO Go Twitter account mentions news on the Xbox 360 client is "coming soon" but for now subscribers can just grab the app and start watching -- with a few caveats.For reasons not mentioned, the HBO Go app doesn't play nicely with every Smart TV, with access available on all 2010 and 2011 models with the exception of several from last year (listed after the break). Also key to remember is that not every TV provider has given its blessing to allows customers access to HBO Go in the living room, so it seems Comcast, DirecTV and Time Warner customers are still out of luck. If you've got the right combo of service provider and hardware go forth and download from the Samsung Apps marketplace right now, we'll be busy trying to figure out where the old episodes of Arli$$ are.Update: As a few readers pointed out, DirecTV customers actually are able to access the service on Samsung TVs, and HBO representatives confirmed they should have access to the service, contrary to the list posted on the HBO support site. Stream on satellite subscribers, stream on, and if you notice any other discrepancies in the official lists let us know in the comments.
