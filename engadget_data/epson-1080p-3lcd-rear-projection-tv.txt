booth. The TV won't be out until fall of 2005 at the earliest, but Epson claimsÂ that using 3LCD gets you darker
black levels and more accurate colors than you'd get with a regular digital light projection display (peep the
comparison picture above, which pits DLP on the left against 3LCD on the right).
