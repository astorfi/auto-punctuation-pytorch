The two most anticipated smartphones of next week's IFA show, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and Sony Xperia Z1, haven't been officially announced, but neither manufacturer has made any secret of their existence. So, we aren't at all surprised to see that the two devices are starting to become common knowledge amongst the employees at various carriers. An anonymous tipster who claims to work for Three UK has sent us images of an internal doc which shows when the carrier will begin selling the pair of devices, with the Note 3 arriving on the 16th of September and the Z1 following on the 24th. Even if this is accurate, we still can't be sure Three will be the first to launch them -- nor can we account for any potential delays -- but it's at least a solid indicator that the phones will arrive sooner rather than later. We don't have much longer to wait before we find out, but it's something to chew on over the weekend.
