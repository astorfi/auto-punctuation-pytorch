We no longer take them seriously, but Infinium Labs, the company behind the all-too-appropriately named Phantom PC
video game console which never seems to materialize, says that they're setting a firm launch date of November 18th for
the console. If they do ever release the Phantom (which unlike the Xbox or the PS2 is designed specifically for playing
regular PC games), it looks like Infinium is going to take the unusual approach of giving the hardware away for free in
exchange for a two-year subscription to their download service which costs $29.95 a month (the console will cost $199
on its own) and'll let you rent or buy games online.
