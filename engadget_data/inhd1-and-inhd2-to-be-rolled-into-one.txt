       HDSportsguide.com is reporting that INHD1 and INHD2 will be rolled into one at the end of this year. As much as we hate to loose an HD channel we can see how this works for everyone. There really isn't enough original HD programming from iN DEMAND Netowkrs to justify two HD channels and maybe this will lead to more cable providers using the space from INHD2 for another HD channel.
