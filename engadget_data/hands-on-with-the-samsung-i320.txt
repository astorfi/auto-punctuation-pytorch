We got a chance to play around with the Samsung i320 not long thereafter, and we have to say, it was a mighty underwhelming experience dovetailing off the HTC. The screen feels much more cramped and offset a little high, and the keyboard was a big disappointment; each key is angled up in the center, making for a very strange, uncomfortable tactile feedback situation going on there. And that space bar is, in fact, a mite small. Ok, we'll stop with this one, but be forewarned, don't bet on this BlackJack.
