 Advertising is a lot like art -- ether ya get it or you don't. Apparently this Blu-ray ad is a bit over our heads as it just doesn't seem like a good way to promote one of the most exciting technical advancements of the last few years. In fact this advertisement may very well be one of the most boring marketing piece ever created. Seriously, how can Sony expect this to help the sales of the PS3 or Blu-ray? The whole concept is rather innovative showing a collector with lots of room for all of his crap (Blu-ray = lots of storage), but the implementation was very poor. The whole commercial drags on and on. Maybe we just don't get it. Do you?[Thanks, Andrew]
