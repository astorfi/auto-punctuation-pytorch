 This wasn'texactly the kind of peripheral we've been searching for to upgrade our Xbox 360s here around the office, but hey, ifyour box is overheating and you don't want to send it back to Redmond (or can't because of, um, certain "modifications"),check out Nyko's Intercooler. Yup, basically it's just a fan system for better ventilating your Xbox, but the $20 youspend here might might well extend the life of your early console. Then again it might not, and it could be anothereffective way to create some more fan noise in your livingroom. Win-win if you ask us.[Via I4U]
