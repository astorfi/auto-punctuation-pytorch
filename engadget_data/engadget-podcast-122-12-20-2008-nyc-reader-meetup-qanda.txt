 
With all the planning and rushing around, we thought we wouldn't get a chance to get a podcast out this week. Luckily, we had an amazing and candid time with readers during our Q&A at the reader meetup / holiday party -- and we recorded it! Check out the gang getting loose and nimble with our totally bodacious readership. We promise you'll be in serious like with it.

Hosts: Joshua Topolsky, Paul Miller, Nilay Patel, and Josh Fruhlinger
Producer: Trent Wolbe
Guests: Ryan Block, David Kim, ant man, CJ, Andy, Ryan, Tim, Freddy, Fernando, Sia, Dingo, Verse, William, Victorious, Faye.
