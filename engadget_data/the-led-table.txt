The annual International Contemporary Furniture Fair is styling it up in the NYC right now, and while so far we
haven't seen all that much stuff that we'd consider Engadget-worthy (you know what we're talking about),
Inhabitat did spot designer Ingo Maurer's new LED Table, a glass dining room
table that comes embedded with 278 white, blue, or red LEDs. The table is designed so that the LEDs don't look as if
they're wired up, something which gives them the appearance of simply floating in air.
