It also features a comparatively thin cable that promises to deliver fast charging at 480 volts, which, according to the company, should give the Model S an extra boost. When connected to a 240 volt outlet, the car will be able to re-juice at a rate of 62 miles of travel per hour of charging. And while its streamlined aesthetics may signal a shift away from the J1772, Tesla's new charger does feature standard connectors for 120 volt and 240 volt outlets, and will ship with an adapter for industry standard plugs. So why did the manufacturer choose to ignore the J1772? CEO Elon Musk certainly has his reasons. Speaking to the New York Times, Musk poetically described the standard connector as "absolutely terrible, extremely ugly and low power."
