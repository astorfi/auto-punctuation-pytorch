According to an email Apple's sending to pre-order customers, "wrapping up the new 17-inch MacBook Pro is taking a few days longer than we projected," and orders won't ship for another two weeks. Guess cramming all that fancy new sealed battery tech in that new unibody enclosure wasn't so easy, now was it? Full text of the email after the break.[Thanks, Roy]
      

 

-- To Our Valued Apple Customer: Thank you again for your order! Wrapping up the new 17-inch MacBook Pro is taking a few days longer than we projected. As a result, we will be unable to ship your 17-inch MacBook Pro until February 19, 2009. If you don't want to wait, you may cancel your order and receive a prompt refund by calling our toll-free customer service number at 800-676-2775 or by visiting our online order status website at http://www.apple.com/orderstatus. If we do not hear from you before we ship the 17-inch MacBook Pro to you, we will assume that you have agreed to this shipment delay. In that event, a shipment notification with tracking information will be emailed to you as soon as your order is shipped. Again, there is no need to contact us unless you wish to cancel your order. We appreciate your business and apologize for any inconvenience this delay may have caused you. Thank you for shopping at the Apple Online Store! Sincerely, The Apple Online Store
