This is the so-called real world, though, where a quick search on the internet will lead you to a cooked 6.5 ROM, and another search will instantly transport you into a magical universe of countless low-cost rips of your favorite name-brand handsets. It was just a matter of time before those two shady gray markets merged -- and, well, here you go. The Touch Viva knockoff is apparently based on a white-labeled Huawei platform that offers some sort of 460MHz core, quadband EDGE, a 3.2 megapixel cam, WiFi, and a 2.8-inch QVGA display. Given the forgettable design and spec sheet, we think you'd have to be extraordinarily hard up for 6.5 to bother dropping the requisite 1,099 yuan (about $161) -- but then again, you'd be making history with this one whether Microsoft likes it or not.[Via wmpoweruser.com]
