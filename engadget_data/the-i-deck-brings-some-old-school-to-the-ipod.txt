Among the copious quantities of accessories available for Apple's DAP, the DIY creations just seem to rock our world. The latest invention to surface, dubbed the I-Deck, is a fusion of old school and new, sure to impress even the most creative gadgeteers or 19th century aristocrats. Don't confuse this gramophone-record player hybrid with that other i-deck iPod dock; this elaborate sound system provides functionality even we find refreshing. Aside from pumping tunes through the fixated mono speaker, the I-Deck's LCD turntable displays the album art of the current track while doubling as an enlarged iPod scroll-wheel to let that inner DJ kick out the jams. Although this isn't available to the masses (yet), we think creator Michael Kennedy has masterminded quite the show-stopper sure to rope in all manner of retro-futurist nerds.
