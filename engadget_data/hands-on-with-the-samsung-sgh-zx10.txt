Nah, this one isn't quite as slick as that SPH-A900 we
spotted at Samsung's media event last night, but we did also have a chance to lay our hands on the
SGH-ZX10 and confirm what we sorta already figured out
the other day: that sooner or later this badboy will be bringing the HSDPA love to Cingular. Samsung wasn't exactly
forthcoming regarding specs, but they did list it as having a built-in digital camera (which is pretty much a given
these days on phones like this whether you like it or not) and MP3 player software. Otherwise we weren't too blown
away, although the screen on the SGH-ZX10 was definitely nice and bright.


UPDATE: Ok, looks like the ZX10 might have UMTS and not HSDPA.
