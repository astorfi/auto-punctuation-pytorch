Nokia's first to answer the call with an NFC-enabled version of the standard-duty 6131 clamshell, aptly named the 6131 NFC. An N76 it's not, but it still gets the job done with FM radio, microSD expansion, Bluetooth, and a 1.3 megapixel cam -- and, of course, that all-important NFC hardware for quick payments, wireless contact info exchange, or whatever nifty use cases the NFC folks can dream up. The 6131 drops this quarter for around $340 before carrier (and when we say "carrier," we think we probably mean "Cingular") subsidies.
