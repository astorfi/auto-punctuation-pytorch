 
Well, that was fast. Not long after we saw Dell's 7-inch tablet earn its WiFi certification, we happened upon a treatment for its in-production commercial -- exhausted Android mascot and all. Of course the video'll touting the gaming, social, and internet capabilities, but it's also got Blio reader, Stage UI (same skin as the 5-inch Streak), the new campaign slogan ("You can tell [it's] Dell"), and yes, even a name: Streak 7, as said by the voice over. Not the most original, but when you got a brand, might as well keep it going. Looks like we've got something else to keep an eye out for when CES rolls around in a few weeks. Peep the treatment for yourself below.
