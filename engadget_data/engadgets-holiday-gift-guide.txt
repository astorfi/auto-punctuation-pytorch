We know as well as anyone what an insane mess it is shopping for tech gifts for your friends and family this time of year, so we're going to do our best to simplify the process. We've hand-selected a slew of gadgets and written a number of gift guides to help you make it through alive. We'll post a new one every few days throughout November and December; each guide will to help you pick the perfect gadgety gift for a different person in your life (today we're starting with him, and in a few days we'll go to her, then son, daughter, mom, dad, and so on).Our each of our guides will be broken down by price to help you shop for what you can afford. As you're well aware, when shopping on the internet, prices can vary wildly, so please remember that some listed prices may be approximated. We know tech toys often don't come cheap, but with any luck you'll swoop into 2007 with some very happy giftees and a bank account not too depleted to miss out on getting yourself a little something after CES. Enjoy, and happy holidays!Sincerely,Your pals EngadgetP.S. -If you have any hot suggestions we may have missed, please don't hesitate to let us know in the comments!The guides: for him, for her, for son, for daughter, for dad, for mom, for colleague.
