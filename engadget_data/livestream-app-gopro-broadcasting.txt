Typically, streaming live footage from an action camera requires a PC to provide the internet connection. That's not exactly an option when you're flying off a cliff in a wingsuit. Livestream just made it a lot easier to share your adventures with the world, however. Its newest iOS app now lets you broadcast video from GoPro Hero cameras anywhere you have a good data connection; so long as you can fit an iPhone in your pocket, your friends can see that thrilling BASE jump or bike ride in real-time. There's no word of GoPro support on Android, but it won't be surprising if there's a corresponding update before long.
