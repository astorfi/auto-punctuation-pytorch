The possibility of posting under the influence aside, Bay -- like many Blu-ray supporters -- is gloating after the latest dramatic announcement from Warner. Not only does he think that HD DVD will die a slow death, but also states "Blu ray is just better." He then urges his fans to "Have faith people Transformers will come out in Blu-ray one day!" Yeah ok, Michael we get it, but we wonder how you could've left out "You're my boy blue!"
