       In Demand president Rob Jacobson confirmed the rumors we've been hearing about INHD, INHD2 will shut down January 1st and merge its programming with INHD1. There's also "a good chance" that the singular channel will adopt the name of its current primetime programming block, Mojo. The network is also considering adding additional nights of original programming to the Mojo block. More original HDTV shows, less Tour de Gorge should make everyone happy, we think.[Thanks, Chris]
