Rounding out Verizon's new crop of smartphones is the Droid Mini, which promises to be "compact without compromise," following the well-trodden path of Samsung's smaller Galaxy phones. The Mini has a 4.3-inch screen, making the new Droid bigger than an iPhone but smaller than the other new Droids. As with those bigger devices, you'll get the new Droid Command Center homescreen widget with access to notifications, weather updates and more, as well as quick capture to take photos with a double-shake. You'll also get some deeper Google Now integration, including a new "call my Droid" action that will ring your phone if you ever lose it -- within shouting range, presumably. So far, we know it'll be priced at $99, with sales beginning on August 29th, but we'll be back soon with a hands-on post (and presumably, more specs to go with it).

Update: Pre-orders for the device are now live, and with them, the phone's complete specs. Those include a 1.7GHz dual-core processor, 16GB of onboard storage (with 2GB of RAM), a 2,130mAh battery and a 10-megapixel camera with 1080p video capture.
