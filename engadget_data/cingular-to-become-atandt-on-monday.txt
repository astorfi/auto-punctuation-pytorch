 Now that Cingular's co-owners have been united in holy matrimony, it looks like AT&T is wasting no time in killing off the brand to replace it with its own. Like, no time at all -- in fact, ComputerWorld is reporting that AT&T will begin using dual Cingular/AT&T branding this coming Monday. The new scheme will be used for some as-yet-undetermined period of time until everyone feels comfortable that the general populace understands what exactly has become of the nation's largest GSM carrier, at which point the AT&T name'll go it alone. So if anyone out there still has an old-skool AT&T Wireless handset kicking around, here's your opportunity to pull it back out and feel cool again.[Thanks, Sam K. and jetfxr]
