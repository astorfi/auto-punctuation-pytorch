While other airlines throughout Europe are racing to offer in-flight calling for shorter trips, Lufthansa says that "the vast majority told us they don't want this feature," which makes sense, since no one likes a loud-talker in an enclosed space. Instead, the Cologne-based company is rolling out a service which will allow broadband connections for laptops, text-messaging on phones, and wireless email (and data, we assume) on hand-helds, similar to recent offerings we've seen from other carriers. Of course, Lufthansa's passengers could still be annoyed by chatter if someone gets clever and decides to rock Skype on a trans-atlantic trip -- unless the airline has plans for blocking VoIP. Only they know for sure.
