Forget SwiftKey and Swype, Google's bringing its own keyboard to the Android masses. As of today, users looking for an alternative to their OEM or third-party typing solution can head to Play and download the keyboard (supports Android 4.0 and up) for a "Nexus typing experience." And don't worry if you've gotten used to that swipe-to-text flow on that smartphone or tablet, that's all still here, though Google calls its implementation Gesture Typing. There's also access to Voice Typing, word prediction and correction, in addition to dictionary support for 26 languages. So if you've been harboring Nexus envy and want to bring that skinned device closer to Google's pure vision, now you have a partial fix.
