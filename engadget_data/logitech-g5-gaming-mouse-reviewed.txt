If you liked the
Logitech G15 gaming keyboard that we featured earlier
today, then you'll probably want to check out its little brother, the G5 gaming mouse. Like most recent pointers of
note (though not Apple's much-hyped
Mighty Mouse), this one's a
laser mouse, which gives it ultra-high
resolution and sensitivity (2000 dpi in this case). Other features include custom weights, so you can adjust the
balance to your comfort, and three sensitivity levels. ExtremeTech put one through the old click-and-drag drill, and
found that "the movement of the G5 is smoother and more precise than any other mouse we've tested." Want one? Be
prepared to spend $80, or about $100 for the wireless G7, which has most of the same features but cuts the cord.
