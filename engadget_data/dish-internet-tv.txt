How do you fight cord-cutters? Offer an internet streaming service with all of cable TV's best content. It sounds like a bit of a stretch, but it could be happening: the distribution deal that settled Disney and Dish's ad-skipping dispute also gave the TV-provider the rights to stream Disney-owned channels over the internet. Sources close to Bloomberg are now saying that Dish is hoping to launch the service before the end of the summer.



According to Bloomberg, Dish is currently in talks with CBS, NBCUniversal and other major content providers to create a package it can sell to a younger audience -- 18 to 34 year olds who aren't willing to pay cable prices for cable content. Sources familiar with the talks say that several larger networks are holding out until Dish can can promise that at least two major networks will be on board. It's a challenge, but doable: Dish's deal with Disney already gives it access to ABC, the Disney Channel and content from ESPN. The company has reportedly made strong progress securing the rights to broadcast NBC channels too, which could add the USA network, Bravo or E! to the internet-package. We've reached out to Dish for more information, but don't get too excited: the company already declined to comment to Bloomberg writers.
