Lots of the expected stuff here, like Brushes, Twitteriffic, and the Wall Street Journal app, but there's a few things we're definitely interested in playing with, like the Desktop Connect VNC client, the ABC Player, and quite a few apps focused on printing. Yes, printing -- apparently the ability to print a document from the iPad will cost you at least $2, and probably more like $5. Magical and revolutionary, indeed. There's tons to look at, so hit the source link and let us know if you see anything interesting in comments.
