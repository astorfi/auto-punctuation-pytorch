       TheToronto Star is reporting that the biggest city in Canada (that would be Toronto) is about to get blanketed in WiFigoodness, joining such US cities as Philadelphia and San Francisco with similarlyambitious municipal broadband initiatives. Mayor David Miller is expected to announce the project in conjunction withToronto Hydro, who had previously bought 18,000 street lamps around the city for $60 million, and which will be usedpartly to help the water utility fulfill a mandate requiring it to deploy remotely-readable smart meters. No detailsare available yet regarding proposed pricing structures or benefits to the city such as reduced-cost access forlow-income households, but the project already has some detractors who question the appropriateness of governmentinvolvement in citywide mesh networks. Also keeping a close eye on developments are major Canadian telecom players suchas Rogers, Bell, and Tellus, whose own wired and wireless broadband services could be threatened by Toronto Hydro'snetwork.[Thanks, Ted]
