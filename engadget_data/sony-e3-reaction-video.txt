Sony's E3 press conference kicked off with a bang -- The Last Guardian is on its way to PlayStation 4 in 2016. After that, the rest of the show was gravy, including a fantastic-looking remake of Final Fantasy 7 and the fairly shocking announcement of Shenmue 3's $2 million Kickstarter (which is totally funded by now). We took a minute right after the showcase to break down the major announcements; join us in the video above.
