 Remember how we told you that Sony had hinted that "DRM would become less important" just a few days ago? Well, it appears that Stan Glasgow's quip wasn't just empty rhetoric. Late last night the wires lit up with reports that EMI Music has begun selling music tracks sans DRM for a buck apiece from Yahoo's online music service, becoming one of the few major labels to take the plunge into unrestricted territory. Of course, Sony dabbled with DRM-free tunes this past summer by releasing a song by Jessica Simpson, and Disney released an entire album by Jesse McCartney -- so consider these baby steps, folks. Meanwhile, if you want DRM-free music from the iTunes Store, you'll have to do it the old-fashioned way.[Thanks, aneet]
