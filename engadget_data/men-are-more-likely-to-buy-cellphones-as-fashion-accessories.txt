Now here's a bit of a shocker: a recent study concluded that (young) males are more likely to buy cellphones as
fashion accessories than their female counterparts, who were stated to look first towards safety and security. So the
men are seeking status and the women are practical and seek security? What is this, a beginner's course on gender
stereotyping? You know, nevermind, we're not even going to touch this one.
