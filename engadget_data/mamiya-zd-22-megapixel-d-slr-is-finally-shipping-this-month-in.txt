Mamiya first announced their 22 megapixel ZD medium format digital-SLR more than a year
ago and it's finally going to ship, a bit late, but hey
this one is worth the wait. This professional-level shooter is up for pre-order (grrr, in Japan only apparently) for
delivery on the 21st. Oh, did we mention it'll set you back a cool $10,844 US green equivalent? But this is for pros,
son, and features a 14-bit A/D converter recording 12-bit images at 1.5fps, CF and SD storage, 1.8-inch LCD and
FireWire support. 12
megapixels
or less is just so yesterday.
