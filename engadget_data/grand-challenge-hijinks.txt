Reading like a robotic comedy of errors, DARPA has produced a masterfully
understated official summary of the performance of each of the teams participating in yesterday's Grand Challenge.
Some highlights:



Vehicle 22 - Red Team - At mile 7.4. Vehicle went off course, got caught on an obstacle and rubber on the
 front wheels caught fire, which was quickly extinguished. Vehicle has been disabled.




Vehicle 21- SciAutonicsII - At mile 6.7. Vehicle went into an embankment and became stuck.  Vehicle has
 been disabled, and the team is recovering it.




Vehicle 5 - Team Caltech - At mile 1.3.  Vehicle went through a fence, and couldn't come back through. 
 Vehicle has been disabled, and the team is recovering it.




Vehicle 7 - Digital Auto Drive - At mile 6.0.  Vehicle was paused to allow a wrecker to get through, and,
 upon restarting, sensors were not able to determine the proper route.  After sensors tried unsuccessfully for
 three hours, vehicle was disabled. 




Vehicle 25 - Virginia Tech - Vehicle brakes locked up in the start area. Vehicle has been removed from
 the course.




Vehicle 23 - Axion Racing - Vehicle circled the wrong way in the start area. Vehicle has been removed from
 the course.




Vehicle 2 - Team CajunBot - Vehicle brushed a wall on its way out of the chute.  Vehicle has been removed
 from the course.




Vehicle 4 - Team CIMAR - At mile 0.45. Vehicle ran into some wire and got totally wrapped up in
 it. Vehicle has been disabled.




Vehicle 20 – Team TerraMax – Got to mile 1.2.  Vehicle then started backing up and after .5 miles, the
 vehicle was disabled. 



You can't make this stuff up!
