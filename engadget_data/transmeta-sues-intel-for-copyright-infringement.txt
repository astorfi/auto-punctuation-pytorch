 Oh Transmeta, we remember you when you were the darling of Silicon Valley -- yes, the same company that attracted Linus Torvalds and the attention of Microsoft. But apparently Transmeta's designs were so good that Intel copied them (specifically some relating to such nebulous IP holdings as "computer architecture" and "power efficiency") without asking first, resulting in Transmeta filing suit against Intel. According to an account in the EE Times: "The complaint charges that Intel has infringed and is infringing Transmeta's patents by making and selling a variety of microprocessor products, including at least Intel's Pentium III, Pentium 4, Pentium M, Core and Core 2 product lines." Given Intel's recent success, it seems like a possible legal ploy to get at Intel's coffers -- especially considering the bouts with restructuring Transmeta's had in the past couple years.[Via Slashdot]
