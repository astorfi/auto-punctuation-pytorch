       Ok, here we go again, the Apple Store is down in the US and Canada, only. While 90% of the time we're looking at product updates, there's always the chance that Apple's performing routine maintenance or making such minor tweaks that there's no discernible impact to the fanboy radar. We'll see in an hour or two when the site comes back online. So why not sound-off in the comments with your best guesses 'til then.Update: Well, after what was at least a year long ratio of 1 to 1 store outages to new product announcements, Apple has now taken their store down twice only to return with minor changes, if any. Apple hopeful will now have to turn their sites to August 7th for that rumored iMac / iLife release.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
