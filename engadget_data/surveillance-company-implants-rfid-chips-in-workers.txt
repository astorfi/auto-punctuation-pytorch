 Sure, implanting an RFID chip in your workers might inciteprivacy concerns, be a tad creepy, and signal the end of days, but we can't help but raise the awesome flag forCityWatcher.com and their efforts to borgify the workplace. Apparently they have planted chips in the upper right armsof two employees assigned to the secure vault which holds the security footage captured by the company, and while itseems like a bit of a PR stunt more than a security measure, the RFID chips are required to access the room, so atleast they're not kidding around.
