2.8-inch VGA display
WinMo 6.1 Pro
WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0
eGPS, FM tuner
Quad-band HSDPA 7.2
4GB internal flash, microSD slot
528MHz CPU
3.2 megapixel camera with autofocus
10.7mm (0.47-inches) thick
Supposedly also features an orientation sensor / accelerometer

Whether it's got a QWERTY keyboard could still be up for grabs, especially since that configuration might belong to the CDMA-based Raphael. Still, the it makes sense HTC wouldn't want the XPERIA X1 they made for Sony Ericsson to be their best engineered device on the market for long. We'll be watching this one closely.[Thanks, Kevin]
