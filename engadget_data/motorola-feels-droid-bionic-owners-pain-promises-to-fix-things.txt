Motorola, however, is apparently aware of Droid Bionic owners' woes and is working on a plan to make things right. At least that's what Punit Soni, VP of Product at Motorola Mobility, is promising owners of the device on his Google+ page. Faced with complaints ranging from the Bionic's locked bootloader to its delayed ICS update, a contrite Soni admitted that Droid Bionic owners got a "raw deal" and promised their feedback "will not fall on deaf ears." He then said that the company has a plan for the device and that he is "currently solidifying things to ensure we can publish it, commit and follow up." Soni did not provide specifics on what those plans are though you have to admit that the guy's candor about the Bionic's issues is refreshing. In the meantime, the phone's ICS upgrade is now slated to roll out in Q4. Bionic owners who want to add their proverbial two cents to the conversation can hit up the source link below.
