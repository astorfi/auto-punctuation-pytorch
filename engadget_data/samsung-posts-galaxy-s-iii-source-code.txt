 
 That was fast: just a few days after the Galaxy S III reached buyers' eager hands, Samsung has posted the phone's source code. Its dutiful clinging to Google's Android guidelines opens the floodgates to custom ROMs as well as a better sense of what makes Samsung's Android 4.0 variant tick. As you'd anticipate, the code is only valid for the international GT-i9300 version. North American models, for the time being, are left out. Still, the source is useful for most anyone that wants to tinker with what should be the most ubiquitous Google-powered phone of the year, so get to downloading if that sounds like you.
