We kicked this around last year(and then we got kicked around in thecomments) when discussing "Truth inAdvertising". On on hand folks believe that any display that can show 720 horizontal lines qualifies ashigh-def, meaning that XGA (or 1024 x 768) should be considered high-def. Our contention is that XGA is a computerresolution and that the more traditional 1280 x 720 (or higher) would be required for the HD moniker. We'll be runninga poll on this one later today, but before we do, take a look at Henning's thoughts over at HDBlog for his insights onthe subject.
