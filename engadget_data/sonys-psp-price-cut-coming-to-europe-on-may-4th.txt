As these things tend to fall, Europe is getting similar treatment as the US (albeit in a slightly later fashion), as the price of the PlayStation Portable will soon be descending to £130 / €170 (between $231 and $260) across the lake. Additionally, several Platinum titles will be taking a nosedive right along with it, as Ridge Racer 2, Tekken, Killzone, LocoRoco, and Moto GP all sink to £14.99 ($30). Hold your horses before skipping out of work and ripping our your credit card, though, as the price drops aren't slated to take effect until May 4th -- but we'd still recommend keeping a close eye out, as we know all too well how those street dates can fall through hold up.[Via Joystiq]
