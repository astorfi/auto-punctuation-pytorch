 While Sony and AMEX Digital have already busted out Blu-ray-equipped media PCs, it looks like Okoro Media Systems is finally making the leap, too. Just a few months after stuffing Core 2 Duo chips in its machines, the company has now unveiled the OMS-BX100 and OMS-BX300 HTPCs, which both sport Blu-ray drives and HDPC-compliant 1080p outputs. The thinner, sleeker BX100 packs an Intel T7200 Core 2 Duo processor, 2GB of DDR2 RAM, front panel LCD, optional 7-inch touchscreen, 500GB SATA hard drive, ATI X1600 PRO 256MB PCI-e graphics card, built-in TV tuner, and the usual complement of ports including 4-pin FireWire, audio in / out, USB 2.0, and just about every video output imaginable. The larger, more feature-packed BX300 houses an Intel 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo E6600 processor, 2GB of memory, a terabyte of internal storage, NVIDIA GeForce 7600 256MB PCI-e graphics set, dual OTA tuners, and touts the same port selection as its smaller sibling. Both units come with your choice of operating system and HTPC software, and while both boxes are available now, the low-profile BX100 starts at $2,995, and the beefed-up BX300 will set you back $3,495 (or much, much more).[Via eHomeUpgrade]
