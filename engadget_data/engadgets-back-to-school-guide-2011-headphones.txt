The S5i takes the same internals and packs 'em into an adventure-ready, rugged and moisture-resistant package, so you won't need to worry if you spill some brewsky water on them.

 Key specs: Ruggedized rubber design, moisture-resistant in-line remote / mic and driver housings

 Price: $104 on Amazon
