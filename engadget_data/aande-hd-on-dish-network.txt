       While DirecTV loves to make promises of their new HD channels, DISH continues to deliver the most HD channels available and today they increased that by one with the addition of A&E HD. Now DISH Network viewers can enjoy CSI: Miami in HD over and over again. For those who don't have A&E HD yet it is a simulcast of A&E and not all the programming is in HD, including The Sopranos. The good news is they don't stretch all their SD programming or claim that it's all HD in the guide.[Thanks, Frankie!]
