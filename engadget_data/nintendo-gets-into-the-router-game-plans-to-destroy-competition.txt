Just like every other router ever. Only this one is cheap, cute and built by Nintendo, so watch out Linksys / Netgear / everybody. The "Nintendo WiFi Network Adapter," meant to supplement 2005's WiFi USB Connector, looks to be Japan-only at the moment, and is due for a September 18th release.[Thanks, Sanimir]
