Now the Vision:W itself has hit newsstands in the latest issue of Popular Mechanics magazine. Featured most prominently is the 4.3-inch widescreen, which Pop Mech calls "the best screen we've seen on a portable media player." High praise indeed. It looks like the standard bevy of Creative codec support is going to be evident here, and the prices aren't too bad neither: $399 for the 30GB version, $499 for 60GB (OK, not exactly free). Of course, that "W" stands for widescreen, not wireless, but the Zune won't have nothing on this screen, so it's really a different game entirely.
