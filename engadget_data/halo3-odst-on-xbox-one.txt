If you've stuck with Halo: The Master Chief Collection this long you deserve a reward, and folks who played during the game's disastrous launch window last year will soon have theirs. As a 343 Industries rep writes on Halo Waypoint, the promised, free Halo 3: ODST expansion is "on track" to be part of next month's content update. Beyond that, the patch also adds the revamped "Relic" multiplayer map into the fold. Remember -- ODST isn't a total overhaul along the lines of Halo 2, it's just the old game running at 1080p and 60 FPS. "Relic," however is getting the full remaster treatment and even a new name that'll be revealed at a later date. For the rest of this month's patch notes, be sure to hit the links below.
