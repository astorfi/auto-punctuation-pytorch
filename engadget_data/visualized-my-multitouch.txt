 Museum owners, public officials and design studio heads are just the sort who would have an excuse to splash out on one of MyMultitouch's displays. The 84-inch PixelSense-esque table is designed to be used by up to 32 fingers at once, letting groups paw around interactive exhibits on a large scale. This one, in particular, comes with a 3,840 x 2,160 UHD display, infrared-based multitouch and a steel stand that lets you mount it at a wide variety of angles. Since it's driven by any PC with a 4K-outputting graphics card, you could even use it as your own desktop display, although you'd need to drop â‚¬33,000 ($43,100), plus whatever an 84-inch desk would set you back.
