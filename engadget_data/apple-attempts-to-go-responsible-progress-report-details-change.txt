  Apple had a few issues with its suppliers this year and has published its annual Supplier Responsibility Progress Report today. The company has apparently schooled more than a million "supply chain employees" on rights and health and safety, while it has also began a specific environmental compliance program for some of its suppliers in China, having spotted several violations last year -- which it's now working on. Perhaps more interestingly, this notes the first time that Apple has revealed all 156 of its suppliers in full. The report (unsurprisingly) reads like exercise in backslapping, but if you're into that sort of thing, you can check the whole report at the source.Update: MacRumors has published Tim Cook's team-wide email on the matter.
