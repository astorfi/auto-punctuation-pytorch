Andlucky us, apparently at least one such system will be shown this week at CeBIT developed by none other than Fraunhofer: the aptly and succinctly dubbed Brain ComputerInterface (we'd prefer something a little snappier, say, like the Computer Brain Interface, but whatevs). Thesystem reads brain-waves from 128 scalp electrodes -- very slowly, mind you -- and apparently over the last couple ofyears they've already honed the device to control a pointer and enable trained users to actually write a sentence withtheir mind alone (even though it may take between five and ten minutes to do so).[Via Popgadget]
