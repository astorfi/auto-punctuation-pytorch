Fallout 4 is coming to Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC, and so far, this is what it looks like. First, the rumors are true: Fallout 4 is set in Boston, as demonstrated by scenes from an alternate-universe Scollay Square, the real-life Boston city center established in 1838 and demolished in 1962, plus other landmarks in the video. Second: That voice you hear is definitely series narrator Ron Perlman. Bethesda's 24-hour Fallout 4 teaser site hit zero this morning, revealing a trailer and pre-order links, plus a nudge to tune into the company's presentation at E3 on June 14th. The teaser site also went live a tad early, letting the world peek platform details and a few screenshots ahead of the actual announcement. Watch the first Fallout 4 trailer below.
