The bar's been raised peopleâ€”now that your room can (and thusly should)
dynamically match your style, so should also your
furniture. E-ink dyed fabric for your Knoll sofa
might still be a ways off, but the Chameleon looks mighty slick even when it's not mimicing the tones you feed it. Just
one of many concept devices you can find over Royal Philips way, who we'd actually really like to spin biz off and
actually start making these.


P.S. +5 Magritte points awarded to Philips for that photo.
