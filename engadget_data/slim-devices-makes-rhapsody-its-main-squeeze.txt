 Squeezebox owners, listen up! If you've been pining away over Rhapsody access on your Slim Devices music streamers, your time has finally come. the release of SlimServer 6.3 and a Squeezebox firmware upgrade enable Squeezebox 2 and 3 owners to use the service like those Sonos-using next-door neighbors; too bad those Sonos loving friends of theirs they haven't yet gotten their PlaysForSure on like Slim, but hey, as far as Rhapsody support we're just about all on level ground now.[Via eHomeUpgrade]
