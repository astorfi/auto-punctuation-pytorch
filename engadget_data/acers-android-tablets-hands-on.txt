The 10.1-inch, dual-core Tegra-powered version was the only unit that would power on, and though we did get to see it blaze through some HD video, for the most part it was very sluggish and clearly acting like a pre-production unit. As far as the hardware goes, the display was bright and surprisingly had decent viewing angles. Acer's been notorious for using terrible LCDs, so this is quite a nice change! Oh, and as you already knew, it does have two cameras. 

We eventually convinced a very nice Acer rep on hand to bring out the 4.8- and 7-inch devices for a hardware demo -- both of them were also very early units, but they did look nice from afar with glossy black screens and brushed metal backs. The phonlet's 4.8-inch, 1024 x 480-resolution screen (it has a 21:9 aspect ratio!) makes it much wider than a Streak, and reminded us a lot of the LG GW900 (may it rest in peace). We told you we didn't have much in the way of impressions, but hit the gallery below for some more hands-on shots and the break for a quick video of the 10-incher in action. April can't come soon enough, can it?
