No close call here: Razer's Nabu wearable accounted for nearly 50 percent of the 54,511 reader votes. We'd venture to say that Razer's promotion of its finalist selection had something to do with the overwhelming turnout, but the company couldn't pull off such a landslide victory without an extremely enthusiastic fan base. Though it didn't snag our award for Best Digital Health and Fitness Product, the Nabu is pretty cool; it sports two OLED displays rather than the standard one, and Razer's planning to add some of its gaming roots to the activity tracker with augmented-reality applications. Congratulations, Razer, and enjoy your 3D-printed trophy!
