The flying toasters and infinite space your sleeping computer's been living with are being retired. No, After Dark isn't being resurrected and, well, does Windows even come with a screen saver built-in anymore? It's Google, and specifically the Trends section of Google, that's leading the bleeding edge of screen saver tech: Mac users can now download a Trends-driven screen saver that...yep, it culls trending Google topics and pushes them to your screensaver. It's quite pretty! Head over here to grab it for yourself.
