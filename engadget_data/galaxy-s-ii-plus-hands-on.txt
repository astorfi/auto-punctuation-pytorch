 As ubiquitous as Samsung's Galaxy S II is, we imagined that its influence would wane in the face of the S III and whatever we see in a week's time. The Korean behemoth has other ideas, once again refreshing the former flagship to ensure it'll remain on store shelves as an increasingly lower-end option. Inside you've got a 1.2GHz dual-core Broadcom CPU, 1GB RAM and Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean). There's also a 4.3-inch WVGA (800 x 480) display, 8-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 2-megapixel lens up top, as well as GSM and HSPA+ support. How does it compare to the original? Well, it felt a lot more responsive and snappy than when we handled the Galaxy S II last, but part of that is likely due to the new Android Jelly Bean OS' buttery-smooth scrolling. Otherwise, it handled and behaved much like Samsung's aging 'droid hit. The case has now been sanded-down to reflect the company's more natural, Galaxy S III-based design cues, so if you fancy a short game of spot the difference, you can check out the gallery.
