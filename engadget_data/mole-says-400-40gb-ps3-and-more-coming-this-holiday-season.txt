 This one's firmly in the rumor category, but Ars Technica is reporting that its "mole" had gotten wind of some fairly big plans Sony has in store for this holiday season, not the least of which is a new 40GB PlayStaiton 3 that would retail for $400. What's more, this source says that Sony will also be dropping the price of the 80GB PS3 to $500, and that one or both will come bundled with a Blu-ray version of Spider-Man 3. If that's not enough, Ars Technica is also reporting that Sony will be dropping the price of the tried and true PS2 to a mere $100, which is a rather roundabout way to ensure backwards compatibility but a welcome price drop nonetheless. While Sony's obviously remaining mum on the matter, as both Ars and Joystiq point out, the Tokyo Game Show later this month would seem to be a likely opportunity for it to get official with things, if it in fact has anything to get official with.[Via Joystiq]
