Sony knows that high-speed internet access is vital to the PS4's success, but that level of service isn't always guaranteed in Europe. To solve this problem, the company is striking deals for PS4-friendly internet access with a slew of European providers. Ono, Orange, T-Mobile and Virgin Media are some of the first confirmed partners. Details of the partnerships are scarce at present, although the companies involved suggest that Sony's ISP agreements will at least cover bigger European countries like France, Germany, Spain and the UK.


Update: Virgin Media adds that it's the only UK partner.
