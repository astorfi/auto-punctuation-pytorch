The company's Senior Director of Consumer PCs and Tablets for Asia-Pacific, Yam Su Yin, has told The Indian Express that HP isn't done with smartphones and is already working on a new device. While its focus (for now) remains on tablets, laptops and its all-in-ones, it's wisely decided not to ignore the ever-increasing influence of smartphones, despite that whole messy Palm saga. When asked about a chances of a future HP smartphone, she said: "The answer is yes but I cannot give a timetable. It would be silly if we say no. HP has to be in the game."


"Being late you have to create a different set of proposition[s]. There are still things that can be done. It's not late. When HP has a smartphone, it will give a differentiated experience." We'd put money on an Android device being in the works, given several of HP's recent product launches, but to compete in the increasingly two-horse smartphone race, HP will have to ensure that its "differentiated experience" offers something pretty pervasive to win over customers.
