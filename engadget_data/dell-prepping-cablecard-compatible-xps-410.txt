 So Vista's been out for a little over a month now, yet hardware supporting one of its most anticipated features -- CableCARD compatibility -- is still nowhere to be found; we'd assumed that big names like Niveus and VidaBox would have had products ready at launch, but apparently the certification process is taking longer than they anticipated. Well the good news is that at least one manufacturer is planning to offer a compatible box in the near future: PC Magazine reports that Dell just sent them a pre-production XPS loaded up with ATI's TV Wonder Digital Cable tuner (external or internal is not made clear). The brief teaser article doesn't mention anything about a possible launch window, though, so don't go tossing your Series3 TiVo out just yet.[Via Gearlog]
