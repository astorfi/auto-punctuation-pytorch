 Intel just took the official wraps off their Canmore HDTV system on chip described as a "CE system and an Internet system." Available in the second half of 2008, it will feature a powerful PC-class processor core with "leading edge" A/V processing that can plan 1080p video and serve up 3-D graphics with 7.1 surround sound. Expect to see them in future set-top boxes, media players, and TVs.
