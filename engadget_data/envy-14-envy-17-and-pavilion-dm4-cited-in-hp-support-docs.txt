"HP Support Assistant CVA documentation, SP47326â€³ includes references to both, meaning that a release is either in the works or someone in support is jumping the gun a bit. If that ain't enough for your casual Friday kicks, a perusal of a little something called "LightScribe System Software CVA documentation, SP47798" (that one's our fave) even mentions the HP Pavilion dm4, which SlashGear describes as a possible "14-inch machine with integrated optical drive, switchable graphics and a choice of Intel or AMD processors." Of course, there is no indication when, or if these models will ever see the light of day -- but if you were in desperate need for a device to fill the gab between your 13-inch and 15-inch HP Envy laptops, there is at least hope.
