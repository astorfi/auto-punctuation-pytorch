The new Nexus 7's official unveiling might still be a few days away, but impatient tablet fans can get a peek right now: @evleaks seems to have come across the alleged device's official press render. The image doesn't do much to confirm the 7-inch tablet's internal specifications, but what we can see matches previous leaks, giving us a clearer view of the device's rumored 5MP rear-facing camera and and a branded backside -- now lacking the dimples of the original. A pair of speakers can be seen on the rear's north and south ends and volume, power and a microphone input line the tablet's right edge.


On the front we can see an offset front-facing shooter, an underlining notification LED and what is most likely Android 4.3. Although the press shot doesn't reveal anything about the device's screen, a Best Buy ad featuring it pegs it as a 1,920 x 1,200 display, pricing the 16GB variant of the upcoming tablet at $229 --$40 less than the reported price of the slate's 32GB model. Phone Arena says the leaked ad is scheduled to run next week, placing the circular's promised Tuesday availability for the Nexus 7 on July 30th. We'll wait for Google to give us the full story on the 24th before jumping the gun, but if you just can't wait, feel free to ogle Best Buy's unreleased insert after the break.


Update: Android Police has nine additional press shots, showing a clearer view of the device's sides (and SIM card slot) as well as an updated background. Check them out at the source link below.
