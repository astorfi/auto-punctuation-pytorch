Well, you'll be glad to hear that Vodafone's Xperia Arc S page has now gone live, and we've confirmed with the UK phone network that the curvy smartphone will also be available in-store from tomorrow. Signing up for a two year plan at Â£31 per month nets you the gradient blue version for free. Aside from a new super-charged 1.4GHz processor and a "3D sweep panorama" mode, other specs are all-but identical to the original. Certainly not a deal-breaker, with an Exmor-equipped 8.1 megapixel shooter and that 4.2-inch Reality Display both squeezed into its very pocketable profile. So, please form a orderly queue at your nearest Vodafone store if that sounds like your thing -- or you could just click on the link below.
