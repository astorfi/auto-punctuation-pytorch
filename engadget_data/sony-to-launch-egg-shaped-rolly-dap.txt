'Course, this form factor certainly isn't new for a DAP, but it sounds like Sony may be giving it a whirl with the introduction of the "Rolly." Supposedly, a snippet of the video is displayed above, but it sure doesn't expose much. Little is currently known (or presumed) about the device at the moment, but we are hearing that it will boast an integrated speaker for whatever that's worth. We'll be keeping an ear to the ground for further developments.[Via Pocket-Lint, thanks Elliott]
