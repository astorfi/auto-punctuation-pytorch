If you're thinking the same, and you've got $1,044 to spare in order to find out, upstart gaming rig maker Origin PC has the means to get it to you. The outfit's Genesis desktop can now be ordered with Intel's freshest slab of silicon for $895, or you can snag an extra gigahertz for another $149. We know you'll make the right call.
