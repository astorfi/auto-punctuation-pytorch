 If there ever was a hack that could be assured of a mention on Engadget, it would be this: the MacBook tilt-sensor controlled Roomba. Once again utilizing the accelerometer inside each and every MacBook, the guys over at Hacking Roomba managed to get a Bluetooth-enabled Roomba to listen to the Mac's tilting orders. Practicality isn't the aim here -- lets face it, the Roomba will willingly clean a floor on its own. Instead, it's a mix of ingenuity and "because we can" mentality that draws us to these sorts of projects. That and the possibilty of freaking out the Engadget HQ house cat, of course.
