 Finally, for the man who haseverything -- except a job where he can dress casually -- it's the Commuter Tie from Thomas Pink. The bright pink silktie has a hidden pocket on the back that's the perfect size for an iPod nano, and includes an extra loop to keepheadphone wires from getting tangled (though from Pink's promo pic, right, it looks like the wires will get a bitjammed anyhow, since the headphone jack on the nano is on the bottom). We can't help but worry that using this withanything heavier than a nano would result in a curious tightening around the throat -- not to mention a ratherunattractive stretching of our neckwear. And if you're going to spend $95 on a tie, we'd like to think you can alsocome up with a few bucks for a dedicated carrying case for your audio player. Of course, all of this is irrelevant tous, since we're not in the market for a pink tie -- it would clash horribly with our pajamas.
