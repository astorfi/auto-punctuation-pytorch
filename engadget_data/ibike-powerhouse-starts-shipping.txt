 Velocomp's iBike Powerhouse, the cycling computer that integrates with your wheels to bring you workouts such as the descriptively named Brazilian Butt, is finally ready to ship. Introduced back in January, the Powerhouse works with an app for the iPhone or iPod touch (hence the iMoniker) to measure your pedal rates and other health stats, with preset workouts guiding you through 45- to 90-minute rides targeted toward your fitness level. The regimens also include tips and video demos from cycling pro Hunter Allen.

 The $279 package, available through the iBike site, includes a case for the iPhone or iPod touch, the Powerhouse computer itself, the app, a wireless speed sensor and a handle bar mounting system. Though the system comes with two pre-loaded workouts, you can buy more for $9.99 a pop through the iOS app. Head on down to the PR for more info.



  Show full PR text    Velocomp , a leading sports technology company and creator of the iBike Dash CC Cycling Computer, announced today that it is now shipping iBike® POWERHOUSE, the world's first intelligent cycling fitness system that automatically adjusts to your exercise goals. Based on assessments of your fitness level, the revolutionary iBike POWERHOUSE works with your iPhone and iPod touch to measure, guide and motivate you to achieve important health, appearance, and fitness goals. The POWERHOUSE method maximizes the benefit of each ride and shortens the time needed to achieve results.

   iBike POWERHOUSE combines iBike's patented power measurement and analysis technologies with automatically-adjusting, goal-oriented cycling plans - all delivered through the incredible display and computing power of the iPhone/iPod touch.

  Choose Your Goal-Based Plan – iBike POWERHOUSE Guides You Step-by-Step
   Working out with iBike POWERHOUSE is easy. Select a goal-based plan, from "iSlim," "CycleMax," "Express Fitness," "Brazilian Butt," "Weekend Warrior," and "Zero to 20 miles" -- just some of the plans available. Then, over a period of 4-6 weeks, iBike POWERHOUSE guides you through a series of 45-90 minute bike rides. During each ride, you are directed to pedal at specific levels of effort (power), customized to the plan's goals and your measured fitness level. So, a "couch potato" will start out at a challenging but lower level of effort, whereas a fitter cyclist will start the same plan at a significantly higher level of effort.

  Fitness Plans Designed by Power-Cycling Coach Hunter Allen
   iBike POWERHOUSE's fitness plans are designed by Hunter Allen, one of the world's foremost power-cycling coaches. Allen's plans have been proven over nearly 20 years of coaching cyclists at all levels -- from beginner to world class. And, in addition to the structured ride information for each plan, videos are included with tips from Allen for getting the most out of your cycling.

  iBike POWERHOUSE is a complete system, including:
   · A water/shock resistant "smart case" for the iPhone/iPod touch.

   · Patented electronics that perform all cycling measurements, including power.

   · The iBike POWERHOUSE app that interacts with iBike's electronics.

   · A wireless speed/cadence sensor.

   · Handle bar mounting system.

   · The ability to listen to music or take phone calls while cycling*

   "The iBike POWERHOUSE is the only product that creates cycling plans customized to your fitness level and goals, and that automatically adjusts as you improve," said John Hamann, CEO, Velocomp. "iBike POWERHOUSE is a must for anyone who owns a bike and who wants to achieve measurable improvement towards health and fitness goals or improve their overall cycling."
