 Mark this Sunday on your calendars, if you're the kind that still has a paper calendar and a pen lying around somewhere. The magic date has now been declared by AT&T CFO John Stephens to be the official launch of the carrier's LTE network. The exec used the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Media, Entertainment & Communications conference as the company's golden opportunity to announce the upcoming deployment. Just to play it safe, we also reached out to an AT&T spokesperson and received confirmation that the carrier is indeed ready to make the upgrade from "faux G" to true, vanilla 4G. We don't see it pushing any more Jetstreams out the door, but travelers relying on the almighty USB data stick will certainly be hoping for the company's promised speeds of up to 28Mbps.
