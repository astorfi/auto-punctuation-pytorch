 

Ready for yet another S1 / S2 teaser video that tells you more about the marketing team's potential extra-curricular indulgences and absolutely nothing new about the tablets? Well, drop those tabs and strap in for some doll-voiced la la la's as Sony leads us even deeper into the late-night realm of desktop toys and the tablets they love. Shots of the stylish slates displaying video and gaming functionality are all but hidden in a "filled with fun" maze of booby-trap triggered contraptions. It's a romp through the sort of endearing Tim Burton-esque, high-art nightmare Sony's dabbled in for past Playstation campaigns -- so we're not too surprised. Hit the break to hitch a ride on this video wonderland.
