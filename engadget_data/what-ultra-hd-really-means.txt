In yet another successful attempt at making the Quad HD / 4K / Ultra HD situation as clear as mud, this week the CEA updated its official... definition of the term "Ultra High-Definition." The original spec was established in late 2012 just as the first high-res TVs debuted, and now the expanded "updated core characteristics" will let customers know the TV or player they're buying is actually capable of playing high-res video content. What's new is that Ultra HD TVs, monitors and projectors have to be able to upscale HD (1080p) video to Ultra HD (3,840 x 2,160), decode HEVC, have at least one HDMI input that supports Ultra HD video input at 24, 30 and 60fps and that can decode the HDCP 2.2 DRM that super-sharp video will require. Not up on all of the acronyms and buzzwords? Whether it's a stream from Netflix or Amazon, a broadcast over cable or satellite or some new version of Blu-ray, if your new TV has the logo this fall, you'll be ready for it -- simple, right?
