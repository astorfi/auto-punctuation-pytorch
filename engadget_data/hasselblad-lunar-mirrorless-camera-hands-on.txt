 
 The Lunar has landed -- at Photokina, at least. Hasselblad was showing off a slew of different designs for the forthcoming camera -- and while we were told that its still in prototype mode (both from company reps and signage on the device itself), the camera seemed to be in mostly working order. The first thing you'll notice, once you get past the space-age design, is the fact that the camera really does feel like a rebranded Sony NEX device slipped into a new shell, and as such, it takes those Sony e-mount lenses. And on the back, you'll find that similar collapsible display.

 That said, it really does feel quite nice in the hand -- the device we played with had a leathery grip -- there are a number of carbon fiber and wood options available, as well. All of this is punctuated by a metal top with large metallic knobs, and inside you'll find an APS-C 24.3 megapixel sensor. The Lunar will start at â‚¬5,000 when it launches in Q1 of next year. And in case that's not rich enough for your blood, you can tack a "significant" amount onto that by getting the models decked out in pricier materials.
