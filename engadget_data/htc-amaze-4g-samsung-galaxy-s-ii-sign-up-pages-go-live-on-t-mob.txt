Hot on the heels of yesterday's Mobilize announcement, T-Mobile's thrown up a product page for its particular variant of Samsung's uber-hyped handset, in addition to a landing page for the recently unveiled HTC Amaze 4G (a rebranded Sensation XE for the states). The operator's set an official October 12th launch date for its 42Mbps HSPA+ smartphones, with concrete pricing that pegs HTC's amazing device at $260, and Sammy's TouchWiz-inflected beast at $230 -- both after a $50 rebate on a new two-year contract. If you're as jazzed about these closer to 4G fine, faux-G phones as we are, be sure to hit up the source link below to sign-up for an early order notification.
