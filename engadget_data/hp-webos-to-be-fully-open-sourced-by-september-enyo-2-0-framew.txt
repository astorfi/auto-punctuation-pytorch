   When HP announced last month that it would open-source webOS, the outfit seemed mighty pleased (and relieved) to have finally made a definitive decision regarding the fate of its $1.2 billion software experiment. In fact, though, the company's initial announcement was light on detail, other than the fact that webOS will live on with the help of developers both inside and outside HP. Now, the company's ready to talk specifics: HP says it expects the software will be fully open-sourced by September, at which point its official name will be Open webOS 1.0. The first piece of the puzzle is arriving today in the form of the second-gen Enyo framework, a free tool that lets developers write webOS apps for tablets, phones and desktop browsers. Like the original framework, it supports WebKit, but version 2.0 also expands compatibility to modern desktop browsers such as Firefox, Chrome and Safari. The company also revealed that it's moving to a standard Linux kernel -- a clear attempt to sweeten the pot for hardware manufacturers that have never experimented with webOS, but at least know how to build systems running Linux / Android. For now, that Enyo framework is available for free (more details at the source links), and we've got the PR below, which details HP's plans between now and the OS' September release.
