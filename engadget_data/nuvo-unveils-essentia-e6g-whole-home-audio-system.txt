Aside from the being an apparent power sipper, the E6G also touts Philips Class D digital audio amplification (40-watts per zone), an RS-232 bidirectional control interface, 1U rack height, a newfangled control pad, OLED display and support for six sources and an equal number of zones. Of course, we sure hope you save a few dollars on that energy bill if you plan on picking this up, 'cause you'll be shelling out $2,299 up front before ever plugging it in.
