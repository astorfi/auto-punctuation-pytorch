We'll admit that we haven't been particularly impressed with the sponsored tweets we've been getting courtesy of Twitter's current ad model. To address the issue, the service is toying around with a more targeted program, offering up ads to users from those businesses and brands they've shown an interest in. Rather than simply mining mentions on the service, the new model utilizes browser cookie IDs and scrambled email addresses, so those who've actually visited that site are more likely to get adverts from it.
