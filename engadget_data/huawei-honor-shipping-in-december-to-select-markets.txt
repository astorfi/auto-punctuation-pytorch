The device, with its colorful assortment of six different hues, will be ready for an official release in the twelfth month to China, Russia, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Japan, with other markets following later (there's no word on when the Honor will arrive on Cricket as the Glory). We've known for quite some time that it was coming this quarter, and we already know the specs: Huawei's new darling will come running Android 2.3.5 underneath a proprietary skin, be powered by a 1.4GHz CPU and 512MB of RAM, and offers a 4-inch FWVGA (854 x 480) display, 8MP rear camera with a 2MP front-facing cam and a power-packed 1,900mAh battery. Happy holidays indeed. Read on below for the press release.
