UK provider Sky TV is hoping to start a
loyalty program for their subscribers by using a currently-empty smartcard slot in their set-top boxes.  Say, for
instance, you're a serious Comedy Central addict.  You could be rewarded in a points system for your loyalty,
redeemable for special offers or even premium programming.  Other, more evil ideas include reward programs for
those who actually watch advertisements.  This not only makes advertisers happy, but it allows sad TV addicts to
feel as though there is a friend out there, somewhere, in the shape of a mop-like device that magically sucks up all
the dust and evil things in life who really cares for them.
