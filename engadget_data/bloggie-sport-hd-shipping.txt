   We do love documenting our dirt-trail journeys to show our friends at, ah, dirt-trail bike club. If you feel the same way, then you'll love Sony's Bloggie Sport HD, which ships today. Announced at CES, it takes the features we know and love from the pocket camcorder and wraps it in a shock, dust and waterproof shell you can take to depths of five meters for up to an hour. Fancy watching one get played with underwater? We've got video to excite you ready for this weekend's extreme sports adventuring.
