Translation: Martha baked a cake in the shape of a Wii, and wanted to show it off. Although this example may not be in the same league as our birthday cake competition -- she ain't winnin' no Alienware with that thing -- we'll give Martha a respectable grade for her first effort: we wish her better luck next time with the "geeking out."
