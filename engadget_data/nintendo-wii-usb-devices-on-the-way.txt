 Some wily web browsers have found a job listing at Nintendo of America that suggests the game company is finally getting serious about USB support for the Wii. The job search, found a few days ago, was for a "Software/Hardware Tester" who can execute a "test plan for Wii's USB devices." Some think this could mean compatibility for external USB storage devices like hard drives and flash drives given the Wii's limited 512MB internal memory. We, however, hope this means some sort of support for USB keyboards. It's about time, isn't it, Nintendo?
