In a statement given to Joystiq, SCEA public relations manager Al De Leon says, "we do not have plans for a PS3 price drop, and any rumors to that effect are false and are the result of speculation." Although we wouldn't put it past the company to deny it up until the second before an official announcement, we seriously doubt Sony would announce any sort of price cut on the day it's most likely to get drowned out by fake PSP2 mockups. No word on that speculated $100 PS2, but we wouldn't get our hopes up here, either.
