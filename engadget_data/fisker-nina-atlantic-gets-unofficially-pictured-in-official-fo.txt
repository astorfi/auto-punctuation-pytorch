  We got a quick glimpse of Fisker's once-halted Project Nina the other day courtesy of Autoblog, and we now have our best look at the car to date thanks to some seemingly official press photos that have turned up on Autoforum.cz. Now being dubbed the Atlantic, the car promises to be a smaller and more affordable version of Fisker's Karma sedan and, as those earlier shots indicated, we should soon be seeing plenty more of it at this week's New York Auto Show. Apart from an expected BMW-sourced four-cylinder engine, though, details on the car itself remain decidedly light -- including any indication of a possible price tag or rollout date. In the meantime, you can find more photos where this one came from at the links below.
