'Course, only certain shows such as American Morning, Lou Dobbs Tonight, Anderson Cooper 360 and In The Money are actually shot in high-definition, but hey, you'll take what you can get, eh? Sadly, there's no word on if / when the station will bleed out to other locales and carriers in Canada, but if you manage to spot it on your lineup (and you're not already situated in Ontario), be sure to drop us a line in comments.
