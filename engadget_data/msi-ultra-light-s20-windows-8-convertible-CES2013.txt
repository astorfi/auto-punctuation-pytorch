Announced as part of its upcoming showcase, the company's Slider S20 is the very same Ultrabook we first saw back at Computex 2012 and even recently had hands-on time with, but now there's official pricing and a semi-concrete release date to accompany it: Q1 2013 for $1,200. True to its name, this 2.2lbs Windows 8 hybrid measures just under 1-inch in thickness and features an 11.6-inch 1,920 x 1,080 10-point multi-touch IPS display, an Intel Core i5 processor, 128GB of SSD storage, 8GB DDR3 RAM, 720p front-facing camera and supports radios for Bluetooth 4.0 , as well as WiFi b/g/n. As for connectivity, the glossy white convertible hosts ports for USB 3.0 (2x), Ethernet, mini HDMI-out and a Jackson Peak Wireless adapter. It'll be on display in Vegas next week, so you can check it out en vivo if you happen to be in town. Otherwise, make do with the PR just past the break.
