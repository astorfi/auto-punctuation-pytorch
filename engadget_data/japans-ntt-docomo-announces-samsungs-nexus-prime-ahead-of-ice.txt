Today, the provider confirmed that it'll be "among the fastest" to bring the new handset to market, adding that the Nexus Prime will be on sale in November. Unfortunately, the company didn't get any more specific with regard to release dates, price or specs, but we'll be sure to bring you the latest as soon as we get it. And, as always, you can follow the event in real-time, on our liveblog.
