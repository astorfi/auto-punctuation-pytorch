The company's UK branch confirmed the news today on its Facebook page, announcing that its original tablet-netbook hybrid device will make the jump to Android 4.0 sometime after January 12th. That date, as you may recall, is when the Transformer Prime is slated to receive the update, though ASUS has yet to confirm a specific date for the predecessor's update, saying only that it'll roll out "ASAP." As always, we'll be sure to let you know when we hear more.
