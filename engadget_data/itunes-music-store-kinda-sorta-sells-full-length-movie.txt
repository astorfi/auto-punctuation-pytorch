Sort of. While a direct link to themovie does indeed take you to a page where you can buy it, you won't find it any other way. In fact, although the movieis listed on the Disney Channel's page on iTMS, there's no link to actually buy it. Then there's the price. The moviereportedly initially appeared on iTMS for $1.99, then disappeared for a few hours, only to reappear at a $9.99 pricepoint. From the looks of things, this seems like another pricing experiment from Apple, akin to the recent"multi-pass" offering for "The Daily Show" and "The Colbert Report," which lets customerspay $9.99 per month for all episodes of the two shows. As far as price tests go, that's one that seems to pass; as forpaying $9.99 for a low-res copy of a movie of the week that will probably show up in Blockbuster's remainder bin in amonth, let's just say it's time for Apple and Disney to go back to school for a bit.[Thanks to everyone whosent this in]
