Talking with journos as Taipei's big gala got underway, company chairman JT Wang said that ARM was too fresh-faced to be used in anything besides a tablet, at least until 64-bit ARM architecture speeds things up in earnest. Wang wasn't too worried, though: Intel and Microsoft were recovering their "relationship" now that Windows 8 was providing a spark to reignite the love affair. That will leave Acer taking a decidedly different route than its Taiwan sibling ASUS, whose Tablet 600 carries more than a slight smartbook vibe. With ARM-based Windows 8 PCs not poised to arrive in force until early 2013, though, it will take some time before we know which course is wisest.
