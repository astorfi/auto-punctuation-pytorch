So the unfortunately-named robotic
HAL, Hybrid Assistive Limb, is finally making it to mass
production after a ten year development cycle. This bionic suit gives its wearer extra strength by providing a worn
exoskeleton that gives an extra boost to walking and climbing movements. Each time the wearer takes a step, bioelectric
sensors attached to the skin monitor the movements, send the data wirelessly to an attached computer worn in a
backpack, which in turns tells the robotic limbs to take a step right along with the user, adding strength to the
movement. Potential applications for the suit include helping people with brain and spinal injuries as well as act as a
wheelchair replacement for the elderly. We just want one so we can be the next great crime-fighting cyborg superhero â€”
but at $19,000 a pop, we kinda can't afford to be that altruistic.
