The Z2 series of LED lit LCDs ship later this month and utilize a dual-core "CEVO (Cell Evolution) Engine" processor that has the horsepower to run its super resolution video upconverting algorithms. It also claims a mere 0.7 frames of input lag in game mode thanks to First In First Out memory that matches the performance of screens used in arcade cabinets. Even if you don't play Marvel vs. Capcom 3 on one of these, the company also announced it will release a version of its currently iOS-only Regza remote control / DLNA streaming app for Android and Windows PCs. So far the app is still a Japan-only thing, so while we wait for this tech to make it over to the US you can check out the specs for the TVs Toshiba actually did announce are coming to the States this year after the break.
