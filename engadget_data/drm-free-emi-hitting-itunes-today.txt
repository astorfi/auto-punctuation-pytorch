Hmmm, "labels" huh? That's plural which means Stevie boy might have more than EMI up his sleeve when he goes on stage for All Things D later today. Mind you, you still can't purchase any DRM-free music on iTunes but that should be corrected in time for some heavy grandstanding.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
