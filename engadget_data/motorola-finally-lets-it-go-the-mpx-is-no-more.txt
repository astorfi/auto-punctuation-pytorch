We've seen some harsh to handle stillborn products (especially in the
MPx line), but we're going to admit we were a bit
saddened to hear Motorola confirmed that the MPx is going to be no more. Well, not entirely no more, but that
limited-release basis it saw in Southeast Asia is going to be status quo for the issue-riddled device, and we can
definitely not expect to see it Stateside except through import shops who like ringing 'em up for a G or more. Of
course, we'll be willing to let this roll of their shoulders if the
RAZRberry we've been waiting for so patiently
can quickly slide into the qwerty-keyboard equipped smartphone slot we'd been saving for the MPx, but it looks like
this makes Motorola 2 for 2 on Windows Mobile devices right now (the
MPx200 and
MPx220 vs. the MPx and
MPx100). But who's keeping track?
Oh, us, right.
