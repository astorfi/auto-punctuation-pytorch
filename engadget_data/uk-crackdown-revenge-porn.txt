In a bid to crack down on the sharing of "revenge porn," UK prosecutors have warned that the most severe cases can come with a 14-year spell behind bars. According to new guidance issued by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), explicit images that are sent to force victims into sexual activity or humiliate a former partner can break sex offense laws (and possibly even child protection regulations), allowing prosecutors to seek longer sentences for offenders. In the past, many cases were tried under obscenity laws, which come with softer punishments and also need to meet a "public interest threshold" that gauges the impact of the offense.



Although the sharing of images can be damaging in itself, they are often accompanied by personal information such as a victim's name, social media profiles and address. While no new laws have come into place, the CPS is clarifying existing legislation so that the public, and those intent on humiliating their former partners, "can now see clearly that this is a crime that can and will be prosecuted."
