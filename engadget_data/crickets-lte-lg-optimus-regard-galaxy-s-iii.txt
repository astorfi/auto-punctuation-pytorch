 CDMA-based Cricket has announced its first LTE smartphones, launching the Optimus Regard this week, while that rather popular Samsung Galaxy S III will shake hands with the carrier's new 4G network on November 23rd. The Optimus Regard features a 1.2GHz processor, Android 4.0, 3.5-inch screen and 5-megapixel camera, with that humble spec sheet setting you back $250. Meanwhile, a few weeks later, Samsung's flagship will land priced at $550 off-contract. Cricket is offering both devices on its new Double Data plan that offers (for now, at least) double the monthly data allowance of its 3G plans. The $50 plan nets your 2GB of data, while $60 gets 5GB and $70 will offer 10GB of data. If you're mildly tempted by either the Galaxy S III or the humbler (cheaper) Optimus can read up on the full offering at the sources below.
