At over six pounds, this one isn't exactly a lightweight, but you do get some decent specs with that added heft, including a 15.4-inch WXGA display, your choice of T7100 or T7300 Core 2 Duo processors, Intel GMA X3100 graphics, up to 2GB of RAM, a max 200GB hard drive, a dual-layer DVD burner, and a welcome ExpressCard slot to let you take advantage of the growing amount of gear out there. Unfortunately, as is the case with many of the other Santa Rosa-based laptops we've seen, there's still no word on what it'll cost or exactly when it'll be available.
