They're only making 100 consumer-available Wakamaru bots (which is good, because they're selling 'em for Â¥1,575,000,
about $14,300 US), but Mitsubishi believe this little child-bot that has a listening vocabulary of about 10,000 words
and face recognition for up to ten people will be able to take care of the place while the master's away. We'd just
like to see it vacuuming with its older brother, the
Dyson.
