The so-called SWD-M100D was spotted chillin' out, relaxin' all cool at Sammy's MWC WiMAX kiosk, which makes perfect sense given its ability to connect to WiMAX networks. Unfortunately, it was caught running WinMo 6.1, though the slide out QWERTY keyboard, 3 megapixel camera, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR module, 4.3-inch touchscreen, microSD slot and TV output were all welcome inclusions. Samsung's PR folks have been somewhat dodgy so far, but a recent press release about its innovation in the WiMAX space specifically makes mention of an elusive MID. We're on to you, Samsung, and we're not looking away for even a second.[Via Pocketables]Read - In the wild shotsRead - Samsung release
