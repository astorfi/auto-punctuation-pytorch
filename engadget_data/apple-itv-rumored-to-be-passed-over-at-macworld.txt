 Take it for what you will, but the latest AppleInsider rumor to chew on is that at MacWorld next week Stevie J will not be officially introducing the iTV. It's been kind of a given that since last year's "It's Showtime" event when the iTV was informally announced, that Macworld 2007 would be when we all got to have a looksee at the final product. According to AI, however, Apple is still working the kinks out of the device software, and will delay its launch until late January or early February. Whether it'll make it through the fog of development still dubbed "iTV" no one yet knows, but we'll be honest, it's what we don't know is coming down Apple's product pipeline that we're most interested in right now.
