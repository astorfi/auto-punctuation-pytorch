 Microsoft's SkyDrive is now one of the centerpieces of the company's desktop and mobile platforms, but its relative newness has denied us some of the fine-grained control we've taken for granted from services like Dropbox. The cloud storage service just resolved two of those common power user gripes in one fell swoop through an update to the desktop client. To start, it's at last possible to limit SkyDrive syncing on Macs and Windows PCs just to specific folders -- that poor tablet won't reach its breaking point when someone creates a 5GB home video on the family desktop. Windows users alone see the second update, which integrates SkyDrive with right-click contextual menus for much faster sharing. Mobile customers aren't left out with the refresh, either. Both Android and Windows Phone 8 SkyDrive users get a long-due file search as well as the option to shrink photos when they go online. Updates for the four update platforms are available at the source link, although they should push out on their own over the next two days for those who aren't in a hurry.
