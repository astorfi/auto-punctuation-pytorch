However, it also appears that the 16GB model will drop its price down to $199, according to leaked images from both Office Depot and GameStop -- great news for anyone who's so far held off from grabbing the first Nexus tablet. While an official announcement's been delayed by the forces of nature, we expect to hear more from Google sooner rather than later.
