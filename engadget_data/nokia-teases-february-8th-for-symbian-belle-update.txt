   Looks like Nokia Vietnam wasn't keeping its powder dry when it threw up a page (subsequently pulled) promising an update to Symbian Belle for February 8th. Still, that didn't stop us taking some screenshots of the promised update on its Facebook page, which (electronically) translates to:  "After the holiday, Nokia is good news in ne :) You ready to update Symbian Belle Anna my Nokia phone on 8 / 2 home." Which just about says it all, really.  [Thanks, Nano]
