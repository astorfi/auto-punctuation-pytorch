In case you hadn't heard, Samsung's newest phone is coming. At the Oscars, the Galaxy S5 just got a huge shot of publicity, both in a 30-second ad segment and the not-so-casual presence of its big bro, the Note 3, throughout the award ceremony. We hope you like Hollywood stars and selfies, because Ellen's going to be tweeting a whole lot of them. That's your sponsorship dollars at work, Samsung, even if DeGeneres apparently switched back to an iPhone backstage.


Update: Oh, and that ensemble picture being taken in the shot above? The real thing is now the most-retweeted post, ever.
