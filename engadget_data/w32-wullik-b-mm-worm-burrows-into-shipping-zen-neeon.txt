Looks like somebody turned off the virus scanner at the Creative production plantâ€”it would appear that about 3,700
Japanese 5GB Zen Neeons shipped since July
might have possibly been packing a W32.Wullik.B@mm payload. Of course, if you don't go running conspicuous applications
found on your device and have some cursory virus scanning going on you'll probably be ok just to wipe the damned thing
out of box, but somehow we have a feeling there'll be an unfortunate few for whom this won't be too fond an
experience.
