Man, they good. HP's iPAQ Mobile
Messenger line isn't even out yet, and they're already fixing up the things that the users have been complaining
about (namely no WiFi and Windows Mobile 5.0). Otherwise the specs seem exactly the same: 312MHz Xscale chip, 128MB
Flash, 64MB RAM, GSM/GPRS/EDGE, Bluetooth, IrDA, MiniSD, GPS, 3-inch screen, and 1.3 megapixel cam. Still not quite
enough to run mobile Skype over WiFi, and the 240 x 240 screen rubs us the wrong way, but we'll get some SIP up in
there in no time. Hot damn, it's on now.
