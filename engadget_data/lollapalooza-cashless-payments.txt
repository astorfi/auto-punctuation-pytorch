Festival goers across the US may soon have a cashless (and cardless) payment option when they road trip to catch their favorite acts. Lollapalooza, the annual music fest in Chicago's Grant Park, is the first big name event in the States to adopt the system. The Lolla Cashless method uses RFID-equipped wristbands to give audience members the ability to register the bracelet online and connect a credit or debit card for purchases prior to the event in early August. On site, bands can be used for transactions by tapping on a connected pad and entering a PIN code for verification. In the event that merchants lose that requisite connection, the system will store transactions until network access is restored. It's worth noting that Lollapalooza isn't the first festival to use the wristbands, as the Mysteryland USA festival this past May offered pre-loaded payments with Coachella, Bonnaroo and others using them for ticketing and marketing purposes. The report from Adweek specifically mentions food and drink purchases, so you may want to stash a few bucks if you're after artist merchandise.
