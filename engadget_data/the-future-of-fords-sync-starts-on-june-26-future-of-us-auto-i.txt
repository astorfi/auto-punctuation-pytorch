It was said the update would be included in 2010 Fords, which is still true, but owners of older models can also get in on the fun with an update coming early next week (installable via thumb drive). That's hot, but even hotter is talk of what's planned for the next update: internet radio, and Pandora is on the short list for hopeful inclusion. Have you streamed in a Ford, lately?Update: As pointed out by commenter ericr34, it actually sounds like owners of earlier SYNC cars may not be able to get in on all this goodness. Here's to hoping that Ford enables pre-recession car buyers to experience the upgrade fun.
