The Nokia Essence is the latest stereo Bluetooth to hit the market, and it's poised to eliminate as much of the world around you as possible -- 99.8 percent of it, at least. As many earbuds impel the user to turn up the volume level just to hear more bass, the idea with the Essence is to zap out low-frequency background noises (such as traffic) to provide a deeper bass sound without having to crank up the knob to 11. The Essence is also equipped with NFC for easy tap-to-pair functionality. Scroll down below to see a video showing a guy who's getting the most out of his new headphones.
