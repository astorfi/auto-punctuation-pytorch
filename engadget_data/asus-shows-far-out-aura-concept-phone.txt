You know -- absolute limits of technological advancement, laws of physics, corporate red tape, and the like. Must be nice, right? You can go ahead and design a phone for yourself (or even better, for ASUS) that meets virtually every dreamy spec requirement you can conjure. Go ahead, drop a 3.9-inch touch screen that eats up the entire surface of that bad boy. While you're at it, throw in a sliding d-pad bar that can be positioned anywhere along the screen. Oh, and don't forget the HSDPA, WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0, and microSD expansion, all in a 6mm thick shell that magically reveals a full keyboard stowed in a slot along the left edge. And yes, that's a full 0.1 millimeter thicker than Samsung's Ultra Edition 5.9, but don't even think about drawing a comparison (except for the fact that the Samsung actually exists, we suppose).[Via Mobile-review and Unwired View, thanks Staska]
