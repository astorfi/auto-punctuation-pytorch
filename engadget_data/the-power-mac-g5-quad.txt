It's gonna cost ya $3,300, but now you can finally get
four G5 cores (running in two dual-core G5 CPUs, anyway) in a single box. Today Apple upgraded their Power Mac line
with DDR2 SDRAM, PCI-Express, support for up to 1TB of storage, and, of course, long awaited multiple Cinema Display
supportâ€”up to four 30-inchers, to be exact. Not too shabby, but we priced out a top of the line Power Mac G5 Quad and
it came out to be about $18,000 without a display (granted, the thing had 16GB of RAM).
