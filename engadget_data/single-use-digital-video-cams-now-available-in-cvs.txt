Pure Digital, the company behind the low-end
single-use digicams available in drug stores around the
country, is at it again, this time with digital video cameras, available in the CVS chain for $29.95 â€” plus $12.95 for
burning the video to DVD. The cameras (which were first announced
last summer) capture 20 minutes of what we assume is
MPEG-4 video. In an era when even many of the freebie phones bundled with cell plans can do low-end movies, and
VGA-quality video has become a standard feature on point-and-shoot digicams, we're not sure whether there's a real
market for single-use digital video cameras, but we're about to find out (we'll also find out how long it takes for
some determined hacker to open and reverse-engineer this).
