Unfortunately, Cupcake and Donut -- versions 1.5 and 1.6, respectively -- simply refuse to die, together accounting for basically all of the remaining half. That's down a little under 5 percent from the beginning of June, though, so at least we're moving in the right direction -- and a couple well-placed OTAs from HTC, Motorola, and Samsung would obliterate most of the remainder, we figure. Version fragmentation is an enemy of this platform, regardless of what Google says -- so let's just fast-track a bunch of Froyo ROMs and put all this talk behind us, alright?
