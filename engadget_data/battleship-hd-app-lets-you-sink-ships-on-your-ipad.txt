That's right, the Battleship HD app is now available for download on your iOS slab, featuring a multiple-player mode, which pits you against friends (and presumably foes) packing an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. It's also got a single-player mode, available in three flavors: Classic, Salvo, and Super Weapons. Now go forth and drop bombs! The iPad app is now available at the source link for $3.
