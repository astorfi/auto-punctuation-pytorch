Google's about to kick another one of its features to the curb, though we doubt there'll be any pitchforks and torches, Ã  la Reader. Yes, the not-much-beloved "video response" on YouTube is going to Google heaven, apparently because the click-through rate was a pitiful 0.0004 percent. The team suggested using hashtags instead going forward, but you were probably doing that anyway. Because you never used video responses, ever. None of you.
