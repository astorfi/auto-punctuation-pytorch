Less than a month after the LTE-enabled Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 sauntered past the FCC, AT&T has announced that it'll start selling the device on June 21st. Originally released in the US as a WiFi-only affair, the 8-inch slate will set you back $399 with a two-year contract. However, should you also be in the market for a new smartphone, you can snag the tablet for only $199 if you buy it and bundle the plan with a Samsung Galaxy S 4, S 4 Active or Galaxy Note 2. The S-Pen-toting device is equipped with a 1,280 x 800 display, a 1.6GHz quad-core processor and Android 4.1. These details barely scratch the surface though, so we encourage you to exercise that pointer finger and check out our review to help you decide if this baby is worth your money.
