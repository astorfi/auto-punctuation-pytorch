A closer look at the button layout shows a decided lack of keys required by WinMo 6.5, which leads us to the logical conclusion that the so-called Touch.B here -- previously known under the codename "Rome" -- runs Android. MobiFrance doesn't have any additional details on the phone, its specs, or where it might launch, but if it does in fact run on the Google juice, it's looking like a possible successor (or kissing cousin, perhaps) of the Tattoo. Now that we look at it, we're not actually seeing the buttons that'd be required of an Android device, either -- and we have heard rumors for ages now that HTC would be releasing devices running a homegrown dumbphone platform -- but we'll hold off on the conclusion-jumping until we get just a little more detail.
