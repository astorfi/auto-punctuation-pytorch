 
We got a chance to spend a little time with Contour's upcoming Live Viewfinder for the ContourGPS, an app that finally lets us know for sure which way our little cameras are pointing. The app makes a Bluetooth connection to the camera and pulls down footage in real-time, also allowing you to tweak camera settings, which is hugely more convenient than tethering to a PC or Mac. The company also showed off a rifle-ready picatinny rail mount (above), following in the footsteps of Tachyon. Get yourself a taste after the break.
