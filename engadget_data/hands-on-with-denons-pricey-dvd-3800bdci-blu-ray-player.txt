This player was found in numerous locales within Denon's fanciful booth, and while the setup may not have been ideal, the image quality of Speed was noticeably lacking. Nevertheless, we stooped down to snag a few images for those still wondering what a $2,000 Blu-ray player really looks like, so go ahead and quell that curiosity, won't ya?
