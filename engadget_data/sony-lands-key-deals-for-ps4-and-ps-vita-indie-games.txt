Sony has long argued that the PS4 and PS Vita are indie-friendly consoles, and it's backing up words with deeds at Gamescom. The company has landed a PS4 exclusive for the console version of Rogue Legacy. Both the PS4 and Vita are also getting a new version of The Binding of Isaac (called Rebirth), while a new N+ (N++) game is coming to PlayStation hardware. In a few cases, Sony will get first crack at some anticipated games -- a Hotline Miami sequel and Guns of Icarus Online will make their console debuts on the PS4 and PS Vita. If your tastes in games venture beyond the mainstream, Sony may have you covered for the foreseeable future.
