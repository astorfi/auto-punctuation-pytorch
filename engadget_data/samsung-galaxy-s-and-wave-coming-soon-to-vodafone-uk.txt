The Wave brings the new Bada sensibility to British shores, while the Galaxy S will be pretty much the most advanced Android handset the UK has yet seen. It runs version 2.1 with Samsung's own skin on top, but it's the hardware behind it that'll be pushing Brits to upgrade. Hit the source link to peruse the full list, which also includes the new BlackBerry Pearl 3G, but do remember to be patient -- an Amazon pre-order listing for the Wave (priced at Â£350, or 521 greenbacks) indicates a one to three month waiting period.
