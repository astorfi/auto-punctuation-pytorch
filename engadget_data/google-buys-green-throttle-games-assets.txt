Green Throttle Games was late to the Android gaming platform party, and paid the price for it -- the company effectively wound down at the end of 2013. However, its efforts may not have been in vain. Google has confirmed to PandoDaily that it has acquired key portions of Green Throttle's business, including its parts, labor and two co-founders. The crew in Mountain View hasn't said what it will do with its new resources, but PandoDaily sources claim that Google wants to refine the Bluetooth controller for its long-fabled (and possibly gaming-focused) TV set-top box. Whether or not that's true, the move suggests that Google's interest in games is extending beyond software.
