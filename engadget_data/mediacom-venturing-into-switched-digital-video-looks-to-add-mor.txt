Unfortunately, the operator didn't note which markets would see SDV first, but it did say that it planned to "deploy digital simulcast to 50 percent of its systems by year-end." For those that just love to be reassured, the company's EVP of operations John Pascarelli was quoted as saying that the "side benefit of [the upgrades] is it will help us expedite the delivery of more HD channels to those systems [and offer] a more competitive product." More specifically, the firm "outlined a plan to offer 25 high-definition channels for free to entry-level digital customers," with that figure rising to around 40 with premiums / HD VOD added in.
