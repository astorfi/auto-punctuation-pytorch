  If you're into high strangeness in the mobile realm, you'd be wise to check out the video of the Optimus Vu that LG just posted -- just follow the break. While our Korean translation skills aren't quite up to par, we've been able to decipher that this boxy number packs a 5-inch touchscreen and a rather unique 4:3 aspect ratio. The telltale capacitive touch buttons reveal this as an Android device, which the Korean manufacturer suggests is more comfortable to hold than traditional portrait-based solutions. It'll be interesting to see what this means for application compatibility, but for the moment, we're going to keep digging for more specs. Oh, and if you happen to know Korean, don't be afraid to drop additional tidbits into the comments below.[Thanks, Byungjin]Update: We've stumbled upon an image -- embedded after the break -- from Datacider that purports to be a shot of the Optimus Vu in the wild. They've also included a smattering of specs, which include a 1.5GHz Qualcomm APQ8060 SoC, 1GB RAM, 8GB ROM, NFC, an eight megapixel camera and Android 2.3. More interestingly, the screen shows a "February 21st" date stamp, which may or may not be a hint. Feel free to hit up the source link for that extra peek.
