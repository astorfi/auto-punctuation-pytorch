Viber may have brought its most highly requested feature, VoIP calling, to BlackBerry users way back in April. Still, that's not to say the Skype competitor is quite done polishing its application on older versions of BlackBerry's OS -- namely, 5, 6 and 7. For starters, conversations have been enhanced with the ability to insert user images, while a new "seen" status lets you know when a recipient has viewed messages you've sent. Rounding up the update are some light design changes and improved location sharing/privacy settings, which allow folks to have more customization options throughout the app. Be sure to keep an eye on the BlackBerry World store, as this new version of Viber is expected be rolling out in the next few hours.
