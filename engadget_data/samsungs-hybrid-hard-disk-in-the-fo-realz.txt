That's the latest pic of Samsung's Hybrid Hard Drive (HHD) which like those from Seagate and others, are still expected to launch in January in leverage of Vista's SuperFetch, ReadyBoost, and ReadyDrive technologies. Yeah, nothing more to say about HHDs than we have already, just a new picture to prep ya for double-quick boot speeds, greater reliability, and 20-30 minutes longer battery life. Mmm flash memory... is there anything you can't do?
