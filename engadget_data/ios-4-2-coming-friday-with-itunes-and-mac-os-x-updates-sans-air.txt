Of course, in order to take advantage AirPlay we'll have to see an update to iTunes as well, which is good because iTunes 10.1 is rumored to be coming tomorrow today at some point. But that ain't all! It seems that the website of note for Mac stories has been hearing from devs that references to AirPrint have been disappearing from online documentation in the iOS developer center, leading to speculation that Mac OS X 10.6.5 (also rumored to hit tomorrow today) will not have the ability to print wirelessly after all. We can't speak to the veracity of all these claims, but we're pretty sure we can look forward to a new OS for our Apple handhelds before the week is over.

Update: Of course, as Benedict Murray pointed out in the comments, if there really were a conspiracy afoot to disappear AirPrint, Apple certainly would have dropped it from the product page. So we'll see.
