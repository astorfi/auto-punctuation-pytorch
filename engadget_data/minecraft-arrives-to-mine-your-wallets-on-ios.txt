They watched with envious eyes as the mobile edition of the world-building game launched on the Xperia Play before an Android-wide release back in October. As of today, that injustice has been remedied, but it's not all gravy. The Pocket Edition of the game is the same stripped-down version that you can play on Gingerbread; that means there's no crafting, mining or survival modes -- just the classic construction mode. Considering the spartan nature of the software, the $7 asking price seems pretty hefty -- still, when you need a fix, you need a fix, right?
