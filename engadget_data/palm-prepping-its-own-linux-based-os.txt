Ed Colligan, in his Investor Day keynote today, announced that Palm will be launching a homegrown Linux-based OS by the end of the year, with Opera for a browser and the recently acquired Chattermail for messaging. Palm has been secretly at work on this OS for a number of years, and does not plan to license it to other manufacturers. Colligan also says that Palm is going to continue Windows Mobile product releases, and thanks to that handy Garnet license, Palm will be able to show its "commitment to the Palm OS community" by merging Palm OS 5.4 support into its Linux kernel. So, no more ALP dreams for the Palm kids, but this isn't a total surprise either, rumors had been brewing that Palm had something like this up its sleeve -- we just hope it's not too little, 'cause it certainly seems to be too late. On the hardware side, Palm is working on platforms that can be used with either OS, which should speed development time and supposedly result in more device releases, including an expanded product portfolio "to address user segments." What, you mean not every consumer wants a chubby Treo that looks just like every other Treo since the 650? We're shocked!  Read - Ed Colligan keynote Read - Palm announces new Linux-based OS
