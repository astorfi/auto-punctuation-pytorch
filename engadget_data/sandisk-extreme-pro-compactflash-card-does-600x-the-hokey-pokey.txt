SanDisk's new Extreme Pro CF line packs an impressive 600x rating, which is twice that of the Extreme IV CompactFlash card that it shipped right around this time last year. Available in 16GB, 32GB and 64GB flavors, this unit promises 90MB/sec read and write performance, guaranteed operation at extreme temperatures and a thumbs-up from Chase Jarvis. Also introduced is the 8/16/32GB SanDisk Extreme, which features 60MB/sec of read and write performance (400x) while going a little easier on the wallet. Both families should be available any day now, with the Extreme gang ranging from $130 to $375 and the Extreme Pro crew starting at $300 and stopping at around $800. Oh, and if you're scouting an ExpressCard reader to handle the new speeds, the Extreme Pro ExpressCard Adapter will splash down next month for $49.99. Enthralling demo is after the break.
