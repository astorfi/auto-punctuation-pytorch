Whatever you want to call it, here's another one, this time up the SmartKey TV from Italian firm LiquidTv. Inside its tiny housing are a 1GHz ARM Cortex A9 processor, Mali 400MP GPU, 512MB RAM and 4GB flash storage. There's a USB host port, and one for power, along with a microSD (up to 32GB) card slot, plus wireless in b, g and n flavors. Unlike other products that leave the input solution up to you, this little guy has accessories and a smartphone app purpose-built for that. If you want a slice, it'll cost you €99 (about $125,) or €119 ($150) with a motion sensor remote control. Tune your browser to the Italian video after the break to see it in action.

 Update: Some people are pointing out the similarities between this product and a Kickstarter project, and it looks like there are some issues between the two. LiquidTv has now removed its existing video demo -- and Infinitec (the company behind a very similar-looking Pendroid project) have been quick to state that the SmartKey TV isn't related to its Pocket TV.
