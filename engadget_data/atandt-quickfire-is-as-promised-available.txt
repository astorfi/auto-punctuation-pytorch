 As previously foreseen, the UTStarcom Sidekick knock-off Quickfire, also known as the Knick, is now available online and in AT&T stores. It's quite a deal for new subscribers -- $99.99 with a 2-year contract, mail-in rebate (ugh) and promotion card -- or $299.99 without any of those discounts. In case your memory stinks, the Quickfire is a 3G device with a 2.8-inch, 240 x 320 touchscreen display, full QWERTY keyboard, and support for microSD cards up to 8GB. You're probably not reading this anymore because you're already on your way out to get one, right? Hello?[Thanks, Jordan]
