When we last saw this little purr-machine, it was giving blank stares of disapproval while harmfully invading our dreams like a kind of down-coated demon. The new version appears to up the gross-factor to 11 by including even more lifelike movements, all new speech (with moving mouth), and a healthy dose of allergy-irritating dander. Okay, we made that last one up, but with such attention to detail -- including the common cat trait of perfect human speech -- it wouldn't surprise us to see this one causing all kinds of health issues. Watch the charming video after the break, you'll see what we mean.
