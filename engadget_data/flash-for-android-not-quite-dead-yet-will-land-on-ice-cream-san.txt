Turns out the latest edition of Adobe's multimedia plug-in isn't compatible with the newest version of Google's mobile OS. Don't panic just yet though, while the end is nigh for mobile Flash, it's still got one more release left in it and that will deliver ICS compatibility. Adobe told the folks over at Pocket-lint, "[it] will release one more version of the Flash Player for mobile browsing, which will provide support for Android 4.0." Or, if you're a glass half-empty type, ICS will be your last chance to browse the "full" web on Android. The final release of the mobile plug-in will also be accompanied by one last version of the Linux Porting Kit -- after that, you better hope HTML5 really hits its stride.
