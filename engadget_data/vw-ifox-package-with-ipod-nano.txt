FM transmitters, cassette adapters: those are so last year. Heck, even buying your DAP separately from your ride is
like, totally last week. Thanks to Volkswagen, you can now save yourself a trip to the big box retailers, with the
newly-announced iPod/VW Fox combo package. Even better than getting fries with your burger, the iFox package, as it's
being called, comes complete with a VW-branded 2GB
iPod nano, a dock to attach it to the
Blaupunkt Calgary MP3 radio, and of course that wiley old Fox with an "iPod Inside" logo (hello, Intel legal?). VW is
only offering 500 of these bad boys, and since all prices are in Euros, we kinda doubt they'll send one our way.
