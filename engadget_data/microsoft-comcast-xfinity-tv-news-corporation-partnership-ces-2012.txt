For one, we're told that Comcast's Xfinity TV will soon be coming to Xbox 360 (FiOS users are finally getting a little company, as it were), and moreover, there's a new News Corporation partnership that'll bring Fox News, Wall Street Journal, Fox and IGN to the aforesaid console. Craig Davidson, Director of Xbox, also threw a verbal high-five to U-Verse, Telus and Telefonica. No word on launch dates, unfortunately, but we're guessing the parties involved will be making their own announcements on that.
