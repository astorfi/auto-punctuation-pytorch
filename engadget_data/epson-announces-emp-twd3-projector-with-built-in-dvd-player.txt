 Epson has announced the latest in its line of projectors with built-in DVD players, the 3LCD-based EMP-TWD3 -- available on its own or bundled with a pull-down 80-inch screen. The projector itself is only a modest upgrade to the previous model, added an analog RGB input (D-sub 15 pin/component combined) to the mix, which includes 854 x 480 (480p) resolution, 1,200 lumens, and 1,000:1 contrast ratio. The projector also packs in a pair of speakers, which seem to account for much of it's size, though we're guessing few will be satisfied with the 10W they pump out. Look for this one to hit Japan September 21st for 150,000 Yen ($1,290), or 160,000 Yen ($1,375) for the package with the screen.[Via Impress]
