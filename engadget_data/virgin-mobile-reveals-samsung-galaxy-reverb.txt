Like its cousins, the phone offers Android 4.0, which is complemented by a 1.4GHz CPU, a 5-megapixel camera and a 4-inch touchscreen. Virgin Mobile's latest is set to hit stores in September for $250, but you can claim your place in line through the pre-order process, which is set to kick off on August 29th. We've already managed to grab some hands-on pics of the Galaxy Reverb, so if you're curious to see what's in store, be sure to hit up the gallery below.
