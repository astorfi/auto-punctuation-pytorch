 At Mobile World Congress, Nokia has announced the Lumia 520, its latest piece of ammunition in the company's campaign to conquer emerging markets and first-time smartphone buyers. The inexpensive smartphone actually packs a pretty powerful punch for its price point, offering the same dual-core 1GHz Snapdragon CPU found in the Lumia 720 also announced today. It also features 512MB RAM, a 4-inch WVGA (800 x 480) IPS LCD display and 1,430mAh battery. As we've come to expect on Lumia devices, it comes included with Nokia services like the full suite of Here Maps, Nokia Music and several lenses such as Cinemagraph and panorama. The 520 will come in five color options: cyan, yellow, red, black and white. Snap-on covers will also be available for anyone interested in swapping hues day-to-day. The $183 phone begins its quest for dominance in China later this quarter, and shortly afterward it will make its way to Europe, the rest of Asia and T-Mobile in the US. Head below for a full listing of specs.

   The Nokia Lumia 720 delivers a high end camera performance at a mid-range price point. A  large f/1.9 aperture and exclusive Carl Zeiss optics are designed to deliver bright, clear pictures day and night, while the HD-quality, wide-angle front-facing camera makes taking pictures with friends and video calling more enjoyable. The sleek and stylish smartphone comes with the latest high-end Nokia Lumia experiences, including Nokia Music, the HERE location suite, and the option to add wireless charging with a snap-on wireless charging cover.  The Nokia Lumia 720 comes in five colors, with an estimated starting price of EUR 249 before taxes and subsidies. Rollout is planned to start in Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore in Q1 2013, before continuing into broader markets in Q2, including China as well as key markets in Europe, Asia, Africa and India.

A four inch super sensitive touchscreen makes for a more responsive and immersive content experience than can usually be found at this price.
