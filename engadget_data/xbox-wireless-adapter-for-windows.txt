You won't have to wait much longer to use your Xbox One gamepad wirelessly with your PC. Microsoft announced today that its handy peripheral, revealed earlier this year, is now shipping to "most" retail stores around the world. If you're in the US, though, it looks like the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows will be available starting today for $25. There's also a bundle kitted with an Xbox One controller, which is $55 extra -- or $80 total, to be specific. The USB-powered add-on is going to be useful for Windows 10 users who want to use it to play PC games, as well as with Xbox One titles being streamed to a nearby desktop, laptop or hybrid tablet.
