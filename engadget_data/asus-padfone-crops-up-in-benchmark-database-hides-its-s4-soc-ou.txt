  Late last spring, we got hands-on with dummy units of the PadFone and its companion dock, but aside from potential form factors and a Christmas release window, details of its glorified guts were scarce. That's all changed now thanks to GLBenchmark's public results database, which outs the category-straddling device as having a Krait S4 MSM8960. Yes, the first in a line of uber-performing Qualcomm SoCs will be embedded in the heart of ASUS' smartphone, bringing support for a global range of frequencies (including blazing HSPA+ and LTE speeds) and an Adreno 225 GPU. What could very well be disheartening is evidence the handset's running Gingerbread 2.3.5, but we'll chock that up to early testing and cling tightly to the company's hard ICS-laden wink. If you've been eagerly anticipating this mobile power couple, you shouldn't have to wait long -- that target holiday release is surely creeping up. So, expect to see an official announcement of the dual-core goods any day now.
