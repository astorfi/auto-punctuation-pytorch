LG's flagship Optimus G Pro, due to launch on AT&T on May 10th, might just make its way to Sprint later this year -- and possibly with an upgraded processor. A User Agent Profile on Sprint's website reveals a 1080p, Android 4.2.2 handset called the LS980, which lines up with AT&T's model number (E980) and also corroborates an earlier listing at the Bluetooth SIG. Curiously, the UAP mentions Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 800 ("M8974"), in contrast to the existing G Pro's Snapdragon 600 processor. Then again, there's only so much you can tell about future products from XML files like these. It could be an upgraded Sprint G Pro variant, but the reference to a totally new chip has us (and Android Police) thinking it could also be a full-fledged Optimus G sequel, which has already been rumored and possibly leaked. Either way, it's nice to see evidence of a top-tier phone maker using this cutting edge Snapdragon, especially after the comedy of ZTE's Grand Memo.
