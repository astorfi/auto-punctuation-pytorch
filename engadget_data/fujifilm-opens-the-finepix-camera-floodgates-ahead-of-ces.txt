It's a long list, so get comfortable. Let's start with the JX580, which will offer up 16 megapixels, 5x optical zoom and a three-inch LCD for $119, when it drops in February. The JX500 will be hitting the same month for $99, bringing 14 megapixels, 5x optical zoom and a 2.7-inch LCD. The AX550 brings 16 megapixels and 5x optical zoom. It'll be hitting in March for $89. All three slim cameras feature intelligent flash, tracking auto focus and scene recognition auto.

And what of the FinePix JZ250 and JZ100? We're glad you asked. The JZ250 brings a 16 megapixel sensor, 8x optical zoom and a newly brightened three-inch LCD to the table, while the JZ100 rocks 14 megapixels, 8x optical zoom and a 2.7-inch LCD. Both can shoot movies in 720p and will hit retail in March for $149 and $129, respectively. The T400 and T350 both offer up Scene Recognition Auto, face detection and Motion Panorama Mode, as well as 10x optical zoom and three-inch LCDs. The T400 does 16 megapixels and the T350 tops out at 14. They'll run $179 and $159 when they're released in March.

The FinePix XP150 and XP100 do the rugged thing, shockproof, freezeproof, dustproof and waterproof to 33 feet. The XP50, meanwhile, is also durable -- albeit slightly less so. All three cameras shoot 1080p video and have dual image stabilization and tracking autofocus. The XP150 also brings GPS and geo-tagging to the table. The three cameras will hit in March for $279, $259 and $199. Full PR after the break.
