It's unlikely that this year's Super Bowl will equal the awesome spectacularness of last year's event (though since it's Fox that's broadcasting the game, you never know), but whether you're going to tune for the game itself or just for the commercials, we thought we'd do our part and tell you how to blow out the Super Bowl like nobody's biz (from the Engadget perspective, of course). We're giving you the best guide to jaw-dropping Super Bowl gear this side of Mark Cuban's skybox, and topping it off with an extensive guide to DVRing (or TiVo-ing, if you will) that hi-def Super Bowl broadcast. Let the games begin!

 
 An HDTV (duh)  So you have to rock the Super Bowl in high definition. It's just not even a question. Sure, it may not be 1080p, or a Jumbotron (or the other Jumbotron) but if you're ready for the king of plasma HDTVs (for the next 15 minutes, anyway), look no further than the Panasonic Onyx XVS series. That's right, no more need for another HDTV tuner box floating around, this guy's got an ATSC/QAM tuner built in, as well as a CableCARD slot, and almost every interface under the sun. Our only complaint is that they're not the full 1080 (native res is actually 1366x768, which really burns our chaps), but we'll overlook that in favor of its outstanding black (and color) representation.
