 That didn't take long. The boys behind CyanogenMod promised a quick turnaround for its upcoming JellyBean-based update and are already teasing workable CM10 ROMs. CyanogenMod's Ricardo Cerqueira tossed a video of an early CM10 build on his YouTube page, declaring "it lives!" The early build is running on an LG Optimus 4X HD, and runs through unlocking the screen and recording and playing back a video. The build is still having some trouble with Google's revamped search integration, but considering Android 4.1's source code was released only days ago, the quick development is promising. Check out Cercuiera's quick demo for yourself after the break.
