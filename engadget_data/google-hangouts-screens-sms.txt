Wondering what new features we'll see once Google official unveils the Nexus 5? Android Police has a hint: an overhauled, more comprehensive Hangouts app. A pair of leaked screenshots seem to deliver on a promise Google made back in May, and show evidence of an SMS integrated hangout app. An image of the app's conversation window shows that messages will be branded by their delivery method, including a "via SMS" tag next to the text's time stamp. It hints at a more unified communication platform for Android, but the settings page helpfully illustrates that using Hangouts for SMS is optional -- a check mark allows the feature to be cleanly disabled for those who prefer to keep their conversations segregated. Although these shots line up with previous rumors, Android Police can't say when the update might be available or if it will actually coincide with the release of KitKat or the Nexus 5. Either way, we're looking forward to finding out.
