At any rate, Razer is momentarily stepping away from its ambidextrous ways in order to craft a mouse that fits especially well in the hands of righties. The new Imperator gaming mouse houses the same 3.5G laser sensor that has become common on the outfit's critters of late, but this one includes a smattering of "adjustable side buttons" that can actually slide and lock into place wherever you find them most comfortable. It's up for order now for $79.99 (or â‚¬69.99 for those across the pond), and if the gallery below doesn't get you close enough, a demonstration vid is just past the break.
