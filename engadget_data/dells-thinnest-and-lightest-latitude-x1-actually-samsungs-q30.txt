We love Samsung laptops, and their
Q30 is no exception. We
heard before that
Samsung's wasn't bringing their fab machines Stateside because
of a noncompete with Dell—and now we know to what extent they're
not competing. At least one Samsung laptop has been slated for the Dell rebadge treatment—the Q30 subnotebook will
become the Dell X1—so it should be no surprise whatsoever that Dell's nicest machine to date is not their own. If
you've forgotten how power-packed the diminutive Q30/X1 is, imagine a 2.4-pound 1-inch thick laptop with Sonoma
Centrino, a 1.1GHz ULV Pentium M, a 12.1-inch WXGA (1280 x 768) widescreen display, up to 1.28GB of DDR2 SDRAM,
802.11b/g WiFi, Bluetooth, SD slot, DVD±RW drive, and Gigabit Ethernet.
