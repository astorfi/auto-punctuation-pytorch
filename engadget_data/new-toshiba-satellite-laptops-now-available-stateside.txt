As previously noted, the A500 is a 16-inch multimedia machine (starting at $749.99), while the U500 ($849.99) is a 13.3-inch guy more suited to on-the-go computing. Newly announced are the M500/M505 (with 14-inch high-def LED display, starting at $699.99) and the P500/P505 (an 18.4-inch desktop replacement with slot-loading DVD drive, starting at $799.99). All the new Satellites include multimedia command keys, webcam, face recognition software, harmon/kardon speakers and, of course, the world renowned eSATA/USB combo port. And if you're good, we have a couple pics for you. After the break, of course.
