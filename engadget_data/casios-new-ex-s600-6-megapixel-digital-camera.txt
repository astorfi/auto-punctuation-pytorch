Casio's new EX-S600 gives their popular Exilim
Card line of digicams a bump to 6 megapixels. This camera also extends its anti-shake technology with an MPEG-4 movie
stabilizer function and flaunts a better battery for up to 300 snaps on a single charge. Other than that, the camera
still features the same 2.2-inch LCD, 3x optical zoom, and ultra-slim dimensions of the 5 megapixel
EX-S500. Available in early 2006 in three retchtasticly
named colors: sparkle silver, mistral blue (pictured), or latin orange.
