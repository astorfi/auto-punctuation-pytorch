We imagine this comes down to Apple's meticulous level of control over any monkey business. As such, the magic 6pm launch is likely the result of a next-day, 6pm delivery cutoff by AT&T's distribution agent -- FedEx. You don't think these babies are just going to be sitting around in the stock room do you? So if you happen to see a FedEx guy hovering near an AT&T or Apple store on June 29th... well, be nice, mkay?
