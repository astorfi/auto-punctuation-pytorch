 How does a US carrier get around AT&T's exclusivity of the Lumia 920? Why, it releases an exclusive of its own, of course. News of the Lumia 928 is probably familiar to many of you, which has been rumored (and spotted in inventory systems) as an upscale Windows Phone for Verizon. Now, things just got real, as @evleaks has just released the first glimpse of the Lumia 928, and adorned in black, we're quite sure that Batman would approve. Naturally, Big Red's branding adorns both the front and back of the device, but at least there's a modicum of restraint. This being Nokia's second Windows Phone outing on Verizon, we're crossing our fingers that the phone was spared a beating with the ugly stick. We'll reserve judgment until we can get our grubby mitts on one.
