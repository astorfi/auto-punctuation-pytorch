 

We're here at Sony's CES press event -- we're expecting some more 3D TV action and maybe some Blu-ray news, but we'll find out what's going down soon enough.
 

5:29PM Beautiful Nightmare now blasting again -- these lyrics describe our feelings about 3D almost perfectly. Either way, we don't want to wake up.5:27PM "Our goal is to become an undisputed global leader in 3D." And... that's it!5:27PM All Sony Style stores in the US getting 3D demo units, starting tonight in Vegas.5:26PM To recap: Sony not only thinks you'll wear the glasses, but that you'll go out and buy them as an add-on kit for your TV, along with a transmitter. That sounds workable.5:26PM Showing off a prototype of a 3D OLED TV.5:26PM They'll be joined by two other lines of 3D-capable sets that don't bundle the glasses and the transmitter. Which you'll have to go out and buy separately.5:25PM Stan back on, introducing new 3D Bravias for 2010. They'll be packaged with two pairs of active shutter glasses, and a transmitter built in.5:24PM "I've been trying to persuade ESPN to do curling in 3D."5:23PM "We're working hard to making Sony devices already in the home 3D friendly."

Insert Tiger Woods joke.5:20PM 2010 FIFA World Cup will be in 3D this summer, shot on Sony 3D cameras.5:19PM Sony and CBS partnering on The Sony 3D Experience, a new consumer research experience. Not a lot of detail about it, but it'll be at the MGM Grand here at Vegas.5:19PM Sony Music also pushing 3D -- Kenny Chesney is coming to theaters in 3D this summer.5:18PM Sony opening a 3D technology center to teach filmmakers how to shoot 3D.5:18PM Sir Howard: "I'd forgotten I was wearing 3D glasses! That's a good sign, isn't it?"5:16PM Invited Discover and IMAX execs on stage. "At Discovery we view 3D as the future of TV."5:16PM Sir Howard: "Imagine Shark Week in 3D -- we may have to equip everyone with a defibrillator."5:15PM Some seriously impressive stuff in this demo -- the Discovery stuff in particular. Lots of "why'd they bother" moments as well, though.5:14PM Partnership with RealD, Discovery, and IMAX. Glasses demo time again!5:13PM "We will marshall all our resources to deliver the next great consumer experience... wait for it... 3D."5:12PM Sir Howie back on stage. "Oh, many of you are still here. That's a good sign. A good sign." He's so charming, it hurts.5:12PM "Sony's commitment to 3D should leave no doubt about where we're headed."5:12PM VAIO Z, showcases ultramobile expertise. Intelligent switching between graphics intensive and battery saving modes. Sounds like switchable discrete / integrated graphics to us.5:11PM VAIO F, with Intel's latest quad-core CPU and HDMI out.5:10PM The VAIO W is also made out of recycled CDs, which is a lot cooler than that printed manual thing.5:10PM VAIO W -- "A laptop so green it doesn't come with a printed manual." These are words that were just said.5:09PM Abrupt transition time! Sony has recycled 24.5 million pounds of waste and will strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent.5:08PM TransferJet coming to cameras, photo frames, and VAIO in the future.5:08PM He shot across three images in a "second or two." Of course we don't know what the file sizes were, but it certainly worked as promised.5:07PM They're demoing a TransferJet demo -- wirelessly transferring images from one camera to another.5:07PM Is it time for Zoolander jokes? "Next you'll have a Magnum detector and I'll be out of a job." Yes, it is that time.5:06PM He's taking a panoramic shot of the audience. "Sony executives seriously working it down here. Smile with the eyes, you've obviously a Top Model fan."5:05PM He likes it a lot. Why? Because the auto-adjustment in Photoshop doesn't do anything to Cyber-shot pictures. "They're nearly perfect." Um, sure.5:04PM Nigel's got a new Cyber-shot: "They're like 'professional point-and-shoots'... they have G-series lenses, which are like SLR optics in a point-and-shoot."

Is it seriously 2012 already?4:58PM Seriously. Sony just went away from their own proprietary format. Dog and cats, living together. Mass hysteria.4:58PM HandyCam and Cyber-shot cameras going dual-SD and MemoryStick! This is seriously huge news. No wonder Sony announced SD cards this morning.4:57PM Wall Street Journal available now, and two new exclusive Dow Jones packages are also now available: MarketWatch and WSJ Plus.

Just what Sony needs, another division!4:53PM Streaming movies coming to VAIO and other Windows PC later this month in six countries, also BD decks and TVs.4:53PM Single user ID for both PSN and other consumer products -- so these other devices aren't getting true PSN, but they're "looking at making a single experience" in the future.4:52PM They're extending the video services to more devices -- Blu-ray players, laptops, TVs.4:51PM More countries for video on PSN later this year. 38m registered users on PSN.4:50PM Talking up the premium video content on PlayStation Network.4:50PM Sony's good at making devices, but they know they need to do more.4:50PM "I'm not here just to talk about the PS3... we're expanding our network services beyond PS3 and PSP."4:49PM 1.7m PS3s sold in North America alone this past quarter.

Okay.4:48PM "The new Dash personal internet viewer is designed to show you your favorite parts of the internet in a dash." Also does movies, audio, Facebook, Twitter.4:47PM It can either lie flat or stand. It's too chunky for a pocket, but it's mobile -- they're not showing it plugged in.4:46PM Sony Dash Internet Viewer. Looks like an alarm clock / picture frame.4:46PM "Sony is committed to providing content that consumers want everywhere they go."4:45PM New Blu-ray deck with monolithic design, WiFi, joined by a new HTIB that does internet video and BD-Live.4:44PM "Blu-ray continues to make significant strides...

New HTIB with wireless speakers.4:43PM Pre-orders starting tonight, delivery in early March.4:43PM They'll obviously be connected TVs, lots of Bravia Internet Video integration and Bravia Internet Widgets... and "something else you'll be hearing about shortly."4:42PM So... how does this TV embody the make.believe spirit? It's not just empty marketing, is it?4:41PM NX800 -- new LED backlit set. New Bravias starting this spring, from 22-60 inches. Monolithic TVs are designed for be viewed at a six degree slant to compensate for low stands.4:40PM Newest products that embody make.believe philosophy. First up: new Bravias, featuring our "new monolithic design." The music is appropriately terrifying.4:39PM Joshua Marc Levy, art director, Sony Music. Just a normal guy buying a Walkman, really.4:39PM This is something about an album cover designer, who is as yet unnamed. "I get to create album covers for some of the greatest artists of all time!" Sure sounds like the average Sony customer to us. Update: It's Joshua Marc Levy!4:37PM "I want to share a make.believe story with you."

Maybe you'll call us cool again."4:31PM The glitter was also in 3D.4:31PM Glitter explosion!4:30PM The projected 3D isn't actually all that great -- it's nice, but it's not worth wearing silly glasses for. Particularly when the real Taylor Swift is right in front of you. The sparkles on her guitar do "pop," though.4:29PM We're going to say live Taylor beats 3D projected Taylor. Her guitar is so sparkly!4:28PM Oh -- they're projecting this live in 3D on the screen behind her. We're having a hard time deciding which is the more convincing 3D experience.4:27PM For some reason, we have to put the glasses on again. But... she's right here!4:26PM Taylor loves taking pictures and videos on the road to connect with her fans. "I'm very interested in what's the newest and the best...
