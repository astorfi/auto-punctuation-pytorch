It didn't seem that long ago that Microsoft held its last Surface tablet launch in New York City, but it's time again for yet another one. Yep, Microsoft has just sent us an invitation for a Surface-related event slated for May 20th in the Big Apple, imploring us to join them "for a small gathering." We really don't know much else aside from that, but we're guessing a new tablet -- possibly a mini Surface? -- could be unveiled. All we do know is that we'll be there live and in person to tell you all about it.
