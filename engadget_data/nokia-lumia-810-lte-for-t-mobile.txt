 We've some really unfortunate news to share with Lumia 810 owners who'd purchased the handset on T-Mobile's word that a software update would enable LTE support. As it turns out, despite the Lumia 810's hardware readiness and regulatory approval to access Band 4 LTE, that's not going to happen -- T-Mobile isn't going to release the update. Sadly, this isn't an April Fools' prank. If you're scratching your head about the revelation, you're not alone. Representatives for the UnCarrier first revealed to us back in January that a software update would enable LTE functionality, which is a position that it's maintained up through last week. As it stands, this leaves T-Mobile without an LTE offering for Windows Phone users, as the smartphone field is now limited to the Apple iPhone 5, BlackBerry Z10, HTC One, Samsung Galaxy Note II and Galaxy S4. We've asked T-Mobile whether it might make concessions to those who purchased the Lumia 810 on good faith that an LTE software update would be released, but for the moment, you'll need to find solace in the carrier's speedy HSPA+ 42 network.



  Statement from T-Mobile
  While the Nokia Lumia 810 features a chipset, which provides the hardware capability to support both HSPA+42 and LTE, the device will not automatically access our LTE network and, at this time, it will not receive an update to do so.  T-Mobile is committed to enhancing customers' experience with our devices, including providing upgrades to device features and operating systems, and T-Mobile aims to deliver software upgrades when it will provide a better experience for our customers. We'll share additional information on upgrades for the Nokia Lumia 810 when they are available.
