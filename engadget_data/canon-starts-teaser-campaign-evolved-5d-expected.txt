 
Canon just launched its teaser campaign dubbed, "Destined Evolution." There's no way at this point to know for sure, but that certainly looks like a compact, full-frame 5D body (pictured after the break) given the button locations, mode dial, and seemingly lack of a pop-up flash. Three years since the 5D was originally launched, Photokina suddenly can't come soon enough.Update: Another teaser shot with slightly more detail from Canon Japan posted after the break.
