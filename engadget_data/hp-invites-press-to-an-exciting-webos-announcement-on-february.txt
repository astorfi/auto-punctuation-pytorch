Think Beyond.' -- and that definitely sounds like a multi-product launch to us. If we were betting types, we'd put money on a phone (perhaps rumors we've been hearing about the 'world's smallest' smartphone will turn out to be true), a tablet, and lots of talk about the future of webOS. One thing missing? The name Palm. Looks like that brand could be on the way out. Regardless, we'll be there live delivering the news in true Engadget fashion... so get ready!
