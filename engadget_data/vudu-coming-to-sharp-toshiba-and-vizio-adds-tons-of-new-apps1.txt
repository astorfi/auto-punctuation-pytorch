 
The folks over at VUDU have been very busy apparently, not only have deals been struck to get VUDU onto new Sharp, Sanyo, and Toshiba HDTVs and Blu-ray players, but there are also 100 new apps for select models -- TV manufactures like LG can decide not to support the Apps even though the VUDU movie streaming is supported. The list is pretty extensive, but many of the names look iffy -- more like show names than apps -- so we'll hold back on judgement until after we've gotten a chance to try them first hand. There are some that piqued our interest though; like Twitter, Facebook and Weather. Check out the entire list for yourself after the break.
