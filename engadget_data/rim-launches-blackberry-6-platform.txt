 
It's been teased since WES back in April -- but with the launch of the Torch today, RIM had to come clean with all the details on its thoroughly refreshed BlackBerry 6 operating system, too. Besides the obvious name change from "BlackBerry OS" to simply "BlackBerry," the software features countless updates, most notably new universal search functionality, social network aggregation, WiFi-powered media sync with your desktop music collection, and an all-new (and desperately needed) WebKit-based browser with support for HTML5. Thankfully, RIM has also committed to bringing BlackBerry 6 as an upgrade to at least a few recent models -- the Bold 9700, Bold 9650, and Pearl 3G, to be specific -- "subject to carrier certifications in the months ahead." Follow the break for the full press release and video teaser.
