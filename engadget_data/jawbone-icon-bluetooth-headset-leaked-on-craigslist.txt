HTCPedia managed to get cozy with Mr. Blurrycam and got a few shots of the supposedly forthcoming Jawbone Icon, which appears to don the same skin pattern as the Jawbone Prime but in a form factor similar to the original Jawbone -- quite an odd decision so we remain skeptical, but it'd be a welcoming addition for the market nevertheless. A couple of close-up shots after the break.

[Thanks, Brian!]
