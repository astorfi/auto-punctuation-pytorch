 There's no official word on the wires, but we don't think Stuff.tv has a particularly good reason to fake press shots of new Sonos gear, so we'll give 'em the benefit of the doubt until we hear otherwise -- the cheeky Brits say Sonos is set to unveil two new ZonePlayers, the ZP120 and ZP90, both of which feature MIMO antennas for extended range. Just as in the current lineup, the £249 ZP90 is a receiver only, while the £349 ZP120 features a built-in amp in a package 43 percent smaller than the ZP100. Should be available soon, separately or in the £699 BU150 bundle.
