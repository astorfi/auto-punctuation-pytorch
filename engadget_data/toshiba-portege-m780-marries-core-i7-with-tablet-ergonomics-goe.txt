Bob has spotted the above M780 tablet PC from Toshiba (which we first heard of a couple of weeks ago) on the company's official site, though its product page has yet to be linked to from any of the home pages. So it's official, but sort of prematurely so. Browsing through the spec sheet, this update to the M750 seems to lack for nothing, as its maxed out variant (priced at $1,799) offers a 2.66GHz Core i7-620M, 4GB of DDR3 RAM and a 7200RPM 320GB hard drive. Okay, you could stand to upgrade those integrated graphics perhaps, but it's a potent package nonetheless. It's also interesting to see these 12-inch convertible tablets maturing to the point of offering viable workstation performance, as the M780 is joined by Lenovo's ThinkPad X201T and Fujitsu's upcoming tablet in offering Intel's finest and fastest dual-core processor inside.

[Thanks, Bob]

Update: Toshiba has completed the ceremonies of officialdom now, with a full press release, which also notes the addition of a multitouch panel to the Satellite Pro U500.
