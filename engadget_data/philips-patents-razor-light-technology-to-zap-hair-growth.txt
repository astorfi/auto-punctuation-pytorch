 While most folks aren't exactly fond of going bald on their noggin, eliminating the pesky hair on faces and legs doesn't sound half bad. Aside from the gazillion topical treatments scams available at your local Wally World, there's always the uber-expensive "laser hair removal" option, but Philips seems to think it has a less costly, less intrusive solution. The firm has recently patented razor light technology, which utilizes "low doses of electromagnetic radiation" to kick active follicles into the dormant catagen phase. By sending pulses "between 1 and 100 milliseconds" apart just above the skin, it offers up a relatively safe, easy, and (hopefully) pain free experience to putting a halt to shaving every other day (or more). Obviously, the method isn't aimed at immediate hair removal, as plans are to implement numerous treatments over "two week intervals," but it could slowly eliminate the regrowth of hair once treated. So while we're not exactly sure when you'll be replacing that bag of disposables with a newfangled light gun, a little help in the hygiene department is never a bad thing.[Via NewScientistTech]
