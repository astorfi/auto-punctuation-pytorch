The real kicker is that the E-P2 is said to be bringing with it an oft-desired viewfinder, while the M9 will reportedly be a full-frame camera, and presumably cost more than a small car. Of course, neither are anywhere close to being official, but it may not be the worst idea to stick with your current gear a little while longer to see how things shake out.Read - Photo Rumors, "Chasseur d'Image magazine: Leica M9 in September"Read - Leica rumors, "Olympus EP-2: released before the end of the year, with a viewfinder"[Thanks, Tony]
