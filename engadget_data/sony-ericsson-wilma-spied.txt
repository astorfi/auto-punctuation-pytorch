We'll round this up real quicksince there's been a slew of Sony Ericsson bits over the last couple of weeks. During CES SE announcedthe W810i, the successor to the K750. But shortly thereafter wecaught wind of another new leaked phone (assuming it's real, anyhow), which we're hearing referred to as"Betty." Then a couple of days ago we saw some shots of what's supposedly SE's new P970/P980 QWERTY phone. But SE'sleak o' the day today, the Wilma, will supposedly trump all of their previous devices with a 3.2 megapixel camera, QVGAdisplay, Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP, stereo speakers, 466MB of internal flash, a front-facing conference cam, andEDGE/UMTS. Do we think this thing's legit? Eh, hard to say, but we'll keep our fingers crossed.
