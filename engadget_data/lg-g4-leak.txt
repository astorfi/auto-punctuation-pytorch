Oops. LG is supposed to be unveiling its range-topping G4 smartphone on April 28th, but well-known leaker Evan Blass has discovered an unannounced product site that reveals a ton about the new Android flagship a couple of weeks in advance. A lot of the text is clearly placeholder material, but there are a few noteworthy revelations here. The G4's back will have several color options (including multiple shades of real leather), and that super-fast f/1.8 camera is helped out by an infrared color accuracy sensor, second-generation image stabilization and a full manual mode.



          
 
 
 Other details you've probably seen before -- the G4 packs a color-rich 5.5-inch Quad HD screen, the latest version of LG's custom interface and both a removable 3,000mAh battery as well as a microSD slot. There are still a few tidbits that aren't mentioned in this unintentional teaser (the specs page largely rehashes the G3's info), but something tells us that LG's big event won't hold a lot of surprises.
