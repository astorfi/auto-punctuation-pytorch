Now, some five months after its triumphant launch in the US of A and other countries, Cupertino's started selling the pixel-packed new iPad for 50 bucks less than the original price -- that's if, of course, you don't mind a refurbished unit. Still, as we've said before, Apple includes a one-year warranty with each iPad sold via its "Certified Refurbished" online store, which is considerably better than any Craigslist deal you might find out there. Currently, stock appears to be quite loaded, but you never know how long that's going to last. In other words, you may want to get 'em while they're hot.
