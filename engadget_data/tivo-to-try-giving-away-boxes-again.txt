After all, he hasn't been CEO that long. So, when Rogers announced recently that the company would starta test of a no-upfront-fee plan "fairly soon," he couldn't possibly have known that the company actually didstart offering such a plan back in November of last year, and that links from the plan's web page still function,allowing customers to sign up for TiVo for $16.95 per month with no money down. Wait a minute. You say Rogers becameCEO last July, and, therefore, was already with the company when the free deal was announced last November? Hmm. Maybehe was just out that day. Either that or he just hit the wrong button and skipped over it.[Thanks toeveryone who sent this in]
