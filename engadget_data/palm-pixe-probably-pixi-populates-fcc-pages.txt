At any rate, the Palm Pixi has popped up in the FCC database, being tested for CDMA/1xEVDO Rel 0 and EVDO Rev. A along with Bluetooth... and naturally, no WiFi. Not much else to say here and the most interesting pics are locked under a confidentiality agreement. Of course, there's always a chance this is an entirely different Sprint-bound phone lacking WiFi, but that'd just be cruel.
