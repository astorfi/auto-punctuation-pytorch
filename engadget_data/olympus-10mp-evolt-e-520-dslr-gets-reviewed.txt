The cats over at PhotographyBLOG managed to secure a fully functional unit, and results were much, much improved. Although reviewers didn't go quite so far as to call it the perfect camera, it sure came close in their eyes. Aside from the depressingly small viewfinder and the low quantity of AF sensors, critics found the unit quite hard to bash. Overall, it managed to snag a stellar 4.5 out of 5 rating, and better still, it was said to be just the thing for "beginners and enthusiasts alike." Taking Olympus more seriously in your search for a suitable DSLR just might be in order.
