Now that the gadget market is properly saturated and just about everyone who wants one has a cellphone, an MP3
player, a DVD player, and a digital camera, manufacturers are finally wising up and exploiting the huge untapped
potential of the animal world. Or at least TOMY is with their new Wonderful Shot 3.5 megapixel digital camera for dogs,
which they're supposed to wear around their neck. There's a remote control for triggering the shutter (we're
disappointed they didn't trust/respect the dog's artistic sensibility) but with any luck there's also an option to have
it just take photos every five minutes or something so you can finally figure out what the heck your canine is up to
all day.
