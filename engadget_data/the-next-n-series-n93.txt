We don't know much about what's going on here, but from our broken translation we can glean that there's another
Nokia N-series device out there somewhere — perhaps the successor to the
N92? — that appears to have a rather chubby 3 megapixel
autofocusing 3x zoom camera, DVB-H functionality, and may also feature HSDPA / UMTS / EDGE, 802.11g, and Bluetooth 1.2.
Anyone else seen this thing floating around?
