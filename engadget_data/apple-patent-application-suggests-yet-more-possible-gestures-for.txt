As you can see above, Apple's using a nano in its illustrations for the patent, but the actual claims suggest that the gestures wouldn't necessarily require a screen at all -- possibly for something similar to that back-side interface that also turned up in an Apple patent application? As for the gestures themselves, they'd apparently involve things like a single tap to pause or play, a double tap to skip forward, a triple tap to skip back, and a circular motion to control the volume. Of course, that aforementioned patent application was published in 2007 and we've yet to see anything result from it, so you may not want to hold your breath for this one either.
