In no uncertain terms, Stephen Elop said that Nokia's, "First MeeGo device will be a 2011 event." A device rumored to be the N9, pictured above. In general communications about new Nokia products will be made far closer to product availability. Elop added that his first impression of Nokia's MeeGo work "inspires both confidence and excitement." Let's hope so, in Q1 2011 Nokia's MeeGo smartphone OS will be battling resurgent webOS and Windows Phone 7 devices in addition to the Android, iOS, and BlackBerry incumbents at the high-end of the market.
