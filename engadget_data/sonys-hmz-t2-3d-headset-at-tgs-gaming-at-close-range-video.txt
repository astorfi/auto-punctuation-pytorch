In addition to the headset's substitutional reality prototype, the standard model stakes claim to almost a fifth of PlayStation's demo area. With all the local buzz, we decided to weigh in on how the $900 headgear shapes up as a gaming display. The answer? Heavily. Out of necessity, the HMZ-T2 crams the majority of its hardware in front of the users eyeballs, bearing most of its weight on the nose. Over extended gaming sessions, we could see this becoming uncomfortable -- and indeed, in our short time with the device we found our neck relaxing, begging to give in to the weight of the device. As silly as hung-head gaming might appear, however, the visual effect certainly does the trick -- creating the illusion of a large 3D television 4-6 feet in front of the user. It didn't add anything to Hot Shots Golf 6 in terms of gameplay or experience, but it certainly comes in a more compact form than a full size television. The fancy headgear could surely be a boon for gamers living in a tight space, but folks with room (and cash) to spare are probably better off with a proper flat screen. On the other hand, visors are way more futuristic looking. Don't believe us? See us get our Geordi La Forge on after the break.
