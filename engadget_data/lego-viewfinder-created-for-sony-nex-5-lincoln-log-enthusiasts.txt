 Do you spend your days pining for a viewfinder with some Danish building-block flair for your shiny new Sony NEX-5? Well, your camera woes have been solved -- while appealing to your childlike aesthetic sensibilities -- by a DIYer who fashioned just such a viewfinder out of some Lego blocks and parts from an old CD-ROM drive. Its complexity doesn't quite match that of an all-Lego camera, but it's a slick little solution for those who want to add some pizazz -- and functionality -- to Sony's favorite not-quite-Micro Four-Thirds shooter. Hit up the source link to see how to build one for yourself.
