Microsoft's tech support seems to be vaguely aware of the issue, and recommends trying again on Tuesday the 28th, since the server "might be down for a few days." Oh, is that all?Update: Looks like they've fixed it. Thanks for the heads up, Marius.[Via Boing Boing; thanks to everyone who sent this in]
