Unfortunately it'sonly a non-working prototype at the moment, but you can expect to see these hit the streets this summer in Asia andthen launched at IFA in Berlin this September for the rest of world, likely sans DMB and that big telescoping antenna.Hands ons with the, uh, mockup after the break.
