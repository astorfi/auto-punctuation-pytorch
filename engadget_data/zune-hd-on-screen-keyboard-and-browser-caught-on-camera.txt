It's only a minor glimpse, but it definitely looks sleek. Shot of the browser after the break, and hit up the read link for full gallery. Seriously, Microsoft, add a 3G chipset and dialer app, and you can go ahead and draft those "million seller" press releases already.

Update: CNET has posted some more pictures of the browser and keyboard, including Facebook in landscape mode.
