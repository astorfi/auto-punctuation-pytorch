Finally got off the reservation list for Mailbox? Now there's another app trying to sway your Gmail loyalty that's just arrived for iPad: Evomail. It brings "frictionless" support for Google's mail client, including quick access to labels, trash and archives, full Gmail search, push notifications and social network sharing for Twitter or Facebook. While launching strictly on the iPad, the developers told us that versions for iPhone, then Android would follow, but that it'd only support Google's mail service "at the moment." If you think it might serve your Gmail needs better than, er, the free-of-charge Gmail app, it's $2.99 at the source.
