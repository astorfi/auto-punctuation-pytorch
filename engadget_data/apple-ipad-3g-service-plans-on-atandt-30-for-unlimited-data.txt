A 250MB plan, meanwhile, will be available for half that at $14.99 a month. Activation can happen right on the device -- no store visits or calls are necessary -- and there's no contract involved. The device is fully unlocked, so if you absolutely want to, you're welcome to take it to any other GSM carrier of your choice (assuming you can find a SIM that works -- Apple's talking up a new "micro SIM" for it). International users, stay tuned: Apple expects to have deals in place for you by June of this year.
