While it lacks the sexy we saw in the last two outings, the Motorola i872 will certainly appeal to longtime iDEN fans with its vanilla clamshell style. Specs are thin for this device but we're hearing it packs a 1.3 megapixel shooter with LED flash, Bluetooth with A2DP, and an SD slot to bump your memory up for music and such. No word on pricing but it should apparently start shipping next quarter. As per usual, this is all rumor magic, but we hope that the proof arrives in the next little while. Hit the gallery for a couple more shots.[Thanks, iDENguy]
