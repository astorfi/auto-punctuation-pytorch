 
Holla! Verizon justannounced availability of the first Windows Mobile-powered Treo, the long-awaited Treo 700w. Thespecs are exactly what we'd figured, but we'll run 'em down for ya again: EV-DO, a 1.3 megapixel digital camera, 128MBof memory, Bluetooth 1.2, removable battery, an SDIO expansion card slot, and a 240 x 240 pixel display (which is lowerres than the 320 x 320 display found in the Treo 650). They're selling it for $399.99 with a two-year service agreement.Anyone ordered theirs yet?
