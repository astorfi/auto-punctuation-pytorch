Due to be announced tomorrow at Digital Life, the Gateway One is a sleek little all-in-one number, rocking a slot-loading DVD burner, a bunch of inputs and even wall-mounting capabilities. No word on screen size, but it looks spacious enough. The One hosts an easily-replaced hard drive and memory, along with a 5-in-1 card reader. You can score the One in one of three configurations, starting at $1,300 for a 1.5GHz Core 2 Duo processor, 2GB of RAM, a 320GB HDD and Intel X3100 integrated graphics, and ramping on up to the $1,800 unit with a 2GHz processor, 3GB of RAM, 500GB HDD and Mobility Radeon HD 2600 dedicated graphics. The third version splits the difference on specs for $1,500. Apparently there's even a webcam hidden somewhere in the unit, though you couldn't tell it from the pics. There's another shot after the break.[Via Digg]Read - MacNN (while it lasts)Read - SlashGear (currently down)Read - Gateway One teaser page
