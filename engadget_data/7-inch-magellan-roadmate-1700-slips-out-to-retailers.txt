The big selling point with this one, as you might have surmised, is its spacious 7-inch widescreen display, which gets paired with a number of other features right in line with Magellan's other recent RoadMate offerings. That includes complete maps of the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, built-in AAA TourBook listings, six million points of interest, text-to-speech, and a microSD card slot for expansion, among other standard fare. No firm word on a release date, but Best Buy is estimating availability between September 14th and 21st, and currently has it listed for $299.99.[Via GPS Review]
