We've never been big fans of information appliances — except in the aftermarket, where they inevitably become great
hacker toys — and the upcoming Verizon One will probably be no exception. While the idea of combining a DSL modem, WiFi
router and cordless phone into a single unit has its advantages, the addition of a touchscreen display with email
access, news and information services adds up to either an overpowered phone system or an underpowered computer. We
suspect that most users will brand this the latter, though we'd be happy to put one in our kitchen, next to our 3Com
Audrey.
