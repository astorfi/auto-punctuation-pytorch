       There's really no point in launching a major new portable audio device without a ton of accessories, so Microsoft's got you Zuneheads covered with a trio of packs to maximize your listening experience at home, in the car, or when you're getting your travel on. The Zune Home A/V Pack is centered around a dock (obviously), which you connect to your home theater gear through the bundled AV cable, and control with the included wireless remote; this pack also includes a sync cable and AC adapter. When you're rocking the Zune in your ride, the Car Pack will deliver power from your DC socket and transmit songs with the obligatory FM transmitter. Finally, for jamming to tunes while holed up in a sleazy motel, you can enhance the experience somewhat with the Zune Travel Pack, which includes premium earbuds (hopefully magnetic -- fingers crossed), a so-called dual connect remote, snazzy gear bag, and the same sync cable and AC adapter found in the home kit. Also noteworthy are the number of third-party manufacturers on-board to help you pimp out your Zune, including Altec Lansing, DLO, Griffin, Klipsch, Logitech, Harman Kardan, and several more -- basically the same folks who have been accessorizing your iPod for all these years. Okay, enough with the peripherals -- go read about the hardware and software, 'cause like, that's what's actually influencing your purchasing decision, no?
