Even though Sony's offering a few free PlayStation 4 games at launch to PlayStation Plus members, the company apparently wants to extend its philanthropy to the entire PS4 consumer base. Every PlayStation 4 comes pre-loaded with a copy of The Playroom, which you may remember from E3 2013 as "that crazy demo thing that uses basically every piece of the DualShock 4 and PS4 Eye to amazing effect."


If you did miss the video and you're not able to watch at the moment, know this: The Playroom is a super neat addition to the PS4 console. It essentially acts as the Wii Sports for the PlayStation 4, showing off everything from the DualShock 4's lightbar to the PS4 Eye's depth-sensing functionality. It's also full of adorable little robots, should all that other stuff not suffice. We've dropped our full video walking through its features just below; the PlayStation 4 is planned for launch in "holiday 2013" at $400.


Update: Please excuse us if we've misled anyone -- the PlayStation 4 Eye does not come packed in with the console and DualShock 4. It's a separate $60 purchase, though The Playroom still ships with PS4 consoles.
