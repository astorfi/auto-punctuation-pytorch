With all this talk of some prominent companies casting their wrists into the increasingly hot world of wearables, let's not forget the number of folks that have been toiling away in that world for some time now. Companies like TomTom, which is already on the, erm, pulse of the watch world. The GPS-maker announced plans for two new sporty additions to its line earlier this year, and now the Runner and Multi-Sport have found their way to the market. The Runner's got indoor tracking, a speedy GPS locator, desktop stat syncing, a heart rate monitor, 10-hour battery and waterproof / scratch resistant casing. The Multi-Sport's got all of the above, plus a bike mount, altimeter, motion sensor for swimming and a cadence sensor. Both are available now in the states, priced at $170 and $200, respectively.
