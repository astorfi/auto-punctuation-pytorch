All the same, LaBiche's claims that "A real Flying Car is finally here!" have piqued our interest, and we're pleased to hear that this FSC-1TM flying sports car thing should be able to hit an airspeed in excess of 275 mph, not bad at all for a pair of retractable wings. So far the most testing this thing has gotten is in the X-Plane flight simulator software, and in a 1/10th scale model plane prototype. A full-size mockup is in the works, and apparently they're all ready to take your money for a $175,000 build-it-yourself kit, but we're guessing it'll be a few years until someone is foolhardy enough to try and get the real deal off the ground.[Via The Raw Feed]
