Audi, who's long been toying with the idea of building self-driving cars, has upgraded one of its RS 7 sedans to be an autonomous concept vehicle for those who like to ride fast. The prototype looks pretty much like a production version RS 7, except its steering wheel, brakes, throttle valve and other components are all controlled by a self-driving system. It uses GPS (for orientation), radio signals and a 3D camera (which takes pictures used for additional positioning information) to drive the car around a race track. You read that right: the upgraded RS 7's nothing like Google's wholesome bug-like car meant for ordinary people and everyday driving.





 No, it was made for race tracks and Fast and Furious movies, that's why the company's demonstrating what it can do on the Hockenheimring, a motor-racing circuit in Germany, on October 17th and 19th. The car will do one lap around the track -- where Audi's expecting it to reach a top speed of 149.1 mph and to finish in 2 minutes and 10 seconds -- on both days completely driverless. This isn't the first time Audi's sending an autonomous car to conquer a race track, though: back in 2010, a driverless Audi TTS Coupe successfully climbed Colorado's Pikes Peak mountain race circuit within 27 minutes.
