  Screen Grabs chronicles the uses (and misuses) of real-world gadgets in today's movies and TV. Send in your sightings (with screen grab!) to screengrabs at engadget dot com.   We'd be lying if we said we were frenemies with Gossip Girl's goings-on (one of them's in the Pretty Reckless, right?). Fom the picture above, it looks like Serena van der Woodsen's shipping magnate father must have lifted this HP Envy 14 Spectre off the back of one of his shipments, given that the glass-built Ultrabook doesn't arrive in stores until February 8th. It wouldn't be the first time the show's squeezed in some unrealistic product placement: there was the time Serena had a SIM-card packing Verizon Droid X, or when someone had actually bought a Kin.[Thanks, Ross]
