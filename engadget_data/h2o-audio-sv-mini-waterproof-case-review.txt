The H2O Audio SV Mini waterproof case for the iPod mini, besides looking a bit unpleasant,
sort of fails in the one thing it's actually supposed toÂ do, i.e. waterproof your iPod mini. The reviewer took it
and the waterproof headphones just a few feet underwater and found that after submerging the unit, there were water
splotches inside the case. Anyone found a decent waterproof case for iPods that actually works?
