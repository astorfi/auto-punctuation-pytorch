As was pretty clear from the early shots, this one's a sleek little device and, while it doesn't exactly pack a whole slew of features, it looks to perform all the basic tasks with welcome simplicity. On the downside, the 1.8-inch screen apparently leaves a bit to be desired, especially when playing videos and, while the included earphones are a tad better than the usual fare, the sound quality from the player itself is apparently just average. Hit up the link below for the full blow-by-blow account, including a bonus unboxing / demo video.
