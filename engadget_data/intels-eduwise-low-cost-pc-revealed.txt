The $400 device announced a few months ago inBrazil, sports "light-blue accents" and "snaps shut like a purse" -- perfect for students andteachers on a tight-budget with a sense of flair -- runs Windows or Linux, and ships pre-loaded with special softwareallowing students and teachers to interact through shared presentations and test administration over the Eduwise'sbuilt-in WiFi. The Eduwise will be available "next year" via the usual outlet of PC manufacturers who'll nodoubt tweak this reference design a bit. Of course, Intel had to take the spotlight opp to blast a shot across the bow of the $100OLPC with Otellini saying, "nobody wants to cross the digital divide using yesterday's technology." Yeah,nor should they have to harvest a kidney to avoid crossing the classroom for a little one-on-one, eh? Man, we haven'tseen this much selfish generosity since Atlas shrugged.[Via Sagags]
