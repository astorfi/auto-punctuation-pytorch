filing a patent for controllers or devices with tilt inputâ€”but what do you know, their patent was approved, and now
we'll probably see a few dozen peripheral companies sued or settle for patent infringement. Ok, maybe not, but someone
get a pen and paper before we forget this idea: Engadget is officially filing to patent a method of input control
wherein a device's microcontroller receives digital signals based upon kinetic impacts made on an implemented form or
surface. It's all about gaming the patent system, yo.
