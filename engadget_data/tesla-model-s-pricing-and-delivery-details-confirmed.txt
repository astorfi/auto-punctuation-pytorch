A base Model S, with an estimated 160 miles of range, will retail for $57,400 and will of course be eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit. The 230 mile range version will carry a $10,000 premium, and if you want a chance at making 300 miles on a charge it's another $10k on top of that. 

So, $77,400 then if you want the top of the line Model S 300, which initially will be called the "Model S Signature Series" in the US, a limited edition run of 1,000 autos with big batts. Deliveries are expected to begin sometime around the summer of 2012, with the 230 and 160 versions coming later in the year. Tesla hopes to produce 5,000 of the cars in total in 2012, a whopping 20,000 in 2013. Oh, and should you live in a market that requires a right-hand drive model you have about a two year wait ahead of you. That's what you get for driving on the wrong side of the road.
