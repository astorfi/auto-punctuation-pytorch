New iPads means new accessories, right? Hot on the heels of announcing the new iPad mini and the ridiculously thin iPad Air, Apple revealed two new cases to go with each. These include a standard cover (similar to what's available now), which is priced at $39. There's also going to be a leather version for $79. Additionally, Apple will be selling a Product Red version, though it's unclear how much that will cost, if there is in fact a premium.
