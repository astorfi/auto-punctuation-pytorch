 While Nintendo's Wii has been the undisputed champ of at-launch availability so far, and looks to be well on the way to its projected 4 million sales by the end of the year, supply problems are starting to crop up in Europe. Apparently Nintendo hasn't yet shipped the full quantities it has promised to some retailers, which naturally doesn't sit too well with pre-order customers. Hopes are high for getting the rest of those pre-ordered Wiis by Christmas, but that's little consolation to the fanboys hoping to get their European Wii on by December 8th. Non pre-order customers pretty much don't stand a chance, and we're just hoping this doesn't all end in tears, PS3 style.
