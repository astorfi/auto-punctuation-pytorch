When YouTube's offline viewing feature launches in November, don't expect to find Vevo on board. According to Variety, the music video service has opted out of the functionality, which will let users download videos on Youtube mobile apps for up to 48 hours of offline playback. YouTube reportedly gave Vevo and other partners a chance to opt out of the upcoming feature, so -- while Vevo is the site's biggest content supplier -- this news is hardly scandalous. It makes sense, too; the music video provider has its own apps to promote, after all.
