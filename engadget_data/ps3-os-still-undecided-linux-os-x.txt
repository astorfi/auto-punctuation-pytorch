So way back in June, Kutaragi was spouting some
hyperbole about the Cell being the one processor to rule them all, with the ability to power a
PS3 console running
potentially multiple operating systems. He name-dropped Linux and Mac OS X as possibilities for the default operating
system in the PS3. A recent article on the Sony website confirms that they're still looking into the possibility of the
PS3 running Linux or Tiger — or at least that they've got some really wishful thinking going on that Stevie J is gonna
license OS X for use in the box. So what do you think — pure PR hype? Public plea? Or some sort of tease on an actual,
potential partnership?
