Who can possibly be contented with their hamsters merely
powering their lights? We want it all. We want hamsters
powering our kitchen appliances, we want them powering our video game consoles, we want them charging our phones. Yeah,
you heard us. Of course, exactly what happens when your poor little organic electricity production unit runs out of
steam is entirely up to you, but we might recommend buying an itsy bitsy whip and an itsy bitsy circus ringleader
costume for your hand to keep the ball rolling. Gotta make 'dem calls!


 P.S. To Peter Ash, the creator of this device: don't worry dude, even though you got a C for this project, you're on
Engadget now. And that's gotta mean something, right?


 [Thanks, GCR]
