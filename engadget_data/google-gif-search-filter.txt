 Do you find yourself spending countless hours combing through image searches looking for GIFs of cats wearing sunglasses telling people to "deal with it"? If so, then your lack of productivity is about to become even more galling. Earlier today, Google announced the addition of an animated GIF filter that allows searchers to specifically weed out photos that move. To access this soon to be overused feature, click on Google's Search tools option and select "Animated" as your image type. While we'd hate to pull you away from your epic search for your next internet avatar, you could actually try doing something constructive, like studying the history of the GIF. Or taking a whack at spamming comments with GIFs from Knight Rider, like a certain editor that we know.
