This includes the iPhone 4, fourth-generation iPod touch, and even the first-generation iPad. Alas, both movies and slideshows will be capped at 720p output from these older devices, whereas the iPad 2 goes a little further with screen mirroring of up to 1080p -- we're guessing the beastly dual-core A5 chip is what makes the magic happen here, though movie output's also limited to 720p. And hey, we're only a few months away from finding out if the next iPhone will also get some 1080p love, so no pressure on buying this dongle just yet.
