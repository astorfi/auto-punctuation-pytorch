 After that luke warm reception (and we're being pretty generous there) it looks like B&O + Samsung are still bringing the Serene (aka SGH-E910) to US shores. From the sound of their fluffy press release, it seems like the Serene will merely be sold in B&O stores, and probably at the boutique cost one might expect. For those actually considering it, we can tell you that it's supposed to include a brushed aluminum docking station and travel charger, and it'll have a specially designed leather Louis Vuitton case for it available at B&O and some LV stores, but really, why spend all this time polishing a turd?
