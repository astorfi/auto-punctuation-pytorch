As you can see, the thumb drive should at least match the laptop quite nicely, but there unfortunately doesn't seem to be any word as to what capacities will be available, or any other details for that matter. We're pretty sure you can expect them to roll out sometime before the Olympics get underway this summer, however, with 'em likely to demand a bit of a premium over other, non-Olympic drives.
