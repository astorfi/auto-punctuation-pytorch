The little Massachusetts startup that got all of our hopes up with a localcasting ZvBox showed up at this year's CEDIA, and while it didn't bring much to the show (after all, it only has one product), there seemed to be a good bit of buzz around the floor. We're still giving ours a thorough run-through, but if you're anxious to see what ZeeVee was doing in Denver, check out the gallery below.
