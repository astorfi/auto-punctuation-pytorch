"Thank you for waiting, everyone." That's how Nintendo capped the new trailer today for Shin Megami Tensei x Fire Emblem, a Wii U game it's developing with Japanese publisher Atlus, announced back in January 2013. While the video is fairly gorgeous and shows off some gameplay, it doesn't offer a release date. We did, however, get the following description: "The role-playing masters at Atlus are developing a truly modern RPG where everyday life exists alongside a secret world of fantasy." Watch the trailer below.
