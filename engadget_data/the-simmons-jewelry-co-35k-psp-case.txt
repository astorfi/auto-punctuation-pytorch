We might be a little more down with a $35,000 jewel-encrusted PSP, but we're just gonna have to settle for the
$35,000 jewel-encrusted PSP case that Russel and Kimora Lee Simmons are finally
breaking out in conjunction with M. Fabrikant & Sons
jewelers. Apparently the Baby Phat version we
saw last year actually has a full pound of gold,
alligator skin, and yellow and black diamonds, and god only knows what we can expect from the straight Simmons Jewelry
Co. version. We're not entirely sure what he means by saying "Much of the profits will go back to Africa," but Russ,
weekend jaunts to Morocco don't count, ok?
