 Trust. It's a valuable commodity. But serial twitter-sleuth @evleaks has done enough to earn ours for this latest leak. A Windows Phone 8 device -- apparently known internally as the Tiara -- which will be one of the first to run the next revision of the mobile operating system (GDR2). With a reported 4.3-inch display, a 1.2GHz Snapdragon processor, 1.6-megapixel front-facing camera and 1GB of RAM, it bears more than a resemblance to another recent addition to the HTC fold. If you had hopes that it might also borrow from the firm's latest Android flagship design, then sorry to dash them, as the sources suggest otherwise. The Tiara moniker is unlikely to remain, with @evleaks taking a stab at it coming to market mid-May, possibly as the HTC 8W. Not a bad guess. Now it's just a matter of waiting to see if all that trust is truly well placed.
