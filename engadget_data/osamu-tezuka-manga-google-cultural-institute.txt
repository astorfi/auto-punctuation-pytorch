One of the (if not the) most influential manga artists ever, Osamu Tezuka, has joined the digital halls of the Google Cultural Institute. If there was no Tezuka, there would have probably been no Dragonball, no One Piece... well, you get the picture. The collection includes a Google Street View tour of the museum founded in his honor, as well as a beautifully curated selection of photos, artwork and video clips. It's all been timed to coincide with Atomu's (Astro Boy) birthday, the robot boy that's now 62 years old-- and starred in Japan's first (yes, first) anime. While the collection might not touch the mind-blowing 700 total manga titles the artist completed in his lifetime, it's a mighty well-presented primer.
