 In addition to that curiously familiar-looking DSLR, Samsung also introduced a pair of compact digital cameras at Photo & Imaging 2006 in Korea today, the Digimax L70 (seen here) and the Digimax S1000. The L70 is a 7.1 megapixel camera with a 3x optical zoom, 2.5-inch LCD, and a 1/2.5-inch CCD image sensor. And, at least according to LetsGoDigital's translation, Samsung appears to to be pushing the camera as a PMP as well, touting its 9-key "multicontroller" design on the back of the camera, which we unfortunately can't see. The S1000 is Samsung's first 10 megapixel compact, coming equipped with a 3x zoom, 2.5-inch LCD, and a 1/1.8-inch CCD image sensor. No word yet on pricing or availability.
