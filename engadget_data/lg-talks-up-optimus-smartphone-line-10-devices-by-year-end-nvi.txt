LG stated on Wednesday that it's pouring some mega cash on R&D and marketing to play catch up, and it plans to release a whopping 10 smartphones by the end of the year, projecting sales of 5 million units in that time. The low-end Optimus One kicks things off in September with a whopping 120 carriers globally, but LG also said it has a dual-core Tegra 2 based handset in the works for the performance minded. It's unclear if this is a replacement chip for the supposedly Snapdragon LU2300 Optimus Q (pictured) or the innards for another handset entirely, but 10 phones is a big quota to fill (at least for anyone who isn't LG or Samsung), so hopefully it's the latter. Finally, LG reiterated that it's working on a tablet for Q4. "It's going to be surprisingly productive," said LG's Chang Ma, attempting to set it apart from the iPad in that regard. So, LG's for-serious about Android, but is it too late? According to Mr. Ma, who may or may not have slowly donning a pair of really hip sunglasses at the moment, "The race hasn't started yet."
