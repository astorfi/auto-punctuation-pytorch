 
Whether you need it or not, HDMI 1.3a is all the rage these days. Maybe it's because it's the way we're used to doing things, but maybe it's cause we want our audio decoded by the same piece of equipment that amplifies it (but probably because Dolby can license more equipment). Regardless of where you like your Dolby TureHD decoded, we love options. Just like the recently announced Onkyo receivers, Pioneer's new lineup of Elite receivers includes decoders for Dolby TrueHD, DTS MA and a slew of other formats. These new receivers offer other features too; like iPod and satellite radio compatibility and HDMI Consumer Electronics Control. The HDMI 1.3 equipped models start with a MSRP of $1000 and will be available in June.
