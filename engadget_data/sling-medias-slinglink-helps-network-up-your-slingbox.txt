Sling Media has a new product called SlingLink for their
Slingbox remote TV viewing device. It's a fairly
basic network adapter that allows you to create a simple Slingbox network over your home's electrical wiring without
much networking know how, and would be perfect as a bundle if you're gifting the Slingbox to someone a bit less tech
savvy, but you could probably find a networking solution cheaper than the Slinglink's $99 if they already have WiFi set
up. It's nothing ground breaking, as networking products
such as this have been around for years, but
Sling Media seems to be going to extra mile to make sure that you'll have a hard time not getting the Slingbox
up and running.
