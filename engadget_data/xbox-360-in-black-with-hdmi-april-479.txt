Joystiq seems to think it's not a hoax, but instead a legitimate leak from Game Informer, which supposedly had the details. Also noted, the 120GB drive will be available separately for under two bills, no internal HD DVD (duh); no word on integrated WiFi (don't hold your breath). We're still skeptical, but hey, we're still very interested, too.
