"Pearl 2") official, with it likely headed to the aforementioned carries sometime between now and Thanksgiving. As we had heard before, this one comes with built-in GPS (which Boy Genius speculates will be disabled on Verizon's offering), along with A2DP/AVRCP Bluetooth, a 2 megapixel camera (with video recording capability), and a standard 3.5mm audio jack. According to RIM, you can also expect an overhauled interface, complete with an updated browser and some improved multimedia features, including the ability to create and edit playlists. Still no word on a price, but we'd expect Sprint and Verizon to be doling out that info before too long.[Via The Boy Genius Report]
