For a while it looked like Telstra might opt for a smart workaround to the old handset's lack of memory, but now the operator's update page makes it clear that it has fallen in line with the wider HTC stance: Android 2.3 just isn't viable on this device, unless you're prepared to go off-piste with the developer build or an unofficial ROM.
