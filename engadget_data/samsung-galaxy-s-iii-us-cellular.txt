US Cellular, the first of the smaller folks to announce that it's carrying the flagship, confirmed to us today that the 16GB version of the device will be available online beginning tomorrow and should get stocked on retail shelves by the end of the week. The 32GB model is coming, but no exact dates have been announced yet. The price? $200 for 16GB and $250 for 32GB, both after $100 mail-in rebates. Rejoice, ye USCC users, for your turn to ravish in the glory of the GS III is finally here.
