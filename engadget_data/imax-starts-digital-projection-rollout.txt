 Keep an eye out for a new development at IMAX theaters near you, as it starts to roll out digital projection to its 296 theaters next month. Two sites in Washington and one in Philadelphia are first (not to mention those new theaters in Russia), with 50 expected to be complete by the end of the year. The big deal here is that the savings cost, switching from a $22,000 70mm IMAX print to $800 hard drive copies, along with more joint venture deals, should lead the company to profitability according to analysts. Look for more flicks available in IMAX format as a result, with Madagascar 2 making the first big jump to digital, with plans to hit 35 screens on November 7.
