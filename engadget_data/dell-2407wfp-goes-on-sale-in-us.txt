But what can we say, we love them big-booty monitors, so head on over to Dell's site if you've got the itch to drop $949 US on a screen that'll light up that life with 1920 x 1200 pixels. That's a lot of pixels friend, you should at least consider it.P.S. -For those wondering, unfortunatel the monitor's ship date is still listed as unavailable, so don't buy if you're expecting to get the thing overnighted, ok?[Thanks, master_of_fm]
