As you might imagine, Google was not terribly pleased at this turn of events, and issued the following retort: "The Android activation numbers do not include upgrades and are, in fact, only a portion of the Android devices in the market since we only include devices that have Google services." Now, we don't honestly know who's telling the truth here and we'd like to be able to take both companies at their word, but this isn't the first time even during this particular Apple shindig that questionable claims were thrown out as fact.
