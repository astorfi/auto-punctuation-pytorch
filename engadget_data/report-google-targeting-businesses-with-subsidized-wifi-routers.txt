Google is readying a plan to provide heavily subsidized, commercial grade WiFi routers and equipment to businesses, according to The Information. The idea is to give companies like doctor's offices and restaurants easy internet access while letting Google mine the data for targeted ads. Insiders say that would also allow such businesses to set up a website and even learn about customers buying habits. That lines up nicely with other rumors about Mountain View's WiFi plans in Google Fiber cities and public spaces like Starbucks. There's even talk of an app to let you manage your myriad WiFi connections -- so we wouldn't be surprised to see Google's master plan soon.
