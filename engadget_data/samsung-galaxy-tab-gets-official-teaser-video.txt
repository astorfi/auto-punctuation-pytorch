It's short, sweet, and dramatic, yet the official Samsung Galaxy Tab teaser video still manages to reveal a number of features previously only rumored. We've got Android 2.2 running on a 7-inch display, video calling, Swype, HD movie playback, "Flash support," GPS navigation, an e-reader, and plenty more. Now get ready to be teased mercilessly by the video embedded after the break -- it's as close as you'll get before the official reveal in Berlin (at IFA) on September 2nd. Yeah, we'll be there.

Update: here's a few other things we've noticed from the trailer. In addition to the aforementioned details, the floating text also references augmented reality and video calling (perhaps indicating a front-facing camera as well). Speaking of cameras, you'll notice in one shot what appears to be a LED flash bulb next to the camera. Must we really wait another 9 or so days?
