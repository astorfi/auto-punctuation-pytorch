When's it gonna happen?Well, BusinessWeek apparently has it on authority that Microsoft's sick of all the supposed "iPod killers"that are failing in their assassination attempts, and that they're matters into their own hands. So how would theirdevice theoretically differentiate itself from the rest of the pack? Says PeterMoore, "It can't just be our version of the iPod," and BizWeek states that "in addition to playingmusic and videos, a Microsoft device would include games." We'll cede the possibility that Microsoft may beworking on a Gizmondo-like portable gaming and media device -- vague though it may be -- but honestly, what would astory like this be without the grandiloquent Sim Wong Hoo, CEO of Creative, making his standard-issue self-aggrandizingstatement? Says Hoo, were Microsoft to build their own hardware in addition to their own portable software platform,their hardware partners would branch off and "what [they were] trying to build will collapse." Uh, yeah.[Via Joystiq]
