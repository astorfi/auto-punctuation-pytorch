Thirty-two tasty batches of Eclair are already in the oven, and you can easily check to see if you're a likely candidate for upgrade by scanning the back of your phone. If your eight-digit "SI-number" (e.g. 1242-4859) matches any of those on the list at our source link, your 720p video recording mode, enhanced social networking integration and five homescreens are on the way. Just don't necessarily expect to see them anytime soon on AT&T.
