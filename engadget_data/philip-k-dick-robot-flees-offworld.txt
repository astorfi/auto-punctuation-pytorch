 Replicants, they call them. Created for offworldwork. When one of them goes missing, they call me in. But this one's different. Created in the likeness of Philip K. Dick by Hanson Robotics.Vanished suddenly. Missing for weeks. No one knows what happened. But the story is that some museum called theSmithsonian wanted to put him in a box and display him around the country. Not something a replicant would want. Isuspect this one has already found some like-minded supporters who will attempt to keep it offworld indefinitely. Toobad he won't live. But then again, who does?
