At a German event this week, a slimmer version of the tablet was snapped sporting a built in S-Pen slot that had also been sweating off some extra pounds. So much so, that the company will retail a dedicated pen holder to make your electronic doodling more comfortable.

 We've also heard unconfirmed rumors that the biggest change to the tablet was internal -- with the Galaxy S III's quad-core Exynos chip replacing the original dual-core innards we'd seen previously. We reached out to the company on that point to see if it could shed any light, but its people weren't able to make any comment ahead of its official debut.
