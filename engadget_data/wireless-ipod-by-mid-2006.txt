Sometimes the stars align such that we just can't help ourselves from speculating. As Mobile Content News points
out, PortalPlayer, the company that makes the chipset used in the iPod with an estimated 90% of
their 3rd quarter 2005 revenue coming from the iPod alone, is making big moves into wireless. Just last month they
named Vodafone and Ericsson veteran Tomas Isaksson to their Board of Directors and then last week they announced their
licensing of Sun's Java ME platform which moves Mobile Java content beyond
devices such as cellphones and into next generation portable media players "expected to be released in
the first half of 2006." Now we have an analyst over at Citigroup reminding us that PortalPlayer "wants to acquire a
small private company with a wireless technology portfolio" and are "dedicating 2006 to building out wireless
capabilities." So what does this all mean? Well, "wireless" and "iPod" could yield a
Bluetooth 2.0 iPod finally
axing the cable from
the headphones, or a WiFi iPod which functions as a remote control and streaming data source to that new
Mac mini with Front Row, or even the highly desired
iPhone which seems almost a certainty in
Apple's expanding device portfolio. But hey, we've still got all the
Macworld Intel rumors to sort out to get
too carried away by anything up to 6 months awayâ€¦that's an eternity 'round
here.
