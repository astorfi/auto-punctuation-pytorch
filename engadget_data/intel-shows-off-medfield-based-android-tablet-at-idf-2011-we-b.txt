But unlike the prototype Andy Rubin whisked with him off stage, we were able to at least get up close and personal with its Intel inside sibling. Unfortunately we weren't able to actually touch it, but here's to hoping we can track one down and do a proper hands-on at some point today.

Update: Our eagle-eyed friends at CarryPad have spotted an NFC marking on the tablet's back.
