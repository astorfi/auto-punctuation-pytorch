 With more and more devices being released sporting HDMI outputs (although certainly not all of them), and so many TVs holding steady at just one HDMI input, you're gonna have to shell out some loot for a switcher sooner or later. Most models on the market are dedicated little boxes that cost several hundred dollars, but cable manufacturer ACCELL has just announced a new solution for switching on the cheap, called the UltraAV HDMI 2-1 Audio/Video Switch, that tucks in unobtrusively among your nest of cables. This small wafer of a device simply features two inputs and an output, along with a handy IR repeater on a five-foot cord for toggling between sources from the included wireless remote. TMCnet is reporting that these will begin shipping next month, and for under a hundred bucks (well, only a penny under, but still).[Via TMCnet]
