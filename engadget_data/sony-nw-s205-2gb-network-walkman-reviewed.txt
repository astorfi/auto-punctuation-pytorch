 After we let the cat out of the bag, it didn't take long for CNET to get their hands on Sony's latest excuse to exercise. The NW-S205, appearing only in black and housing 2GB of capacity, is their newest Network Walkman and is apparently poised to combat the Nike+iPod craze. It seems to have done quite well at accomplishing that goal, as the myriad of features and bundled accessories (Sony, is that you?) readily revealed its "athletic intentions." Although the reviewers weren't too fond of being forced to transfer files via SonicStage, there was plenty of love for the cigar-shaped DAP. The player seemed well-built for its intentions: having a water (and sweat) resistant enclosure, throwing in a comfortable armband, and including the G-Sensor (Sony's name for a pedometer) made this a viable alternative to Apple's offering. CNET was most impressed with the built-in FM tuner -- something sorely missing on the nano -- and the intelligent playlist changer that hopped lists when you broke into a run or slowed to a walk. Thanks to a $150 asking price and superb "out-of-the-box" functionality, the NW-S205 was highly regarded, and will be tempting legs everywhere to make good use of themselves in August.
