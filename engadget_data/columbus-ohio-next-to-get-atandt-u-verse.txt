 
Just a week after folks in St. Louis got the rights to brag about being the latest crew to get access to U-verse, AT&T has announced that it will be bringing the fiber-based service to Columbus, Ohio. More specifically, 51 communities in the area will soon be eligible for service, and installations are slated to start on December 24th. 'Course, consumers who sign up before January 31, 2008 will receive their choice of free HD service for a year, a $100 cash-back redemption or one month of free TV service when they order U200, U300 or U400 by phone. If you're curious to see if your neck of the woods is covered, take a peek beyond the break, and if you've been left high and dry this go 'round, rest assured that AT&T is promising to expand U-verse in and around the area in due time
