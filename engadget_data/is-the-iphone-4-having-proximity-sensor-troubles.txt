Well -- it looks like it's possible there's another issue too -- this time with the proximity sensor. Now, we're no strangers to spontaneously turning on speakerphone with our faces (though admittedly our cheeks are pretty round), so it's hard to say if this is an iPhone 4-specific issue, but the mounting reports would suggest that it's possible the new handsets sensor is a little bit... over sensitive. Reported issues include accidentally disconnecting calls, throwing the speakerphone switch, and putting people on hold accidentally. What about you? Are you having problems with your iPhone 4's proximity sensor? Let us know in the comments.
