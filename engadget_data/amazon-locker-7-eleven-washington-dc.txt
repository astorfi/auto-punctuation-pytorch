Folks who swear their delivery person never rings the bell before dropping off packages will be pleased to know that Amazon Lockers have popped up at multiple 7-Elevens around the region. As Zatz Not Funny notes, Amazon has yet to officially list the market under the service, but at least four locations are searchable -- and the site did find one more that's currently off the radar. If you're eager to get a glimpse of the P.O. Box-esque units for yourself or get access on your account, you'll find more info at the source links below.
