Even though the WhatsApp iPhone application received an update yesterday, the popular messaging service made it official in a blog post today, detailing notes from the latest release. What's especially interesting here, however, is that WhatsApp is bringing a familiar cost scheme over to Apple's platform. Essentially, iOS users can download the app free of charge, but they will now have to pay a 99-cent yearly fee after the first twelve months of using it -- a business model similar to the one WhatsApp already implements on Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone. Hey, it's still but a small price to pay to somewhat fashionably keep tabs on all your amigos 24/7, eh?
