During EA's press event at Gamescom 2013 in Cologne, the outfit revealed that FIFA 14 seasons that start on current-gen systems will easily be transported over to next-gen consoles when they arrive this fall. Saved seasons, FIFA Ultimate Teams, Virtual Pro and EA Sports Football Club info can all be carried to the shiny new Xbox One and PS4 as soon as that pre-order arrives or you'll able to nab one off the shelves. You'll be able to step foot on the pitch soon as the title launches around the globe next month.
