First spotted on a r/Android poster's GSM Galaxy Nexus and later on Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 tablets (as shown above), there are no changes listed other than "performance and stability," however there's hope that this includes promised fixes for Bluetooth A2DP issues. We haven't seen any new software on our devices and there's no official word yet, let us know in the comments if you're seeing anything new on your mobile device.
