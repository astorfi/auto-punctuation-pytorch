 Up first is the IdeaCentre A730, a 27-inch multi-touch all-in-one that measures just 0.9 inch (24.5mm) thick. Still, the system has room for an optical drive, which is integrated into the base. You have your choice of a 2,560 x 1,440 or 1,920 x 1,080 frameless display, and like many Windows 8 devices we've been seeing lately, the screen is adjustable -- from -5 degrees to 90 degrees. The desktop comes with up to a Core i7 processor, storage maxes out at 1TB and graphics options include an NVIDIA GeForce GT 745M chip with 2GB of dedicated memory. The A730 will go on sale for $1,499 and up in June.

 Lenovo is also adding to its C series desktop lineup with the new 23-inch C540. It's more budget-friendly than the A730, with the non-touch model starting at $549 and processor options topping out at a Core i3 chip, and it will be available both with and without a touchscreen. (The resolution is 1,920 x 1,080 for both versions.) The highest-end graphics option will be a NVIDIA GeForce 615 chip with 2GB of RAM, and you can outfit the system with up to 2TB of storage space. The non-touch IdeaCentre C540 will be available in February, and touch models will hit the market in June. Hit up the press galleries below for a look at both systems.
