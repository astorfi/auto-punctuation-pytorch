The next iPhone will be (presumably) unveiled on September 10th, as hinted at on the Apple-delivered invite that you see above. When the curtains pull back, it'll be nearly a year to the day since the iPhone 5 was ushered into reality, and it'll no doubt be a monumentally important day for the company. Particularly compared to the barrage of products Apple introduced in 2012 -- iPad mini, iPhone 5, the MacBook Pro with Retina display, enhanced MacBook Air / iMac / Mac mini lines, a redesigned iPod nano, a revised iPad / iPod touch / Apple TV, ad OS X Mountain Lion -- 2013 has been eerily quiet. Outside of a tweaked iPhone 5 for T-Mobile's network, a Haswell-infused MacBook Air and a tease of the next-generation Mac Pro, we've been left with little more than hopes for newly-inspired versions of iOS and OS X.


That changes on the 10th of September, as at the very least, we're expecting a next-gen iPhone to hit the stage. We'll also be holding out hope for an oh-so-colorful lower-end iPhone 5C for emerging markets -- markets where Android and even Windows Phone are the platforms of choice for communities making the move into the smartphone era. We wouldn't put it past Apple to also revise its iPad line while it's at it, and naturally, iOS 7 should be just about primed for release to the masses. As you'd expect, we'll be on hand in Cupertino in order to liveblog every second of the action, and we'd invite you to cast your best guesses on what's to come in comments below.
