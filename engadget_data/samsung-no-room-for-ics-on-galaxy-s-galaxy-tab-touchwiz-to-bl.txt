Now we know why: an official blog post explains that, thanks to TouchWiz, Samsung Widgets and Video Calls, there isn't enough space left on the devices' ROM to hold the fourth generation of Google's OS. Depending on your interpretation, there also seems to be an issue with unsatisfactory performance, which makes us raise an eyebrow in Sammy's general direction. We're sure that we won't have to wait too long before some users take matters into their own hands and boot TouchWiz from the face of their phones in a quest for some delicious ice-creamy goodness.
