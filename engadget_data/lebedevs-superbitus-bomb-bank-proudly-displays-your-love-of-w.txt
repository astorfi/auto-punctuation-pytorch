Well the latest creation from Art Lebedev Studios -- a single-use, bomb-shaped piggy bank -- is definitely not one of those products. Lebedev, best known for the eternally-delayed Optimus keyboard, the petite Mini Three, and the uncomfortable-looking Mus2 "pointer" mouse, must have decided that what the world really needs now is a way to store its change in a ceramic container modeled after World War II era munitions. The idea here is that you use the included marker to write your savings goal on the outside of the so-called "Superbitus" (or a pinup girl, if you want to keep the meme going); then, after you've accumulated the requisite loot (we assume that you need to tabulate that separately), you're supposed to destroy the bank not with a hammer, but by "dropping the bomb." Yeah, we know, this is probably not the best way to store or spend your hard-earned money, but if you're the type who likes to show off "artsy" trinkets to your friends, this product might be right up your bomb bay alley.[Via Chip Chick]
