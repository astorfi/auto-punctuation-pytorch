 With the Atom-based mini laptop orgy that has become synonymous with 2008, it's no surprise that Intel has had problems meeting demand for the new processor. That should end soon, however, says Sean Maloney, executive VP and GM of Intel's Sales and Marketing Group. Maloney points out that Intel now has four 300-millimeter manufacturing plants that he says will be doling out the silicon wafers en-masse by September. "We've got four 300-millimeter fabs, so we can really hose this stuff out," he told PC World. With the expected popularity of the ASUS Eee PC 901, this news is coming just in time.
