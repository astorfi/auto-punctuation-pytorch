TiVo promised that the placeshifting TV capabilities recently added to its Roamio Plus and Pro DVRs would expand to its older hardware, and now they have. Updated TiVo owners with a Stream transcoder plugged into their Premiere or standard Roamio DVR can start streaming and downloading live or recorded TV from anywhere, so long as it's over WiFi. This functionality is rolling out starting today, and all users should have it within the next couple of weeks. If this pace keeps up, it shouldn't be too much longer before the devices and services that can't stream live TV anytime, anywhere, will be outnumbered by those that can.
