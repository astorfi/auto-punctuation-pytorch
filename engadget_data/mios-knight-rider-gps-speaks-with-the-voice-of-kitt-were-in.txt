As of right now there's only one GPS unit worth buying, and it's this trick Knight Rider unit from Mio that issues directions in the voice of KITT. Yep, Mr. Feeney William Daniels is gonna be right there with you, although we doubt he'll be as tolerant of your skin-tight pants and unkempt chest hair this time around. Underneath the hood it's basically the same Mio kit as you'd expect, only it boots up by saying "Hello Michael, where do you want to go today?" uses a cartoon Trans-Am to represent your car, and features dual LED scanner lights on each side. Yes, we're in love. $270 is all it'll take when this thing hits in a few months -- 10 points to the first reader to get a picture of it inside a KITT replica.[Via Autoblog]
