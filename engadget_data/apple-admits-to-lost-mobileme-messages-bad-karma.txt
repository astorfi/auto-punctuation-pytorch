 Apple's Push-like MobileMe launch has been such a debacle that they're now in damage control mode. As a result, some poor soul has been tasked by Steve Jobs to post status updates "every other day or so." The first update is already revealing:

Last Friday, 1% of MobileMe subscribers were affected by a "serious problem" with one of Apple's mail server. 
Limited web access has been restored to those accounts but full access won't be sorted until next week.
Of these 1%, Apple admits to losing "approximately 10%" of the messages received between July 16 and July 18.

For the rest of you MobileMe subscribers, Apple has added server capacity, tuned the software to scale better, and fixed over 70 bugs to date. So the question is, how's MobileMe working for you?%Poll-17308%
