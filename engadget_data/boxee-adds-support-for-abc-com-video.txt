With the latest announcement from boxee, we are really starting to wonder what's left? Sure we know there is plenty of internet content out there that isn't accessible on boxee, but not much. At the very least with that addition of ABC.com, you can now stream video from every major online video source worth mentioning. The bad news is that at this point only boxee Mac users can enjoy the season premiere of Lost via boxee, but the team is working furiously to add it to the Apple TV build just as soon as possible -- hopefully in the "next few days."
