The component-producing division of Paradigm Electronics (best known for loudspeakers) has introduced its ARC-1 Room Correction System. The listening room is often the single weakest link in your audio system, and used in conjunction with an Anthem Statement processor, the ARC-1 will help tame room effects automagically. Sounds like a feature built into just about every AVR these days, but as you'd guess from Anthem's high-end pedigree, here it's implemented with separates and priced accordingly. A cool $399 (estimated) will get you the ARC-1and a calibrated mic to go along with it.
