You can now hail an Uber car in Germany with a clear conscience... at least, for a while. Frankfurt's Regional Court has lifted a temporary ban on Uber in the country, rejecting the taxi industry's claim that urgent action was needed to stop the ridesharing outfit in its tracks. Uber isn't suddenly in the clear, mind you. It's still facing legal action for operating without a commercial license, and the taxi business is appealing the decision in hopes of getting its competition off the road. In the meantime, though, you won't have to take an old-school cab the next time you're visiting Berlin.
