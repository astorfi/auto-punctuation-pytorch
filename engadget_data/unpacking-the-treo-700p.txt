Engadget Mobile reader and self-proclaimed Gadget Guru Andy Pargh hooked us up with some shots he snapped of him tearing open his box to reveal the sweet, sweet treasure within -- the 700p. Looks like Sprint didn't get the last laugh after all -- unless some of you already have a Sprint 700p and have been holding out on us. Don't hold out on us, people!
      

 

Yum.
