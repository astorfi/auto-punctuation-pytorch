In case you weren't already aware, this will allow customers to access game highlights and historical NCAA March Madness vignettes via video-on-demand, but unfortunately, only users in North Texas will see said programming in high-definition. Now, more than ever, the rest of the TWC nation could really use HD VOD, eh? [Disclosure: Engadget is part of the Time Warner family]
