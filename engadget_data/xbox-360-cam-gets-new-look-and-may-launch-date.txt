The source is supposedly an unreleased Chinese issueof the Official Xbox Magazine, and this new look matches the most recent version of the camera we've seen first hand.But there's no telling if this will be the version that actually makes it to stores, or if that fabled day will be inMay, but things are looking good for among us inclined to video chatting and awkward gesture-based games.[Via Joystiq]
