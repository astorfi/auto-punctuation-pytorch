 Who said there wasn't a killer HD DVD? Harry Potter might not be your all-time favorite flick but it sure is to many people. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire doesn't have a release date just yet, but we do know a good amount of what's going to be on the disc. It is going to be presented in 2.35:1 widescreen at 1080p and include both Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Digital-Plus 5.1 tracks. Along with the normal DVD extras the HD DVD release is going to have Warner's "in-Movie Experience" that features an interactive video commentary, plus, additional making-of content, and interviews. So far Warner hasn't announced any plans to bring this title out on Blu-ray ether. We just wish we knew when it was hitting the streets.
