 Right on the heels on Samsung's CES press conference, we got up close and personal with Samsung's just-announced work of art, the 85-inch S9 UHD TV. Its size alone is pretty spectacular, but Sammy clearly wanted to make this one a looker. The company calls the stand a "timeless gallery" frame, and indeed the set would fit right in with some of the more conceptual pieces at the MoMA. Still, that easel-like design could be a bit limiting for some living rooms, so you can remove the S9 and wall-mount it -- though the 2.2 channel audio is built into that frame. Unique design aside, this TV is all about the high-end specs. "Precision Black Pro" display tech is to thank for the high contrast ratio, and colors really do pop -- even without Samsung's grand display of fireworks. Powering all 85 inches of high-def visuals is a quad-core processor, which should also help to up-sample 1080p footage to make better use of that Ultra HD (4K) resolution. No word on pricing or availability yet, but it's said to be available sometime in 2013, so start saving those pennies. In the mean-time, check out our walk-around video after the break.
