 Well, youknow how we do in America: if ya can't beat 'em, sue 'em. Netflix is taking Blockbuster to court in California over the latter's onlinemovie rental service, which, while suspiciously similar to Netflix, is certainly not the second DVD rental serviceavailable to consumers. We're a little perplexed as to why Netflix would only now be taking Blockbuster to court overtheir business methodology (i.e. their forming a company that does subscription-based online DVD rental by mail)seeking payment for damages and not, say, Wal-Mart (oh yeah, because they already took over Wal-Mart), butsomething tells us they're not looking for recompense so much as they're looking for Blockbuster to get the hell offtheir turf.
