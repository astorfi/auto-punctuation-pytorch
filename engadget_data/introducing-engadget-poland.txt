Well, besides the fact that we had some amazing talent waiting in the wings to blow it out, it's also a smaller (dare we say underserved?) market to soft-launch in that allows us to work out the kinks as we prepare to do even more international versions of Engadget in the coming weeks and months.So if Polish isn't your bag, just hang tight, you'll be seeing even more localized Engadgets soon enough. And if it is, head on over and welcome our Polish team to the fold!
