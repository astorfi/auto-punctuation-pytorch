The recent exploits in AACS have been rumored to slow down the release schedule for Blu-ray titles from FOX and Disney and many believe this is because they've been waiting for BD+, -- an additional optional layer of DRM available to Blu-ray. This new code will run in a virtual machine while the disc is in use and can do just about whatever it deems necessary to validate that your player is secure before allowing the movie to be played. What BD+ cannot do is modify your player, so once the disc is ejected, the process is gone.
