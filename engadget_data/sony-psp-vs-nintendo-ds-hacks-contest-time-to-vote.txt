contest, so we waited to start up the voting for our Sony
PSP vs. Nintendo DS hacks contest until this week. You've got 48 hours to get your votes in for one of our four
finalists. You'll want to consider the write-up and the reproducibility factor as well as other esoterics like
usefulness and creativity when you pick your winner. Here's the list so you can review the entries:




PSPTetris



Controlling your home with your PSP



Controlling iTunes with your PSP



How to set up your own PSP web portal



That's all she wrote. Voting closed. Winner TBA.
