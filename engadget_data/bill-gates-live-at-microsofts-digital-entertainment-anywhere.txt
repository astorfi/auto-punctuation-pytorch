Engadget publisher/baby daddy Jason Calacanis hit Microsoft's Digital Entertainment Anywhere event in Los Angeles
this afternoon and recorded this MP3 of Bill Gates' keynote address for us. He introduces all the new stuff, like
Plays For Sure,
Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005,
Windows
Media Extender, and Windows Media Center Extender for Xbox. And yes, that is Bill G. up on stage with Queen
Latifah. We saw Bringing Down the House, so we know what that's all about.
