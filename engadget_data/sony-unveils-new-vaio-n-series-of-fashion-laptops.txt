Sony is aiming their new Vaio N Series line of mid-tier laptops at the fashionista set, and while they aren't incredibly forthcoming on specs, we're sure these laptops will look good doing whatever they've got the juice to do. Starting at $1,000, the N Series models feature 15.4-inch displays, Core Duo processors (in the top-end at least) and a dual-layer DVD burner, along with the usual Sony frills like a Memory Stick reader, i.LINK port and ExpressCard slot. There's also 802.11a/b/g WiFi, and while we're not so sure about graphics options, Sony does claim that select models are Vista Premium ready, so we've got that going for us. The N Series ships next month, and Sony should be taking pre-orders starting today.
