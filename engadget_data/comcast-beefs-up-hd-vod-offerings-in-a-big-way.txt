Announced today, a slew of upcoming films will be available on the firm's "signature video on demand" in both SD and HD -- on the exact same day as the DVD release, no less. Furthermore, it's also following the vision set forth in Project Infinity by offering up a number of television premieres via HD VOD "at least one week before airing on linear television channels." Among the movie titles slated to hit soon are The Brave One, Rendition, No Reservations and Michael Clayton, while The Tudors and Flavor of Love hold things down on the TV series front. Take a look at the full release after the jump.
