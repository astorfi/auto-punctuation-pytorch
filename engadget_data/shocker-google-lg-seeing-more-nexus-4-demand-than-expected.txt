 Who'd have thought that pricing a high-end smartphone like the Nexus 4 at $350 or less would lead to strong sales? Google and LG certainly appear to have been caught off-guard. LG's UK mobile lead Andy Coughlin tells CNET that the pair estimated Nexus 4 shipments in the way you'd expect for any phone, but have been rocked by "huge demand" -- in short, they didn't realize that offering such a giant bargain would lead to sellouts within minutes. While we don't have tangible shipping numbers, that the spending sprees happen over and over again suggests that LG is producing more than a handful of Nexus 4s as it tries to keep up. We suspect that many of you reading this just want to know when sales resume; sadly, Coughlin's not telling.
