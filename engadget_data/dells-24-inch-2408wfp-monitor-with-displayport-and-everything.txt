Dell's 24-inch, Ultrasharp 2408WFP monitor is up and dancing on Dell's US page. $748 buys into a 1,900 x 1,200 resolution, 178-degree viewing angle, 1,300:1 contrast ratio, 400 cd/m2 brightness, 6-ms response, and 102% color gamut. Standard stuff until you get to the vast suite of jacks: HDMI, 2x DVI, DisplayPort, VGA, Composite, S-Video, Component, a single USB upstream, and 2x USB downstream. Just another reason why Round Rock, Tejas is the world's focal point for computer monitors. Who'd have thunk?[Thanks, Brad] Read -- Order page Read -- User guide
