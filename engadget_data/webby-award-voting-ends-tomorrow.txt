Seriously, though, it's an honor just to have our humble production nominated for the third year in a row alongside several other impressive products. Ballots do close tomorrow and, if you're a fan of segments like our epic tour of Asia's gadget markets, then click here (no, seriously, right there) to give us and the dozens of people who put in countless hours of hard work to make them happen a virtual pat on the back. Thanks for reading, watching and being a fan, and we promise to continue working our butts off to keep you informed and entertained.
