That's a hat trick of hotly-anticipated DSLRs* right there, and the GH1 might be the most anticipated of the bunch. Sadly for would-be importers, the Japanese version here can't be set to display English menus, but we can still gawk at the pretty pictures, including an amazing shot of the lens cap entitled "The Engadget Product Photo Effect." Hit the read link for the full set, including some test shots.  *Yes, we know GH1's not technically a DSLR -- what would you call it?  [Thanks, Guillermo]
