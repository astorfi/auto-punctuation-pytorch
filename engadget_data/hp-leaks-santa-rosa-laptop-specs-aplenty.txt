Those getting the upgrade in this batch include the HP Pavilion DV2500, DV6500, and DV9500, along with the HP Compaq Presario V3000 and V6000. None of them are exactly on the ultra portable side of things, with screens ranging form 14 to 17 inches, along with 1.6GHz T5450, 1.8GHz T7100, or 2.0GHz T7300 processors, and integrated Intel GMA X3100 graphics on all but the Pavilion DV9500, which gets a slightly more powerful NVIDIA GeForce 8400M with 256MB of dedicated RAM. As all the information is coming from leaked product manuals, there's no word on pricing or availability, but we'd expect that to be coming from HP before too long.[Via Laptoping]
