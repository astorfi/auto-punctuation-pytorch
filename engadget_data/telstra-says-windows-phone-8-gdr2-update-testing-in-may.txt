We've heard talk of a GDR2 update coming to Windows Phone 8, including more recent claims of restored FM radio support and a double-tap-to-wake feature, but it's been unclear when the mid-cycle refresh would show up. Telstra may have just given us a better clue: the Australian carrier tells customers on its support forums that Nokia should deliver its version of GDR2 for testing sometime in mid-May. That suggests the upgrade is relatively close, although we wouldn't make too many assumptions beyond that -- Telstra is just one of many networks that needs to sign off on GDR2, and it's likely neither the first nor the last. Nonetheless, it's apparent that Microsoft is relatively close to delivering a big tune-up.
