The 20th anniversary reboot of the retro gaming system -- now branded the Neo Geo X Gold -- has a suggested retail price of a cent under $200, and for that you get the handheld and the newly detailed peripherals shown above -- a joystick and a charging dock that doubles as TV out (via HDMI or RCA). The specs have changed somewhat since the initial announcement and the handheld is now showing off a 4.3-inch LCD, a little bigger than the 3.5-inch previously announced, while the list of pre-installed titles looks just as healthy as it originally did -- see the source link for the full list.
