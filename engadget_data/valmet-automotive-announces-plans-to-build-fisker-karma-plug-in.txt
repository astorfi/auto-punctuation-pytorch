As Fisker itself had announced way back when, they're expecting to churn out 15,000 of the cars annually, with the first of 'em sent to land in North America sometime in the fourth quarter of 2009, and Europeans getting theirs shortly thereafter in 2010. Apparently, Valmet was chosen to manufacture the car after an "extensive global search," with its location in Finland in particular working in its favor given that more than half of Fisker's cars are expected to be sold outside of North America.[Thanks, Timo]
