Give 'er a slide in portrait mode and you get a traditional numeric keypad, nudge this pup landscape and you get a, uh, numeric keypad -- hopefully using those rocker style keys found on certain Blackberries for some QWERTY-esque text entry. What we do know is that a landscape slide enables video calling which can be active while sending and receiving text messages, files, or downloading videos-on-demand. This 1.8Mbps capable phone also brings Bluetooth, a flash UI, some unspecified file viewing capabilities and what appears to be a memory slot expansion from the photos. Expected to hit Korea this June on SK Telecom's new HSDPA network. More pics after the break.
