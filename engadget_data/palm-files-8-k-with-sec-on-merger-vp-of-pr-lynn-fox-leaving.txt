 Okay, we've got lots of Palm news tonight, so take our hand and let us walk you through it. For starters, the company filed a 8-K report with the SEC today, which is a requirement when major changes (e.g. a merger with HP) are happening. According to the paperwork, the transaction / acquisition was expected to close by July 1st... but it might actually be anytime within the first week of July. A PreCentral forums member claims to have listened in on a shareholding meeting today and heard that from VP of Investor Relations Teri Klein. Additionally, he also heard that under HP, current Palm CEO Jon Rubinstein will head up a smartphone / mobility unit that's culled from both his company and another HP unit. 

Finally, news has come in this evening in that VP of Public Relations Lynn Fox is joining the likes of Matias Duarte, Rich Dellinger, and Caitlin Spaan in leaving Palm. Though we understand she's staying with Palm through next week, she is definitely not sticking around -- according to her Facebook page, Fox "respectfully declined the opportunity to join HP after its acquisition of Palm" and will be pursuing other opportunities. So, when can we get back to talking about those mysterious new webOS devices? That aren't printers?
