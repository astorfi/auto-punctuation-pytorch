Yeah, maybe it just caught out eye because it's around the size of a small refrigerator, but upon speaking with a company representative, we learned that it's actually a 400-disc Blu-ray Mega Changer. The unit on hand was simply there for demonstrative purposes, but Sony intends to launch the BD-Live-capable, RS-232 port-packin' beast in early 2009. There's no word on whether it will ever interface with HTPCs, but we wouldn't count on it. Tap the gallery for a closer look.
