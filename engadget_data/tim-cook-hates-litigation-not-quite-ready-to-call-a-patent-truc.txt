In response to a question about the potential for settlements in the current pile of lawsuits on the company's plate, the CEO seemed open to the idea. In fact, he used the "h" word to describe is feelings towards the process. "I've always hated litigation. I continue to hate it," he said, before striking a slightly more combative tone to clarify, "I just want people to invent their own stuff." So there you go, stop stealing Apple's inventions and its lawyers won't sue. Seems simple enough. The urge to avoid further legal tussles seems genuine though, saying that, if an acceptable agreement could be struck he'd "highly prefer to settle rather than battle."
