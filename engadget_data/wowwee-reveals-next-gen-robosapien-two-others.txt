Following the runaway success of theoriginal Robosapien, the V2, Robopet, and Roboraptor comes the Robosapien RS2 Media which adds a host of newfeatures as well as more powerful programming capabilities. The RS2 Media takes its design cues from the V2 but tackson an LCD screen for viewing images from Robo's headcam, SD slot for capturing that data and storing scripts, and a USB1.0 port for connecting to an MP3 player ala iZ by Zizzle. Next,Wowwee is giving Roboraptor a friend to play with (or battle) in the form of the super-agile Roboreptile, whoseagressive personality warrants shipping the bot with a head cowl to calm it down (you mean they really didn't have toblow up Isla Nublar?). Finally, we'll soon see Wowwee's first collaboration with Segway, thetwo-wheeled, self-balancing P(ersonality)-Bot. With an LCD face and artificial feelings, P-bot promises to be the mostemotive Robo-whatever to date. We'll have pics, prices, and release dates for you as soon as we break into Wowwee'ssuite at The Bellagio. Keep reading to see the other new members of the Roboposse...[Props toSascha at PC Mag for the pic hook-ups]
