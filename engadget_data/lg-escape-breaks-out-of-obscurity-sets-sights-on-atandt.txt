 
 Not content to wait for official phone announcements? The folks at EVLeaks have got you covered -- outing another handset's vitals on Twitter. The team's latest breach appears to be the LG Escape, an Ice Cream Sandwich powered Android handset sporting a 4.3-inch qHD display, a 1.2GHz dual-core processor, a 5 megapixel rear facing camera, NFC and a 2150 mAh battery. EVLeaks also says the device is primed for AT&T's LTE network, which corroborates nicely with Federal reports. No word on price or availability just yet, but we'll let you know when we hear more details.
