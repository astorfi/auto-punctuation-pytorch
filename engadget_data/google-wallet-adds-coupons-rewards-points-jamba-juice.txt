Indeed it can, now that Big G has beefed up its mobile payment platform with a host of offers from retailers like Jamba Juice, American Eagle, OfficeMax and Foot Locker, among other partners. Yesterday, Google rolled out a new program whereby consumers can redeem coupons and accumulate rewards points at select locations, using only their handsets. The app's Offers tab, meanwhile, has expanded to include so-called "Featured Offers," where users can take advantage of discounts exclusive to the Google Wallet platform. Unfortunately, these features are only available at select locations, so check out the source link below to find the one closest to you.
