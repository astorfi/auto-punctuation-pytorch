Slate billed them as "mean spirited," and it turns out more people identify with the lovable John Hodgman's PC than they seem to with the (not so) subtly smug demeanor donned by Justin Long's Mac. VH1's Best Week Ever more or less sums it up with Christian Finnegan and Nick Kroll's spoof of the ad campaign; as card carrying expensive jeans-wearing Gnarles Barkley-listening nerds, we especially enjoyed the following dialogue:Mac: Basically, I "stole" footage from Psycho, and then "borrowed" music from the Gnarles Barkley song, and put 'em all together. It's mad stupid.PC: Do you know what I think is "stupid?"Mac: What?PC: Expensive worn jeans, ironic t-shirts, and pretentious film school glasses.
