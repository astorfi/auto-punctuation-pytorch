Sporting a NSX-46GT1 model number, it sat up on that chrome lipped stand pictured in the invite for its October 12 debut but didn't have much to show in terms of software that we haven't seen already. HDGuru was also on hand and notes a rear USB-mounted WiFi dongle used for the internet features to go along with the Dish Network receiver below. Still waiting to see a production remote/keyboard or remote control apps on a mobile device before you decide to stroll into an IR-blaster connected future? So are we, but for now check out a few more pictures of the set in this gallery.
