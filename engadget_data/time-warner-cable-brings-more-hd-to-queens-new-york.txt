According to Matt, Woodside (a neighborhood in Queens, NY) residents can now fetch CNN HD, M HD, History Channel HD, A&E HD, Food Network HD, Lifetime Movies HD, HGTV HD, TMC HD, Versus HD and... NFL HD. No need to wipe your eyes -- as you can see above, NFL HD is indeed situated on channel 795, though we're hesitant to believe that this is the first indication of TWC and NFL Network working out their issues. For customers in the area, why not fire up your STB and flip through the new additions, and while you're at it, drop us a line in comments with what exactly shows up on 795.Update: Apparently, the Staten Island TWC lineup is the same as Woodside's, and in that locale, channel 795 is NHL HD rather than NFL HD. An unfortunate typo, indeed. Thanks, UnnDunn![Thanks, Matt]
