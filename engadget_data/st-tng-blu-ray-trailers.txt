The increase in quality is obvious to see, with the recomposed special effects and 7.1 DTS HD even offsetting the pain of re-watching episodes like Shades of Gray and Haven. The second set also includes a reunion talk, interesting just to see how much the stars of the show have changed in the intervening two-and-a-half-decades. You can watch both after the break, but if you decide to hold off until season three, we won't tell anyone.
