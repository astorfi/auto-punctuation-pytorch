 Try to buy a Galaxy Nexus from the Google Play store today and you're greeted with the "coming soon" message you see above, and we now officially know the reason why. The company has confirmed to ABC News that the smartphone has indeed been pulled as a result of Judge Lucy Koh's recent decision to not lift the injunction against the device. It's also confirmed, though, that it plans to resume sales of the device sometime next week, when it will be shipping with the new Jelly Bean operating system -- a change that Google says will address the issues in dispute.
