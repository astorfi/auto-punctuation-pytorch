The latest Lara Croft game, Rise of the Tomb Raider, launches on Steam, the Windows store and other retailers on January 28th, Square Enix announced today. Rise of the Tomb Raider popped up on Steam last month with a vague promise to hit PC sometime in January. It wasn't the most complicated clue to figure out, but at least it turned out to be accurate.



The standard version of the game on PC costs $60, while the Digital Deluxe version, including a Season Pass to "nearly all" current and future DLC, is $90. A Collector's Edition, including the Season Pass and a 12-inch Lara statue among other goodies, costs $150 in the Square Enix e-store.

Rise of the Tomb Raider launched as an Xbox-exclusive in November, meaning it came to Xbox One and Xbox 360 only. Publisher Square Enix and developer Crystal Dynamics announced the exclusivity deal at Gamescom in August 2014, to the surprise and disappointment of some PC and PlayStation fans. The studios later clarified the definition of "exclusive," noting that Rise of the Tomb Raider would come to PC in early 2016. The game will land on PlayStation 4 in holiday 2016, after one year on Xbox platforms.
