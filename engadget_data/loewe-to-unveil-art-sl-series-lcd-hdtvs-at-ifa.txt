There's not a whole lot being divulged prior to the expo's opening day, but we are told that a 42- and 47-inch ART SL LCD HDTV will be shown off to the public. Each set will reportedly boast a Full HD panel, 100Hz technology, built-in 250GB hard drive (optional) and an integrated DVB-T / DVB-C or DVB-S2 TV tuner. Each unit will be made available in glossy black or silver chrome, though we'll have to wait until August to get pricing / release information.
