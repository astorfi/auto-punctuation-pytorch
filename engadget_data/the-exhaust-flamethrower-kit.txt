We have to admit, we're pretty skeptical of pretty much anything that shoots flames for under $50 unless it's a
butane lighter, but who are we to argue with a budget exhaust flamethrower kit for fifty bucks? Granted, it may be
dangerous not only for the driver, but, say, for the many pedestrians who cross past the back of a car during rush hour
in New York, but this is the closest you're ever going to get to having a Batmobile so we're not going to spoil your
fun, alright?
