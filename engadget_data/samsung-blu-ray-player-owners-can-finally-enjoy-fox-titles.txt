As promised, Samsung made the CDR image available for download, so we decided to try it out; sure enough, it works, so we can finally enjoy the latest Fox titles. As crummy as this situation is for consumers -- especially those who don't know what firmware is -- we're happy to see Samsung continue to support their first generation Blu-ray player.
