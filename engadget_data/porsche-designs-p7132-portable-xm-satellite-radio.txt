No pics or other juiciness (just a teaser silhouette), but Porsche Design has a page up their new P'7132 "palm-size"
portable AM/FM, shortwave, and XM satellite radio. It's listed as coming soon, but like that rumored new
Pioneer wearable XM radio, we're betting on a
big announcement at the CES next month.
