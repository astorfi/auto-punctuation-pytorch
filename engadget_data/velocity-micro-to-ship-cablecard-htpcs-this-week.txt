 Well, well, Mr. Velocity Micro Director of Product Development Chris Morley -- didn't think we read AVS Forum, did you? Well, maybe you did, we dunno, but we appreciate your letting us know that "Grand Theater systems look to be 100% and we're shipping [this] week. Pro Cinemas are a few days behind due to issues with Asus." Shipping full-on CableCARD-equipped HTPCs that soon huh? Good, because we can't fricking wait to start rocking some CableCARD HTPC action -- DRM and expensive tuners and delays and all. Let's get it on.[Thanks, Keith]
