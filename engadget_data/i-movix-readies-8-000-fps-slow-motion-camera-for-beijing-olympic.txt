You've seen their work before in Planet Earth, Future Weapons and PGA Tour coverage on CBS. This promises to be the best Olympics so far in terms of HDTV coverage and its good to know even the replay cameras are up to the task, when we want to see every detail of the first runner to break the tape. Usually photo finishes are determined using high speed cameras with still shots, but we don't know, the Olympic judges may want to join NFL refs with an HD booth all their own.[Via HDTV Professor]
