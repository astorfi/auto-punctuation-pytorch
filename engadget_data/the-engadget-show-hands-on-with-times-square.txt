 In addition to our full length Engadget Show, we'll be doing short segments on a wide variety of topics which we're hoping will delight, inform, or at least entertain for a few, precious moments.



Ever wondered who makes the outrageous displays in Times Square? Now you'll know. Josh talks to Meric Adriansen from D3 LED, the man who designs and builds those massive structures, and goes behind the scenes to see the rigs from the other side. Want to get deep inside of the art and science behind the light pollution that is -- literally -- New York's most visible spot? Watch the video... and subscribe to the RSS / iTunes feed below (we're still waiting on Zune Marketplace approval).

Also, if you missed the premiere of the show with Palm CEO Jon Rubinstein, you can see it here.
