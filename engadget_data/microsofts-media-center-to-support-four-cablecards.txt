If you'll recall, Media Center previously supported just a pair of CableCARDs, but word on the street has Niveus Media and Exceptional Innovation as the first two HTPC vendors to offer up systems that take full advantage of the new functionality. Reportedly, Exceptional Innovation's Model 754 LifeMedia Server will have four CableCARD slots built-in right into its chassis, while Niveus is opting for four external tuners, and while hard pricing details don't look to be available just yet, go on and tell yourself that it won't be cheap.
