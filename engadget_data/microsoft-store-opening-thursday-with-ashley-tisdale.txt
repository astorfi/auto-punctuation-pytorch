The Scottsdale Arizona Microsoft Store is indeed opening on October 22nd as we heard, the first of many we expect to grace local strip malls across the country. "Be entertained," "Be excited," and "Be early" (doors open at 10AM), exclaim the ads in the Arizona Republic newspaper, to collect gift bags and concert tickets being given away to the first 1,000 visitors. And wow, Ashley Tisdale... we guess Tony Danza was busy that day.
