Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal ran a story quoting Samsung's Lee Young-hee as stating that initial sales of the Galaxy Tablet were "quite small." Turns out that wasn't exactly the right adjective. As you can hear in the audio clip below, she actually said sales of the thing are "quite smooth," just like the chins on most of our interns. This mix-up is being blamed on a transcript provided by Samsung, but rather than point fingers we'll just smile ruefully, shake our heads, and go back to writing posts about robots and things. And the Galaxy Tab? Well, sales may be moving right along, but it looks like returns are progressing quite smoothly as well.
