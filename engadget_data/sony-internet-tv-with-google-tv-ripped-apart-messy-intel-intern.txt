Imagine our shock and horror, then, to discover what an untidy tangle of wires its cables turned out to be, particularly in comparison to the mega-clean insides of the Revue or the ultra-compact Boxee Box. What gives, Sony? Just because it's a TV doesn't mean it doesn't matter. Don't feed yourself that nobody-loves-me-guess-I'll-eat-worms trash. You have to have a little self respect. If you don't give a damn, who will? Okay, we're done.
