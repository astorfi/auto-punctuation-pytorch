DPNow has a first look at Canon's recently announced professional-series 16.7 megapixel Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II (the
name is a wee bit long, but what can you do?), which is an upgrade of the EOS-1Ds, just with double the resolution,
802.11b/g support via an add-on, and new image processing software. If you just have to own the latest, highest
resolution digital camera, and have ten large to drop on a digital camera, this would be it. Then again, DPNow does
point out that Nikon's 12 megapixel D2X is cheaper,
faster, and lighter, so comparisons are bound to happen when both cameras are officially released. Gotta love the
rivalry.
