So it was that FireWire audio interface for
GarageBand, codenamed "Asteriod" or "Q97", that Apple got
all litigious about late last week. They still haven't identified the mystery person or persons who leaked details
about this thing, but they have filed subpeonas against AppleInsider, PowerPage, and ThinkSecret in order to force them
to cough up what they know about who it might be. Apple isn't actually suing any of these sites, but they are
definitely turning up the heat in their hunt for the leakster, which from the sound of it, is someone within the
company who didn't take their non-disclosure agreement seriously enough.
