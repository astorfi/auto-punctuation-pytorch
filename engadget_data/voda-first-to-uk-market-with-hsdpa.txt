 Brits feeling left behind in the HSDPA game are about to get their day in the spotlight. Vodafone is prepping its UMTS follow-on for a Thursday launch, offering their Mobile Connect HSDPA data card for laptop users seeking a little extra WWAN oomph. Availability is initially limited to London, Glasgow, Sheffield, Greater Manchester and Tyneside with a nationwide rollout scheduled for summer 2007, but if neither the limited coverage nor the £45 monthly price tag for unlimited data scare you, get ready to whip out £49 for your card come tomorrow.[Via The Register]
