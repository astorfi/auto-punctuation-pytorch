 The third fiscal quarter of this year saw the best of times and the worst of times for Dish Network. On the positive side of the ledger, the company saw net revenues grow by 12.3 percent since Q3 2010, reaching $3.6 billion. Profits, meanwhile, jumped by 30.3 percent over the year to $319 million, compared with the $245 million it raked in during the third quarter of 2010. Dish said the jump in revenues could be partially attributed to its acquisition of Blockbuster and the subsequent launch of Blockbuster Movie Pass, which the company hopes to expand and build upon going forward. The report wasn't entirely rosy, however, as Dish Network saw a net loss of about 111,000 subscribers during the quarter (about 20,000 more than analysts had predicted), bringing its total to approximately 14 million customers. By contrast, during the third quarter of last year, the company added about 327,000 users. But this decline didn't stop Dish from doling out a rare $2.00 per share dividend to investors, which may make its less savory results a bit easier on the stomach. Check out the full report, after the break.
