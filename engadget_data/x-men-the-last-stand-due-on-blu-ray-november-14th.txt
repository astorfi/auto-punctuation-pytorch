 There has been considerable speculation over when Twentieth Century Fox would put out one of its biggest recent titles on the Blu-ray format and it has finally answered that question. X-Men: The Last Stand is set for release November 14th, specifically timed to be on store shelves for the release of the PlayStation 3 November 17th. Carrying an MSRP of $39.98, the film is authored in standard HDMV using MPEG-4 AVC compression and includes such extras as a 6.1 DTS ES HD Lossless Master Audio soundtrack, two commentary tracks, twelve deleted scenes and a Marvel Trivia Track enabling pop=up bits of information and comic panels referencing different information about the characters during the movie. Did we mention that all of the extras are high definition? With X-Men debuting at the same time as Fox's previously announced first round of Blu-ray releases Fox has been very clear that its Blu-ray strategy is centered entirely around Sony's console, with or without $100 HDMI cables gamers can look forward to some excellent releases that week.
