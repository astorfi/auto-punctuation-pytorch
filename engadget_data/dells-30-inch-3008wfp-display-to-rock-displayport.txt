The update to the much-loved 3007WFP will apparently feature the same 2560 x 1600 resolution, but input options are vastly improved: in addition to that DisplayPort, you're getting HDMI, VGA, component video, two DVI, S-Video, and composite. No word on any other improvements, but with that many inputs, we're pretty certain you can find something to plug into this thing and be happy. Now if only Dell would hurry up and ship that sweet-looking 30-inch DisplayPort concept we saw a while back, we'd be all set.
