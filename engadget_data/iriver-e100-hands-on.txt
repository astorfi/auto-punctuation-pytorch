You've already seen the review, so we won't bore you with a full rehash, but suffice it to say that this thing is well built but feels suspiciously lightweight -- not to mention inexplicably thick. The software is all nice and responsive, though it takes a bit of getting used to the d-click interface, and while you're certainly not going to get much mileage out of the built-in speaker, it is a nice touch. The screen is great straight on, but suffers from some viewing angle woes. We really can't fault the player for much, but there's nothing too compelling here to make us leave any members of our current assortment of DAPs. Video is after the break.
