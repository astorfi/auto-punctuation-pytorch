The streaming was speedy and extremely clear during our demo, and the overall speed of the interface seemed really solid. We also learned that the box is indeed 720p (just as we'd reported earlier). Apple told us that they felt that using 720p allowed them to strike a balance between quality and bandwidth. We're guessing most people won't complain if the service works as advertised. Take a look at a few of the pics below, and we're going to go back for a deeper look!
