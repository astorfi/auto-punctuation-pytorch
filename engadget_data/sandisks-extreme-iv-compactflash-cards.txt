Their new SanDisk Extreme IV CF cards come in sizes up to 8GB, and offer speeds of at least 40MBps, not to mention the extreme environmental conditions they can suffer through (-13°F to 185°F). The cards are surprisingly affordable, however, weighing in at $160 for the 2GB, $320 for the 4GB, and $640 for the 8GB. Perhaps it's overkill for your puny mid-range DSLR, but from the looks of it you'd probably hang on to this memory card a lot longer than your average digital camera.
