Up to bat first is the 12.1-inch tx2000 convertible tablet (pictured), which presumably takes over for the tx1000 and comes bundled with the outfit's QuickPlay software, a webcam and an integrated microphone (beyond that, it's wait-and-see). As for the oh-so-intimidating Pavilion HDX, it will soon be available with a 512MB NVIDIA GeForce 8800M GTS graphics set, an optional Core 2 Extreme processor, Blu-ray / HD DVD support and a 20.1-inch WUXGA (1,920 x 1,200) XHD Ultra Brightview display. Additionally, the workhorse will boast four Altec Lansing speakers and a built-in "subwoofer," an eSATA port, hybrid analog / digital TV tuner, room for two HDDs and a media remote to boot. As for pricing and availability, expect the tx2000 to start shipping as CES commences for $1,299 and up, while the newly pimped HDX will ship later this month and start at $1,999.Update: Check out an incredibly boring demo video of the tx2000 after the break.
