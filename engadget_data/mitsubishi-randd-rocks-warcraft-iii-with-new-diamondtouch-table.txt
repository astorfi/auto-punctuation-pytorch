IGN has video of the DiamondTouch panel in action, and it really appears to be a glorified top-downprojection system -- which it is. The image is projected onto a white table, which contains the actual magic. Bytouching the table you complete a circuit that sends a signal through your body with the X/Y position of your touch.This means the table can handle multiple simultaneous touches, so you and your friends can all gather around and dogaming as it was meant to be done, tabletop style. Mitsubishi's system also includes voice control, and they show itall off with a fairly impressive demo of WarCraft III.[Thanks, Gerry]
