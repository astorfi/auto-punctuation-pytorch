Last year, Google ponied up $22.5 million to the FTC as a penalty for bypassing cookie settings in the Safari browser to track users. While Mountain View no doubt wishes this episode were far behind it already, the company will pay a pretty sum once again as the result of a settlement today: $17 million in a suit brought by 37 states and the District of Columbia over that very same practice of tracking users in Safari.


From 2011 to 2012, Google used a loophole in Apple's browser that allowed for placing tracking cookies on users' machines without them knowing. The search giant's suffered more than a slap on the wrist, but it's still not admitting wrongdoing; in a statement, a spokeswoman said that the company "has taken steps to remove the ad cookies, which collected no personal information, from Apple's browsers."
