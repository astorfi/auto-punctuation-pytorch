Usesenvisioned for the displays include OLED overlays on top of LCDs that could be used to display specific informationwithout interfering with the main picture and automobile windshields with built-in displays that can displayinformation as needed and turn off when not in use. Of course, what we really want is a transparent window that turnsinto an HD display when we flick a switch, but that may just be a little too much to ask for at this point.
