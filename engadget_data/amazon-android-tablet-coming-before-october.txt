According to those oh so familiar "people familiar with the matter," the Android-based slate would rock a nine-inch screen and, surprisingly, lack a camera, making it ill-suited as an iPad competitor -- the tablet would apparently be focused on offering media purchased from the online retailer. What's more, those sources are also spreading word of two new Kindles coming in Q3 -- one with a touchscreen, the other a budget version of the current e-reader. Of course, it's all just rumor for now, but that's a whole lot of rumor.
