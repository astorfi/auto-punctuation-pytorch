This one is apparently a 10.2-inch model, and will pack the usual Atom N270 processor, along with a standard hard drive of unspecified size (no word on an SSD option), a 6-cell battery, and Windows XP for an OS, among other standard features. No official word on a price just yet, but Samsung tells What Laptop that it'll be in keeping with other similar offerings on the market, and that it'll be available in your choice of white, black or blue.Update: Looks like those remaining specs aren't much of a mystery any more. According to Pocketables, you can expect to get 1GB of RAM as standard, along with your choice of 80, 120, or 160GB hard drives, a 1.3 megapixel webcam, and a 3-in-1 card reader, all in a 2.9-pound package. Still no official word on a price just yet, but it looks like it'll sell for the local equivalent of $550 in Korea.[Thanks, techiefan777]
