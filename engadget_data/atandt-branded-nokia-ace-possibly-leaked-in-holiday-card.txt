It seems that someone sent out a holiday greeting featuring a phone that looks a heck of a lot like the Lumia 800, except it prominently features a Ma-Bell logo, a 4G icon and what appears to be a front facing camera. Of course, what has also been referred to as the Lumia 900 could just as easily be a chop job -- and not a particularly difficult one to pull off at that. Hit up the source link for a couple of more pics of what could be Nokia's first high-end Mango (or, perhaps Tango) offering here in the US.
