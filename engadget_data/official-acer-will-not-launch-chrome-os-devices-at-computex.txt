Unfortunately, that's exactly what's going on. Like we said last week, Google's other operating system just doesn't look like it's ready for prime time yet, and it's a little premature to expect devices running Chrome OS to "launch" in just two weeks -- although we're sure we'll see someone throw an early Chromium build on a new tablet or netbook, and show it off at the upcoming Taipei computer show. Of course, we are expecting Android tablets and smartbooks to be in full force at the show, and we'll be there hunting down the best ones. Hit the break for Acer's official Chrome comment.
