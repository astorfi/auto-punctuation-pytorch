As a common practice, it seems the rollout is gradual, and many of the devices receiving the update appear to be the property of corporate stores. Nonetheless, the 39.8MB download carries a build number IMM76K and similarly brings an update to the baseband software -- which is reason to hope that the (resolved) connectivity issues reported by Android 4.0.4 users of the HSPA+ and Sprint variants will be a non-issue. Are you one of the proud and few to receive the refresh? Let us know in the comments below.  [Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
