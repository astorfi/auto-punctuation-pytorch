The miniaturized version of the iBoom ($89.99) combines a clock radio with a portable, AA / AC-powered boombox, which comes in white or graphite colors, boasts the usual sleep / alarm functions, and sports an iPod cradle and LCD screen to boot. The TransDock features an "enhanced mounting arm," video-out for use with in-car displays, top and side mounted antennas, and removable faceplates as well. Additionally, you can connect other DAPs via the aux in jack, and the USB pass-through allows other random USB gadgetry to be charged while it's in use. Lastly, the refreshed HomeDock Deluxe ($149.99) didn't change much in the design department, but did add on-screen album art on a dedicated "Now Playing" screen, a dozen new color themes and screen savers, and a feature that enables "on the fly" playlist creation. The iBoom Travel and HomeDock Deluxe are currently for sale directly through DLO, while the updated TransDock is still waiting for its own release date.
