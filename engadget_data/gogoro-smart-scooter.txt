One of the biggest barriers to owning an electric vehicle is that you have to charge it, often for hours, before taking it for a spin. But what if you could swap out its depleted battery for a fully charged one in seconds? And what if those batteries were in plentiful supply throughout the city? And what if, on top of that, the vehicle in question was a high-powered, cloud-connected electric scooter that told you, among other things, exactly when you should go and swap them out?


That's exactly what today's big announcement is from Gogoro, a new effort by a couple of ex-HTC executives -- former Chief Innovation Officer Horace Luke and former Chief Technologist Matthew Taylor -- both of whom were responsible for some of HTC's most groundbreaking products in the past few years. With Gogoro, however, Luke and Taylor's focus is not on phones, but on implementing smarter energy consumption in large cities. And its plans include transforming the urban transport landscape as we know it.






There are essentially two components to today's Gogoro launch: a sleek two-wheeled vehicle that the company built from the ground up, called the Gogoro SmartScooter, plus an entirely new battery-swapping infrastructure simply called the Gogoro Energy Network. Think of the latter as an interconnected citywide system of battery vending machines -- called GoStations -- where you can drop in your spent batteries and exchange them for freshly charged ones. Of course, the idea of hot-swappable EV batteries isn't entirely new, but Gogoro's effort is focusing on scooters. Additionally, these aren't any ordinary batteries either. The Gogoro Battery is designed to be highly modular, complete with a helpful handle at the top for easy portability. Created in partnership with Panasonic, the lithium-ion battery has supposedly 25 different sensors, NFC connectivity, plus 256-bit security encryption so that only those authorized can use them.
