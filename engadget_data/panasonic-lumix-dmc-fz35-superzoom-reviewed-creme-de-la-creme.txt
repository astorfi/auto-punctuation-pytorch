Both TrustedReviews and PhotographyBLOG managed to score a unit for review, and both outlets came away generally impressed. The former concluded that the outfit's newest 18x zoomer was only marginally changed from its predecessor, but those who skipped on over the FZ28 should certainly give this one a look. In fact, it straight up confessed that to "get anything better than this, you'll have to move up to a DSLR." You may notice that this bugger doesn't offer the greatest zoom nor the most megapixels in its class, but the stellar image quality and even more stirring video mode kept critics from suggesting any of those more marketable rivals.
