Well, it's been a wild ride up and down (and mostly down) on the
HD-DVD vs. Blu-ray DVD format war
roller coaster, and now all hope of a unified DVD format is officially lost. Sony and Toshiba have totally given up all
efforts to continue the unification talks. Looks like the war will officially be waged in the market, with plenty of
potential home theater installation casualties likely. It's gonna be bloody.
