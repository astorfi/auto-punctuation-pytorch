As much as the federal government would like it to, the public outrage at the scope of its PRISM program has yet to die down, despite any good the program may have served in the interests of national and local security. The revelations made by Edward Snowden have cast a bright light on the powers granted our government by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), and many companies are taking the opportunity to push the feds to let them tell the public just how many governmental data requests are being made. Of course, no company can release exactly how many requests were made under FISA -- companies can only publish the number of total data requests, whether they be from the NSA, local law enforcement or elsewhere. Since so many of Silicon Valley's giants have been dishing our data to Uncle Sam on the sly, we figured we'd bring you all the numbers in one place.


At the top of the request list is Yahoo, which received between 12-13,000 requests in the first six months of 2013. During that same time period, Apple received between 4-5,000 requests. Meanwhile, Google reported 8,438 requests between July and December of 2012, Facebook received between 9-10,000 and Microsoft was asked for its users data between 6-7,000 times. Prefer pictures to numbers? A colorful chart awaits after the break.
