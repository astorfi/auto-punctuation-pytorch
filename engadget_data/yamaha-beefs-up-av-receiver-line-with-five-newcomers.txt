Holding down the high-end is the RX-V863 and RX-V663, which both support Dolby Digital Plus / DTS-HD / DTS-HD Master Audio formats and offer up 105-watts x 7 and 95-watts x 7, respectively. Furthermore, the V863 adds in 1080p upconverting along with a trio of HDMI 1.3 inputs and one output. Each of the newcomers support Apple's iPod with an optional dock, and every one save for the low-end RX-V363 can handle satellite radio and feature the firm's proprietary Yamaha Parametric Room Acoustic Optimizer (YPAO) technology.
