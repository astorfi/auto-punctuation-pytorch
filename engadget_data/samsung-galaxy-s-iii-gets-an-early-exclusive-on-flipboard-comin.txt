 It looks like you can now add one more popular iOS app to the Android ranks -- sort of. Samsung has managed to get an exclusive version of Flipboard for its just-announced Galaxy S III smartphone, and the folks at SlashGear have already taken it for a quick spin. The short version: it's a lot like the iOS app, with the notable exception of some widgets that you can add to the phone's home screen. As for when it will head to other Android phones, Flipboard is only saying that it will be available for "select" phones in the "coming months." You can find SlashGear's hands-on at the link below.
