Google's years-long effort to get a  foothold in the living room is finally paying off. The search pioneer has announced that TVs from Sharp, Sony and TP Vision (aka Philips) will all run Android TV when they arrive this spring. Both Sharp and Sony will have multiple 4K models using the internet-savvy software, and every single Philips set will ship with Google's technology on board. You can also expect to see the operating system on Razer's Forge TV game console this February, and Huawei is building an Android TV media player that arrives later this year.



          
 
 
 The folks in Mountain View aren't about to declare victory. Major brands like LG, Panasonic and Samsung have all conspicuously shied away from Android TV in favor of other platforms, so Eric Schmidt's lofty vision of a Google-dominated TV landscape still isn't coming true. However, Android-based sets are no longer the novelty they used to be -- in a few months' time, you can walk into your local electronics shop and expect to find at least a few of these smart screens on sale.
