Swiss site Needful Things has come across an18 karat gold, 63-diamond-sportin' organix that our terrible German (i.e. Babelfish) leads us to believe will be ondisplay at CeBIT- a fitting debut for a project that took some very patient jeweler about 100 hours to complete. It'sunclear which version of the organix -- the 512MB or 1GB -- was the lucky beneficiary of such intricate adornment, butit seems safe to speculate that any customer in the market for a $20,000, um, luxury item such as this, probably isn'tevaluating storage capacity as part of his/her purchasing decision.
