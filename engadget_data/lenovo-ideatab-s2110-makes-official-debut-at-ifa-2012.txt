 There may not be much mystery left surrounding the IdeaTab S2110, but Lenovo's making it official at IFA anyhow. The hybrid slate, first shown off at this past CES as the IdeaTab S2, now has a new name, but aside from that not much has changed since we saw it creep onto the company's site. The 10.1-inch convertible, outfitted with a 1280 x 800 IPS display capable of 420 nits of brightness, runs a skinned version of Android 4.0 atop Qualcomm's dual-core 8060A CPU clocked at 1.5GHz and packs a dual 1.3-megapixel front facing / 5-megapixel rear camera setup, as well as support for WCDMA / EVDO, Bluetooth 4.0 and WiFi. It'll be offered in two configurations -- 16GB and 32GB -- but alas, there's no option for expansion via microSD. For users dead set on expanding that capacity, an optional keyboard dock will be made available that not only augments the S2110's storage via full SD slot, but also extends battery life by an extra 10 hours. The tab's already on sale, so if you've got $399 to burn for the base model, or $499 for the dock-enhanced model, head on over to the source below and get your credit card at the ready.
