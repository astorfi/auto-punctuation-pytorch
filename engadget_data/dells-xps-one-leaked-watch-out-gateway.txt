What we're seeing here is a likely 22-inch WSXGA (1,680 x 1,050) display flanked by stereo speakers (with media buttons running up one side), topped off by a webcam, and featuring a slot-loading Blu-ray burner along the right bezel. On the inside we've got a number of processor options from Intel (the FCC test unit had a 2.66GHz E6750 Core 2 Duo), integrated or ATI Mobility Radeon HD 2400 graphics, up to 4GB of RAM, four-flavor WiFi plus Bluetooth, and the usual slew of connectors including S/PDIF and a proprietary port for an optional breakout TV dongle. Input comes via the included wireless mouse and keyboard, and Dell's also loaded up a memory card reader, making for quite the capable multimedia PC. We'd expect this desktop to be priced well above the recent Gateway model with which it shares a moniker -- which isn't such a big deal, really, as $2,000+ price tags have never really stopped XPS customers before.
