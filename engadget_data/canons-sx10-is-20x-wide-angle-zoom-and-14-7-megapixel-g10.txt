Demonstrating its chops downmarket with its PowerShot range, Canon just announced its 10 megapixel SX10 IS with 20x wide-angle zoom lens and 2.5-inch folding LCD along side a 14.7 megapixel G10 with 5x wide-angle zoom lens and 3-inch LCD. Both feature Canon's optical image stabilization and DIGIC 4 image processing with face and motion detection, face detection self-timer, servo AF, and intelligent contrast correction. The SX10 IS is powered by 4x AA batteries and should hit shelves in late October for $400 -- the G10 should pop for $500 at about the same time.
