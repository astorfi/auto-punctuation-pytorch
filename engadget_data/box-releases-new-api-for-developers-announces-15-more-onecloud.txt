Now Box is getting in on the act, announcing the release of a brand new API that is says makes it easier than ever for developers to integrate the Box platform into their products. Along with it, the company has also announced 15 more Box OneCloud apps for iOS devices, and teamed up with the NYC-based General Assembly and TechStars in an effort to "drive innovation in enterprise software." You can get a quick rundown of the new API in the video after the break, and find all the details on how to get started with it at the links below.
