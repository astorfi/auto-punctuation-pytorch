Firefox (our fave browser) has a handy feature that lets you add search engines to the search bar, so it was only a
matter of time until Macromedia programmer superstar and Engadget pal Mike Chambers cooked up a custom Engadget search
engine plug-in. All you need to do is visit this
site, click the link, and you too can add Engadget to your Firefox search options.


 On a side note, if anyone is wondering why Firefox is grabbing a bigger chunk of the browser market, it's not just
because of the security issues involved with IE, it's also because of a ravenous community of creators making cool
plug-ins, add-ons, and hacks to personalize the browser and make it better and more useful for people.
