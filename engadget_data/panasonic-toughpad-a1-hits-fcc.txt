The FCC's stable of tests aren't revealing much we didn't already know about the Toughpad, but be assured that its WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities are both fit for use. The full radio reports are up now, so hit the source for over 86 pages of detail -- if you're feeling tough enough.

 Update: Panasonic's got in touch to tell us that the Toughpad will now arrive with Android 4.0.
