 If you're down for a round of crystal ball gazing into the future of Google Play, then you'd best thank Android Police, which recently tore apart the latest APK in attempt to learn what new features might be on deck. Most curiously, the mobile app suggests that pre-order functionality may work its way into Google Play, and while there's nothing definitive about how it might be implemented, it goes without saying that the feature would make more sense for hardware rather than software. Not to stop there, it also appears that developers are working to integrate the app review system with Google+. As is, it seems that you may be required to be a Google+ member in order to review apps, and your name and picture will be publicly tied to these reviews.
