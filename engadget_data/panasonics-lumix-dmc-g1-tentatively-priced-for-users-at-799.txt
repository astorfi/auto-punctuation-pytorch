During a leisurely chat at Photokina, the higher-up noted that the Micro Four Thirds camera would hit US soil for $799, though he didn't bother to mention an expected ship date. If you'll recall, we found that the G1 would start shipping at the tail end of October for Â¥80,000 (around $750); considering that, we'd say $799 sounds about right over on this side of the world.
