The disappointment for us is that it's probably another SureType device, and all signs point to EDGE data, not UTMS. With what we could gather from the legend, the Stealth will include an MP3 player (huh?), removable memory, but sadly still no camera. The Stealth appears to be slated for release in the October / November timeframe.
