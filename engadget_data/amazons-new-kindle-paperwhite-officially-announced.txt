In case you needed official confirmation, Amazon's new Kindle Paperwhite is indeed real and on the way. While we still don't have much in the way of specifics, according to the public listing, we do know that the refreshed Paperwhite should arrive with a 25-percent faster processor, improved display with higher contrast and longer lasting battery (supposedly rated for up to two months). Amazon's also bundled in some new features: social integration by way of Goodreads so users can get book recommendations from other like-minded readers, Kindle Page Flip which lets users skip ahead without losing their place and Vocabulary Builder which creates flashcards based on past word searches. Pricing remains the same as we reported earlier with the WiFi-only models set to ship out on the 30th of this month and retailing for $119 (with ads) and $139. Users keen on the $189 3G version will have a bit longer to wait as that device is slated for a November 5th release. Pre-orders are available now, so quit reading and get to one-clicking.
