Sony PlayStation's Shuhei Yoshida is one of the most personable and savvy executives you'll ever meet. He's funny, passionate and he's extremely active on Twitter -- typically gushing about over his own brand or what games he's excited to play. Now, he's going to be in one: Capy Games announced today that the Japanese executive is going to be a playable character in the PS4 and Vita versions of Super Time force Ultra. Yoshida's weapon of choice? His smartphone, of course.



The short trailer (embedded below) shows a business-suited up Yoshida wielding his smartphone, pummeling enemies with emoticons and a variety of tweets. One reads "I love PS4," the other is a deadly hashtag: #STFU (the acronym for the game, not a rude demand for verbal silence). It looks amazing and hilarious. Not familiar with Yoshida? Read up: he's had a major hand in the history of PlayStation.
