Some users of the Vodafone V602 in Japan are
outfitting their phones with a night-vision device made by Yamada Denshi.  The device, meant for military and
defense uses, works with the V602 and allows its users to "see" through clothing with night-vision sensors that pick up
body heat.  The device is so popular among pervs in Japan that it prompted an official statement from
Vodafone.  One priceless tidbit: "we would never sell a phone that was enabling someone to see someone
naked."  Well there you go.  Naked-watching is not officially endorsed by Vodafone.
