What's more surprising, however, is that the device is actually built pretty well, and we even enjoyed the classic-style keyboard spread across its 12.1-inch expanse. The unit was built by an unnamed ODM who is currently shopping it around to manufacturers (or perhaps someone's bitten already, who knows), and we're getting a ballpark $200 pricepoint and a promise of about 4 hours of battery life with regular use. Apparently the big trend with these low-power ARM processor-based laptops is to trim down on battery size and therefore cost, and so we'll have to see where the market settles on preferred batter life: 4 hours might be too few, but at $200 it's surely tempting. The machine runs full Ubuntu plenty well, including 720p movies, and we were even digging the screen brightness and color -- basically, if Marvell's partners can get this on the market in short order, it might have a significant leg up on the rest of the smartbook competition, at least in terms of sheer quality and sex appeal. 

Update: We grabbed a quick video -- check it out after the break!
