 The state of West Virginia seems to be on the "get fit" warpath, as not only did the public school system decide to expand and renew the Dance Dance Revolution program to get youngsters a-movin', but now WVU has developed a system that allows boxers to give it a go without, um, perishing. The Punchstat analysis system is a ringside computerized tool that is being honed to provide a realistic and objective method of determining when a boxing match should be halted. Researchers in Morgantown have performed a "computer-assisted video analysis" to compare a trio of professional matches where one of them led to a fighter's death; these results were further compared with over 4,000 other bouts previously scored with Punchstat, and it was stated that a "significant differences" were seen in fights that led to death. Most notably, fighters that died due to boxing faced around 23 punches per round (compared to the average of 9.4), and more "power punches" were withstood as well. But before scientists can accurately implement a "danger meter" of sorts into pay-per-view matchups, some critics insinuate that factors such as "fighter strength and the effects of the punches that connect" need to be considered before it can be entirely reliable, and it's even suggested that a tried and true accelerometer be installed on a fighter to calculate the force of a blow. Still, we're down with beating someone to a pulp for sport if everyone leaves without a life-threatening injury, but we'll probably take the pansy's way out and stick with Wii Boxing to carve our calories.[Via Physorg]
