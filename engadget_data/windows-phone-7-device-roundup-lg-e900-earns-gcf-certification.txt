One of the more interesting MIA handsets -- the so-called Trophy with WinMo 6.5 and a portrait QWERTY keyboard -- looks like it may have been repurposed as a Windows Phone 7 model thanks to some new shots out of Vodafone Germany's inventory system, which is pretty awesome considering how difficult portrait QWERTY devices are to come by, generally (though it would've had to get a redesign with a higher-res display and faster processor to meet Microsoft's spec guidelines). Along the same lines, LG's well-leaked E900 has recently gotten its blessing from the Global Certification Forum where it's listed with 900 / 2100MHz 3G (HSPA, we're sure) alongside quadband GSM. Certainly going to be an interesting fall, isn't it?
