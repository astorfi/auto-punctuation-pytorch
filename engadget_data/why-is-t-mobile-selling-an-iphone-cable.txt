It's interesting to note that Deutsche Telekom boss Rene Obermann in part blamed the lack of the iPhone in the States as a driving factor in its third quarter churn rate... a meaningless musing, perhaps, but it could've been a little bit of foreshadowing, too. It's important to note that T-Mobile has carried Nexus One accessories this year, too, so it's not out of the realm of possibility to think that they're just trying to cater to the unlockers who are already using iPhones on T-Mobile -- but then again, we'd argue that the people savvy enough to do that probably aren't shopping for overpriced cables in carrier stores. It's also important to note that T-Mobile literally just took a dig at FaceTime (while blasting AT&T's network in the same breath), so it's hard to say what this means, if anything.
