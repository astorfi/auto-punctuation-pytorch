Whatever that is, Samsung's about to blow it away with a new 3.3-inch 800 x 480 AMOLED touchscreen coming in March. The magic lies in the on-cell touch technology -- 0.001mm-thick capacitive touch sensors are deposited between the panel's substrate and the bottom polarizer film, thus removing the usual touchscreen glass cover and the gap that follows. If all goes well, Samsung should be delivering thinner and lighter phones with slightly brighter touchscreens in a few months' time, or possibly phones in the current package but with bigger batteries. Sorry, LCD, but we've got a new crush to focus on.
