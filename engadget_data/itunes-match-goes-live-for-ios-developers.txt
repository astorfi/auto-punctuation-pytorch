Better point that browser towards Apple's dev portal, as Cupertino's just flipped the switch for its upcoming music laundering service. There you'll find iTunes 10.5 beta 6.1 with iTunes Match which'll let you sign up for a yearly $24.99 fee. Hopping on the bandwagon early has extra rewards too -- early birds get three months (on top of their yearly sub) for free. A tipster also provided us with a screencap (after the break) of his iPod touch running the current iOS beta, which now magically has a toggle for the service under the Music section of the Settings app. Taking the plunge? Let us know how you fare in the comments.

[Thanks, Matt]

Update: Looks like the initial signups have stopped, but Apple plans to expand the number of testers "over the next days." So, keep compulsively checking iTunes if you want in on the next round.
