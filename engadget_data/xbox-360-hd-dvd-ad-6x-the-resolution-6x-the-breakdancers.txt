This idea is communicated through the universal language of dance and is meant to show why spending $199 this November for an add-on makes sense. Of course most people won't be getting 1080p output (6x the resolution of DVD) from their 360 due to its lack of an HDMI connection but you get the point. The general public is still very confused about HD and why or if its worth the investment, and we're pretty sure this does a better job of telling them than the rather confusing Sony Blu-ray ad.
