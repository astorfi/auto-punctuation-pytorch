 A recent leak from Intel has revealed the chip-maker's plans for its Penryn mobile processor line, detailing all the sweet news in a roadmap which has made its way into the waiting public's hands. On the sheet are the details of four new Core 2 Duo chips and one new Core 2 Extreme that Intel will be shepherding into the market in the near future (or so we hope). All of the chips feature the Santa Rosa-standard 800MHz frontside bus, with the C2Ds clocking in at 2.5GHZ and 2.6GHz with a 6MB cache, or alternately 2.1GHz and 2.4GHz with a 3MB cache -- the C2E delivers 2.8GHz with a 6MB cache. No word on pricing or availability, but you'll know as soon as we do.[Via Reg Hardware]
