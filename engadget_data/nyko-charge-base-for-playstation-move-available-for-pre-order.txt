While we're still lusting after the shooting attachment, we do realize the need for more modest hardware such as that supplied by Nyko. The Charge Station is a pretty straightforward affair: it features four ports for powering up as many Motion Controllers and / or Navigation Controllers, and can be pre-ordered from Amazon for $20. On a related note, we can't wait to see what CTA comes up with for its Move accessories. We hope there are some Sony-compatible wings in our future!
