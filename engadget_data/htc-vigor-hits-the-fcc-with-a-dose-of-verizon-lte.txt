The oft-rumored HTC Vigor is the latest device to pass through the halls of the FCC whilst sporting Big Red's 4G frequencies, along with a handy dose of CDMA / EVDO. HTC's still keeping an uber-tight lid on all of the details of this phone, however, mandating that all of the juicy secrets remain confidential for now. The Vigor's rumored to have a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU, 1GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, but we're still in the dark despite the phone's fancy new badge of approval. We're just another baby step closer, folks, so feel free to peruse the numbers and graphs in the source link.
