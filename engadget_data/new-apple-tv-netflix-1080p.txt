  Even though Apple didn't make any huge changes on its new Apple TV box, it does come with a slight spec bump for Netflix. On the third generation Apple TV, Netflix will take advantage of its higher resolution output with 1080p streams, just like other platforms like the PS3 and Roku. Don't have the new box? You'll still get a slightly more integrated experience, now that new users can sign up directly from the Apple TV, and pay via their iTunes account.
