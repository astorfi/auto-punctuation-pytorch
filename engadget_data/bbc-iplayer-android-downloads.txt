BBC iPlayer viewers with Android devices have been left waiting for many features, and until today one of them was the ability to download shows for offline viewing. A fresh update is changing that, as the broadcaster is enabling it (as long as you're on WiFi) on several devices running Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean. A blog post claims it should cover about 70 percent of app users with compatible devices will be able to use the feature starting today, with more to be added in the future. Just like on iOS, users can download an episode and keep it for up to 30 days offline, with 7 days for viewing after they've pressed play.


A BBC blog post specifically lists 11 devices (included after the break) that will enjoy support once the update arrives on Google Play and the Amazon Appstore today. Unfortunately, two that aren't on it for now are the Kindle Fire 7 and Kindle Fire HD 7. BBC says it's working on those, and the FAQ claims if your device has ICS or higher there's a "strong" chance support will arrive in the coming months. The update for iOS offline viewing launched just over a year ago, but the Android version will bring a trick it doesn't have: background downloading without keeping the screen awake. Otherwise, the update adds support for Android 4.3, and "addresses some known issues."
