If you're looking to get your James Bond on (and didn't already spring for the
Aquada), you may want to check out the Hydra Spyder from
the modestly named Cool Amphibious Manufacturers International. The $155,000 custom car is powered by a Corvette motor
and can function as well in the water as on land. The Spyder can seat four, pull a water skier, and takes six months to
build. Want something that'll handle a bigger group? CAM also produces amphibious buses and RVs, with prices starting
at a mere $850,000. This is definitely not your father's Winnebago.
