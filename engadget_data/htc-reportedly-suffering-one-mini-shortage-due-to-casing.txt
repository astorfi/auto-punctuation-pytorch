HTC just can't catch a break, it seems: Reuters claims that the company now faces a One mini shortage due to both "design difficulties" with the casing as well as other, unnamed factors. The site's sources didn't explain the shortfall in detail, although we likely can't chalk it up to popularity. Analysts weren't expecting HTC to ship more than 200,000 One minis per month, which suggests that any supply problems would hurt the firm's bottom line. We've reached out to HTC for comment, and we'll let you know if it can confirm or deny its manufacturing woes. In the meantime, we'd suggest buying the full-sized One if you can't find its tiny counterpart in stores.
