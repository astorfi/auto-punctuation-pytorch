 Here's afollowup on the Vaio XL2 Digital LivingSystem media PC mentioned at Sony's press event yesterday -- the successor to the Vaio XL1 sports bothNTSC and ATSC TV tuners. Like the XL1, the XL2 sports an HDMI video out, operation via wireless keyboard and remote, andan optional 200 CD/DVD changer for library management. Running Windows MCE 2005, the XL2 is harboring Intel Viiv inside. Price is unknown, but you can bet itain't gonna be cheap.
