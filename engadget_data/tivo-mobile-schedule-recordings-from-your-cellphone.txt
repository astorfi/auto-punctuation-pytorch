 You may have seen reports that TiVo subscriberswill be able to schedule up recordings directly from their Verizon (and then others 60 days after launch) cellphonebeginning this summer. Dubbed TiVo Mobile, this is the latest feature introduced to help TiVo differentiate itself fromonslaught of generic PVRs. Sounds good until we get to the price. MocoNews is reporting that TiVo will charge a $5 permonth premium for this service on top of their $12.95 per month subscription. Huh? No thanks, though we might give Orb's free TiVo Everywhere service a try.[Via Zatz Not Funny]
