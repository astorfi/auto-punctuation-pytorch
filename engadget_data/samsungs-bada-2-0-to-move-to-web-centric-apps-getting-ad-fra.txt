A developer event in South Korea appears to have yielded the first details on what Bada 2.0 will bring when it launches next year, and needless to say, it adds a bunch of smartphone-worthy stuff to the mix: an honest-to-goodness ad framework of some sort, better support for apps that use web technologies, multitasking, NFC capabilities, and a brand new SDK that'll support Mac and Linux. We're still going to see a whole lot more hardware -- and a more cohesive story -- to justify why even low-end "smartphones" should be using Bada over Android, but it's an interesting development nonetheless.
