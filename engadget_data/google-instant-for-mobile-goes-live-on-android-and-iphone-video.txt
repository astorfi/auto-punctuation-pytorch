Just go to Google in your favorite mobile browser and press the "Turn on" link, and you'll be able to rush into the arms of your favorite technology blog with four fewer clicks. We maintain that it's nigh-useless on most standard-sized mobile devices, as you can only ever see the top result without scrolling up and down, but it won't cost you a penny to pick up your handset and form an opinion for yourself. Video demo after the break.
