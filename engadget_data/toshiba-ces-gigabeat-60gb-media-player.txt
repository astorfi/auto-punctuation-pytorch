While we broke the news on the
Gigabeat media player back in September, there's firm details
now on cost and specs. The top of the line model will be the F60, with 60GB of storage space, which will retail for
$549 ($50 less than the iPod Photo), with support for MP3 and WMA audio files, JPG viewing via the big 2.2-inch 32k
color QVGA 240x320 LCD screen, and it will be controlled by a funky looking plus-shaped touch sensitive control. Each
Gigabeat will come equipped with a cradle, which will have two buttons, one for the usual syncing, and one for CD Rip
Recording,Â so one button can rip your music from your CDs and send them directly to your player. The lower end
models will be the 40GB for $449, 20GB for $399, and 10GB for $299, all which should include the same LCD screen and
cradle.
