Sure to be the envy of all your home theater-fanatic buddies, the HD 160XT sports a 7-inch touchscreen for menu control, media information, and even video previewing, along with four open HDD bays, two optical drive slots, a pair of supposedly silent exhaust fans, and of course, the obligatory remote. Available in black or silver, we sure wouldn't mind building a system around this case and displaying it proudly in our gear rack, but unfortunately we have no idea when or where these will be available.
