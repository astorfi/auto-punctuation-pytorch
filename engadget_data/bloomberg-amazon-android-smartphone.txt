The rumors center around a purported chase for wireless patents (presumably so Amazon can fight off the kinds of challenges currently faced by companies like Samsung and HTC) and partnership with Foxconn for manufacturing. There's no details yet on what the device could be like or when it will arrive, but we're not getting too excited right away -- we've been down this road before with that Vizio Phone that never appeared. Amazon certainly has the infrastructure to enter the cellphone market with its appstore and media delivery services, but is anyone ready to jump into a two-year contract on a (presumably) reskinned-Android device?
