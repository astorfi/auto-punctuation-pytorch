Needless (and harmless, might we add) jabs aside, the firm had a number of its latest GPS units up on display, and while the model numbers (and software, obviously) were a touch different than the US models announced yesterday, the hardware was definitely the same. We really dug what we saw, too, as the curvaceous, thin designs really caught the eye and the LCD displays were all bright and easy to read. If you're hungry for more pics, you know where to look.
