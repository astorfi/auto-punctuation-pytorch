Starting sometime next year, that arrangement will let PayPal customers use their charge cards at any of the 7 million retail locations that accept Discover cards, with funds drawn directly from their PayPal account. What's more, PayPal says that retailers won't have to make any hardware or software upgrades to accept the PayPal payments, noting that they'll simply have to let customers know of the new option with in-store signage. Of course, the deal also likely has implications beyond traditional plastic cards, as PayPal is now also pushing its mobile payments more than ever, not to mention its own triangular Square competitor. You can find the official announcement below.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. & RIVERWOODS, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, PayPal announced an extension of its offline strategy by teaming up with Discover to bring PayPal to more than 7 million merchant locations across the U.S., and potentially to millions of international merchant locations in the future. Starting in 2013, Discover will work with PayPal to enable participating merchants to accept PayPal easily through their existing relationship with Discover. Consumers will be able to take advantage of the benefits of PayPal at these merchant locations, providing them with the simplicity, speed and security they've come to expect from PayPal across any channel, any time.

"We're delighted to enable PayPal's efforts to provide their U.S. customers acceptance at millions of physical point-of-sale locations by leveraging our unique payment services assets. The establishment of this relationship is a major industry milestone, which will help shape the emerging payments landscape by bringing together an established direct banking and payments company with a leading commerce enabler to create an alternative payments option for consumers at the point of sale," said Diane Offereins, President of Discover Payment Services. "This initiative will result in real change and innovation for the industry by bringing new technologies to the point of sale that benefit merchants and PayPal customers."

"This relationship will deliver a truly seamless digital wallet, available most places consumers shop offline, which offers the speed, simplicity and security already enjoyed by 113 million active PayPal customers online."

   Starting in 2013, participating merchants will be enabled to accept PayPal easily through their relationship with Discover. To offer PayPal, merchants will not have to install or upgrade existing point-of-sale hardware or software and consumers will know of this additional payments option through in-store signage. As a leader in online payments, PayPal expects to bring brick-and-mortar merchants more shoppers in store and to extend convenience and utility for consumers through innovative mobile payment solutions. Additionally, PayPal's 50+ million active U.S. customers are expected to help increase customer engagement, loyalty and incremental sales at the physical point of sale.
