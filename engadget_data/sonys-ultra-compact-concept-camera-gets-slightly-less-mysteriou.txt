Still nothing in the way of specs or an actual working camera, of course, but Sony has provided a few screenshots of the camera's menu system that at least provide a few tidbits of information. Most notably, it seems that the camera will employ a touchscreen interface, with most of the main controls handled by a menu on the side of the screen, and it looks like the camera will have a RAW + JPEG shooting mode, which should no doubt please more serious photographers. Hit up the link below for a few more screenshots.

[Thanks, Julien]
