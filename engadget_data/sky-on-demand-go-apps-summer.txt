One option is to get some TV time in, and Sky's got a few updates to share that might tempt you in front of a screen on dreary afternoons. At some point this summer, shows from Fox, Universal and SyFy will be available on Sky's On Demand service, as well as content from Disney if you're signed up for the Entertainment Extra package. Mobile apps will be getting a makeover, with "enhanced navigation" and a new design including bigger thumbnails when cruising through the VOD library. The Sky Go Xbox 360 app will also be updated to bring it in line with Microsoft's UI style. Furthermore, Sky Multiroom subscribers will get access to Sky Go Extra, which allows you to download content in addition to streaming, at no extra cost in early July. Vitamin D's overrated anyways.
