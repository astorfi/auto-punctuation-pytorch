 It's not just America waiting keenly on the Nokia Lumia 920 and its PureView powers -- new images have popped up proving that this Windows Phone 8 device is also headed to China. Corroborating earlier reports of a Lumia 920 that is compatible with China Mobile's TD-SCDMA network, the phone's settings screen mentions "CMCC", which is a reference to that operator -- although it's not clear whether the handset will also support the carrier's proposed LTE network. The pics only show a dark-colored variant, but Nokia will no doubt be depending on the booming Chinese market to bring some sunshine to its balance sheet.
