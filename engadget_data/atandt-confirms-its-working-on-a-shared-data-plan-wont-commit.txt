He also left no doubts about those plans when pressed further on the question, clearly opening the door to a situation where you could have an iPad, an Atrix 4G, an AT&T netbook and just about anything else all sharing a unified pool of minutes and data. He didn't offer any hints about possible pricing, though, and it certainly sounds like this is something that's still a ways out from actually being launched.
