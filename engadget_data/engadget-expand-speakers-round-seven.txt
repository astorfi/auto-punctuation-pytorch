  It's time for another round of additions to the speaker lineup for our big Expand event coming up in just a few weeks. You'll want to be sure to pick up your tickets so you don't miss out on these folks up on stage:

  Alexandra Hall: Senior Director, Google Lunar X PRIZE  DJ Spooky That Subliminal Kid: Artist  Victor Agreda, Jr.: Editor-in-Chief, The Unofficial Apple Weblog  Raghu Tarra: SVP & General Manger, Sling Media, Inc. In addition to joining us on stage, DJ Spooky will be playing a set at Expand on Sunday -- so you'll want to stick around with us all weekend at Fort Mason Center. If you can't be with us for 100% of the fun though, don't forget we also offer day passes for either Saturday or Sunday. Your Saturday pass also gets you into our Day 1 after-party, where we'll have upright cabinets and modern game consoles for retro and current-generation gamers alike to have a little friendly competition. Please join us!

 And don't forget...
