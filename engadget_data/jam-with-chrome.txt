 Wish you could spend your downtime practicing your guitar licks with your friends, but lack a garage and / or sympathetic neighbors? Google's just made both problems moot with its browser-based music service, Jam with Chrome. Unsurprisingly, Chrome users can invite up to three friends to join in a practice session, controlling synthesized instruments straight from the browser. We've been trying it for the last few minutes and it's still a little fussy when it comes to actually, you know, inviting your friends in, but when that minor issue is resolved, we've got big hopes that The Engadgets will knock that Bieber fellow off the top of the charts.
