From the looks of things, it's an extremely simple process to get the data moved over (despite the long waits for multiple GB files being copied), though it looks like you'll still need the DVD on hand to actually play the game. Don't believe a word we're saying? Take a look at the video after the break and see for yourself![Via Xbox-Scene News]
