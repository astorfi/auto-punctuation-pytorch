If you've got a light in the vicinity above you, there's gonna be glare -- we saw it on stage, and we just saw it now in person. That said, the screen is clear and the touch functionality is pretty clever (five fingers open up a widget where you can scroll through other touch-friendly apps). The keyboard, on the other hand, is pretty hard to use -- even the rep admitted there's a learning curve. You can't rest your fingers down without hitting something, of course. We managed to browse to Engadget, but it took several tries. Check out the photos below! 

Update: Now with video! It's after the break.
