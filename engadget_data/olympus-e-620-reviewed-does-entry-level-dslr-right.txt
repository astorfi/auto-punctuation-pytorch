It sounds like a tall order, but according to Photography Blog it's a an almost complete success, offering "the most effective combination of features, ease-of-use and price of any Olympus DSLR camera to date." Not everything is perfect, with low-light performance suffering from visible noise degradation, blamed on the relatively petite sensor here, and the lack of video capture being something of a detriment. But, overall image quality is rated very high, in-body image stabilization effective, the flip-out LCD useful, and overall it's said to be a great value for its $699 MSRP -- that it's already selling for well over $100 less than that is an extra bonus.
