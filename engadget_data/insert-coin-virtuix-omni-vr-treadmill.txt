In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line.

If the unison of Virtuix's Omni Treadmill and Oculus Rift got your left thumb hungry for a well deserved retirement, then it'll also want to push you in the direction of the game controller's official Kickstarter. Yup, for just $249 (if you get in there quick enough), you can snag yourself an Omni in DIY kit form plus one set of shoes (additional pairs costing $49). Those with deeper pockets can opt to get the full kit (including belt, tracking hardware and software) from $399, or go all out and get the Omni Rack (for holding your Rift control box, favorite beverage etc) and some exclusive merch on top for $539. Really dig this thing? Then why not lay down $7,999 for a custom design made from wood and steel? Those of you who are still undecided can delve into the project a little further (at the source), but it seems likely that the final retail price could be somewhat higher than that offered to Kickstarter backers so, you know, you might not want to hang around too long.




Previous project update: Sonte's digital shades have still only raised around $25,000 -- an eighth of its target. There's still plenty of time though, so if WiFi-enabled blinds are what you've been wishing for, be sure to show it your support.
