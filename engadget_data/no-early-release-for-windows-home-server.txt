       Unfortunately for those hoping for an August 27th release for Windows Home Server, it won't be happening: this "general availability date" was actually referring to tech support for system builders. Hopefully peeps won't have to wait too long for the box, as it's still on track for its original September / October launch schedule. Until then, why not check out the announcement post, along with our gallery of the software in action.[Thanks, Arneh and Daniel S.]
