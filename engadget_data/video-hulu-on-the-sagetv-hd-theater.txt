  After seeing a few pictures of the Hulu access on the SageTV HD Theater, we wanted to go by and check it out for ourselves, and while we were there we took a quick video -- sorry it isn't in HD. Overall we liked the interface, and although we've given SageTV a hard time about the lack of richness in regards to the interface in the past, we were impressed overall. As we mentioned before, this isn't available to the public yet and one of the reasons is that right now the ads aren't coming through, but Sage assured us this would be fixed before it's released -- shucks.
