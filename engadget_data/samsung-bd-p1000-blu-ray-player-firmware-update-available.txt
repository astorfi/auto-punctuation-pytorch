The firmware update 1.0 doesn't say exactly what it fixes, but the list of upgrades found so far is as follows:

Fixes stuttering audio/video while viewing movies with DTS soundtracks 
Adds pillarboxing to 4:3 content on Blu-ray discs (instead of stretching it to widescreen), 
Improved load times
Hourglass icon changed to colored dots
Fixes reversed analog outs on affected players
Adds DTS decoding for DVD content (like AVIA test disc)

Of course, if you're on the list Samsung will simply send a disc for you to put in the player and upgrade, but why wait? Another release to fix the annoying noise reduction issue is expected "soon".[Via AVS Forum & Home Theater Blog, thanks for the tip Dave!]
