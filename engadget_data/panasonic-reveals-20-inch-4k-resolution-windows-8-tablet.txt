Wow. Panasonic has just dropped a bomb in the form of a 20-inch Windows 8 tablet sporting a whopping 4k resolution. Our man on the scene liveblogging, Mat Smith, said it "looks like a photo" in person, with great viewing angles, and it sports a touchscreen display and stylus, to boot -- with super-detailed stylus manipulation of images also possible according to Panasonic. The company hasn't revealed any more details, but we saw a similar screen from the company last year, and the beast is already parked at Panasonic's booth here at CES 2013, so we're planning to get our mitts on it and give a full report. Stay tuned!
