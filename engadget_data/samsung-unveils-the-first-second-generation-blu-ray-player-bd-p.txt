 Samsung launched the first Blu-ray player, the BD-P1000, last year and is first into the breach again with its second generation player, the BD-P1200. Featuring HDMI 1.3 (with CEC to control other devices, just like some of LG's new HDTVs), and DTS audio support the player will launch in March with a price of only $799, compared to the $999 launch price of the previous version. Samsung also confirmed the unit will feature an HQV processor for clear images, but no word on if it is the same process used in Toshiba's HD-XA2, or if 1080p24 will be an available option at launch. Check our live coverage of the press conference for more information, or continue on for more pictures. From the press conference we know it also has an ethernet connection, but no mention of any BD-Live functionality, yet.
