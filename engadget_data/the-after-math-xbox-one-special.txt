Welcome to The After Math, where we attempt to summarize this week's tech news through numbers, decimal places and percentages.

We doubt you missed it, but Microsoft unveiled its new games console this week, and it even showed off some Xbox One hardware to prove it. While the new name is offering casual gamers a bit of confusion -- Google "Xbox One" for a taste -- the specifications sound like they could make for one very potent console. Billions of transistors? We're just hoping they ensure there's plenty of Covenant to shoot in the requisite Halo sequel. There was a very heavy focus on TV, Call of Duty and sports games, so plenty of big-hitter titles to get excited about. But numbers and decimals make us just as happy, so join us for plenty of 'em after the break.
