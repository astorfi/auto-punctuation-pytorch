But at least this dissection is performed by an actual Vaio engineer who ought to know his stuff. In the video after the break, Shinji Oguchi explains how cooling was improved using a range of tricks, like aerating the laptop's guts via holes in the keyboard. He also splits open the innovative external media dock, which connects via Intel's Light Peak technology and uses a discrete GPU to give the Vaio Z some gaming oomph. Finally, there's a separate, speeded-up video of Shinji putting the whole thing back together again from memory. The poor guy must be sick of it by now.
