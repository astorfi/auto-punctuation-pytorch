Penciling in a February 2011 launch for the Gingerbread flagship, the Russki guys point out that their version of the Nexus S will come with a 4-inch Super Clear LCD instead of the Super AMOLED panel adorning the English-speaking variants. This is most likely motivated by the still limited supply of S-AMOLED displays, though we wouldn't fret too much -- the Super Clear stuff has shown that it's no slouch either. If anything, it'll be the February release that has us grumbling our way through winter.
