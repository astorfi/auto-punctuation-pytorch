We've been hearing rumblings about an iPhone 6 event next month for some time now, but Apple has made it official: the company's next affair will indeed be held on September 9th. While there aren't the usual clues as to what we can expect -- the invite merely states "Wish we could say more" -- the change in seasons this time of year usually signals the arrival of a new iPhone. And of course, there's been some talk of a wearable, too. As always, you can bet we'll be there to bring all the news as it happens starting at 10AM PT/1PM ET in Cupertino.



On 9.9.14, what's Apple going to announce?
