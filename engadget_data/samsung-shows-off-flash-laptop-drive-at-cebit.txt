The demo box uses a 32GB 1.8-inch solid-state drive created by Samsung, to show off the company's flash chops.Unfortunately, at $30 per gigabyte, the 32GB drive would cost over $900. However, with flash prices continuing todecline, and companies like Intel predictingthat flash laptops are on their way, we may not have to wait too much longer for this to be feasible -- though,even at over $900, that flash laptop drive sounds mighty tempting.
