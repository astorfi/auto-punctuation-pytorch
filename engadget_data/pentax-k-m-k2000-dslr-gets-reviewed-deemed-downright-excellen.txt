The DSLR was recently apprehended and tested at PhotographyBLOG, and apparently they had a really tough time finding anything negative to say. In fact, it was deemed "another excellent addition to Pentax's DSLR range, seamlessly slotting in below the K200D." With the combination of ease-of-use, mid-range features and a low price, critics found themselves in awe of the value proposition. It was also noted that the small size was appealing to those appalled by bulky high-end cameras, and the image quality is about as good as one could expect for under seven bills (with a lens). Don't take our word for it, though -- tap the read link and check out the drool for yourself.
