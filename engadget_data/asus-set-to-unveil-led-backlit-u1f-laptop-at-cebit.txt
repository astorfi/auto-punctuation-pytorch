 Apparently, Asus didn't have quite enough fun dishing out swank new laptop gear at CES, as the firm is now prepared to unveil its first LED-backlit machine at this year's CeBIT Show in Hanover, Germany. The ultralight U1F weighs in at just 2.2-pounds, and sports an 11.1-inch WXGA+ LED-backlit screen, steel edges, leather-clad palm rests, black motif, an ultra-low voltage Intel Core Duo processor, and of course, will come pre-loaded with Windows Vista. Unfortunately, Asus isn't spilling any more details on this one until the time is just right, but hopefully this noticeable move towards LED-backlit lappies will persuade a few other firms out there to follow suit, and soon.[Via Laptoping]
