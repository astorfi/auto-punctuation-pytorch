If there's a way to prepare for Active Time Battling, you should probably get on it -- Final Fantasy IV is now available on the Google Play Store. That said, you may want to grab a Phoenix Down before we tell you the price: an ice cold $15.99. At very least, it's the same price carried by its iOS counterpart, and a good bit less expensive than various Sony and Nintendo portable versions. It's also got the upgraded graphics and new localization enjoyed by iOS players -- as far as we can tell, it's identical to other mobile versions. Grab your nearest chocobo and head past the break to see a trailer of the game in action.
