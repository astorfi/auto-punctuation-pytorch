 We saw DivX posted looking for beta testers for "super-secret stuff" this week, but only now are we getting a slightly better idea of what's at hand. We have it from a trusted insider that DivX is at work on a connected hardware platform in the connected home devices category (PC-to-TV, see: SlingCatcher, Apple TV, Xbox 360, and countless other media streaming devices). We don't know what this hardware's actually going to be capable of, or what form it will eventually take as it makes its way into consumers' hands, but it stands to reason this is a proactive (and long overdue) approach on DivX's part to make sure more home media devices support that company's format, which is rarely found in US hardware these days.
