To put that in some perspective, HP (currently at the top of the laptop heap) shipped some 6.2 million laptops total in the last quarter, while Apple sold approximately 1.4 million in the same time period. Given that Asus is talking about one particular model (with few variations), however, 3.8 million in a year certainly isn't too shabby. What's more, as Daily Tech reports, at least some of those 3.8 million laptops will be shipping with Windows -- specifically, a stripped-down version of XP that's been designed for "emerging markets." Stripped-down or not, however, those'll apparently still demand a $30 to $60 premium over the base, non-Windows model.[Laptop sales figures courtesy of CNET News.com]
