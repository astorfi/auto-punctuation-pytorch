It's tempting to want to read a lot into that, too bad that "working together" doesn't mean a whole heck of a lot. Especially since "working together" could mean anything from the Google Maps app that comes pre-installed on the iPhone (which also happens to be already available for lots of other phones as well) to more deeply integrating Google into Safari, with some sort of hardware device being a longshot. Besides, isn't Google working on a phone of its own?[Thanks, Will Arnold]
