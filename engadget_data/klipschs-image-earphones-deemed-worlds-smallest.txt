Turns out, the firm's IMAGE earbuds are also proclaiming that they are the "world's smallest and lightest in-ear earphones," and while we haven't seen the ruler busted out just yet, we fear it may be needed to settle this obvious conflict. Regardless, these 'buds utilize patent-pending Contour Ear Gels, KG926 balanced micro-armatures, aluminum bodies that are finished in anodized copper, and come with 50-inch long vinyl cables. Ready for a November release, the IMAGE earphones will ring up at $349 and will arrive with a carrying case and pouch, a 1/4-inch / airline adapter, five sets of ear gels, and a cleaning tool to boot. Click on for a literal hands-on shot.
