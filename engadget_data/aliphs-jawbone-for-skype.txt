We caught up with Aliph, the company that makes thisyapper, over at Showstoppers here in Vegas. The award-winning design was updated since we last saw it as evidenced by our pic above of theJawbone on one of the Aliph peeps. We got a chance to give it a listen as well and the clarity was indescribable. $80later this month gets you the Jawbone PC Edition with USB 1.1 and 2.0 support.
