If your idea of a good time is seeing a new smartphone unveiled, Samsung's arranging just such a party at Times Square in New York for the upcoming Galaxy S IV, according to a recent tweet. We'd guess that revelers will get to watch a livestream of the recently announced Samsung Unpacked 2013 shindig for the new handset on the block's famous big screens, while the event itself happens at Radio City Music hall. There's no other details other than the @timessquare Twitter handle, but if you're not in the big apple, you'll be able to catch it right here instead, of course.
