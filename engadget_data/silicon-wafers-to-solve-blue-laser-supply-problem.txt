 Blue lasers. The little diode is at the heart of Blu-ray and HD DVD technology, and its scarcity is the reason you might be reading this while camping out for a PlayStation 3 right now. Shimei Semiconductor Co. thinks it's found an easier way to make them by growing the gallium nitride LEDs on a silicon wafer instead of the sapphire-based process used currently. The predicted lower cost and longer lifespan of the components sounds great ...too bad these aren't expected to be available until April of 2007. Still, those waiting for a dual-format player -- or maybe a European PS3 -- might have one of these blue lasers in their future.[Via CNet]
