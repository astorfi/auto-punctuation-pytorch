   You've already seen it unboxed on board the International Space Station, and now you can watch as the crew of the ISS activates Robotnaut 2 and begins to put it through its paces. The robot was turned on just before eleven o'clock Eastern, but there's still plenty more to see -- head on past the break for the live stream. Naturally, you can also keep up with the robot's progress on its Twitter feed.  Update: And that's a wrap for today. Robonaut 2 has been powered down and put to bed, with additional tests planned for tomorrow. If you missed it, you can catch a video of today's activities here.
