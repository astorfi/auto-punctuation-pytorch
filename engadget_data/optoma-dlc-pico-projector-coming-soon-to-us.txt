If by chance you've forgotten, the PK-101 has a 480 x 320 resolution, 9 ANSI lumens, a 1000:1 contrast ratio, gets up to 2 hours of battery life and has a 0.5 watt speaker. The most important feature of the projector of course, is its miniscule size (51 × 105 × 17-mm / 120g), which, we admit, is really, really, small. We don't have an exact release date, but we're assured that it's "coming soon" and that it'll run you about $400. [Via About Projectors]
