Samsung has tackled just about every kind of speaker you can imagine, but it hasn't had an answer to hot-selling 360-degree speakers like the UE Boom. Well, that changes today: the Korean firm has unveiled the WAM6500 and WAM7500, its first compact one-piece speakers to promise room-filling sound. Both center around a "ring radiator" that pipes audio in every direction while supposedly striking a careful balance between bass and treble. If you ask us, though, they're as much about the "premium" styling as anything else. The portable 6500 (above) looks like the kettle from an avant garde kitchen, while the tabletop-oriented 7500 (below) could easily double as a 31st-century desk lamp. Samsung hasn't divulged pricing, but these fashion-forward designs will likely command a premium.



On top of this, the tech giant is expanding its Curved Soundbar range to accommodate the wider range of curved TVs it has in store. The 6000, 6500 and 8500 series join the 7500 line, and they'll give you curvy audio for sets in sizes ranging from 45 to 78 inches. If you splurge on the 8500, you'll also get a "wider" 9.1-channel surround sound effect courtesy of three extra speakers. There's no word as to how much these new soundbars will cost, although history suggests that you'll find out shortly before they ship.
