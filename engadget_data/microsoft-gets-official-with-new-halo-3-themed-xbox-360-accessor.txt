 
We first caught sight of these new Halo 3-themed Xbox 360 accessories a few months back, but Microsoft is just now getting official with them, confirming all the details that made themselves known earlier. As we mentioned last time, the controllers are both of the wireless variety, and sport your choice of Covenant Brute or Master Chief themes designed by Spawn-creator Todd McFarlane. What's more, each controller also comes with a "Limited Edition" Halo 3 Master Chief figurine also designed by McFarlane. Look for them to set you back $60 apiece when they're released on September 4th. Also coming for the same price that day is a Halo 3-themed wireless headset, which doesn't boast the McFarlane touch but looks like it should fit in better with your Halo 3 Special Edition Xbox 360. Finally, while it's not Halo-themed, Microsoft has also taken the opportunity to reconfirm that its Xbox 360 Messenger Kit is indeed going to be released September 4th for $30, which includes the the Chatpad and an Xbox 360 headset. Click on through for a closer look at each accessory.
