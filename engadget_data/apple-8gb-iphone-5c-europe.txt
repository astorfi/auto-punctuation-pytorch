The rumors are true, Apple is launching an 8GB version of the iPhone 5c. After internal documents from German carrier O2 clued us into a new variant of Apple's mid-tier phone, carriers across Europe have now begun taking orders for it. UK operator O2 and French provider SFR are offering the handset for free and one euro respectively on multi-year contracts, discounting it by more than £50 ($83) to tempt new customers. Apple has also added the new model to its online stores, pricing unlocked models at £429 ($714), which means you'll need to pay an extra £40 ($67) to double your storage. While the 8GB variant is available in China and Australia, it remains conspicuous in its absence from the company's US store. Apple has remained quiet regarding sales of its multi-colored iPhone, but today's price drop could certainly indicate sales didn't meet expectations.
