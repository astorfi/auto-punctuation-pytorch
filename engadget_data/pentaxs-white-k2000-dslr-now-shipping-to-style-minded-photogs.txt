What's more, it's also still listed at $679.95 for the kit that includes both an 18-55mm and a 50-200mm lens, so it looks like that wasn't a special pre-order price, though that certainly doesn't make it any less of a bargain. Sold? Then hit up the link below to get your order in, and look for the camera to ship in as little as a day, according to Pentax.[Thanks, Jason]
