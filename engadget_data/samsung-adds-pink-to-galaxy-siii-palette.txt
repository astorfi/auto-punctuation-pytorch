 In the last round of color additions to its flagship Galaxy S III smartphone, Samsung took a decidedly sombre tone, with new hues like Titanium Gray and Amber Brown. But, according to GSM Arena, the smartphone maker decided to lighten things up this time, going with a pale pink to round out its color selection for the model to a lucky seven -- but the new shade will only roll out to Korea, for now. It will go along with the original Marble White and Pebble Blue, plus the aforementioned dark colors which were accompanied by Garnet Red and Sapphire Black. There's no mention of availability stateside, but if you've been thinking of settling for a less capable model to matchy-match with Fifi, now you can go with power and panache.
