 We're tempted to believe that the latest news in the ongoing quarrel between Broadcom and Qualcomm is foreshadowing some form of closure, but considering just how long this thing has been going on, we suppose we shouldn't be so hopeful. Nevertheless, Broadcom has just announced that it will not seek a new trial and will accept the $19.6 million in damages originally awarded in a patent infringement case. The proclamation came after a federal judge affirmed the jury verdict that Qualcomm infringed on Broadcom patents but "removed an award of double damages." Of course, you knew these two bitter enemies couldn't just shake hands and call it even, as Broadcom did note that it would gladly pocket the near-$20 million award and "pursue an injunction against Qualcomm's infringing products." Surprised? Nah, we didn't think so.
