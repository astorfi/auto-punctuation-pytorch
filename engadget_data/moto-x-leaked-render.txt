All signs suggest that the Moto X will become official on August 1st, but if snapshots and videos of the real thing aren't enough to satiate your curiosity... well, now there's a press render from @evleaks and partner site TheUnlockr. Naturally, stock Android has been key to the Moto X for some time now, but it seems that we might find subtle interface tweaks from Motorola, such as the transparent navigation bar, which is now highly visible. In all, there aren't many startling revelations in the latest leak, but one thing is for certain: the phone's face sure looks a lot cleaner now that Motorola's logo has been scrubbed away.


Update: A render of the phone's right side profile has now emerged from @evleaks, which you can see in the above image. At first glance, the Moto X might appear to be a rather chunky handset, but appearances can be deceiving; if you'll recall the Eric Schmidt incident, the Moto X actually sports rather sleek curves.
