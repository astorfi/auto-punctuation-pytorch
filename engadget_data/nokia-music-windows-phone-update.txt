 Human beings living their mobile life under Microsoft's OS have been enjoying the Nokia Music service for awhile now, but for the Windows Phone 8 folk in particular, the groovy app just got a little better. Earlier today, Nokia released an updated version of its jam-packed application, giving users, among other things, a Live Tile option that displays various info about the music currently being played -- you know, simple (but useful) stuff like artist and song names. What's more, Nokia Music now also boasts a history feature which takes virtual note of the most recently played tracks, as well as bringing improvements to the download section of the app's mix radio stations. If all that jazz sounds great to you, dear reader, then pay the source link below a quick visit, where you'll easily find a direct download of the goods.
