We've all been completely pissed off with
Best Buy for one reason or
another, but no matter how infuriatingly incompetent their people can be, it's probably not a good idea to follow
Marlene Anne Bagnall's strategy for getting what you want out of them. She found out the hard way that while pulling a
gun on the Best Buy television repairman and telling him that, "You're not leaving until the TV is fixed," actually
isn't a good way to get your TV fixed, it is an excellent way to get yourself charged with aggravated
assault and false imprisonment. The repairman, who had already tried and failed to fix her TV several times, calmed her
down by calling Best Buy and getting them to agree to give her a new TV, then left and called the cops.
