Whether you're a fan of Captain Kirk or Picard (we're Team Picard here), you have to admit it's apt that William Shatner is reviewing the celebrity-exclusive Facebook app -- he definitely loves some VIP prestige. The Priceline huckster gives a surprisingly in-depth feature-by-feature comparison between The Social Network's Mentions app and Pages, which everyone has access to, but not before throwing some shade toward the starship Enterprise's yellow-shirted helmsman and all-around social-media-guy George Takei. Apparently, when you first sign into Mentions you can't proceed any further until you follow one of Facebook's suggested celebrity accounts.



"The first person on the list I was given was George Takei (rolling my eyes.) I ended up choosing Robert Downey Jr. to follow and then I hid his posts (sorry Robert!)."




That, he thinks, is a flaw because celebrities shouldn't have to follow other accounts unless they actually want to. Overall, Shatner is left unimpressed, but says he'll still keep using Mentions anyway, in tandem with Pages and the main Facebook app. Surprisingly, his review isn't half bad. Mr. Shatner, if you're reading this and would like to do this sort of thing on a regular basis, you can apply right here.
