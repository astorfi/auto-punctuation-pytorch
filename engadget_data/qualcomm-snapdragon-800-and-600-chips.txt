 Having pushed the Snapdragon S4 into an outrageous number of devices last year, it seemed inevitable that Qualcomm would come to CES 2013 with an even more fiery Snapdragon S5. As it turns out, that prediction was slightly off the mark. We do have new chips to talk about, thank goodness, but a change in the branding means they're actually called the Snapdragon 600 and 800. Both SoCs are due to arrive in high-end phones, tablets and smart TVs in the next three to six months, and both come with aggressive specs. If you haven't got the energy to read our slightly more detailed introduction after the break, then here are two key facts to take away:

  Qualcomm hasn't quit the rat race for a life in academia and Kauaian beach huts  The heavyweight Snapdragon 800 promises a 75 percent performance lift over the S4 Pro, which ought to make it seriously, seriously fast. Read on for more.



 Let's start with the 800 and that claim of 1.75x performance. Assuming it turns out to be true in practice, it'll derive from the following improvements relative to the S4 Pro:

  a shift to a 28nm HPm ("High Performance for mobile") fabrication process  an upgraded Hexagon V5 digital signal processor  the adoption of 800MHz LPDDR3 memory to match up to the PC-like 12.8GB/s bandwidth of Samsung's Exynos 5  an all-new Krait 400 architecture running at higher clock speeds of up to 2.3GHz  an equally new Adreno 330 GPU that'll offer a double helping of compute power This SoC will be able to capture and play 4K video at 30fps, handle 2K video (or more precisely 2560 x 2048) at 60fps, and deliver the latest 7.1 channel DTS-HD and DD Plus audio standards.

 The 800 should arrive by the middle of the year, but another upgrade option will get here even sooner, by Q2. This is the Snapdragon 600, which can be thought of as an S4 Pro with some significant architectural tweaks, a higher 1.9GHz max clock speed, a "speed enhanced" Adreno 320 GPU, and LPDDR3 memory. Qualcomm is specifically angling this chip against Clover Trail and Tegra 4, which suggests we could see it in a range of form factors very soon.

 Needless to say, both the 800 and the 600 will come with a healthy array of wireless connectivity integrated into the chip, including 150Mb/s LTE with Advanced Carrier Aggregation, 802.11ac WiFi and Miracast HD 1080p.

 Finally, there'll also be a Snapdragon 400 and 200 for less demanding smartphones and tablets, but they'll be announced properly later in the year and we have no detail on them as yet.
