Not much has been improved upon within the 52-inch KDL-52V5100, 46-inch KDL-46V5100 and 40-inch KDL-40V5100, but all three now feature the BRAVIA Engine 2 and Motionflow 120Hz technology for improved sharpness and detail in fast-moving images. Furthermore, they include four HDMI inputs, BRAVIA Sync and a USB port for loading up external media. The V-Series also features Sony's own LightSensor technology and dynamic backlight control to ease up on energy usage. The 52-inch KDL-52S5100, 46-inch KDL-46S5100, 40-inch KDL-40S5100 models, and the 31.5-inch KDL-32S5100 all boast 1080p panels and three HDMI ports, while the 31.5-inch KDL-32L5000 and 26-inch KDL-26L5000 ratchet things down to 1,366 x 768 in the resolution department and take aim for your nearest guest room / kitchen. Head on past the break for the full release, and keep an eye out for all of these to start shipping sometime this Spring.

Ranging in screen sizes from 52 to 26 inches diagonally, the nine new models from the V-, S-, and L-series offer high-definition performance at reasonable prices.   "We've migrated features like full HD 1080p and Motionflow™ 120Hz technology down to our entry level models, while also keeping in mind that people are seeking versatile, smaller screen sizes for second rooms outside of the living room," said Randy Waynick, senior vice president of Sony Electronics' Home Products Division.

Additionally, they offer the BRAVIA Engine 2, four HDMI inputs (seven total HD inputs), BRAVIA Sync™ for simplified control of compatible devices, and a USB input for viewing digital images or listening to digital music stored on a compatible USB mass storage device.   The V-series also includes Sony's LightSensor® technology and dynamic backlight control to help save energy and reduce the TV's overall carbon footprint.   The S-series includes the 52-inch KDL-52S5100, 46-inch KDL-46S5100, 40-inch KDL-40S5100 models, and the 32-inch class (31.5 inch diagonal) KDL-32S5100 unit. These models also feature 1920 x 1080 progressive video resolution along with the BRAVIA Engine 2, resulting in outstanding full HD picture quality.    The S-series all offer three HDMI inputs, as well as single PC, component, composite and S-video inputs. They also employ Sony's LightSensor® technology and dynamic backlight control.   The versatile BRAVIA L-series models include the 32-inch class (31.5 inch diagonal) KDL-32L5000 and 26-inch KDL-26L5000. These models offer 1366 x 768 resolution and are good options for the bedroom, kitchen or office.
