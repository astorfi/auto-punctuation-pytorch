 You think you have surround sound in your home theater? What if the sound really enveloped you, putting you at the center of the action? Enter the "Multimedia Dome," the "first digital dome theater to feature natual spatial sound." Fraunhofer, the maker of this aural hemisphere (and creator of MP3, among other things), says that films are shown with six projectors (including one at the pinnacle of the dome), and nearly 100 speakers to create a bubble of dynamic sound. Each projector also comes with its own PC, using software to seamlessly blend the borders of each image. If we were in Berlin at this year's IFA, we'd definitely be spending our days kicking back and watching every other company's video product demo in here.
