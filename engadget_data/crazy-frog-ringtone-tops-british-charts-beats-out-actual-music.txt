Remember the good old days of five minutes ago when you could count on the singles charts being topped by (albeit,
often crappy) conventional musical productions? Stop holding on to the past, yo. Otherwise top-of-the-chartsters
Coldplay were given a sound 4-1 trouncing by one supremely ridiculous ringtone known as Crazy Frog Axel F, which moved
in to the top slot on the British singles chart yesterday. It's the first time a lowly ringtone hath entered into
battle with conventional full-length tracks and won. Please don't ask us why.
