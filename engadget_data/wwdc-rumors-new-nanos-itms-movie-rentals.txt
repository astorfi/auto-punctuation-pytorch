Some flavor of Mac Pro seems a shoo-in, but Think Secret has some dirt on the iTunes Music Store and iPod nano, which they think are due for some keynote love as well. On the iTunes front, the word is that Steve Jobs will announce movie rentals for the store, with titles coming from Walt Disney, Universal Studios, Paramount Pictures, and Warner Bros. -- with more on the way. While a significant move, this marks a bit of a defeat for Jobs, who was purportedly going for mirroring music model with a-la-carte movie purchases, instead of having the file expire after a specific time or number of viewings. We're not sure which rental method Apple will go for, but the movie industry types seem pretty smug about their victory in the matter. As for the iPod, Think Secret's insiders are reporting that the second-gen nano is on the way, which should come in 6-8GB capacities, and feature multiple colors, including that metal alloy enclosure we were hearing about. Otherwise, the new nano shouldn't be much of a departure from the current offering. Rumblings of 40GB and 80GB 5G iPods are also making the rounds, with that 6G being delayed into 2007, but Think Secret doesn't expect anything for the WWDC.Read - iTMS movie rentalsRead - Second-gen iPod nano
