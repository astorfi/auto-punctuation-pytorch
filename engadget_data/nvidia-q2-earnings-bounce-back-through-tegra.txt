It just saw its profit double versus a glum first quarter to $119 million, even though the company only slightly edged ahead in revenue to $1.04 billion. In explaining the success, the company is quick to point to a confluence of events that all worked in favor of its bank account: a slew of Tegra 3 phones and tablets like the Transformer Pad TF300 made NVIDIA's quarter the brightest, but it could also point to a much-expanded GeForce 600 line on the PC side and the shipments of the first phones with NVIDIA-badged Icera chips. The graphics guru expects its revenue to climb more sharply in the heat of the third quarter as well -- between the cult hit Nexus 7 tablet and a role as a major partner for Windows RT, NVIDIA has at least a temporary license to print money.

  Our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 is as follows:
  Revenue is expected to be between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion.
  GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be flat relative to the prior quarter, at 51.8 percent and 52.0 percent, respectively.
  GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $390 million; non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $350 million.
  GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be approximately 20 percent, plus or minus one percentage point, excluding any discrete tax events that may occur during the quarter, which, if realized, may increase or decrease our third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates. If the U.S. research tax credit is reinstated into tax law, we estimate our annual effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2013 to be approximately 16 percent.  We estimate depreciation and amortization for the third quarter to be approximately $57 million to $59 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $30 million to $40 million.
  Diluted shares for the third quarter are expected to be approximately 630 million.
