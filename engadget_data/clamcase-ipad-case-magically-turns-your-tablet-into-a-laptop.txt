Sure, we have our doubts that the Iron Man 2 footage and AC/DC track being used were properly licensed and the product isn't actually real, but we've got a feeling iPad keyboard cases are going to be the playground for accessory manufacturers -- and the trend is just going to intensify when OS 4.0 brings keyboard support to the iPhone. We'll be honest, we can't wait to see what happens when some of these companies let their freak-flags fly -- check the ClamCase video and PR after the break. 

Update: New video after the break -- one that's decidedly less Shoot to Thrill.
