Carphone Warehouse, the UK's biggest independent phone retailer, has confirmed it has been the target of hackers. The company has said that the personal details of up to 2.4 million customers have been stolen, as well as 90,000 encrypted credit card records. BBC News reports that the affected sites include OneStopPhoneShop.com, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk, but also Carphone Warehouse services like TalkTalk Mobile, Talk Mobile and iD Mobile.



"We take the security of customer data extremely seriously, and we are very sorry that people have been affected by this attack on our systems," says Sebastian James, Group Chief Executive of Dixons Carphone. "We are, of course, informing anyone that may have been affected, and have put in place additional security measures."

The breach itself was discovered on Wednesday, but the company has only just shared news of the attack. It has, however, made it clear that Currys, PC World and the "vast majority" of Carphone Warehouse customers aren't affected as those details are stored on separate systems. The retailer has now turned to a "leading cyber security firm" to find out exactly what happened and assess the data that was stolen.
