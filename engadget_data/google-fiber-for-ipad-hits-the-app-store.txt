Let it never be said that Google doesn't show its iOS-toting fans love. Even when it's not bringing apps to Apple's platform first, it usually makes sure to offer its wares on the competing ecosystem. It may have taken a while, but the Google Fiber remote app is now available outside of Android land. You'll need to have an iPad (sorry, no pocketable version here), but just like its Jelly Bean-bound cousin, you can change channels, schedule recordings and fire up on-demand programming. The free app is available now through iTunes, though, it obviously won't do you much good outside of Google Fiber's limited coverage area.
