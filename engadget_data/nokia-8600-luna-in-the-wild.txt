These here are the first live shots we've spied of the rumored 8600 "Luna," a slider with a trick translucent cover and a shape that roughly mimics the older (and allegedly more expensive) 8800. For one thing, having S40 on here in its very latest incarnation is a huge boost to its lust factor, and the huge display doesn't hurt either. Let's hope the Carphone Warehouse has its wits about it and it really will be launching before too long, shall we?[Via Just Another Mobile Phone Blog]
