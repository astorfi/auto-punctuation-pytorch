The report also says that the tablet project has been twice killed by Jobs in recent years -- first time because of bad battery life, which we get, and second because of insufficient memory, which seems a little less believable. Interestingly and uncharacteristically, Jobs took it upon himself to respond, saying via email, "much of your information is incorrect." If Apple really is ramping up to unveiling a tablet, the first of its kind for the company, we have no doubt Jobs would be personally watching over every minute detail of it -- what we really want to know is when we might see something materialize, and that's still very much a mystery.
