Sure, we have devices that will disable a
vehicle if it senses the driver is already drunk (like the
Alco-Lock, at right), but what about a device that sense if the
driver is getting drunk as he drives?  Alco-Detector, created by South African inventor Noel May, fits
that need.  The detector is placed within close proximity to the driver, and if it sense rising alcohol levels, it
slowly disables the car in a safe manner.  The device is also goof-proof, meaning it can't be disabled by wiley
drunkards who use Listerine to foil the system.  So if you see some guy weaving and then slowing down, thank
heavens for Alco-Detecor.
