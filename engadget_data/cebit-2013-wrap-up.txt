 As it'd be poor taste to start singing So Long, Farewell from The Sound of Music, we'll have to settle for a cheery auf wiedersehen and some fond memories of our week in Hannover. Admittedly, this year's show was hardly a vintage for consumer tech news (something of a trend this year, non?), but we certainly saw a few things that made the trip worthwhile. Dan's favorite had to be the eye-tracking AR goggles, while Dana had a soft-spot for those Coby tablets. We're off to load up on chocolate and rindersteak for the flight home -- but you can re-live every nail-biting moment of the CeBIT 2013 if you take a trip past the break.
