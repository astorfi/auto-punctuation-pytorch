The TouchCam N1 from faceVsion is the latest to ship, a $120 model that manages 720p recording and also includes dual unidirectional mics to ensure that your voice gets through loud and clear from any angle. That seems to be the only real advantage over the Freetalk Everyman HD, which recently went on sale itself -- for $70. The N1 does also offer a wider 78-degree lens compared to the Freetalk's 58, but whether that's worth the extra cheddar is something you'll have to decide.
