       Of all the things still lacking an iPod dock -- La-Z-Boys, parkas, and the Foleo -- you can cross off your flat-panel, as JVC has added an iPod dock to their P-Series line of LCD televisions. The iPod TeleDock sits at the bottom of the set, ready to accept your player for charging even when the set is turned off. Video and audio playback can be controlled with the clickwheel-esque TV remote and on-screen menus. The P-Series features 720p on the 32-inch LT-32P679, while the 42-inch LT-42P789, 47-inch LT-47P789, and 52-inch LT-52P789 sets bump the resolution up to 1080p, with availability starting in March.
