 Those of you as fond of Ubuntu as we are likely won't need much convincing, but those that have yet to go 'bu now have one of the most compelling reasons yet to consider the OS, as version 7.04 (otherwise known as "Feisty Fawn") has now been officially released into the wild. Among the improvements this time around are improved wireless and multimedia support, and a new Windows migration tool that should make things a bit easier for those going for a dual-boot system. Unsurprisingly, the servers appear to be taking a bit of a beating at the moment, which we suspect could be the case for a little while longer.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
