Thing is, the PS3 is shipping in Japan on November 11th but the remote won't pop until December 7th for about ¥3,600 (about $31), a move that will surely live in infamy. No word on pricing or release for the rest of world.P.S. -Oh, Sony released pricing on the PS1/2 memory reader and the SIXAXIS, as well: ¥1,500 and ¥5,000, respectively ($12.75 and $42.45).
