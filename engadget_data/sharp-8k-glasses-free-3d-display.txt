Sharp loves to show off the 8K technology it hopes to see in your living room in the future. It's no surprise, then, that the outfit is yet again using CES as a platform to tease another super, super high-res 85-inch screen. Unlike the gorgeous panel we saw last year (pictured above), though, this time Sharp's rolled into the desert with a glasses-free 3D flavor of its 7,680 x 4,320 display. The company isn't sharing many more details at the moment, but, for what it's worth, it did mention that its latest 8K creation was done in collaboration with Philips and Dolby. While we haven't seen this thing ourselves, we know it's here, somewhere in Las Vegas, so we'll be sure to update this post as soon as our eyes meet all those pixels.
