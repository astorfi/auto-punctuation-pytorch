Turns out Rose had a choice to make when he tripped on a 59th street pothole in New York City: protect his newly purchased MacBook Air, or his face -- he chose the former. According to his producers, "The Macbook Air is fine, he showed us the blood stains on it this morning." Wow, in an instant he took a measurable shot to his dignity and redefined the term, "air head." Not bad.
