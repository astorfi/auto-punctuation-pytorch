 Laptop LoJack's number might be up, Intel's apparently gearing up to start pushing its so-called Anti-Theft Technology for laptops. Details are still sparse, but apparently it provides boot-time lockout of unauthorized users (presumably among other things) upon occasion of theft, and is being picked up by partner companies like Lenovo, Fujitsu, Phoenix, and McAffee for release later this year. It'd be really nice if we could get some connected GPS to phone home when your laptop takes off without you, but it's nice to know the industry's finally starting to take this stuff on instead of leaving hapless theft victims to fend for themselves.[Via Ars Technica]
