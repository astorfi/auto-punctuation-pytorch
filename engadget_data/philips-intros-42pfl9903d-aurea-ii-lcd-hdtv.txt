The 42-inch Philips Aurea II (or 42PFL9903D, if you'd prefer) packs a 1080p panel, the latest version of the Perfect Pixel HD engine, a dynamic contrast ratio of 30,000:1 and a wicked fast two-millisecond response time. Reportedly, the main differences between this set and the original Aurea is a thinner frame, more curvaceous corners and an ever-so-slightly updated design. For those with the cash to blow, it'll be available for a stiff Â£2,499 ($3,967) this month.
