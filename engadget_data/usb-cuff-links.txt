We don't actually know if these things have any memory or wireless capabilities or usefulfunctions outside their holding those French-cuffed shirts of yours in place (you do have some French-cuffed shirts,right?), but since you can get USB memory in just about every other form under the sun, we think we'll just revel intheir prodigality and leave it at that.[Via Techie Diva]
