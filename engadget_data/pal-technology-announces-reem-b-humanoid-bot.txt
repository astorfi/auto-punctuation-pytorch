Unfortunately for Reem-A, his new buddy Reem-B is going to be getting all the lady bots with his refined looks, ultrasonic range finders, fully fingered hand and stair walking abilities. Reem-A only has voice, face and object recognition, and some other softwarey skills like self localization, he won't stand a chance. Those Pal Tech jerks. Reem-B will be fully revealed in Q1 2008, until then we'll just have to stare at his impressive chest.[Via Slashdot]
