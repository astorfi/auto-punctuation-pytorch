   Sure there are plenty of biometric locks outthere, but the BioKnob from Tychi Systems adds a twist that may make it a little easier to install: the biometricreader is built into the doorknob itself, rather than a separate mechanism, and fits into any door that can handle anormal doorknob with a latch. The knob can store up to 100 fingerprints, and can also log up to 1,000 entry attempts.The BioKnob is powered by a rechargeable battery that lasts for about 1,000 openings per charge.
