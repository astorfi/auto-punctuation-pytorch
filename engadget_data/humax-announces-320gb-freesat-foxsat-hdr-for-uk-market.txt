The aforementioned company has today launched its Freesat+ Foxsat-HDR, which packs two FreeSat HD digital TV tuners (which can also access analog channels), support for radio / interactive channels, a 320GB hard drive for storing up to 80 hours of HD material or 200 hours of SD content and an HDMI port to boot. The downright sexy set-top-box also includes Dolby Digital audio output, two SCART sockets, a bundled remote, radio recording, split recording and the ability to "live pause" with instant rewind. Get ready to grab yours next month for Â£299 ($487).[Via Digital Spy]
