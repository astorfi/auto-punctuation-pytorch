There were a handful of test devices on display with Xohm modems integrated, including a trick little gaming device with a slide-out control pad, an ASUS Eee, an OQO Model 02, and a couple of data cards. Xohm's open structure allows for all sorts of bizarre, independent devices to hook up to the network, so with any luck, this is exactly the kind of variety we should see after the launch gets official.
