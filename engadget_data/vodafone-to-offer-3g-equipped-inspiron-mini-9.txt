 It's still not quite a standard offering from cellphone carriers, but it looks like the 3G-equipped netbook is fast headed in that direction, with Vodafone now following T-Mobile's Eee-centric lead by offering a mobile broadband-friendly version of Dell's brand new Inspiron Mini 9. Unfortunately, there's no word on pricing or country availability just yet (that's promised in the "coming weeks"), but the 3G-equipped Mini 9 will apparently be available by the end of the month, and the deal is exclusive for Europe, so it looks like any other European carriers interested in hopping on this particular bandwagon will have to make do with one of the other 9,000 netbooks currently on the market.[Via Xataka]
