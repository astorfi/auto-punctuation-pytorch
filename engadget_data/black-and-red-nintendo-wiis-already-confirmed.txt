 We're going ahead and tossing this one in alongside all the other probable-but-not-official rumors out there, as apparently "an anonymous Nintendo representative revealed that black and red Wii consoles have been confirmed." No, there wasn't any followup about other colored offerings, nor any questions about when this colorific duo would hit stores (skeptical yet?), but we will admit this isn't the first time we've gotten wind of colorful Wiis (not to mention a price drop) being on the horizon. So while it's definitely in the Big N's character to pump out old hardware in a variety of colors, we've still got little to go on with regard to its latest machine, but we're sure there's a few talented people out there that could create a vivid version for you if you don't feel like waiting around (or cherishing your loot).[Via Joystiq]
