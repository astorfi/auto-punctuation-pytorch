  It's not been all that long since Nikon last augmented its Coolpix S-series, and now the camera maker's at it again, adding another four to the point-and-shoot range. Starting at the bottom end is the S3300, which definitely keeps things simple: 16 megapixels, 6x zoom, 19 picture modes and 720p is what you'll get for the $140 asking price. An extra $30 lands you the S4300, which adds touchscreen control. Stepping up the ladder, we have the S6300 at $200, which includes a 16 megapixel CMOS sensor, 10x zoom and an Easy Panorama mode for those 180- and 360-degree vistas. Video also jumps up a notch to a full 1080p. Assuming a $350 price tag doesn't seem too lofty, you might like the S9300 -- it has the same 16 megapixel CMOS sensor as the S6300, but also throws in GPS for geotagging, and a generous 18x zoom, giving it a 25-450mm range. There's a limited range of colors for each model, and availability is pegged for February, but hit the PR after the break if you want the full rundown.

These new cameras deliver on Nikon's rich optical heritage and benefit from new technologies poised to create an amazing camera experience for any user, such as GPS and enhanced resolution. The Spring 2012 line of Nikon COOLPIX cameras help capture memories with advanced features including extraordinary low-light capabilities, powerful optics and HD video recording with full stereo sound. Added features such as the built-in GPS of the COOLPIX S9300 and Easy Panorama mode of the COOLPIX S6300 bolster the S-series lineup, in addition to the easy-to-use, slim and stylish COOLPIX S4300 and S3300. These cameras also include Nikon core technologies for amazing photos, including Nikon's Smart Portrait System for flattering portraits and HD video capability across the line.  "The new COOLPIX S-series cameras are super slim and easy to carry around for all of those special 'can't miss' moments that matter in a person's life," said Bo Kajiwara, director of marketing, Nikon Inc. "These cameras complement a personal style while providing amazing image and video quality easily."  The Ultra-Zoom That Fits in a Carry-on  The COOLPIX S9300 is deceptively slim (approximately 1.5-inch body), but hides a super-zoom secret with an outstanding 18x optical Zoom-NIKKOR ED glass lens (25mm-450mm). Vibration Reduction (VR) image stabilization lets users capture far-off horizons or up-close action, making the COOLPIX S9300 a packing priority for any trip. The camera features a 16.0-megapixel Backside Illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensor for capturing low-light images with stunning clarity and sharpness. Nikon's BSI sensor technology increases the flow of light to the sensor's surface, which improves image quality and reduces noise. Whether traveling around the globe or enjoying a night out on the town, users can also record Full HD (1080p) movies with full stereo sound and enjoy high speed frame rates for slow and fast motion effects. Further adding to the COOLPIX S9300's credibility as the ultimate travel camera, built-in GPS has been added to provide the user with accurate geotag data of adventures and even displays a map as to where the user has been.  The Super-Zoom Goes Super Thin  The slim COOLPIX S6300 bundles a 10x optical zoom with a compact body and VR technology, so users can quickly zoom in to the action without worrying about blurry photos. A 16.0-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor captures fast action and scenarios in challenging lighting, such as faces around a dimly-lit birthday cake or sun soaked days at the lake. The COOLPIX S6300 also records full HD (1080p) movies for memorable moments without missing a beat. Additionally, 180o and 360o views of the world, including stunning landscapes or amazing interiors, are simple to create and share with the Easy Panorama mode. Creative color options let the user add their own personal touch in-camera with effects like Low key, High key, Nostalgia Sepia, and even Selective Color, putting a little punch to images and movies.  The Touch Screen to Set Trends  For those looking for a no-frills touch screen camera that captures amazing photos and HD video, the 16.0-megapixel COOLPIX S4300 is the camera that fits the bill. It features a wide-angle 6x (26mm-156mm) optical Zoom-NIKKOR glass lens, plus VR image stabilization for maximum versatility. The 3-inch touch screen LCD makes it easy to compose, focus and capture moments quickly, and subjects come alive with 460,000-dot detail. Additionally, multiple Scene Modes immediately adjust settings for optimum results, while the Auto Scene Selector can identify scenes automatically and set the camera accordingly. The COOLPIX S4300 also features Nikon's Smart Portrait System, which includes the intelligent Smile Shutter function that automatically recognizes when a subject is smiling and releases the shutter for picture-perfect results every time. The Face-Priority AF can find and focus up to 12 faces, making the COOLPIX S4300 the ultimate party accessory.  A Fashionable Zoom for Any Occasion  The Nikon COOLPIX S3300 answers the call for a cost-efficient 16.0-megapixel camera with a 6x (26mm-156mm) optical Zoom-NIKKOR glass lens for near or far photos on any occasion. The slim design of the camera makes it effortless for traveling, while the easy-to-use interface is always ready to capture photos and video. The camera has 19 Scene Modes, including the Scene Auto Selector which analyzes a scene and automatically selects from one of six scene modes. With the COOLPIX S3300, the party can be relived in glorious HD with 720p movie recording, while optical VR minimizes the effects of camera shake for sharp, high-quality images.
