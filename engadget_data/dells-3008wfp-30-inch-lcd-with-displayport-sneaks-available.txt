We knew the 30-incher was coming, with DisplayPort as its primary claim to fame, but there's plenty else to like. The screen packs a 2560 x 1600 resolution, 370 nits of brightness, 8ms response times, a 3000:1 contrast ratio, and DVI-D (with HDCP), HDMI, S-Video, component and composite plugs just in case. Hopefully we're looking at some sort of silly exchange rate silliness for the price, since NZ$2,699 (about $2,050 US) is roughly double what Dell is charging for its existing 30-inch 3007WFP display. Obviously, no word on when this will hit the States, but all signs point to soon.Update: Ha! It's now on the US site for $2,034 with a shiny green "Buy Now" button and 2 day shipping. Anyone want to purchase and tempt our envy? Also available in Japan starting tomorrow according to official Dell press release. Now, you do have a DisplayPort video card, right?
