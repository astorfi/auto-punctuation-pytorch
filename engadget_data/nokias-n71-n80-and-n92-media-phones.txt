Introducing Nokia's sweet new
N-Series media convergence phones,
we have, from the left, the N71, N80, and the N92. And Nokia isn't kidding around with these 3G Series 60 phones, no
sir, they're busting out the WiFi for the N80 and N92, a 3 megapixel camera in the N80, decent music support in the
N71, DVB-H for the N92, and QVGA or greater
resolution displays in all three phones. Both the N71 and N80 should be available Q1 2006, with the N92 following in
the middle of the year. They're priced at 400, 500, and 600 Euro (US$490, $610, and $730) respectively, and we've got
all the juicy specs, along with more pictures, after the jump.



  Starting with the music centric N71, we?re looking at a clamshell with a 2 megapixel camera, along with a second camfor video calls. As far as music playback goes, the phone has a 5-band equalizer, an FM tuner, and support for MP3,AAC, eAAC+, and WMA formats. Sadly there is an unimpressive 10MB of included memory, but it is expandable via miniSD.They also include Bluetooth and USB2.0 for hookups, and there is a 240 x 320 display, along with some external screenaction.

  The N80 goes for the pixels with a 352 x 416 screen and a 3 megapixel camera. We saw some pics last month and it lookslike they were spot on: it is a slider, Nokia?s first smartphone in such a form factor. There is an extra camera forvideo calls, but sadly all these pictures and videos won?t have much of a home with the 40MB of included memory.Luckily you can upgrade with a miniSD card, or spend your time juggling files with the included USB 2.0, Bluetooth, orWiFi, but some more internal storage would?ve been nice. This guy is also quad band GSM and supports EDGE, so it lookslike we just might be seeing it Stateside.

  Finally, we have the Nokia N92, which has support for DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting ? Handhelds), along with anystreams you might catch with the snazz 3G connection. It?s a dual folder, similar to the SamsungD307, giving you a nice landscapeorientation for video viewing on the 2.8-inch, 16 million color, 320 x 240 display. There are once again two camerasavailable for your snapping pleasure, with 2 megapixels in the high-res one. There is also 802.11g WiFi and the usualBluetooth and USB 2.0, along with 90MB of storage, expandable through miniSD.
