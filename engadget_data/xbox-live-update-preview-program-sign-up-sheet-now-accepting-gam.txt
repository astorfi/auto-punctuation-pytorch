Just like last year, Microsoft's resident Xbox 360 spokesman Major Nelson has made the call for sign-ups in the Update Preview Progam, which as the name suggests will get you on the list for potentially some early playtime with the upcoming Dashboard update. Just follow the instructions to get in the virtual queue, and sorry, this isn't gonna get you any closer to Kinect. Productivity notwithstanding, what do you have to lose?
