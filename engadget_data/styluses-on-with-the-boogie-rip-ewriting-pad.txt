The Rip (that's "Record. Image. Preserve.") is the latest addition to the Boogie eWriter line, devices that let you scribble notes and drawings and can be wiped away with the press of a button (think a more legible Etch A Sketch). The Rip ups the ante with the addition of a microUSB port, which lets you transfer notes as PDFs to your computer.

Improv was careful to point out that the device is currently in prototype mode, so we won't hold too much against the company for the product's plasticy feel -- though, if its predecessor is any indication, the final version likely won't be too far from this one, and the company confirmed that the final version will have the same charcoal color. And while the product is indeed plasticy, it certainly feels sturdy. More after the break.






Writing on the thing is quite simple for anyone who has ever used a stylus before (you know who you are), and erasing is done quite simply, with the push of a button. There's also a Save button, which let's you hold onto notes for posterity.All in all, this is a pretty exciting device for those who want simple note taking functionality, but don't want to go all out with, say, a Samsung Note. Pricing hasn't yet been finalized on the device, but it will be a bit more expensive than its predecessor at a little over $100. It should be available around November. Check out a hands-on video below.    Zach Honig contributed to this report.
