Of course, to pull it off you'll have to install a plugin from Xandu and Team 280, which involves fiddling with your BIOS and possibly bricking your system, and apparently the plugin is only working with about 2/3 of users so far, but we deem those risks a small price to pay for the sort of moral triumph involved in this hack of hacks.[Via PSP Fanboy]
