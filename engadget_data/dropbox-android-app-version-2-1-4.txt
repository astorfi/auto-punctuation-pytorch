This time the cloud box application -- now in version 2.1.4 -- brings along a couple of fresh bits to powered-by-Google devices. To start with, the free app's finally adding support for Korean language (on its website, too), while Dropboxers running Ice Cream Sandwich will also see a new "custom-tailored" video streaming UI -- you know, to play nice with those fancy virtual buttons. Judging by recent reviews, most of the Android folk seem to be enjoying the minor changes, but in case you've yet to try it yourself, you can do so by grabbing the update from the Play link down there.
