 Here's a deal that's pretty tough to beat, Cricket is offering unlimited EVDO Rev. 0 data for only $35 -- after discount -- a month. What do you need to get yourself signed up you ask? The Kyocera KPC650 data card which will set you back $59 after various deals and rebates, willingness to shell out $35 beans for all you can chew data, and a willingness to not sign a contract. Fair, no? Of course, the service's footprint is really limited right now, so if you don't live in Nashville, Spokane, the Central Valley of California, Santa Fe / Albuquerque, or Portland, you can ignore this article. If anybody out there is already hooked up with this seemingly reasonable offer, drop us a line and let us know if you've found any snags. Here's hoping the market expands, really soon now.[Via Gearlog]
