Assuming there's no surprises in the next week, that would seem to make them the first non-Nexus phones to get the update. What's more, in addition to various Android-related updates, both phones will also be getting Sony Ericsson's so-called "Facebook inside Xperia" update, which promises to more deeply integrate your phone (including your calendar, contacts, and even music) with the social network. The company's also confirmed that the Facebook integration will be included on all future Xperia phones, and it will be headed to all Xperia models released so far this year.
