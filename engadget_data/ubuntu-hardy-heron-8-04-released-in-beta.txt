As you'd expect, the update brings an increment to Ubuntu's quaint, alphabetical naming convention. In other words, the new Hardy Heron will supplant the current Gutsy Gibbon as we make our way towards an October release of Intrepid Ibex. Got it? Good, now do yourselves a favor and check out Ubuntu's latest. Then decide for yourself if Hardy Heron's April 24th go-date means something special for you.
