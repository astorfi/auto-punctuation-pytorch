But sure enough, Sega has unleashed (or is it unhooked?) the iDog's new companion, theiFish. The new toy includes 50 built-in "healing" sounds and, like its canine cousin, can be connected to anaudio player for a piscine light show. No word yet whether Hasbro is going to pick this one up, so there's hope that itwon't swim to these shores -- though if you really want one, at least one Hong Kong-based e-tailer plans on selling itto US customers for $64.90.[Via I4U]
