Our friend Brent Evans takes the time to write up his highs and lows with the new device. He is really happy with the picture quality -- despite the 2nd generation copy -- he loves having freedom to recording any source he wants in HD without worrying about DRM, but He isn't thrilled to pay the HD STB rental fees to the cable company, he's not a fan of the Ir blaster and says that setup could be easier. Overall he seems very pleased, but does point out that not everyone is so lucky, as many Hauppauge HD-PVR owners have apparently been experiencing over heating issues and can't use the device at all. Hauppauge is evidentially aware of the problem and believes it may be addressable in a firmware update, but nonetheless it is issuing some RMAs.
