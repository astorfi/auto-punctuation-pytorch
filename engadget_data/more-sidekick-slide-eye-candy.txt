 
The single picture of the Sidekick Slide from Danger (alias "Zante" in codename parlance) posted yesterday on Boy Genius Report left us wanting for... oh, say, 27 more pictures, to be precise. That gallery is now live, showing the Motorola "M" logo (a first for a Danger device) in all its metallic glory, some comparo shots to a Sidekick 3, and -- of course -- the obligatory iPhone shot. Check it out![Thanks, EC]
