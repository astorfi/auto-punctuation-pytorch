Designed with the modern musician in mind, these two bad boys are convincingly modeled on the AKAI MPC2000XL sampler and the EMU SP1200 drum machine. And by "convincingly modeled" we mean that they look pretty much exact to their original counterparts. They have a 4GB capacity and are going to run you $39.95 each, and you can pre-order them now. We strongly suggest that you look into doing just that. Several more shots after the break.[Via Crate King; thanks George]
