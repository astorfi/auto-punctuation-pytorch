 2008 -- the year of the Beijing Olympics, a global increase in HD adoption and four years away from anything meaningful. According to UK-based Understanding & Solutions, flat-panel sales will be paramount in revenue growth in worldwide consumer electronics products. The analysis jives with pretty much everything else we've heard thus far, as LCD growth in developing nations will purportedly give a nice boost to the sector. TV manufacturers are expected to ship 128 million LCD and plasma sets in 2008, which would be up 38-percent from last year if John Bird's assumptions are accurate. It's also noted that these figures should remain in tact despite estimated slumps in US / UK flat-panel purchases, but alas, only time will tell if 2008 becomes a banner year for HDTV adoption.[Image courtesy of Dallas News]
