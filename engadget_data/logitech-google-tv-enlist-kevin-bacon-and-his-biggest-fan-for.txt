The main gist is that the Google TV is the key to easily finding your favorite video content, wherever it is... along with the slight danger of turning into Kevin Bacon. Give it a watch, while we're still not totally sure the Revue belongs in every living room this bit is far more convincing than the old screaming anthromophized HDTV.
