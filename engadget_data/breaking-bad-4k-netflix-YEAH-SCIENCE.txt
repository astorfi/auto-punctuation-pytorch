Are you jonesin' for a fix of some new content to play on that fancy-dancy 4K Ultra HDTV in the living room? Netflix has some blue sugar for you, right on schedule. Breaking Bad hits the streaming service today in ultra high-def, and, with it, you'll likely be able to count every hair in The One Who Knocks' beard without a problem. According to Netflix's Joris Evers, the new 4K feed is available "everywhere" the service is, but that doesn't account for whether or not your screen will actually support it.



Breaking Bad now streaming in Ultra HD 4K everywhere @netflix is available!
