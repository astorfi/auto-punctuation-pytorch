 Here's a sure fire way to set rumors in motion: list an unannounced, though hotly rumored camera in a pull-down list on your website. Right there you've got the Canon 5D Mark II. That's it, just a name in a list on a reputable software vendor's bug tracking page. Legitimate leak, idle speculation, or dastardly ploy to drive traffic to PhaseOne -- that's the real question. Proof? Hardly, unless you're already a believer.[Thanks, Eric]
