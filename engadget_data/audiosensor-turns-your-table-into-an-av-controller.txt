Yeah, universal remote
controls are nice and all, but you know — we lose them. Plus, this Audiosensor by Tona Interactive will make us
look like wizards of home theater, as it allows you to control audio, video and other electronic components via hand
movements on the surface of something like a table. The unit translates your hand signals into remote control
programming commands — who needs a scroll wheel when you can just wax on/wax off your coffee table to control your
tunes?
