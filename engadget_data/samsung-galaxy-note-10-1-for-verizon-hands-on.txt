 The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is no stranger to us, as we've had the opportunity to review the global unit on two occasions. This is the first time, however, that we've seen the S Pen-toting tablet bearing the Verizon logo -- and an unusually large one, to boot. Hardware-wise, the Big Red branding and LTE support are essentially the only major differences; its dimensions and glossy (read: fingerprint magnet) titanium gray back are the same as what we've seen on models past, and it comes with the same 1.4GHz quad-core Exynos processor, 2GB RAM, 7,000mAh battery and three size options ranging from 16 to 64GB.

 On the software front, on the other hand, there are a few differentiators worth taking a look at. The device comes with Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) pre-loaded and, aside from the usual benefits that come with such an upgrade, it also adds the cascading capability to the traditional Multi-Window view. While you're still able to access the same 'ol half-and-half view from before, you can now have more than two windows open, and it's also possible to adjust the size -- and even have them piled on top of each other, much like what you'd find on a classic desktop OS. We loved Multi-Window before, and adding this new capability makes it even more tempting. To see a few images of the device, take a quick peek below.

 Update: Journey past the jump to catch the hardware as we take it for a tour on video.
