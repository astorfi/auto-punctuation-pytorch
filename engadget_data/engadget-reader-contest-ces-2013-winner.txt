 Dearest Reader,

 Great news! If you hadn't already heard, Daniel's entry for our 'Bring a Reader to CES 2013' contest won over our own staff, as well as the hearts of the outside world. We'd like to offer our own congratulations to every single individual who shared videos and cleverly-typed missives, as they were all very fun to watch and read, indeed. Tim Steeves is particularly excited to meet him at CES in a couple weeks, so check back then to hear how Daniel makes out with the team in Vegas. Now, we're afraid we'll have to let you go -- so much planning for his trip, so much planning.
