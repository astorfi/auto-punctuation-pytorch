TechCrunch is reporting that the latest version of Android -- you know, the one with the 450 percent performance improvement and buttery smooth Flash playback -- will, upon updating, guide you to visit a selection of Flash-enabled websites. Countering Apple's list of iPad-ready (aka Flash-free) websites, this is clearly intended as a showcase of the Adobe software's capabilities. Ironically, a sizable number of the sites on the list are "mobile optimized," meaning you won't be hitting their full desktop versions (which doesn't quite mesh with the idea of "the full web experience"), but it's still likely to cause some consternation over in Cupertino. All we're wondering now is how much Adobe had to pony up to ensnare such a prominent promo position, but things like that don't stay secret for long.
