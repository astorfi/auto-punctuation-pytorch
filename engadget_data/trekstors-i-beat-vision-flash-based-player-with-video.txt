As if there weren't enough flash-based video players with cracker-sized screens, TrekStor has tossed yet another one
into the fray, the i.Beat Vision. This one has a 1.3-inch screen with a 160x120 resolution â€” we guess if you make the
screen small enough you can make any resolution look good. On the storage end, it'll come in 256MB, 512MB, 1GB and 2GB
varieties, and will support MP3, WMA and OGG. Plus it's got an FM tuner. Retail price starts at 159EUR.
