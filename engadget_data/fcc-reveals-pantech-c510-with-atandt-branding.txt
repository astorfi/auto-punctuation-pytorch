For folks out of the loop, that's "Cingular" in 2006 parlance, and it looks like the carrier is about ready to flip the switch on moving its new old new branding to equipment. Of course, the FCC isn't a great barometer for knowing exactly when stuff is going to actually make it into consumers' hands; it could be a month or six (or more) before those three exquisitely-crafted lower case letters are silk screened onto a phone that's actually in your pocket. See the C510 spread wide open after the break (notice the select button -- so long, splat).
