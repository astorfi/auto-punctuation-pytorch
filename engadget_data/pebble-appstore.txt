Pebble's smartwatch appstore has arrived as promised and it's loaded with over 1,000 apps and watchfaces. Our review of the new Steel watch has more details on how it all works, and users with the iOS companion app will see the new features right away. An Android version isn't quite ready for release, but a beta APK is up on Pebble's developer website if you want to try it out early. There are known issues with the pairing process and a few things to be aware of when loading new apps, while any new issues will be listed on the blog as they're discovered. Assuming you're ready to sideload the app on your phone or tablet then the file is available here, iOS users can hit iTunes for an update.
