There are approximately 3 million Xbox One owners worldwide as of the end of 2013, according to the latest numbers from Microsoft. That's up another million since mid-December, and accounts for sales in 13 countries. Not too bad, eh?


Xbox marketing head Yusuf Mehdi announced the new sales number on Microsoft's Xbox news site, where he wrote, "Since our launch, demand for Xbox One has been strong, selling out throughout the holidays at most retailers worldwide. We are continuing to work hard to deliver additional consoles to retailers as fast as possible."
