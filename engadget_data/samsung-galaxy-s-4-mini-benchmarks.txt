The more we know about the 4.3-inch Galaxy S 4 mini, the more we're convinced that it's coming in the near future. German website All About Samsung claims to have obtained AnTuTu benchmark results from the baby Galaxy S 4, courtesy of an unnamed source. According to the screenshots above, the phone will feature 1.5GB of RAM, an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 2.1-megapixel front shooter capable of 1080p video. The original screenshots confirm the GS4 mini's rumored qHD display resolution (960 x 540 pixels), while also indicating that the phone will likely be powered by Qualcomm's dual-core Snapdragon 400 (like the HTC First), running Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean). If these specs pique your interest, ensure you haven't missed some recently leaked shots of the phone itself.
