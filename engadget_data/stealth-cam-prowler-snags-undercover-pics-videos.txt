This inconspicuous device sports a five-megapixel sensor for color day time captures, a two-megapixel sensor for monochrome nighttime images, and the ability to capture footage in the pitch black wilderness sans a flash. Apparently, the camera / camcorder hybrid utilizes 42 infrared emitters to "illuminate the area up to 50-feet away," after which it can snag programmable burst shots or videos up to 90 seconds in length. It also packs 32MB of internal memory in case a clever animal snags the evidence held on your SD card, and the built-in battery pack should ensure a night full of remote shooting fun in case you're too frightened to hang out in the rough. No word yet on pricing or availability, but we're sure those details will sneak out soon enough.[Via BeSportier]
