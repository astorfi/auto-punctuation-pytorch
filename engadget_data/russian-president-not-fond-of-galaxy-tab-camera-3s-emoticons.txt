Unfortuntely, he doesn't seem to be much of a fan of the GT-P1000's camera according to a recent tweet made from his certified Twitter account. Apparently, he prefers the quality of his trusty Leica M9 camera spotted in the EXIF of the images he posted from Japan just a few days prior -- the $17,500 Neiman Marcus edition, we presume. Proof once again that it's good to be king Президент.
