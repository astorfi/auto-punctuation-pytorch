When Apple revealed that iOS 8 would allow third-party keyboards, one big question came to many people's minds: would some of the better-known Android keyboards make the leap? In short, yes. SwiftKey says it has "already started" porting its heavily customizable software to iOS; Swype tells Engadget that it "can't wait" to support Apple's platform. Fleksy, meanwhile, is going so far as to take sign-ups for a beta program and vows to be "one of the first" with a solution. The odds aren't high that you'll get something like Google Keyboard on your iPhone (we've asked to be sure), but you won't be hurting for input methods when iOS 8 is ready this fall.
