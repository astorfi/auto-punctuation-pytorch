The C3202WTV-B1 set features an integrated terrestrial digital/analog tuner, 1366x768 resolution, 550cd/m2 brightness, 8-ms response, and 1000:1 contrast ratio. It also packs the usual 176-degree visibility and humble set of in/outs including HDMI, S-Video, composite, and even DSub-15 RGB for the old PC -- no component though for you, Jack. Besides throwing back a nice, clean design, the only thing that stands out here is the price, just Â¥109,800 or about $938 should Iiyama ever decide to grace their modest, rest-of-world portfolio with this model. Yeah, it's not as cheap as an $845 Polaroid, but it's not as cheap as an $845 Polaroid either, ifyanowhutamean?[Via Impress]
