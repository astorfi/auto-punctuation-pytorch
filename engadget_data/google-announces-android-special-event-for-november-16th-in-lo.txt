To top things off, the email came from "Nigel Tufnel," Christopher Guest's character from the film. The event kicks off in Los Angeles at 2PM local time (that's 5PM for you folks on the East Coast) on Wednesday, November 16th. We'll be there live, and so will you -- catch the livestream at YouTube.com/Android. There are a few more subtle hints in the invite teaser image, so jump past the break to see if you can pick them out.
