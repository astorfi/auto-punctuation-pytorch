Alright, this guy is officially our new hero.  He's building an 18-foot tall robot (or "mecha") in the backyard
of his home in Anchorage, Alaska.   The anime-inspired behemoth is actually a giant exoskeleton that you jump
into and ride, letting you take eight-foot strides or, presumably, fight invading aliens.  He hopes to have it
finished by next summer and will demonstrate it by demolishing a few cars at the local racetrack.  Somebody,
please send us video.


[Thanks, Dana]
