We've certainly seen that demonstrated with striking effect with the Samsung F480's unfortunately named TouchWiz interface. Now take a look at the UI for Samsung's NV24HD. Besides shooting 720p video, this 10.2 megapixel shooter with 24-mm ultra-wide angle lens features a series of touch-sensitive buttons surrounding a brilliant 2.5-inch AMOLED display. An interesting twist on the lifeless touch-screens we've seen on other cameras. However, it does so at the expense of screen size on a crowded back panel. Still, we're a bit smitten by the user experience which we quickly got the hang of. See for yourself in the video after the break.
