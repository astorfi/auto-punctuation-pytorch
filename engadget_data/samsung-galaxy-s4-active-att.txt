A teaser of a Samsung phone capable of spending some time underwater with a curiously familiar set of hardware buttons underneath the screen? Sure looks like the Galaxy S4 Active to us, and AT&T is ready to unveil its rendition of the water-resistant device to the nation tomorrow, according to a video it released on YouTube today. The teaser shows a few angles of the phone shrouded in darkness, as well as some shots of it hanging out in a glass full of water. Finally, it wraps up its 57-second presentation telling us that we'll find out more on June 13th. Take a look-see for yourself below the break, and then keep your eyes peeled for more news about the Active tomorrow


Update: we just received a screenshot from an anonymous tipster that also confirms the Active is coming, and will be offered in two colors at launch: Dive Blue and Urban Gray. [Thanks, Anonymous!]
