 It brings a smile to our face when a new city gets HDTV, but when a whole country launches another HDTV service, it warms our hearts in a special way. Poland's private broadcaster, ITI Group, is going to launch another way for its native people to receive glorious HDTV. The service creatively called "N" (most of lost something in the translation) is going to offer subscribers a wide range of programming that must be lacking in Polish HDTV offerings. There are some analysts that are wondering if the country needs another HDTV provider but we say, the more the merrier.
