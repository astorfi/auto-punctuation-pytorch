It looks like the dual-core super-phone just stopped by the FCC to have its radio checked out, and we're happy to report the PH39100 came out unscathed. Though photos and specific branding were missing from the filing, we're pretty confident that this 1700/2100/700 LTE device from HTC is, in fact, the Holiday. We're also certain that Ma Bell is working like mad to get this 4.5-inch beast out the door real soon. Hit up the source link if you're into things like RF exposure reports and label placement diagrams.
