The firm is claiming to have introduced the "industry's first Green Ethernet technology" with a new series of environmentally-friendly Gigabit switches, which reportedly "decrease energy costs by reducing power consumption without sacrificing operational performance and functionality." Apparently, these intelligent devices "recognize when a port is active or inactive and adjusts its power accordingly," and they can also "analyze the cable's length" and only send out the necessary amount of juice. Granted, every little bit counts, but we wouldn't let the guilt trip convince you to go replace all of your networking gear or anything.
