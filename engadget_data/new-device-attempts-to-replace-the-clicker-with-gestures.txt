We have yet to see any evidence that people prefer gesture-based
input systems to traditional button-based ones, especially given decades of ingrained button-clicking habits (as well
as the fact that buttons are usually clearly labeled with their functions). But that hasn't stopped researchers from
contuniously developing new gesture-based systems, like the new one
Scottish researchers proposed earlier this year for
portable audio players. And now Australian scientists are attempting to apply the gesture concept to the venerable TV
remote control with a small device that straps to your hand and recognizes various gestures (like as palm-up to
fast-forward through a recorded program). While having something tethered to your hand might help those of us who
are constantly losing our remotes, we can't help but think that most viewers would still rather click than wave — thus
keeping those hands free for more important tasks like holding onto a brewski and a bowl of chips, or for commentary of
programming by way of particular gesticulations that can't be reprinted on a family-friendly web site such as ours.
