Looks like it's been deemed a success though, as Microsoft has decided to expand the deal to all Best Buy and selected GameStop stores later this month. The $99 deal ties you into a two-year subscription at $14.99 per month and includes a 4GB Xbox 360, Kinect unit and Xbox Live Gold. According to Microsoft, this is only the next stage of the "pilot period", with limited numbers and dates. No specifics just yet on those exact numbers and which stores will be offering the deal. But even if SmartGlass didn't grab you the first time round, this makes it even harder to say no. Your turn, Nintendo.
