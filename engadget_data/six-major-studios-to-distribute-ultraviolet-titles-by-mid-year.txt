 
Some days our dream of being able to watch anything, anywhere, anytime, and on any screen seems like it'll never happen, but other days are like today. Yes, today every major studio, except Disney, announced that it would start distributing movies that will work with any UltraViolet devices, software or services. We learned on the Engadget HD podcast that this means that if you buy a movie one way (DVD, VOD, hotel PPV, whatever) you can view it on just about any other without paying again. PC software and updates for existing devices are expected to start rolling out later this year -- so much for launching in 2010 -- but we'll have to wait for CES next year to learn about all our gadgets that can't, or won't, be updated. Of course the dream will only come true if everyone and everything agrees to play, and while we're a long way away from finding out if our media consumption fantasy will ever come true, the list of 60 companies that have already pledged their allegiance is a who's who among media and electronics giants.
