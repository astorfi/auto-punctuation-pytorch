 Where's the fun in owning an exercise tracker like the Nike+ FuelBand if you can't lord your healthiness over others? Nike must have wondered the same thing, as it just updated the FuelBand's iOS app to add Nike+ Friends. Wearers can now learn where their step count places them relative to their peers and share the results for all to see. Should there be any doubters, owners can attach photos, locations and mentions of nearby friends to back up their boasting. Yes, it's an upgrade that's primarily focused on oneupmanship, but it's good in our book if it makes us walk just a bit further each day.

   The latest Nike+ FuelBand app update makes it easier for users to share more and celebrate NikeFuel achievements with their Facebook friends. Now users can capture their activity or workout via photo, upload images from an iOS device, tag location and friends, and comment on the activity pictured. Users can also customize their photo with an overlay that includes their current NikeFuel score and the Nike+ logo before sharing images with their Facebook communities.

   Connecting with Friends

   Starting now, Nike+ FuelBand users with the iPhone app can invite, manage and compete with friends in three ways â€“ through Facebook, Nike+ and Contacts. This update allows athletes to use NikeFuel in new customizable leaderboards as a social currency to compare, compete and challenge friends to keep up.
