This dual-mode phone is said to go quad-band GSM/EDGE, support WCDMA 850/1900(and possibly 2100 making this a global 3G phone), and will operate on Cingular's HSDPA (1.8Mbps) network. What's more, that swiveling 1.3 megapixelcam eliminates the need for that second, bulky cam found on many 3G phones. It supports MicroSD expansion, lookscrazy-thin for all the features it packs, and according to HoFo peeps, throws down an internal 2-inch, QCIF TFT LCD toview content on Cingular's Video service.Apparently, the CU500 is already FCC approved meaning it could drop anytime. More pics after the break.  [Via PhoneArena]
