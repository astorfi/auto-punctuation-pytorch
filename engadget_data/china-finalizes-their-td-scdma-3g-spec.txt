 Looks like China doesn't want to license nothingfrom no one, no how. They're already going their own way with FVDas their chosen standard for HD discs, and now they've finalized their TD-SCDMA 3G network spec so they don't have topay up to Qualcomm or the 3G consortium to use the existing 3G standards. They're hoping for a "timely"rollout, and are expected to give out licenses this year, which means more proprietary phones for them, and less gadgetlove for us, but since China's expertise seems to mainly lie in making cheap (or expensive)knockoffs of phones we already have anyways, we're probably not going to be missing much.
