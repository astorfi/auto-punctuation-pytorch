As you can see above and in a few more shots at the source link below, the laptop is indeed pretty thin -- 21.5mm, or 0.85 inches thick, apparently -- but Lenovo still found room to squeeze in a backlit keyboard (check it out after the break), not to mention the ThinkPad's trademark pointing stick. Unfortunately, Lenovo has yet to officially say anything about it itself, so we still only have that rumored May 20th launch date to go on for the time being.

[Thanks, leungxd]
