After nearly nine years of writing about near field communication (NFC), we honestly thought the tech had maxed out with things like baggage tracking and business cards. Not so, however: Guinness, the company that produces some rather tasty Irish stout, is running a promotion in the UK that gives Android and BlackBerry users with NFC-enabled devices the chance to win a free pint. As a bar patron, you simply tap your phone on the Guinness logo at one of twenty participating pubs, fill out some information on your phone, and if you're lucky, you get one on the house. Technology is rarely this frothy.
