According to some unnamed sources speaking to ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley, Microsoft has decided to simply use "Windows 8" as a name for all things once known as Metro. That means "Metro-style applications" will now be known as "Windows 8 applications," and that the "Metro user interface" will now be the "Windows 8 user interface." What's more, Foley also notes that the phrase "Windows 8 apps" has already turned up on the promo page for Lenovo's new ThinkPad Tablet 2, which also indicates that the traditional Windows 8 apps will simply be known as "desktop" apps to distinguish the two. We'll keep you posted if we hear more on the change from Microsoft itself.
