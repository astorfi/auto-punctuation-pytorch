 We snagged a bunch of pics of the Comcast DVR with TiVo software for you -- pictured above is a new way to find shows, different from previous TiVo searches -- as you search it simultaneously looks for title, actor, director, etc. and if there are no results, there's an "add wishlist" option which saves you from having to look for that same show again. Once it's on the wishlist, it will be recorded automagically the next time something fits that query. Click on for more pics of the interface after the break.
