The standalone unit -- which lacks an HDD and memory sticks -- is set to be priced at a not-too-shabby $229, while the "Plus" model will carry a more expensive $319 price tag, but does come sporting a decent 320GB (5,400RPM) hard drive, 2GB of DDR3 RAM, NVIDIA's GeForce GT 520M GPU alongside the dual-core Intel Atom D2550 CPU. Ports-wise the ZBOX ID84 Plus is pretty well-stacked, sporting two USB 3.0, four USB 2.0, a notorious 6-in-1 card reader, gigabit Ethernet, plus DVI and HDMI. All in all, it looks like Zotac's latest miniature could get most anyone through the days, though we wouldn't blame you if you're interested in something with a little more power under the hood.
