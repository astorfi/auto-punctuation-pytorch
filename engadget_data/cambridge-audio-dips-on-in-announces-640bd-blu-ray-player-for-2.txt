Announced today in Denver, Cambridge Audio has revealed that it too will be producing a BD deck in early 2009. The 640BD will be designed to complement the Azur range of AV receivers, and it will boast full HDMI 1.3 output (including bitstream output of all the latest Dolby / DTS tracks), a full set of analog video outputs, Ethernet, S/PDIF, Toslink and a set of separate, dedicated 7.1 / stereo analog outputs. Unfortunately, that's all the details the company has prepared for this year's Expo, but we'll certainly be hearing more as CES time draws near. Per usual, the full release is after the break.
