Nokia broke the news that Vine was making its way to Windows Phone back in July, but there wasn't an exact word on a release day. Well folks, the time has come. Twitter's video microblogging app has made it's way to Microsoft's mobile OS. Much like the software for Android and iOS, this version captures video with a tap and hold, serves up camera tools for a helping hand and the Explore feature to checking out what's popular. In features that are unique to Windows Phone, users can pin their favorite accounts to the home screen for easy access while pivotting back and forth between other apps. If you've been eagerly waiting, the download should be live in Microsoft's app store later today.


Update: Vine is now available in the Windows Phone Store via the second source link down below. Via the release notes, the app can be accessed from inside camera mode -- making use of that handy Lens feature. You can also pin the Vine camera to that home screen for one-tap launching when you're in a rush to capture the moment.
