 Funding that stimulus package just got ever-so-slightly easier -- Hitachi is the latest company to fess up to LCD price fixing, and as part of its deal with the US Department of Justice, it's paying a $31m fine. The company has specifically admitted to fixing the prices on panels sold to Dell from 2001 to 2004, and while no Hitachi execs are due to join their comrades from LG and Chungwha Picture Tubes just yet, we'd encourage them to book their vacations now, since the DOJ seems like it's staying on the warpath.
