Speaking with IGN this week, he says that it is "something that we're definitely giving consideration to," and that Nintendo wants to "continue to try to allow people to use their Miis on different Nintendo systems going forward." While that's not quite a complete confirmation, it definitely sounds like your Mii could be with you for a long time to come.
