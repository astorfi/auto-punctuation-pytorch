Sony has come a long, long way from the dark days when it was struggling to sell the PlayStation 3. The tech firm just announced that it has sold 18.5 million PlayStation 4 systems between the console's November 2013 launch and the start of 2015, about 4.1 million of which reached gamers during the last month of holiday shopping in 2014. How do those numbers stack up? Microsoft doesn't have lifetime Xbox One stats yet, but the figures are stellar in light of Sony's rough experience with its previous-gen hardware. The company took seven years to move 80 million PS3s, and sales didn't really pick up until multiple price cuts convinced wary gamers to hop on the bandwagon. While the PS2 is still Sony's crowning achievement (it sold 150 million units), there's no question that the PS4 is doing just fine so far.
