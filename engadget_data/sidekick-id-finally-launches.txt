This 5.1 x 2.5 x 0.9-inch bugger's gonna run you a cut-rate $99, and features replaceable, colored bumpers, and all the basics necessary to get going T-Mobile style (including myFaves). But if you want the full Sidekick experience (i.e. camera, Bluetooth), you're still gonna have to roll with the 3. Welcome, welcome, teenage wallet-prybar.
