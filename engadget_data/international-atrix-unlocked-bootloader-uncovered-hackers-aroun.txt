Now, thanks to the tireless folks who haunt the XDA forums, all of our international friends rockin' the laptop-dockable handset will soon be free of Moto's chains. Project Cheesecake, as the quest was known, has dug up files from a forthcoming Orange UK firmware upgrade that can be applied to any Atrix across the globe. That means even our impatient neighbors to the north on Bell will be able to get in on the unlocking action early. If you can't wait for Motorola to officially get the update out the door, just keep an eye out at the source and more coverage links. The devs are doing some final testing to ensure it doesn't brick phones and creating localized builds, so you're just gonna have to wait a tiny bit longer.
