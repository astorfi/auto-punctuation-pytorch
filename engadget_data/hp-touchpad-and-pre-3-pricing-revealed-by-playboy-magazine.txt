Playboy Magazine sure thinks so, as its latest issue (June) comes with pricing for the Pre 3 and Touchpad, information we haven't yet heard from anywhere else. The 3.6-inch smartphone with a sliding keyboard is expected to land at the industry-standard $200 on contract, while its 9.7-inch tablet brandmate should make itself available for $500 without any subsidies. These numbers are stated authoritatively, as if already known, though we'd still urge a note of caution until HP itself blurts the prices out. Skip past the break to see evidence of the Touchpad pricing as well.

Update: False alarm, people. The author of the Playboy article -- yes, Playboy reads Engadget, apparently -- got in touch with us to say that the numbers quoted were just price estimates rather than concrete insider intel. Oh darn.
