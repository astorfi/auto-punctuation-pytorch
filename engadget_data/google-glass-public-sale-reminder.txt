Your taxes are (hopefully) done, you've had your first cup of coffee... now what? Google wants to jump-start your Tuesday by offering even non-Explorers its Glass wearable for $1,500. As many of you said yesterday, that's kinda steep, but today marks the first day the product is open to the public -- until supplies run out, that is. Google Glass will go on sale at this link starting at 6AM PT/9AM ET, and we recommend showing up on time.
