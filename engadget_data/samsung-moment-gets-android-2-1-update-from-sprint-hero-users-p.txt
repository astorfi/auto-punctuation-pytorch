If you're a Samsung Moment owner on Sprint, you know exactly how glorious it feels to have and hold Android 2.1, which Sprint has confirmed to be rolling out to handsets as we speak. Notably, a tweet on the matter has the carrier promising that Hero owners will be "next" to see the same update, but sadly a time line wasn't given. Enjoy and hang tight, respectively.
