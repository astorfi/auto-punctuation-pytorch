 The new AT&T, AT&T and SBC that is, gets the HD Beat award for "Firsthigh-def commercial in 2006". They actually ran the commercial at 11:47 PM, but I did see it again on ABC after midnight. The widescreen aspect and beautiful imagery was fully taken advantageof, as the theme of the commercial was connectivity all around the world. Showing the sunrise-caused shadows in variouslocations really got the message across in way that standard-def or 4:3 television simply can't. Hats off to AT&Tas we expect huge growth numbers in the high-def advertising space this year.
