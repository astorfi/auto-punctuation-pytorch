  We've previously heard rumblings of the ZTE Fury's pending arrival on the Now Network, but now you can safely circle your calendars -- in pencil, anyway -- for a March 11th debut. For those unfamiliar, it'll be a rather low-end smartphone targeted at the budget market, where $20 (after a $50 mail-in rebate) will snag an Android 2.3 handset that packs a 1GHz processor, a 3.5-inch touchscreen and 5MP camera. For those keeping score, it also features 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage. Perhaps we'll find out on March 11th whether less truly is more.
