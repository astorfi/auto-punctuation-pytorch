We were just waiting for robots to start reproducing before we gave over the future of humanity to these beings,and while this might be a mere simulated pregnancy for med students to practice on, it seems close enough to us. Therobot, named Noelle, is a life-sized blond mannequin that costs $20,000 and simulates the pertinent vital signs andexports of a pregnant woman, including blood, urine and a baby. Even the baby simulates vital signs, and can changecolors from pink to blue to signify oxygen deficiency. A human controller can initiate different complications, or justsit back as the robot runs through its program of baby ejection. The bot is starting to be used med schools andmaternity wards across the country, and simpler versions have even seen action in Afghanistan for training.
