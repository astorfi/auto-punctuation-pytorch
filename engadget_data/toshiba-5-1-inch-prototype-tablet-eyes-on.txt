The company had another prototype, one that we couldn't convince them to take out of its glass case, that's not unlike the Intel MID that was floating around back in 2008 and 2009. It's sporting a 21:9 screen in a Galaxy Note-class 5.1-inch size. The bottom of the phablet is home to the microUSB and HDMI ports, while all the physical buttons are on the right side, though, they're oddly positioned near the bottom of the device. One of the three keys is clearly the volume rocker and one is presumably the lock/power, but we're not entirely sure what the other is for. Check out the gallery below and, if we can convince them to open up the case, we'll return with more hands-on impression.
