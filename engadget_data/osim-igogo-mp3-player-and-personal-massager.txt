See, the iGoGo brings 128MB of on-board flash, MMC memory expansion, and two RF-controlled wireless massager units which knead the beat into your muscle. Yeah, it won't regrow teeth, but at least they throw in a few extra pairs of hydro gel pads just in case youGooGoo, dig? And if you're feeling fine now don't worry, the $404 price tag will certainly generate some spasms in need of a rub. [Thanks, spa_lover]
