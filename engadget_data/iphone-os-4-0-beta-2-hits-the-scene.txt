Considering that our units have seemingly gotten buggier over time the longer they've had beta 1 loaded, we've got high hopes for this one -- hopes that stand a very real chance of being crushed, of course, as long as this isn't a gold build. Guess we're still months off from that, huh? Stay tuned for a report of anything that's changed, new, awesome, or lame.
