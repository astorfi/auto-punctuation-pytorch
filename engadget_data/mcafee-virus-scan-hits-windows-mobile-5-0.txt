 Windows Mobile users worried about viruses and other nastiness invading their precious little devices now have another weapon in their arsenal, with McAfee releasing it's VirusScan Mobile software for Windows Mobile 5.0. Available in both standard and Enterprise editions, it'll ward off viruses, worms, trojans, and other attacks, including what some (but not many) refer to as "SMiShing", or phishing scams attempted via SMS, and it'll stop 'em at all corners, including WiFi and Bluetooth. A free 30-day trial's available now for direct download to your device from McAfee's mobile website, with the standard version running you $29.99 for a one-year subscription.[Via Geekzone]
