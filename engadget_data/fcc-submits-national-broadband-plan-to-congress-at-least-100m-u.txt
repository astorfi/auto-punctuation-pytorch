There's a lot to go through -- note the calls for broadband benchmarking and pricing reports -- and we're still combing, but here's what we've noticed so far. The six goals set out for "the next decade" propose that every American have the affordable access (the key, oft-repeated phrase) to "robust broadband services," and, more specifically, at least 100 million US homes with affordable access to at least 100MBps down / 50Mbps up speeds. All communities should have at their disposal 1Gbps service, every first responder should have "access to a nationwide, wireless interoperable broadband public safety network," and here's an interesting one: every citizen should be able to use broadband to "track and manage real-time [home] energy consumption." 

The appeal to our taxpaying wallets comes in the form of the FCC expecting the "vast majority of recommendations [to] not require new government funding", and that the 500MHz of spectrum going on auction is "likely to offset the potential costs." The plan, as the paper itself says, is in beta and be perennially in flux. Set aside 15 minutes of your day and hit up the PDF for all the details, or 25 if you're having to download over dial-up.

Update: Here's a friendly reminder to keep the discussion friendly and on topic -- that is, about the broadband proposal itself. All other comments will get deleted and the respective users run the risk of being banned.
