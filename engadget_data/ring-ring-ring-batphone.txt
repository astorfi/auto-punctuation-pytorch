Definitely not the amazing new Christopher Nolan retelling, we're talking original campy-ass 60s Batman. We're not sure what kind of person would spend $112 on a novelty landline-phone with no way to dial out (probably the same people that bought the $300 Shakespeare bust back in the day), but buy it fast, we heard the mayor of Quahog, Rhode Island is filing suit.
