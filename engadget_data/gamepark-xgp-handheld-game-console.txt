Gamepark is a company that apparently only releases products that are
anagrams involving the letters G, P, and X, for on the
heels of their GPX2 media player comes the XGP game
console. It looks a little bit like the bastard child of a
PSP and a
Sidekick, so if you happen to own both of those
devices, you might consider breeding them and seeing if you can make one of these.
