In a post on the Zune Scene message boards, "mszunefan" says that he'll be making the trip on July 5th, during which he'll do an interview for Microsoft's Channel 10 and then meet his heroes: a no doubt slightly unnerved Zune team. We have to say we're kinda glad that Microsoft stepped in when it did, there's no telling where the next tattoo might have ended up.[Via Zune Boards, thanks Mike]
