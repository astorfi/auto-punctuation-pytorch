The camera is reportedly packing goodies like a massive 36 megapixel sensor capable of 7360 × 4912 resolution, and an ISO range of 100 to 6,400 that's pushable to 25,600. Furthermore, you can expect to find the same 51-point AF system found in the D3s, slots for SD and CF cards, USB 3.0 connectivity and over three-inches of display on back -- all while being "smaller and lighter" than the current D700. Notably, Nikon is apparently stepping up its DSLR video chops with this cam as well, as it's said to be capable of filming 1080p HD video at 30 fps, while 720p grants you up to 60 fps. Of course, this type of primo kit won't come cheap -- if it all proves true you can expect to slap down roughly $3,900 (¥300,000) to make one yours, although, a release date is still anyone's guess. You'll find another shot of this purported beauty after the break and the full rumor rundown at the source link below.
