 Two days ago, Mozilla CEO Gary Kovacs reinforced what we already knew: Firefox OS will launch in four to five countries in Europe and South America by summer. Today, a newsletter from Spanish e-retailer Geeksphone fills in a few more details. According to the email, the Keon and Peak smartphones we saw at MWC will hit its site next week -- albeit as developer preview units. Still, Geeksphone says the two handsets "will be available for dispatch anywhere on earth." The lower-end Keon will cost €91 plus taxes, while the mid-range Peak will set you back €149.
