Chipset developer Metalink has announced what the company says
is an 802.11n-compliant chipset that can achieve speeds of 240 Mbps (of course, since 802.11n technically isn't a
standard yet, it's not really compliant). Metalink is marketing the chipset to the home-video industry,
including makers of HDTV sets and DVRs. With any luck, we'll see some real streaming video equipment based on this
sometime next year.
