 In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line.
 Granted, the Garmin Fenix already does decent GPS from your wrist, but there's a limit to what it can accomplish on its basic little LCD. Enter Leikr: a Gorilla Glass beast with a 2-inch, 320 x 240 display that can throw out a wide range of endurance stats simultaneously or switch to a color navigation mode using up to 8GB-worth of onboard OpenStreetMap data. It's designed by former Nokia engineers who claim they've used their mobile skills to make the Leikr catch a quicker GPS signal, connect directly to a cloud-based, Endomondo-integrated exercise portal using WiFi and Linux-based software, and at the same time stick to a smartphone-like 10mm thickness.

 The project's Kickstarter page has just gone live, with early bird deals still available -- at the time of writing, a minimum $229 buy-in is required to lock down a final production Leikr by the summer. That's hardly cheap, but it's not at $400 Fenix proportions either, so take a look at the video after the break and the funding link below (scroll to the bottom of that page for full specs) and then, you know, dwell on it.



 
 Previous project update: Erm, how to put this? The Emukey EK1 box for keyboard and mouse macros hasn't quite hit home with punters, and has only raised $500 out of its $42,000 goal, with 11 days still to run.
