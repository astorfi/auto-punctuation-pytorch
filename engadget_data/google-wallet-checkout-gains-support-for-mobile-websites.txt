 It wasn't long ago that Google Wallet delved into the online payment sphere, but as of today, the Mountain View juggernaut has extended its checkout service to mobile websites. According to Google, 97 percent of mobile shoppers abandon their carts, which is primarily due to the litany of information that needs to be manually entered. Now, when you stumble upon a mobile website that supports Google Wallet checkouts, you'll merely need to click the buy button, enter your login credentials and then complete the order. The immediate downside is the paltry number of outlets that support the service: 1-800-Flowers, Rockport and Five Guys. Then again, we suppose you could have a pretty nice evening with flowers, new shoes and a couple of burgers.
