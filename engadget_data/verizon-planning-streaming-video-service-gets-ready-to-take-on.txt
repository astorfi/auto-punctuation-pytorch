Reports are that the company is in talks with programming partners to provide content for a Netflix-like video service that it could offer to customers not currently covered by its high-speed FiOS network. Obviously, details are scant, and there's no telling when it might actually launch, but you can bet its competitors will be watching closely... and we don't just mean Netflix. Cable and satellite TV providers are already wary of the public embracing cord-cutting -- when one of their own seems to be encouraging the behavior it sets off a lot of alarms.
