 Who's afraid of the Windows 8 tablet crush? Not Gigabyte. According to Mobile Geeks, the company has brought a couple of new tablets to Las Vegas -- the S1185 for regular customers and the businessy S1082 -- in the expectation that they'll make a dent despite intense competition. The more interesting S1185 has a few things going for it, including a 1080p 11.6-inch display, a powerful Ivy Bridge processor (which could admittedly make battery life an issue), a magnetic add-on and 'optical finger navigation' -- something we'll investigate further when it comes to hands-on time. Meanwhile, the S1082 follows a similar format but adds cellular connectivity and the option of a 500GB HDD instead of a smaller SSD. That's all we know for now, but we'll try to track these slates down on the show floor shortly.
