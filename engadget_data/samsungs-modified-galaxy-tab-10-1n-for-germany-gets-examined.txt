  As you may recall from earlier this week, Samsung has started selling a slightly modified version of its Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet in Germany to satisfy a recent court ruling, which deemed the original model a little too Apple-like in some respects. Just how modified is the new 10.1N model? Well, you can thank NewGadgets.de for our first real look at it. As expected, the changes are all found around the edges of the device, including a more pronounced metal lip that creeps further across the bezel, some repositioned speakers, and... that's about it, really. Hit the source link below for some additional hands-on shots, and head on past the break for a video.
