We were mighty impressed to hear that the Army is working on a mobile version of their Tactical High Energy Laser,
which they're using to shoot down incoming rockets, mortar rounds, and artillery shells, but we were a little
disappointed to learn that the THEL, along with the new mobile version (known as the MTHEL) constitute our nation's
only laser weapons. Do we seriously need to get Phillip in there to set things straight?
