       AT&T Palm users: the Centro is definitely on starting next week. We've gotten solid confirmation that next Tuesday (that'd be the 19th, as we heard) will, in fact, be the day Palm's budget handset launches on AT&T. We expect the price should be set at $99, no final word on colors (expect white); we'll check back in next week at launch time.
