 It looks like some of the hottest MWC action won't take place in the same country -- or even in the same week, for that matter. HTC has confirmed that it will be holding a press event in New York on the 19th of February, which is a few days before the majority of MWC companies hold their press conferences. At the time of this post, we believe this will be the company's new flagship phone (currently rumored to be called the M7). We've also received official confirmation that an event will be held in London as well. Regardless of where they're held, we'll be there to get you the info on the latest and greatest from HTC!
