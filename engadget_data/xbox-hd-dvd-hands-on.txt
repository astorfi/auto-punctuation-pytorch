We're already all well aware of what it can and can't do; we just know you want the pics of the unboxing, it sitting next to the Xbox, and maybe a few bonus shots next to a real life HD DVD player. Hell, we'll even throw in some pics of it next to the competition (you know what we're talking about). Click on, enjoy!
      

 

Ah, that familiar sight.There we go, that's what we were looking for.The back.The top, sorta.Crack that one open, too!Remote! Adapter! USB cable!Stacked up on top.The hardware in the box, unpacked.Okay! Now, we're SO not taking responsibility for that sticker up on the back. Normally we just leave stickers on while photographing (unless it's on the facade, like that white one) but for whatever reason our unit came with the remnants of some badge, torn off and sticky gross, unable to be removed. We'd assume your retail unit probably won't have the same issue.Flipped.USB ports and WiFi adapter groove.Facade sticker removed.Ruh roh!That's a big HD DVD player. The shot we know you've been waiting for.
