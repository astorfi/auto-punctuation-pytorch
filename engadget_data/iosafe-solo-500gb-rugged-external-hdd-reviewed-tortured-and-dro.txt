The hardy woodsmen over at TestFreaks have taken ioSafe at its word and run a 500GB version through the paces. Running it through the benchmarks, they found that the Solo holds up very well when compared with similar makes with regards to speed and performance -- it gets the job done, if you will. Transfer rates were a bit slower when put up against a Seagate BlackArmor WS110 -- but not enough to be terribly disappointing. The real fun, of course, comes with the drowning of the poor little hard drive. Now, we don't want to give anything away, but we'll say this: watch the video (which is after the break) all the way to the end when the protector of Camp Crystal Lake makes a stunning, shocking performance. Hit the read link for the full review, a ton of photos, and even more video.
