The folks over at Pocket-Lint noticed the event on HTC's Facebook page today, where the manufacturer posted an open invitation for the public to "come party" and "see what's next." At this point, it's hard to tell whether or not HTC will actually unveil anything in the way of new hardware, though there have been rumors swirling around a possible September release date for its Ruby and Bliss handsets, coupled with leaks of its forthcoming Puccini tablet. Plus, as Pocket-Lint observes, HTC's last public meetup came in the wake of the Sensation's release, so recent history suggests there may be something afoot this time, as well. We'll have to wait and see how it all shakes out, but you can hit up the source link for more information on attending the event, which is open on a first-come, first-served basis.
