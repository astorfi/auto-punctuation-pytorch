Obviously aimed at the likes of Dell's Mini 12, this larger-than-usual netbook still packs the all-too-familiar suite of "netbook internals," but that doesn't mean it can't look pretty being average. The relocated VGA port is sure to become this unit's signature (or... something), right beside the sleek overall appearance and nicely spaced keyboard. If we didn't know any better, we'd say we see a little X-Slim in here -- right? One more look after the break, or you can opt for a boatload down in the read link.
