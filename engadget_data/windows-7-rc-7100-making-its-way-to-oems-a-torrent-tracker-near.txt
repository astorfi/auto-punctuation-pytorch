Apparently build 7100 has made it into the wild, complete with release candidate plumage and naturally rapid dissemination. Word has it that this could be the RC version Microsoft is planning to release to its MSDN / TechNet subscribers on May 5th, but we'll have to wait until next month to find out for certain sure. The less scrupulous among us should have no trouble tracking down RC 7100 in the meantime.[Via ITavisen]Read - DailyTechRead - SevenForums
