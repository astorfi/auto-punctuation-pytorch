The whole machine's decked in a ThinkPad-esque soft touch finish, and has the same rugged feeling, with magnesium and a seemingly higher quality build than you're normally likely to find in most other Dells.
The capacitive touchscreen worked really well, was nearly flush with the bezel, and, not surprisingly, instantly made us never want to go back to resistive touchscreen tablets.
The hinge is unidirectional and feels really sturdy.
It only has one speaker, so don't expect stereo audio out of the thing. The wireless on/off switch is much appreciated though, as is the SD slot.
The extended battery "slice" / platform add-on doubles your running time, although we're not entirely sure how it hurts heat since it covers the fan intake.
A base price $2500 is too much. We're sorry, we know this machine is pretty rad, but it's true. For a grand less you can snag an X61 with more power, and, we'd wager, more of that ThinkPad ruggedness. Ordinary consumers -- even many businesses -- will not pay that kind of a premium for this machine.
