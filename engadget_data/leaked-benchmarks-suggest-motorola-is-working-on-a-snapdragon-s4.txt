And we're glad that you do decided to dabble, hypothetical engineer, because we can pore over those numbers for a glimpse at what's coming next. According to benchmarks discovered by Blog of Mobile, Motorola might be looking to move on from the Texas Instrument chipsets it's used in the past. In the purported system details included with the benchmark results, the Ice Cream Sandwich-decked phone houses a 1.5GHz MSM8960 chip -- that's Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4. Could these be more details on a possible RAZR HD -- even an Atrix 3? Unfortunately, more concrete information remains scant. The repeated mention of Qinara, however, tallies with Motorola's XT928, China Telecom's version of the Motorola RAZR released last year, codenamed Dinara. (So, would that be Q for Qualcomm?) If, according to the leak, the device does use a 720p display alongside the aforementioned dual-core processor, it would find itself up against HTC's One X, which packs the same Snapdragon S4 hardware in its AT&T guise. Hopefully, Motorola is making some similarly lofty efforts with its hardware design to ensure we've got yet another phone to get excited about.
