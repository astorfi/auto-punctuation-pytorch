Okay, okay, we all get it: the Galaxy S 4 looks a lot like last year's model. But there are of course some differences, most notably on the inside, where the phone steps up to either an Exynos 5 or Snapdragon chip, depending on the region. As is our way, we've combed the spec sheets for both models to see exactly what's changed this time around. So, phone snobs, have at it!
