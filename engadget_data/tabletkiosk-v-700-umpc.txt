Don't tell us you thought the Samsung, Asus and Founder UMPCs we checked out earlier this week were the only ones out there.Like it or not, the UMPC is now a real product category (at least for now), and that means we're going to see more ofthese little boxes coming out over the next few months (though at least they won't be accompanied by cryptic, annoying,overblown hype campaigns). Like this one, from TabletKiosk, acompany known for, yes, PCs designed for use as tablets or in kiosks. The company's entry to the UMPC market is theV-700, with specs that look consistent with the other UMPC's we've seen (though this one doesn't have an Intelprocessor): VIAÂ  C7M at 1GHz, max RAM of 1GB, 2.5-inch HDD up to 160GB, 7-inch 800x480 display, and the standardarray of buttons (and, of course, no specifics about pricing and battery life, the two most closely held secrets inUMPC-land). In fact, if you look closely at it, you'll see that the V-700 is one of the boxes that we saw afew days ago, back when the hype machine was in full swing. Of course, it didn't have any branding (and current picsstill don't). But it's nice to see that at least some of those pics were real, rather than Photoshop projects frompeople with way too much time on their hands.[Thanks, Rob]
