Nokia announced the 9300 today, and as we suspected it looks nothing like that
"mock-up" we couldn't resist posting earlier. What it
does look like is a smaller, thinner 9500. In fact it basically is exactly like 9500 minus the camera and the Wi-Fi.
The 9300 is packed with a massive 80 Megs of memory and an addition 128 MB MMC card. It has Bluetooth and IR, plus the
pop port thingy. There's a 128 x 128 screen with series 40 on the outside, and a 640 x 200 65k color screen running
series 80 (version 2, like on the 9500) inside. The phone part is 900 / 1800 / 1900 GSM with GPRS, EDGE, and HSCSD for
data. Update: Nokia will grace North America with an 850 / 1800/ 1900 "B" version in the same time
frame as the Euro model, which is - wait for it - early next year. Why must phone companies torture us like this?
