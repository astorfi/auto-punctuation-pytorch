When it rains, it pours -- on top of its Galaxy Note Edge announcement, AT&T has unveiled launch plans for no less than six smart devices that should reach stores by November 7th. It'll be a particularly big day for HTC fans, who'll get the Desire Eye ($150 on contract, $550 off), One (M8) for Windows ($200/$670) and RE camera ($199 contract-free). And that's just the start. The previously promised Lumia 830 will arrive at the same time, costing $100 on contract and $450 up front; you'll get a free Fitbit Flex activity tracker with the Windows Phone if you act quickly. Meanwhile, smartwatch lovers will like that both LG's G Watch R and Motorola's Moto 360 will go on sale for respective prices of $299 and $249. That's a lot of release info to digest, but it's hard to complain too much about getting so many gadgets in one day.
