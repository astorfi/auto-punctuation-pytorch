 In our quest to remove wires and dust bunnies frombehind our HDTV sets, we stumbled across Radiospire, a company touting a wireless HDMI solution. Don't yank the cables out of your set just yet; the currentiteration of their chipset supports transmissions up to 15-feet only, but it's a start. Better yet, the transfer rateis up to 3 Gbps, so according to the company, there's no need to compress your data. With full HDCP support andresolutions of 720p, 1080i and 1080p, this sounds like a viable product to remove that clutter of cables in the future.
