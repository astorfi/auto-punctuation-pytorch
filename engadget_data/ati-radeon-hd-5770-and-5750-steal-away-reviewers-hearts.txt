 
The ATI onslaught of 40nm DirectX 11 parts continues today with two even cheaper variants coming from its Evergreen family of chips. Based on the Juniper core, the HD 5770 and 5750 represent ATI's mainstream value proposition, with compute performance of more than 1 TFLOPS and pricing between $109 and $159. There's a significant dropoff in specs from the world-conquering HD 5870 and similarly potent HD 5850, but reviewers found the latest cards were still up to the task, with the 5770's performance said to be "just shy" of the very recent top dog for ATI, the HD 4890. With low power consumption, competitive pricing and added features like Eyefinity and 7.1 HD audio, the new cards might not push performance boundaries, but they also leave you with little reason to look elsewhere for your next GPU purchase.
