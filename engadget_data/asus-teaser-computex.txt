ASUS has a habit of teasing products and it has done it again with a photo of this spun metal... thing. Posted on the company's G+ page as a Computex taster, the picture is accompanied by a puzzlingly vague hint that the new device will "move you." But unless we're about to see an automotive or fitness accessory, we won't get too excited -- after all, it could just be another disc writer.
