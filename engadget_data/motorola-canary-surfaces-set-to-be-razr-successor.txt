Just vague rumblings of specs so far, such as a 1.3 megapixel camera, Bluetooth, and a microSD slot, but we can confirm that the picture is a real shot of a forthcoming Moto device. Whether this "Glass Phone" will be the rumored "RAZR 2" or whatever is hard to tell, but we'll be keeping an eye out for it for sure.
