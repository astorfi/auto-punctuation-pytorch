Reuters notices a trend about digital cameras that's been pretty obvious for a long time now: that megapixels are
becoming less and less relevant (after a certain point, most people can't tell the difference, espcially if you're not
making prints) and that stuff like ease of use, thinness, performance, lens quality, etc are becoming more and more
important to people. We're lusting after Sony's ultrathin five megapixel DSC-T11 ourselves.
