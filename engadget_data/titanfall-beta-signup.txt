Titanfall has become something bigger than a multiplayer mech game. It's the reason many people decided to invest in an Xbox One, and the reason why many others decided to postpone their next-gen console purchase altogether -- the finished title won't arrive until March 11th, and it's coming to the PC and 360 (360 is slightly delayed until March 25th) too. In the meantime though, the developer behind Titanfall, Respawn Entertainment, is providing early access via a beta and you can sign up for access starting tonight at 9PM ET. The good news is that you don't need to pre-order the game to get in, but the bad news is that it's not open to all, so we don't know how many slots there are to go around. Go ahead and try your luck at the sign-up page -- we'll let you know the URL once it's posted "shortly before" 9PM ET, according to Respawn founder Vince Zampella.


Update: The beta sign-up page is live a bit early, interested Xbox One and PC (with an EA Origin account) gamers can apply here (protip: The USA is actually near the top of the country list, not all the way at the bottom). The accompanying FAQ answers a few questions you might have about the beta. There's no Xbox 360 beta planned, once the game is installed on an Xbox One any user on that console can play it, and the beta is available to gamers around the world, although all text will be in English. If you weren't first to sign up don't worry, it doesn't appear to be first-come, first- served. Sign-ups close on the 14th at 7PM ET, and those admitted will be notified via email by midnight pacific time on February 17th.


Update 2: EA has sent out a quick press release advertising the beta and dispensing a few more details, specifically the start date: February 14th. It also details the game modes available to testers, named Attrition, Hardpoint Domination and Last Titan standing -- essentially Team Deathmatch, a control point capture mode and variant on Team Deathmatch that ends when all of a team's Titans are destroyed.



Tonight at 6pm PST there will be a website to sign up for #titanfall beta access. The website will be announced shortly before 6.
