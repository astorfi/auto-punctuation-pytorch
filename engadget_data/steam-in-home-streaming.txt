It has been in beta since mid-November, but Steam's In-Home Streaming is now available to all. Folks who have a fleet of computers at home can link 'em up and then remotely install and play PC games just like you were sitting at your desk. As you might expect, this also enables access to titles on machines running other OSes -- like OS X, Linux and SteamOS, of course. You'll still have to wait a bit to nab up a Steam Machine, but if you're champing at the bit to give it a go, all the info you'll need to get start awaits via that source link.
