 Not even the firsttime we've seen it done, but you've got to give it up for Charleston, West Virginia -- a state heralded for itsrampant obesity problem -- which went from study to practice in using Dance Dance Revolution to work that body. Lastyear 85 kids participated in a survey that used Dance Dance Revolution and diet changes to shed excess poundage, whichapparently also went to the heads of the school administration of the state, since started a pilot program and are nowrolling DDR out to all of West VA's 157 middle schools, in addition to another 753 public schools expecting it in thenext three years. Take thatCalifornia; just remember not to overdo it,ok kids? Safety first. Oh, and that sound you just heard? The owners of hundreds of West Virginian arcades crying outin agony.[Via TheGuardian]
