 Here's a question for our British readers: does itbother you at all that your government is spending your tax quid on outfitting each berth in the Royal Navy's six new,Â£6 billion Type 45 Destroyers with iPod docks andsurround sound (along with CD players and Internet access, but hey, those are obvious necessities)? The first of thesenew warship-cum-luxury-liners, the HMS Daring (the others are the Dauntless, Diamond, Defender, Dragon, and Duncan),left her dry dock in Glasgow today with a ceremonial send-off, complete with confetti and missle-firings. Unfortunatelyfor the people on shore waving and watching for their loved ones, most of the crew immediately headed below deck totheir mini-apartments, cranked up the Spice Girls, and began applying some bronzer in anticipation of their firstparty destination assignment.[Via GigaOm]
