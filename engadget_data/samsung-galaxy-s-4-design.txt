 In case you missed it, Samsung released a new phone over the weekend and now the company's put together a quick video describing the design notions behind its Galaxy S 4. Expect to hear the word "intuitive" a fair few times, mostly in regard to those new software features and a return of those nature-inspired design licks. Samsung adds that it's has also cranked up the attention to detail on the hardware design, in search of the "perfect line" for its new flagship, though we're not exactly sure if it can be both "unlike anything you've ever seen before" and "not a radical difference, but more an evolution," as mentioned in the clip. Take in some sun-kissed vistas and the chilled-out soundtrack right after the break.
