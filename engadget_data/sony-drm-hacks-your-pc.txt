You probably already know that Sony BMG has started selling at least some CDs that include
built-in copy-protection, making it difficult to play the
CDs on a computer using any media player other than the one bundled on the CD, and limiting the number of copies you
can make. But it turns out that, behind the scenes, Sony may also be installing invisible services in the form of a
hidden directory containing cloaked files, which run when you use that media player. Mark Russinovich of SysInternals
did a detailed analysis of a "rootkit" (their word, not ours) he found on his PC, and discovered that, not only was it
surreptitiously installed when he played a protected CD, but it also hogged system resources and integrated itself into
Windows so deeply that uninstalling it disabled his CD drive. Mark's conclusion? Choice words such as "frustrating and
irritating," "malware," and "the software is poorly written and provides no means for uninstall." Yowch. Sony, you want
to respond? (Though, Mark, seriously: Van Zant?)
