 While some have declared 3D dead, Chinese electronics firm Gadmei doesn't appear to have received the memo. Cruising the outskirts of the Las Vegas Convention Center, we came across the company's forthcoming glasses-free 3D HD Pad. The device packs an 8.1-inch 1,280 x 800 display, a 1.5GHz Cortex-A9 processor, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of internal storage, a 5,000 mAh battery and Android 4.2. Sure, these specs aren't much to gawk at, but the real draw here is the tablet's display-altering software that allows users to toggle between 2D and 3D viewing on select applications.

 Entering this demonstration with skepticism, we must say that we were pleasantly surprised with the 3D HD Pad's visual effects. Somewhat reminiscent of using a Nintendo 3DS, viewing angles were limited, but once we found a sweet spot we were good to go. The tablet's 3D capabilities would likely be most effective resting against some type of stand. Visual gimmicks aside, the device has a solid build quality and Jelly Bean ran fairly smooth on its modest hardware.



 As it stands, Gadmei has yet to iron out a plan to bring its new slab to US consumers. If in fact the tablet never sees a stateside debut, we'll always have fond memories of glasses-free 3D and the sour but sweet smell of CES' showroom floor. Thanks for the memories Gadmei.
