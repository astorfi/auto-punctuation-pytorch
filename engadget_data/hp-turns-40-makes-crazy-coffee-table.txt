Misto, as it's known, developed by HP Labs, is basically a large touchscreen table thatallows groups of fawning nerds to gather 'round to share pictures, play games, and occasionally spoil everyone else'sfun byÂ  "accidentally" putting down their coaster at just the wrong moment. Apparently HP's actuallyshooting for commercial release by Thanksgiving of this year; here's to hoping they make it multi-touchcapable.
