The full package also comes with a hardshell carrying case that doubles as a stand, and less impacting on the gameplay itself, a Jay-Z / Eminem two-CD collection with unreleased tracks and a collectible case designed by Shepard Fairey. No word on price, but if that rumored $120 tag for the standard edition pans out, you can expect to be paying a prettier penny here. Browse the new gear, including the Wii version of the standard turntable, in the gallery below.
