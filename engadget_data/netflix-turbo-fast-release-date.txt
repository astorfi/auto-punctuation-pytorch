You remember when that ironically titled film Turbo came out this past summer? The one about the snails (thus the irony)? Apparently it was popular enough to warrant an exclusive animated series on Netflix -- the streaming service's first such investment -- and it becomes available on Christmas Eve. Just in time to distract the little ones while you're gorging on nog!


On December 24th, the first five episodes of Turbo FAST go live on Netflix in the US, Canada, Ireland, Latin America and the UK, while the rest of the season will go live at unnamed intervals during 2014. As such, we'd suggest meting out those first five episodes sparingly, lest the little ones demand more before more are available.
