Cologne, Germany's biennial photo extravaganza is absolutely massive in comparison to Japan's up-and-coming CP+, which admittedly promised a bit more excitement in 2012, but local enthusiasts seem to have come out in droves for this week's show here in Yokohama, likely motivated by an opportunity to check out models that first appeared earlier this month at CES. Still, CP+ is the most prominent camera trade show in Asia, and considering Japan's role in the digital imaging space, it's not to be overlooked. While we're here, we'll be checking out a handful of point-and-shoots from Canon, Nikon, Pentax and Olympus, just to name a few, perhaps joined by a surprise gadget or two.

 Protip: Follow CP+ through our event hub to catch the abundance of hands-ons, posted throughout the week.
