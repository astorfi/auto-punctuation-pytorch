Better yet, French forum lesDelliens proclaims to have the specs on not only the 1520, 1521, 1720, and 1721 already churning in the rumor mill, but also on a new 14.1-inch 1420. Everything certainly looks kosher but you'll have to judge for yourselves. Click-through for a glimpse at the purported specifications (via machine translated French) or just click into the gallery below. Mmm, so many pretty pictures.





The 1720 and 1721 appear to be just what we heard: Santa Rosa-based Intel and AMD machines, respectively. The 1720 maxes out with a 2.2GHz Core 2 Duo T7500, a 17-inch WUXGA TrueLife display, 256MB of GeForce 8600M WP graphics, up to 2x 2.5-inch SATA disk with RAID 0/1 support (!), 802.11n and Gigabit Ethernet, a whole mess of inputs and output and USB-only docking station. The 1520 packs much the same only with a 15.4-inch WSXGA+ TrueLife display and what appears to be a hybrid hard drive option and Blu-ray disc drive which is likely available for the 17-inch as well. the 5.5-pound 1420 offers a 9-cell Lithium Ion battery option and the same HHD option only under a smaller 14.4-inch WXGA+ TrueLife display. Hey, that's what the forum peeps are saying.[Thanks, James]Read - specsRead - pics
