That whole Yahoo buying Tumblr thing? That's a done deal. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer took to Yahoo's Tumblr account -- meta! -- to announce her excitement at the deal's close. "Today is an incredibly exciting day for Yahoo! and Tumblr," Mayer said. She reconfirmed Yahoo's commitment to running Tumblr as a separate entity, and announced a whole mess of new Tumblrs dedicated to various capacities of Yahoo (Search, Messenger, Mail, Sports, Answers and Flickr). There's even a GIF containing the fairly amazing image seen above. Head below for the full letter of celebration from Mayer herself.

By Marissa Mayer, Yahoo! CEO

We're excited to announce that our deal to acquire Tumblr has closed... it's official!

As promised, Tumblr will continue to operate as a separate business, led by David Karp as CEO. Their product roadmap, their team, and tone will all remain the same as will their mission to empower creators and curators alike to do what they love best: create.

David and his team are redefining creative expression online, and we can't wait to see what they come up with next.

In celebration, we've given this blog a bit of a facelift thanks to Jonathan Moore from Style Hatch, and we've brought along some of our friends, too - you can now follow the Search, Messenger, Mail, Sports, Answers and Flickr teams on Tumblr.

Today is an incredibly exciting day for Yahoo! and Tumblr, and I'm thrilled to officially welcome David and the team to Yahoo!.
