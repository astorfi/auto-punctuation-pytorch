 
Acer's announcing a ton of new gear right now (we're live at the event in a New Jersey IMAX theater, of all places) and the hottest new products so far are the new Aspire Timeline laptops. Hard specs are a little light at the moment, but what we do know sounds pretty great: 13.3, 14.1 and 15.6-inch LED-backlit 16:9 screens in a one-inch thick chassis, Intel ULV processors, multitouch touchpads, HDMI and S/PDIF out, and eight hours of battery life -- 10 hours with an SSD. The real killer is pricing, however: $699 to $899. Ouch -- poor Adamo. We're still at the event, but we'll be trying to get as much info on these as we can, stay tuned.Update: We got some more detailed specs, and things are still looking good -- like, built-in WiMAX good. The processors will be ULV Core 2 Duos, and the 13.3-inch model will weigh 3.5 pounds while the 15.6-incher will tip in at 5.3 pounds. RAM is DDR3 and drives top out at 500GB spinners and 64GB SSD. We're angling for clock speeds, we'll let you know when we go hands-on
