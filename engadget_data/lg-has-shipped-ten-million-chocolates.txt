 LG has something to celebrate with the announcement that it has shipped its ten millionth Chocolate phone; this monumental bit of sales and marketing was accomplished 18 months after its intro in Korea and 11 months after hitting global markets. To celebrate the event, LG is handing out free handsets to anybody who hits the Chocolate page in the next hour (ok, that is a huge lie, but it would be totally cool). Everybody put their hands together for LG and wish them continued success and hope that they can repeat that choco-licious love with the Shine.
