We're a bit low on deets, but while we don't know what kind of OS this thing'll run (there's a Windows key on the keyboard, for what it's worth), it does boast Internet browsing, instant messaging and email. Media capabilities are also here in force, with the included video conferencing, PMP functions, FM radio, 2 megapixel camera and IPTV. We're spotting at least SD expansion, but we don't expect too much more than WiBro connectivity with the slimness of this device -- though we'd love to be proved wrong. SODIFF is hoping for a November release, for Korea of course.
