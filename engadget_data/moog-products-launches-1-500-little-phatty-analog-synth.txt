 Musicians everywhere have reason to celebratetoday -- Moog Products has justannounced a portable analog synthsethizer, which pays tribute to the company's founder, and perhaps just asimportantly, will finally bring professional quality synths down to prices that amateurs can afford. Music Thing's TomWhitwell had told us to be on the lookout fora new product from Moog -- the first one following Bob Moog's untimely death from abrain tumor -- and although the legend might not approve of calling this tribute edition "Little Phatty," hewould certainly appreciate the style and reasonable $1,475 price tag. The Little Phatty features a 37-note keyboard, 2ultra-stable oscillators, a Moog low pass ladder filter, and 4-stage analog envelope generators, all wrapped up in anattractive package. Initially Moog Products will only be releasing 1,200 special edition LIttle Phattys, which comewith decorative side panels, the signature plate that you see above, a CD-ROM of the Bob MoogMemorial Celebration Service, and a special poster for your studio to inspire you as you lay down those crazyelectronic tracks.[Thanks, James G]
