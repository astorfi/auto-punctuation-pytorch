Bearing a Vodafone logo on its posterior, it seems safe to say that the smartphone (codenamed "Norman" of all things -- though the original Q's "Franklin" wasn't any better) is destined for Europe; whether it'll make the jump to US shores remains unknown, but we'd love to see this monster live to do battle against the i607 "Blackjack" on Cingular in the coming months. The Norman's spec sheet is mostly speculation at this point, but besides support for UMTS and HSDPA, it'll rock a flattened keyboard (directly addressing a major complaint of the original) and a 2 megapixel cam. If we close our eyes and click our heels together three times, it might pack WiFi too -- but no promises.[Via the::unwired, thanks Gwailo00852]
