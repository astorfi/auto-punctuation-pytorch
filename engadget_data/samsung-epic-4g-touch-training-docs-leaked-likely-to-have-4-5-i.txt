This time, we have a new piece of 411 about the Epic 4G Touch, Sprint's weapon of choice. According to leaked training documents that surfaced today, it appears the device will match the Hercules in screen size, receiving a healthy bump up to a 4.52-inch Super AMOLED Plus display. True or not, we don't have much longer to wait before Sammy lets us in on all of the secrets these three Galaxy S II models have been keeping for so long.
