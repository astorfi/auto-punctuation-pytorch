Enter their latest broadband offerings announcements; while effectively separate from Homezone, they mirror its hodge podge effect in the area of low-cost internet access. AT&T intends to begin servicing those narrower banded of individuals with WildBlue provided satellite internet access starting this month with rates between $50 and $80 for up to 1.5Mbps / 256Kbps service; they announced rolling out fiber to the home (FTTH -- aka AT&T's Project Lightspeed) to another 5.5 million low income houses in 41 markets, perhaps because as we all know it has the most amazing cost-per-megabit metric of any consumer service; and finally complementing their currently existing fixed-wireless rollouts in Jersey, Georgia, and Alaska with more WiMAX to light up soon in Nevada and Texas starting at $40 a month. By this time next year AT&T apparently hopes to be serving you cellular, 3G, home phone, ADSL, sat television and net, FTTH, IPTV, and WiMAX. We forget anything, AT&T, or are we clear for now? You want people to have options, we get it, we get it.[Via GigaOM]
