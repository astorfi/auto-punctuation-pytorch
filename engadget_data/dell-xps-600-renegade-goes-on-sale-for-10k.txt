If you're prepared to spendclose to $10,000, that is ($9,930, to be precise). So, what do you get for that price, other than the dubious ability toboast that you spent ten grand on a Dell, dude? For starters, it's got NVIDIA Quad-SLI graphics and an overclockedPentium 965 Extreme Edition running at 4.26 GHz. Dell is also throwing in their 30-inch 3007WFP display, which regularly goes for $2,199, makingthis a veritable bargain! Well, maybe not. But, hey, there's always that paint job, right? That's gotta be worthsomething.
