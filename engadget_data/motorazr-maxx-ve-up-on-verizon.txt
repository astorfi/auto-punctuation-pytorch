 We knew that today was the day, now sho'nuff Motorola's MOTORAZR maxx Ve is up and jumpin' on Verizon. A two year contract nabs $199.99 (after $50 on-line discount) worth of touch-sensitive controls, 2 megapixel camera, stereo Bluetooth, and the option to lap up all the V CAST music and video you can stuff into microSD expansion. Now giddy up childrens, your EV-DO ride awaits.[Thanks Mark G. and mistakrazy]
