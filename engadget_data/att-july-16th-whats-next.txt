AT&T is attempting to cater to the Boy / Girl Scout in each of us: the carrier wants us to be prepared for what's coming. What this particular piece of news is, we're not quite certain, but it's apparently something AT&T is rather proud of. Beneath the teaser, the company boasts quotes from various publications about the strength, speed and expansiveness of its network, which means this is likely related to something in that sphere. Based on that, we're hoping this means we'll hear some promising news about LTE-Advanced; either way, we'll be waiting until July 16th to learn more about what the company has planned.
