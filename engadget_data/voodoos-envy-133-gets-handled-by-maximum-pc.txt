 
The folks over at Maximum PC have gotten themselves a chance to go face-to-face (and tongue-to-laptop) with Voodoo's newest show-off -- the Envy 133 -- and they've shared with the rest of the world. There's not much to say based on these pictures, save that they clearly were stoked to be getting this close to the sexed-up excuse for maxing out a credit card. If you hit the read link, you'll catch a slew of pictures, some size comparisons with a MacBook Pro, and first impressions of what Voodoo's instant-on OS looks and feels like. What are you waiting for? Get!
