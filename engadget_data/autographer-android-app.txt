Having a photojournalist follow us around all day could work out to be pretty expensive, which is why we liked the idea of Autographer's neck-worn lifelogging camera - even if we didn't appreciate the low-fi picture quality. In any case, the device's creators are continuing to improve the product, releasing a companion app on Google Play that opens it up to Android users. The company can't fix the camera's weak sensor, but at least there's an identical set of features to what's on the iOS counterpart.
