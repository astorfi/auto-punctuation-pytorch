 The hardened news hawks over at China Economic News Service would like to hit us up with some knowledge: Palm allegedly plans on outing a CDMA version of its Treo Pro "in the future" for carriers like "Verizon, Wireless [sic] and Sprint." While we wouldn't typically pay an unsubstantiated report like this much mind, Palm does see a lot of love from its CDMA partners -- and we have to believe that both Verizon and Sprint are putting the full-court press on 'em to pony up the goods after seeing how much more attractive the Treo Pro is than Palm kit they're currently able to offer. And don't give us any weak sauce 800w arguments, alright?[Via Brighthand]
