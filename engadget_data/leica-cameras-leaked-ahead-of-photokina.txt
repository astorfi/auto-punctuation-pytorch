 As you may or may not know, Photokina's taking place in Cologne, Germany in a few days, which has caused a plethora of cameras to make an appearance before they're even made official. The latest round of unannounced, leaked shooters brings us a couple of Leicas, including the high-end, LX7-esque compact pictured above and a superzoom that takes a design cue from its smaller sibling. Unfortunately, details like pricing and availability are still at large, but with Photokina right around the corner, it won't be long before we know more about this sleek pair. For now, head past the break to check out an extra pic, where you'll find the larger member of the two posing for the camera -- ironic, huh?
