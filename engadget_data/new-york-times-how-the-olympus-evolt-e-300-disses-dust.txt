The Olympus Evolt E-300 — the
company's first foray into the competitive sub-$1,000 DSLR market — has been getting mixed reviews; DSLR fans have
griped about its (relatively) sluggish speed and (again, relatively) limited autofocus options, and SLR purists have
been put off by its new lens format and flat top. However, one thing that has caught just about everyone's attention is
the camera's unique "Supersonic Wave Filter," which is designed to keep the CCD dust-free. The New York Times has put
together a good guide to the filter and the Evolt in general; be sure to check out the cutaway graphic of the camera's
innards.
