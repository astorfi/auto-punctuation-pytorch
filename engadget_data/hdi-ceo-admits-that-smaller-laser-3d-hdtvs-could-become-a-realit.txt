According to a new interview with HDI CEO Ingemar Jansson, the June ship date for its 103-inch, laser-based monster is still on track, with a $10,000 price tag being placed on it when ordered "in volume." Frankly, there's not much here that we haven't already heard about the new face of 1080p 3D in the home; what is new, however, is the mention that smaller versions could very well be on the horizon. Regardless of whether you're man or woman enough to admit it, a 103-inch set is far too large for the vast majority of homes, so a 46-inch iteration -- which was mentioned specifically in the dialog -- could be a perfect alternative. There was no time table or estimated price given for the smaller version(s), but you can bet we'll be keeping an ear to the ground for more. Oh, and if you don't think an HDTV upstart can give Sony, Sharp and Samsung a run for their money, there's a "Mr. Vizio" in the back room that would like to have a word with you.
