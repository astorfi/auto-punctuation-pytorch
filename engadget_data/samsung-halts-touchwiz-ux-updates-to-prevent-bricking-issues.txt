It's remaining tight-lipped on the subject but it looks to be in response to some users experiencing lagging graphics or bricked devices. When Android Police tweeted Samsung's Carla Saavedra she said "(the update) has been temporarily halted to assess progress & ensure it's a positive experience for customers" and said regular service would "resume shortly" but "no specifics were given." We'll keep our eyes on this one, but in the meantime you can read the torrid exchange after the break.
