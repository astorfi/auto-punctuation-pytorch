Starting today, Dell's UltraSharp U2711 27-inch display is now on sale in the Americas and Asia (and "soon' in Europe). While the $1,099 US price tag might appear steep at first; remember, you're looking at a professional quality WQHD 2,560 x 1,440 pixel IPS panel with 12-bit internal color processing and 1.07 billion color palette. And that pair of DVI-D inputs accompanied by DisplayPort, VGA, composite, component, and HDMI 1.3 jack means that this beast is meant for much more than just sourcing spreadsheets and pie charts. 4x USB slots and an integrated 8-in-1 card reader rounds out what's destined to become an all-purpose hub at the center of your digital life. If you ask us, Dell's got another winner here based on our impressive hands-on experience and rave, early reviews -- don't let its frumpy looks hold you back, ok?
