Scoble had a chance to play around with the only current implementation of the SPOT-based,cellphone-like external display for laptops, the Asus notebook with the 2-inch squareLCD that we've known about since the days when we were still looking forward to "Longhorn" -- ah, how young andnaive we were back then. The 18 minute vid is a nice mix of close-up shots of the separate, always-on computerperforming email, media control, and PIM tasks, along with commentary from the Windows Sideshow Team concerning thearchitecture and consumer/developer possibilities of the system. All-in-all it seems like a pretty neat concept,although frankly we can't see many applications for it beyond what our WM5 smartphones are doing for us right now --readers?[Thanks, Bill E.]
