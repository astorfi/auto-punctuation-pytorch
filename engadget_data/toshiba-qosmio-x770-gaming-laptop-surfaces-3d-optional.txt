In addition to boasting a more metallic enclosure, this one actually shrinks the display from 18.4 inches to a slightly more portable 17.3 inches (still 1920 x 1080), but it expectedly doesn't compromise much in terms of other specs -- the standard config offers a Core i7-2630QM processor, 8GB of RAM, 1.25TB of storage from a pair of hard drives, and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560M graphics. Also available is a separate X770 3D model, which adds a 3D webcam to the equation, along with a pair of active shutter glasses. Look for both to be available in the next few weeks, with prices starting at â‚¬1,300 (or roughly $1,850).
