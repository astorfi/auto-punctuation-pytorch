Here's the latest and greatest in the
Logitech Harmony Universal Remote line —
the 890 supposedly eliminates the need for elaborate setup and macro programming of your setup by doing everything for
you. It uses Smart State Technology to automagically set up your entertainment system (up to 15 devices, including
lighting) when you give it simple activity commands such as "Watch TV" or "Listen to Music," and will turn off whatever
components aren't being used. Sounds good — if there's a "Write blog post" button, we're thinking it's totally worth
the $399.99.
