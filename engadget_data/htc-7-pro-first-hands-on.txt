Sadly, HTC didn't have a working unit (no IMDb demos for you!), but we did get to check out the hardware and its extremely comfortable five-row QWERTY keyboard -- with clicky keys, a dedicated number row, and a properly staggered layout for once. As for the slider mechanism, it's quite sturdy, and we're definitely digging HTC's good old tilt capability, here in its finest iteration yet -- whereas previous devices typically floated the screen somewhere above the keyboard, here the front lip actually sinks into the phone's frame for extra stability and class. That's all we've really got for now as this bad boy won't be hitting Sprint until the first half of 2011, but in the meantime you can check out a quick video of it below.
