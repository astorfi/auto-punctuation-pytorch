Pick a Watch Instantly movie and it shows right up in your Xbox 360 (or any other Netflix-enabled device's) viewing queue. PyxisMobile offers similar functionality in its Smartflix program for those who can't wait until later this month when Microsoft & Netflix's homegrown version becomes available.
