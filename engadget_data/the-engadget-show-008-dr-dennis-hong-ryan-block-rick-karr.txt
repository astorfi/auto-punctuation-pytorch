Josh sits down with the brilliant roboticist Dr. Dennis Hong to chat about his supremely cool yet surprisingly terrifying 'bots, and then take a look at a few models which the professor brought along with him. Correspondent Rick Karr is back to give us the skinny on why the songwriting industry would like net neutrality to be a little less neutral, and Engadget editor emeritus and gdgt founder Ryan Block joins Josh, Paul, and Ross Miller on the roundtable to delve deep into all things newsworthy in tech. We also got to play with the ATI Eyefinity, one of the craziest gaming rigs you'll ever see... and then give it away to one lucky audience member! All that, and music from Neil Voss and visuals from NO CARRIER. Okay that's enough reading... time to watch!
