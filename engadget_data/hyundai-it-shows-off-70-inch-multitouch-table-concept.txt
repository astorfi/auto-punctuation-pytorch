While there's no specs -- apart from the fact that it's "HD" -- Hyundai is apparently saying that you'd be able to use the display either as a Surface-like multitouch table or as a TV, although it's not clear if that means it actually tilts up. Contrary to appearances, however, the table apparently doesn't function as a phone. Here's hoping Hyundai will actually show it off in action once the show gets underway.
