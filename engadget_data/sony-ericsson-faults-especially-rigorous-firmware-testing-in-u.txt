Basically, the company says that getting an update out in the US is way harder than it is elsewhere because of "the technical requirements that must be met" over which Sony Ericsson has "no control." The blame is levied on an "especially rigorous" testing cycle that can (and presumably, often does) take several months, which is why they've thus far refused to offer guidance on when the update will be released. Honestly, is there any way we can trade in our warranty card to get on the fast track with this stuff? And more importantly, would us bleeding-edge types be willing to take that risk on a wide scale?
