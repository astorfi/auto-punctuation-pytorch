 
We'd like to extend a big welcome to Steve Kim, the latest addition to the Engadget HD team. Steve is a home audio nut and we'll be depending on him to round out our home theater coverage. Steve will also be co-hosting the Engadget HD podcast, -- yeah it still exists -- which will be getting back on track very soon; and if all goes as planned will be available on a weekly basis. So help us welcome Steve to the team, speaking of which, we forgot to ask him where he stands on this whole format war thing.
