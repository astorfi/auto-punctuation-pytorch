According to our sources, the Android-based slate is currently in testing, and should be hitting the markets in the not-too-distant future. 'Course, AT&T just started shipping its first two LTE devices, but having something other than a WWAN modem would certainly be appreciated. As for specs? We've confirmed that a 1.5GHz dual-core processor is onboard, alongside 1GB of RAM, Honeycomb, 16GB of storage, an 8 megapixel rear camera and a 10.1-inch WXGA touchpanel. We're digging for more as we speak, and will be updating accordingly. Meanwhile, feel free to peruse the gallery below -- oh, and that "smaller" device? That's the WiFi-only Flyer that we saw soar through the FCC in April. That'll be let loose on US shores next month, and we're sniffing around for a price as we speak.

Update: We've now received a gallery's worth of screenshots from within the device. It's clearly running Android 3.1 with "HTC Sense 1.1 for Tablet." The shots also clarify that Bluetooth 3.0 is included, with a WiFi module capable of handling 802.11a/b/g/n waves. Mmm!
