Unfortunately, the demos were cooked and they were actually using a PS3 playing a DVD to show off BD-Live "running" from an S550, which was kind of cheap to say the least. Still, if ever there were stand-alone Blu-ray players to get excited about -- and a time to get excited about them -- this is it.
