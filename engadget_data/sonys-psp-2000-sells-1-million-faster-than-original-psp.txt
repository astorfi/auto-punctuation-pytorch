That's 1 million sold just in Japan since the slimmer, lighter, more colorful model was introduced on September 20th. Remarkably, that's two weeks faster than it took the original PSP to hit the same milestone after its launch way back in December, 2004. For comparison sake, the PS3 took 8 months to move 1 million units. Things sure seem to be looking up for Sony's fiscal anchor called a game division. [Via Impress]
