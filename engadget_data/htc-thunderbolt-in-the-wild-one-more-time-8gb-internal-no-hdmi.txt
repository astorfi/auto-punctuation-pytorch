That opportunity comes courtesy of AndroidSPIN, who claims that we can expect a 1GHz single-core processor, 8GB of internal storage with microSD expansion, 8 megapixel rear and 1.3 megapixel front cams, Android 2.2.1 with Sense, HTC-customized mapping and nav (probably HTC Locations with offline caching), and DLNA compatibility -- but no built-in HDMI. Every one of those specs was either already expected or believable enough, though the lack of HDMI -- if true -- would still give the EVO 4G some bragging rights more than six months after its release. Score one for longevity, eh?
