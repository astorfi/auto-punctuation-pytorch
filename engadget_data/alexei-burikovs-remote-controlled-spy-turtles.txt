Rogue spy dolphins in the Gulf Coast be damned, head of the biology department at Rostov-on-Don State Pedagogical
University, Alexei Burikov, believes remote-controlled tactical turtles are totally the wave of the future. Apparently
he thinks that by attaching a device that emits vibrations to the animal's shell, one can instruct a turtle where to
go; when paired with a camera and transmitter the turtle can thusly be used for anything from wildlife observation to
covert tactical operations. We just wonder whether he's been studying Alistair Hennessey's moves a little too
closely.
