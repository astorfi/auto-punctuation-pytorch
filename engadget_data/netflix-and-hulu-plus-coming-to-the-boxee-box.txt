There's no timeline on Hulu Plus -- Boxee told us talks have just begun -- but Netflix should be live by the year, and that's a major requirement if Boxee is going to be competitive with the various other connected TV devices on the market. It's also nice to see the Boxee / Hulu relationship finally thaw out, but we'd guess there's no chance regular Hulu will work in the Boxee browser now, and we'd bet the rest of the networks block it just like Google TV as well. That's okay, though -- adding Netflix and Hulu Plus to the Box's insane codec list, Webkit browser with Flash support, and Vudu integration should still make it pretty easy to get anything you want on your TV. Now if only we could get our hands on a review unit.
