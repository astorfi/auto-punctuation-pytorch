Shown off in advance of CEATEC Japan 2011 (an annual electronics trade show), the operator took the wraps off several mobile-based accessories, ranging from gamma ray and UV light monitoring phone cases to a breathalyzer-like add-on for measuring body fat (you paying attention, HTC Rhyme?). There were also a couple of applications on hand for checking photos of food against a calorie database Ã  la Google Goggles, and an AR implementation for weather services on tablets. It's not clear whether the Japanese carrier actually intends to release these innovations to the mass-consuming public, but as with all things tech in that corner of the world, they're sure to get it before we ever do. Jump past the break for a video peek at Nippon's creep towards a Hitchhiker Guide-style wireless world.
