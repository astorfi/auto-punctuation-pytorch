Putting aside the small matter of launching a new Nexus smartphone and Android OS, Google also plans to unveil new Google+ features and improvements. Sources aware of Google's plans tell us that today's media-focused event will include the introduction of Auto Awesome for videos, an expansion of its impressive photo improvement service, which allows users to record video and have Google+ integrate transitions, music and effects with little or no input. We're told that the new video feature is similar to HTC's Video Highlights in that it uses smart editing, cutting and sequencing techniques to splice a professional-like highlight reel using different types of media. While we don't know exactly how these new features operate, Google SVP Vic Gundotra teased today's announcement with the tagline "#momentsthatmatter," suggesting we won't have long to wait to see the new Auto Awesome feature in the flesh.
