 The HD DVD Promotional Group is on the ground at Comic-Con, with the price drop of the Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on and accompanying 5 free disc promotional offer, with more details of content to expect this holiday season. The Heroes: Season 1 HD DVD boxed set will be available August 28, including HDi features exclusive to the high def release, like a web enabled download center, Heroes Abilities Test, picture-in-picture commentary and others. This is Universal's first release to take advantage of HD-DVD's online capabilities, but it won't be the last. The seven disc package has an SRP of $99.98, and as mentioned earlier, Xbox Live members will be able to download the pilot episode for free before its release.
