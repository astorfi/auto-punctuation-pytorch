Yes, it's true. It was only a matter of time until Hello Kitty worked her evil magic upon this particular gadget, as
she has on oh so many others. The Hello
Kitty Crystal Xbox Console takes that definitively non-pink
Xbox and converts it to its long-latent color scheme.
During the promotional period the entire bundle comes with a Helly Kitty Crystal Controller and Hello Kitty Mission
Rescue Game for $99 with the purchase of selected Samsung LCD TVs, but if you're not anywhere near Singapore you're
gonna be relegated to shelling out a fortune on eBay someday to get your paws on one.
