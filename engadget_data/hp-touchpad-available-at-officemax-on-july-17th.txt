If the above document is to be believed, HP's new 9.7-inch tablet will be available at the retailer on July 17th in both 3G and 4G versions -- which is a bit puzzling, considering the company hasn't made any mention of WiMAX or LTE compatibility. As for that earlier Walmart gossip, another tipster provided PreCentral with a screenshot of the big box's database (after the break), which corroborates the $600 price tag we've been hearing about for the 32GB model. If this proves true, it'll be another month before we find out whether the slate truly lives up to HP's exceedingly high expectations.

Update: We received a note from a reliable source inside Office Max that not all details in the above sheet are correct -- specifically the talk of 3G / 4G versions are a little unreliable, given the sheet currently lists a 4G version of the PlayBook that OfficeMax does not have. Our source expects the OfficeMax TouchPad to be WiFi-only, but at least that July 17th date is looking accurate.
