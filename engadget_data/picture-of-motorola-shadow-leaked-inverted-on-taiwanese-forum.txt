We're looking at what's purported to be Motorola's 'Shadow' (not 'Mirage' as Google Translate unhelpfully suggests) -- a phone with 9mm thickness, 4.3-inch 850x484 screen (larger than the devices on the leaked roadmap), HDMI port and 8-megapixel camera capable of 1080p video recording. Not much else came out of the "tight-lipped" tipster who might've inverted the picture's colors -- see above for our fix -- but an educated guess should point to that friendly green robot (though that battery icon certainly isn't part of Android's game). Any brave souls dare to guess otherwise?
