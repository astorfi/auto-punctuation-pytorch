If we just rang your bell, you'll be glad to know the critics over at Trusted Reviews were able to spend some quality time with the device and test out all those features that may or may not work as advertised. Overall, reviewers felt that the Dynadock performed adequately in everything save for "entertainment," so be sure and give the article a bit of your time to determine whether or not it'll handle the tasks you have in mind for it.
