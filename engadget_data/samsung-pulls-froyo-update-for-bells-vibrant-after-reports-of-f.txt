 We have no idea why Samsung's having such a hard time delivering its overdue promised Froyo upgrades worldwide for the Galaxy S series, but it's not looking any easier for them this weekend: the only Canadian Galaxy S to get upgraded so far, Bell's Vibrant, has just had its update pulled. Seems a healthy number of users attempting the upgrade using Sammy's Kies desktop software ended up with inaccessible internal storage, which sucks for a variety of obvious reasons -- and that would be the apparent reason for the removal of the update. Here's the official statement:
"There have been intermittent issues reported during the firmware upgrade process with Kies for the Samsung Galaxy S i9000M series of phones. Samsung's development team is currently aware of this issue and working towards a solution. Accordingly, The firmware update feature, which affects the ability to upgrade to Android 2.2, is temporarily disabled until a solution is released. We apologize for the inconvenience."
Maybe we can just go straight to Gingerbread or Honeycomb at this point?
