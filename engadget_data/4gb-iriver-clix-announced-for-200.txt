Looks like iriver's finally ready to launch their 4GB clix (or so their site would have us believe), and at the totally doable price of two hundred clams. Unfortunately, you can't actually transact the purchase just yet (we think they might have jumped the gun posting the page), but it's around the corner people, we're serious.[Thanks, sCuZz]
