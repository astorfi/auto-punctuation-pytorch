Not surprisingly, even the sedentary activity of sitting in line makes a man thirsty on an oppressively hot Manhattan afternoon.Line sitters have the same needs as the rest of us: they just need to perform those functions in public.Interesting tidbit: girls and women also seem to be fascinated by the iPhone and all the hype surrounding it -- as evidenced by Sirius' Cosmo Radio live on the scene -- but become decidedly less interested when the topic of conversation turns to writing and editing a gadget blog.It's already pretty wild out there; can you imagine what this place is gonna look like in less than 24 hours?We guess that's why these crowd control barriers are being hauled in by the dozen.Good luck tomorrow buddy![Thanks, Jonathan]
