 Telecoms Korea is quoting a Samsung companyofficial who claims a low-cost, Via-based UMPC will be launched in the second half of 2006. While no model number hasbeen released, it will be priced at "slightly over $700" undercutting that other Via-based TabletKiosk eo by about $200 or less than half of Samsung's ownQ1 (pictured). We're still a few hundie above that $500 sweetspot, and we still have to wait and see what this new Sammy packs for specs and if that's Korean or US pricingthey're referring to. Still, with prices dropping and that Media Center Extender onthe horizon, well, we won't abandon this fledgling platform just yet.Also, while we're here, we wanted toissue an update to yesterday's Samsung Q1 post. As pointed outby several people, the Korean price will actually be W1,199,000 (about $1,250), not W2,000,000 (about $2,000), asreported yesterday. Not exactly a huge bargain, but certainly better than the price we originally reported.[Via UMPC Buzz]
