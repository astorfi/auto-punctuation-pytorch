Microsoft's been insistent so far about keeping sideloaded apps out of the equation unless you're a developer, but a new tool called ChevronWP7 -- compatible with Windows XP SP2 and up -- will "unlock" your little beast so that you can install whatever you like without going through the store. Presumably, this'll come in handy for installing stuff Microsoft would never dream of approving -- and it's a whole lot less hacky than an iPhone jailbreak from the looks of it. Have fun and stay safe out there, folks.
