The sets, which range in size from 42 to 60 inches, feature LG's Cinema Screen display at full 1080p resolution with 240Hz refresh rate and are also 3D capable. For input options, consumers will have ports for HDMI (4x) and USB 2.0 (2x) along with wired ethernet (WiFi is also supported). The company's custom Magic Remote has also seen some improvements as the buttons for navigation have all been moved further up, allowing users a more comfortable one-thumb experience. And from the time we spent holding it, it seems that slight change does help enhance overall in-hand comfort. As for new additions to the remote's layout, LG's added in dedicated buttons for voice control and its Prime Time Quick Smart Guide which brings up an overlay of currently airing programs and remaining air time. There's no pricing available at this time, but we do know these sets will hit the market in Q1 of this year.
