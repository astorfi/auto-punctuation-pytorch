We saw the little guy ondisplay at CeBIT and no doubt, he’s cute with a wide-range of sensors and image/speech processing capabilities.However, was it really necessary for PaPeRo to bust out it's ray gun and vaporize that little girl’s lolli whilewarbling “warning, gingivitis, warning…” Oh the humanity!
