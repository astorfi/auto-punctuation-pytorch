The one mystery left was the screen, which turns out to be a 1400 x 900 19-incher, which feels a bit small in this day and age, but leaves the One's footprint at an acceptable size. Other niceties include dual easy-swap hard drive slots accessed by lifting off the back cover of the computer, and adjustable tilt through a stand in the back. The included mouse, keyboard and remote are all wireless and pre-synced with the computer, while the web-cam is a USB add-on accessory which comes in the box and can be perched up top, and the top-end One comes with a USB TV tuner as well. Otherwise the specs are as expected, with prices ranging from $1,300 to $1,800 and late October availability. Check out our gallery for some in the wild pictures.
