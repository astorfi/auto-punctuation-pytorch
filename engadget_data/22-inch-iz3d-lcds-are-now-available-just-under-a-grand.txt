The displays run off of included S-3D drivers, which are supported by the NVIDIA GeForce 8 Series, and ATI's FireGL V3600 workstation graphics card. There are also DirectX 8 and 9 drivers for XP and Vista, so you should be able to score some sort of 3D content without having to run out and buy new rig. The 3D tech uses passive polarized glasses to create the 3D effect, and feeds off of dual output video cards. The display itself boasts of a 1680 x 1050 resolution, 5ms response time and 600:1 contrast ratio.
