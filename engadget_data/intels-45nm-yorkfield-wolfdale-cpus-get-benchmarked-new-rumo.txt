 According to a report from TechARP that includes benchmarks of all the chips mentioned, Intel could have nailed a release date for its 45nm Yorkfield and Wolfdale CPUs. Q3 2007 now translates to November 11th, if this report is to be believed, for the launch of the first, the most powerful, and the most expensive -- $999 -- of the Yorkfields: the Core 2 Extreme QX9650, a quad core, 3GHz clocked, 2 x 6MB L2 Cache chip. Later on in January next year will come the Core 2 Quad Q9550, Q9450 and Q9300, with progressively lower clock speeds, and only (hah!) 2 x 3MB of L2 Cache for the Q9300. The Core 2 Duo E8000 series -- the Wolfdales -- will hit around the same time as the slower Yorkfields, hitting speeds of 3.16GHz and L2 Cache sizes of 6MB in the E8500, going down to 2.66GHz in the E8200.[Via Slashdot]
