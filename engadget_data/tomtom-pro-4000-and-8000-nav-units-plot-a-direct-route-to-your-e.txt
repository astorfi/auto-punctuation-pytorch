  TomTom's new "PRO" series of GPS units, the PRO 4000 and PRO 8000 aren't that different than your regular old amateur nav slab, only these have the PRO moniker, which means they're supposed to be taken oh-so-much more seriously by your corporate masters when expensed. The $330 and $460 units include perks for the "mobile workforce" like a premium ruggedized sleeve, dedicated phone support line, two year warranty and a PIN lock. Both units sport 4.3-inch widescreen displays, with the 8000 (pictured) adding on IQ Routes, Advanced Lane Guidance, Voice Address Input and Bluetooth. Neither one will do your crappy job for you.[Via NaviGadget]
