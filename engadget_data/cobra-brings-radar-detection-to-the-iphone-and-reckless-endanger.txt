As seems most fitting, the peeps at Cobra are behind this one, and we must say that if this is your thing, the premise is pretty interesting: the handset, running a free app from the company, connects to the iCobra fuzz buster via Bluetooth and alerts the driver to things like cameras, commonly identified speed traps, rough intersections, and more. Suggested retail is $170, but we've seen it making the rounds for the $100 mark. Race your way to your favorite e-tailer to see for yourself.
