Yeah, that's the world's highest capacity M2 card in case you're wondering. Also of significance is their new 2GB to 8GB uSSD 5000 Solid State Disks which measure just one-fourth the size of a 1.8-inch SSD. The new uSSD is meant for sub $250 PCs with SanDisk specifically calling out Intel's Classmate PC. We bet you'll find it bunged inside the Eee PC as well. Also announced are a $30 Multi Card ExpressCard adapter and new high-performance $80 4GB SDHC Plus and $160 8GB Memory Stick Pro Duo cards from their Ultra II lineup.
