Staying true to the 8-bit nature of the tunes, Mauer's gone all out and actually stuffed his new "Vegavox" album onto an NES cartridge, which can be yours for â‚¬22 (or just under $30). Just pair it with an nPod or other portable NES and you can pretend for a minute that cartridges actually became as widely popular as you once imagined they would be -- or was that just us?[Via Digg]
