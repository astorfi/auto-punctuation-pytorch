The little laptop / tablet hybrid does just what the name suggests, with the display literally sliding over the keyboard. Of course, we had to get video of it in action, which you can enjoy after the break. Some pictures are below, too, both of the 7 Series and ultra-thin 9 Series. Needless to say, we're going back for seconds.
