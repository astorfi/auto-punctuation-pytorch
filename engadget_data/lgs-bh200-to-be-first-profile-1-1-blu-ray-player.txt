According to LG's product development director Tim Alessi, LG's latest dual format player (BH200) is on schedule to be the first of it's kind. This latest requirement for stand alone Blu-ray players promises to finally bring the Blu-ray camp up to the standards that HD DVD has enjoyed since almost the very beginning, including features like PIP. At this point it seems that most of the other manufacturers are content to wait for CES to announce compliant players, but we'll be on the look out either way. The real question at this point is where's the content? At this point, the only title announced to contain 1.1 features (Resident Evil: Extinction) isn't due out till 2008.
