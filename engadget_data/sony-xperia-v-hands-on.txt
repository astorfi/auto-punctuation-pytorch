 
 The slightly shier Xperia V was mentioned ever-so-briefly in Sony's IFA presser -- but that's not to say there's nothing to see. We've just got our hands-on with the firm's newest LTE handset, and it's a lightweight 127 grams, comes with a 4.3-inch, 1,280 x 720 display and boasts iPx5/7 water resistance. It's also packing Sony's new ClearAudio+ technology. It's got that familiar Xperia curve, which we like, plus a rough silver finish around the edge. Check out our hands-on video after the break, with more impressions coming soon.




 
 The 1.5 GHz Qualcomm MSM8960 dual-core processor inside the Xperia V proved plenty capable, with that high-resolution screen offering space for on-screen Android 4.0 buttons. It's an Xperia kind of Android, though, with similar widgets and drop-down menu adjustments, but it's all inoffensive enough. There's also raft of Sony's new Android widgets that we'd soon drop from our homescreen -- but again, it's an easily solved problem. It also packs a 13-megapixel sensor versus the 12-megapixel shooter we saw earlier on the Xperia S, although we'll have to wait for the final review model before we can compare results. The Xperia V will come in pink, white and black paint jobs when it hits stores later this year.
