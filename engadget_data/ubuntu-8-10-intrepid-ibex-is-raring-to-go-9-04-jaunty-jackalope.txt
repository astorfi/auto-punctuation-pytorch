 We can't say enough about the joys of a 6 month product release cycle. We put Ubuntu through its paces on personal computers with every refresh, and while it never seems to do everything we need it to, it's so tantalizingly close that we just can't help trying it out 6 months later. This October we're getting 8.10 "Intrepid Ibex" to play with, which is supposed to bring performance gains and a much-improved Network Manager for working with 3G connections and such -- it's currently in Alpha 5 state. Meanwhile, Ubuntu 9.04 "Jaunty Jackalope," due for April of next year, is already being sketched up, and will make boot / resume times and the integration of web apps priorities for the OS. Both are bound to suck up valuable hours of our lives, installing and then uninstalling, and will be worth every minute of it.
