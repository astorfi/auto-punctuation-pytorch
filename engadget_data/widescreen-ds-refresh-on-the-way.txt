Those are pretty significant changes, so we'd actually say that sounds more like a second-gen DS rather than another rev of the current hardware, but IGN says the rumored release date of April or May 2009 doesn't jive with a whole new unit. We'll see when we see -- hopefully we won't be waiting long.  PS.- That's just IGN's mockup, don't get too excited.
