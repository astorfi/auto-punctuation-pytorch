Wegot the penthouse suite, no one could stop us. We came, we saw (the inside of hotel and press rooms, anyway), weconquered the 2005 CES. Now we're headed back to our respective Engadget offices (New York, San Francisco, Seattle,L.A., etc.) a whole lot wiser, and great deal more sleep-deprived, and slightly more drunk. But just because CES isover doesn't mean we've finished! We'll continue to have more posts until we've covered every corner of the Las VegasConvention Centerâ€”remember, every day can be CES if you just believe it in your heart. But for now, some vital LVTeam Engadget stats:   Number of posts: 229 (and counting)  Number of lost gadgets: 4 Number of laptops broken: 1  Number of colds caught: 2  Number of WiFi networks traversed: 12 Average hours slept nightly: 4.73  Number of HD tapes used: 7  Energy bars consumed: 34  Number ofcasinos visited: 6  Amount of money lost gambling: $34.50



 It looked somethinglike this after about 13 minutes. The Hotel War Room.   You may recognize this photograph?   Eric took it off asweet jump, dude.   Cat loves her somePSP.

The paparazzi snappedus this shot of PhoneScoop Rich and Eric in a limo with Kyocera. No photo, no photo!   Covering the Gates keynote live over EV-DO. And falling asleep.   Well look who we foundoutside. We didn%uFFFDt wait around long enough to see if we%uFFFDd be granted a second interview.   Ahh, home sweet home.We swear, that%uFFFDs the real the Statue of Liberty standing right next to the ESB.
