 "HD Supremacy" was claimed by DISH Network, but DirecTV is heading down the Comcast path, touting its VOD offerings with the biggest selection of 1080p movies. With "more than 30" movies available it doesn't quite match Blu-ray and falls short of HDX, but DirecTV Plus HD DVR receiver owners can look forward to new flicks like Slumdog Millionaire, The Wrestler and Quantum of Solace being available in the highest res as soon as they launch on the DirecTV on Demand platform. According to VP Eric Shanks, even customers without 1080p HDTVs are seeing the benefit. A year after we first heard 1080p HD VOD was on the way, are you taking advantage?
