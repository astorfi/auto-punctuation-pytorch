Now that the first major race is out of the way, which took place in Beijing a couple of weeks ago, it's time for Formula E to look toward the future. Accordingly, CEO Alejandro Agag has revealed some interesting details ahead of the EV racing league's sophomore season, namely its plans to allow teams to build batteries and motors of their own by then. As great and exciting as Formula E is, currently all cars are using hardware from the same manufacturer, so allowing others to take part will bring it more in line with Formula 1, in which there are engines from the likes of Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault. "They could build their own whole car if they wanted. But the regulations are quite strict and they don't allow a lot of development in aerodynamics, but they do allow development in motor and battery," Agag stated. He said the idea is for Formula E to have "three or four" different companies working on motors and batteries, something that would definitely make the competition even more interesting.
