In a world gone cuckoo for Atom-based netbooks, isn't it refreshing to see a 15.6-inch (1366 x 768 pixel) laptop that packs a 2GHz Core 2 Duo T4200 processor, 2GB of DDR3 memory and 250GB hard disk, 6-cell battery, integrated DVD writer, and touch-sensitive Desktop Navigator shortcut bar for $669? Why stop there though? $1,199 nabs 4GB of memory, 512MB of GeForce G 105M graphics, and 500GB of disk. For the same money you could gather a trio of netbooks into a personal grid computer of about the same power. Just be sure to let us know how that goes.Update: Laptop above is the nearly-identical Y650. The Y550 is pictured after the break.[Thanks, Sam]
