There are just so many people to thank, we don't want to miss anyone! Brando, for selling all that Thanko crap. We... we promised ourselves we wouldn't cry! ... *sniffle* ... so much for that. We've just never been more proud, to live on an planet where beautiful things like Hello Kitty USB foot warmers can happen. A true achievement for mankind. Oh no, the orchestra is playing -- so many more people to thank -- thank you world!
