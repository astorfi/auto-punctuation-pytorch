Intel just posted decidedly mixed results for the second quarter. While it largely matched its outlook from the first quarter with $12.8 billion in revenue and a healthy net profit of $2 billion, it also saw sharp year-over-year drops in revenue from some of its core divisions. The PC Client Group, which makes the brunt of Intel's processors, saw its revenue decline 7.5 percent; the Other Intel Architecture Group, which primarily handles mobile chips, faced a 15 percent drop. Intel hasn't explained the dip, although there are a pair of major factors at work. In addition to facing a very rough PC market, the company only launched its Haswell architecture late in the quarter -- there hasn't been much time for customers to buy the new chips. Intel says there's "strong acceptance" from early Haswell customers, however, and its outlook for the current quarter is slightly rosier as a result -- it expects to make the same $13.5 billion in revenue that we saw a year ago.
