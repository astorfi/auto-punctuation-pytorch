 Samsung's been jacking megapixel counts all over the place lately, and the Korean giant's latest digital cameras are no exception -- the new NV100 HD (pictured) packs in a ridiculous 14.7 megapixels, and the new compact NV9 tops at 10.2 megapixels. That's probably a little ridiculous, but we're not going to argue with progress, and the cameras seem pretty nice: the NV100 HD has a 3-inch touchscreen, a 3.6X Schneider Kreuznac lens, face, smile, and blink detection, 720p video recording and ISO3200 sensitivity, while the NV9 sports old-school analog battery and storage meters, as a well a 2.7-inch display, optical image stabilizer, and smile and blink detection. Both go on sale in August -- check out the NV9 after the break.Read - NV100 HDRead - NV9
