Twitter #Music launched with Spotify streaming as a core feature. It's only fair that Spotify #Music get an app of its own, then, and one has just launched today. The new client very closely mimics its web counterpart, letting members find and play trending music on Twitter from big-name artists, fast-rising newcomers and everyone in given genres. As you'd imagine, the difference rests in how you play music -- it's much faster to start a track or add it to a playlist, and you don't need to be a Spotify Premium subscriber to tune in. If you're interested in learning what the world is listening to, you'll find the free #Music app at the source link.
