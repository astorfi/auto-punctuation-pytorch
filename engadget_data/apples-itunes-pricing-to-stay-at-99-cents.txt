 Apple Computer's SteveJobs has apparently won his long-runningbattle with the recordindustry over the pricing of songs in the iTunes Music Store. Jobs has long insisted that the store's99-cents-per-song price point should stay in place, while record companies had argued for more flexible pricing, withnewer songs going for a higher price, and catalog material selling for less. The record companies had also pushed for asubscription option similar to that followed by most other online music stores. Now, according to The New York Post, therecord companies have largely thrown in the towel, and will allow Apple to keep pricing flat. The victory is, however,somewhat Pyrrhic for Apple; the company makes very little money (proportionately) from iTMS, and uses the store largelyas a way to lure customers into buying iPods and lock them into its FairPlay DRM, which we all know works only with oneaudio player. (Why do you think the French aregiving them such a hardtime?) Keeping pricing simple is part of Jobs' strategy to avoid losing customers to competing platforms, which have access to music stores thatoffer unlimited download subscription packages for as little as $8 per month. Level pricing may help stanch defections-- but it's not likely to produce any increased revenue for Apple, which is apparently just how they like it.
