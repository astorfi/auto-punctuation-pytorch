Many of the available KVM options provide switching for VGA connectors, so here's an option for switching between
two DVI inputs. The 2 x 1 DVI KVM Switcher will allow you to swap DVI, USB 2.0 and audio between two machines. As a
nicety, it includes two 6 foot DVI cables, two 6 foot USB cables and two audio cables so you don't have to cannibalize
too much from that cable snakepit you have in your closet (don't think we don't know). It's a little on the pricy side
for a KVM switch at $199, but if you need the DVI support it might just be the KVM you've been waiting to see from
across a crowded room.
