Acer UK marketing director Bobby Waltkins has told Pocket-Init that the Z5600 all-in-one PC is due out October 23rd along with -- and here's the kicker -- a genuine copy of Windows 7 pre-loaded on the device. That jibes with what Compal's president said back in late February, but it's hard to say for certain from the wording of his response whether he's referring to the OS's wide release or just his company's 7-equipped desktop, although his talk of a 30-day upgrade free upgrade period might be suggesting the former. Until the boys in Redmond call it official, we're just gonna mark our calendars very lightly with a pencil.
