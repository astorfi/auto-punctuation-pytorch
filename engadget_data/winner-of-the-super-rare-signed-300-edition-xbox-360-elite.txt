Well, you can all officially bum rush Erik Burgardt, since he's the lucky sucker taking this thing home.Just for good measure, in addition to the signed Xbox and 300 HD DVD, Microsoft also hooked him up with a copy of Forza 2, Crackdown, a year's Xbox Live service, and 1600 Microsoft points. Congrats Erik, everyone -- including and especially us -- is incredibly jealous.
