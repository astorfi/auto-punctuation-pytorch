Well, as we reported, that fox -- specifically Firefox 6 -- is now officially ready for your downloading pleasure. If you're a diehard Mozilla fan, or just an armchair browser expert, you're probably already hip to the new Firefox rapid refresh cycle that's seen three releases in the past five months. If not, the folks at Mozilla sent along a couple of nifty graphics (available after the break) to show you how the new timeline works. Alternately, if you're not interested in how your latest install made its way to your device, feel free to download the real deal at the source links below.
