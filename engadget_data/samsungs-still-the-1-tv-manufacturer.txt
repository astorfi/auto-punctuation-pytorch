 Vizio may have snatched the sales crown when it comes to LCDs in the U.S., but Samsung maintained it's position as the largest worldwide TV manufacturer in the second quarter. Following Samsung's 12.4% market share were LG with 11.4% and Philips with 7.1%. The numbers were run by iSuppli, who forecast the quickening demise of the CRT, with it dropping to 38% of unit shipments in 2009, compared to 56% this year. No word on exactly what part of that was HDTVs, but we hope buyers are getting the most quality possible out of those new plasmas and LCDs.[Via TV Snob]
