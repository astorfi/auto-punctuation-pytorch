Carly is out! Not many details about what exactly sparked this to happen today (or well, yesterday), but there's
been a boardroom coup at HP, and CEO and Chairman Carly Fiorina has been ousted, effective immediately. Could
mean some very big changes for HP's direction, including even possibly that
breakup of the company some people have been hinting at
(though we have no confirmation right now as to why she was fired). We'll keep you posted.
