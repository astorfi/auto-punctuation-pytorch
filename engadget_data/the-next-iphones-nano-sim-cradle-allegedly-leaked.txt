 
 Rumors about the new iPhone have basically everything but the screen shrinking. That includes the SIM card and its ejectable drawer. French site NoWhereElse scored some photos of what it claims is the new tray, alongside the 4S version for comparison. As you can clearly see, the new SIM slot is narrower and the insert has a slightly different cosmetic design. If the part turns out to be legit, it will hardly come as a surprise. Apple made a big push for a nano-SIM standard to be adopted over competing designs from Nokia, RIM and Motorola. If the rumors and Cupertino's reliable refresh schedule hold up, you wont have to wait long to find out for sure. The next iPhone is expected to be announced next month.
