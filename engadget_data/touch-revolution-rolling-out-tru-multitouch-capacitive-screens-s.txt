Why, it's introducing a line of projected capacitive displays alternately spanning 15-, 19-, 21.5- and 32-inch diagonals. The biggest model is set for production later in the year, but its smaller siblings are available now. The target market for Touch Revolution are businesses who may integrate these panels -- which also come in an "open frame" option where the OEM can slap on its own external stylings -- into their commercial offerings. Demos of all these models, replete with innovative uses of multitouch on a large-scale display, will be available at CES this week. We'll let you know just how innovative the whole shebang is when we get our fingers on the Tru Multitouch hardware. Full press release after the break.
