Well, we don't know about the 2405FPW yet, but thenew 2007WFP has officially appeared on their support site, and is sporting an 800:1 contrast ratio, 300 cd/m2brightness, 16ms response time, and all the same ports we're accustomed to (four USB 2.0 port hub, VGA, DVI, S-video,composite, etc.). In fact, this monitor looks nary any better than its predecessor but for some marginal imageimprovements and an upgraded enclosure. Not that we'd mean to imply we don't want six for each of our workstations oranything.[Thanks, Ehsan]
