 Yahoo's new app has arrived on Android, packing a similar features selection to the iOS iteration that launched last week.

The news app will make better use of your smartphone screen too, with more attention being paid to both images and video content. Feast your eyes on Yahoo's refresh by grabbing the app at the Play store -- the link's just below.
