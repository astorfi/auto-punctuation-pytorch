If you've been itching for a new convertible since CES last month, sales pages for Lenovo's refreshed Yoga line have started popping up online. Best Buy has the 11-inch Bay-Trail-equipped Yoga 2 listed for $519, while you can buy direct from the manufacturer for $799 -- a far cry higher than the previously announced $529. With the yellow-tag store's lower price, however, comes a caveat: the Yoga 2 doesn't have a release date just yet. It's totally up to you if ordering (Lenovo's ship time is "within three weeks") the touchscreen's efficient 2.4GHz Pentium, 4GB of RAM and 500GB hard drive right now is worth the premium though. After all, $280 is still a decent amount of cash.
