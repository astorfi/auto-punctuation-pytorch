Unlike similar new sets like the ones fromED Digital, the SLC3760N includes 802.11a/b/g for streaming media, and has a response time of 6 or lessmilliseconds for dropping that oh-so-annoying ghosting. HP is pumping out the Plasma too: new 42 and 50-inch sets (thePL 4260N and PL5060N) will grace the retail shelves but not much seems new on these. Three 1080p DLP sets join thecrowd in the extra-large size. 52, 58, and 65-inches of 1920 x 1080 progressive-scan goodness using that wacky wobulation method. All sets include integrated ATSC, NTSC andQAM tuners, which we expected. It is 2006, after all.
