 The latest MWC teaser video from ASUS is light on the details and heavy on the talking statue. The 33-second video titled "A New Discovery at Hand," features Barcelona's Columbus Monument taking a phone call on his stone tablet and the tag line "Join ASUS to Discover a New World." No mentions of PadFones (or, for that matter, FonePads) in the video itself, though the accompanying text promises that those who attend the company's February 25th press conference will witness "Pad and Phone come together."
