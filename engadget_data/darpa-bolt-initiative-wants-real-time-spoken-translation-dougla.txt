Now DARPA wants that done wholesale and with military precision, launching the BOLT initiative. That stands for Boundless Operational Language Translation, and DARPA is giving interested parties until May 19th of this year to submit proposals for how they'll manage to achieve the department's lofty goals, which include written and spoken translation into English of "multiple languages." If you're thinking of competing you can find all the details at the source link, though curiously you won't find a single Vorgon dialect mentioned.
