We know this thing packs in some sweet features(most notably, of course, its HD DVD drive, as well as a 2GHz Core Duo processor, 17-inch 1920 x 1200 display, dual120GB RAID drives, DVB-T tuner, TV tuner, etc.), but damned is that a bank breaker for the back breaker. Guess havingevery single possible feature you can possibly imagine in a single laptop (no word on HDCP-output, however) comes at acost.
