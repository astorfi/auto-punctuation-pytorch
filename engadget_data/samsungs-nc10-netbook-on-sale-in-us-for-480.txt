Unfortunately, the exchange rate here is nearly on point, with the Â£299 NC10 10-inch netbook on sale for $480 (give or take a few nickles) in the US of A. Granted, it looks as if it'll be a fortnight or so at the very least before any Yanks can wrap their grimy paws around the germ-shunning PC, but we've already got the e-tailers lining up to hold your place in line. Who knows -- maybe our version will come with built-in WiMAX and 12-hours of battery life to really sweeten the deal.[Via Liliputing, thanks Michael]Read - Pre-order NC10, option 1Read - Pre-order NC10, option 2
