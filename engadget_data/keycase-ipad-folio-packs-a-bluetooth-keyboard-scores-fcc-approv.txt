It's not the laptop-style ClamCase iPad case that we saw renders of way back in May, but this so-called KeyCase iPad Folio does manage to do a similar trick, and it's thankfully very much real -- it's just landed FCC approval and is already listed at one online retailer (though it's out of stock). The big selling point here, of course, is a Bluetooth keyboard that fits in the case and props up your iPad while in use, which can also be removed whenever you're looking to lighten the load a little. Unfortunately, there's still no official word on a widespread release for the case, but UK retailer GearZap has it listed at Â£60, or just over $90.
