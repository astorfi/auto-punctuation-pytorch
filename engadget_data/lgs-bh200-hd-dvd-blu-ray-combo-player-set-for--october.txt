Turns out, LG seems to be readying its second HD DVD / Blu-ray standalone player for a fall release, and unsurprisingly, it's likely to be dubbed the BH200. Reportedly, this device will support BD-Live functionality, HDi (er, Advanced Navigation), and "1080p output at 60Hz / 1080p upscaling of standard DVDs." And while it wasn't confirmed, LG's product development manager for consumer electronics brand marketing suggested that it could boast "wider support for audio CDs as well as HD DVD network connectivity." Moreover, you can expect it to play nice with MPEG1/2, VC-1, H.264, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, DTS and DTS-HD, tout HDMI 1.3 and Ethernet ports, and to arrive on store shelves for around $999 "in mid-October."UPDATE: It's official -- as a matter of fact, this sucka will be debuting at CEDIA tomorrow, so we'll be trying our best to snag some hands-on time with it, cool? For now, though, check out a few more press shots posted after the jump.
