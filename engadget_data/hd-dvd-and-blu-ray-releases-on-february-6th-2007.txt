       Tomorrow's the big day for Blu-ray fans; the last day HD DVD can claim to have the most titles available -- the additional studio support finally pays off. At this point Blu-ray has more players available, more movies, more players sold, and more movies sold. HD DVD still holds the title in interactivity and value, but will it be enough? As long as Universal continues to support HD DVD there will be no end in sight to the format war, but this week's Universal title Hollywoodland is the only HD DVD-specific title on the calendar in February. Now we all know this can change and 1 or even 100 of the promised titles for 2007 can hit any week they want. Lionsgate is Blu-ray's champion this week, with some great catalog titles including one of our favorites Reservoir Dogs.HD DVD 158 vs Blu-ray 159. Blu-ray
