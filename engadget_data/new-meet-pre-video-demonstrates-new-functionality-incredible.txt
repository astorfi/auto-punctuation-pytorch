We suppose it's the exact type of stuff demonstrated on the video that keeps us coming back: webOS presents some new paradigms for interaction and integration, and, like the iPhone before it, will take a considerable amount of digestion to really come to terms with. Plus it's pretty. This video demonstrates a few interesting tidbits, such as a list of folks invited to a meeting and which ones will be going -- a nice integration of calendar and contacts -- and the phone is shown "sending" a webpage to a friend, which involves forwarding a link and an attached .png screenshot, perfect for mobile-to-mobile communications. Here's hoping we hear more about the phone this week at MWC... and a 3G GSM edition certainly wouldn't be unwelcome. Video is after the break.
