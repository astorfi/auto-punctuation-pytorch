 If you still have RAZRs on the brain after laying eyes on this puppy, we might recommend you get that noodle checked. At a time when Moto perhaps needs a hit more than ever, this shiny piece of gorgeous -- allegedly the "LAZR" -- appears poised to come in and save the day. Features of the chromed-out clamshell are said to include a half gig of internal storage with no expansion slot, Linux (a trend we'll see more and more in Moto's new models), some manner of text-to-speech system for emails and SMSes, and a frickin' two inch external display. No word on a release at this point, but we've got our fingers crossed that it'll bow all official-like at CTIA next week.[Via Howard Forums, thanks Ishay P.]
