The new toolsetfeatures a wide range of sensors allowing your bot to now sense and react to sounds and movement with improved reactionto both light and touch. The heart of the system is the NXT brick -- a 32-bit microprocessor which can be programmed byPC or now, Mac. The brick is USB 2.0 or Bluetooth enabled allowing for wireless instruction download -- sweet. Onceprogrammed, the robot "then takes on a life of its own, fully autonomous from the computer." Hmm that remindsus, it's probably no coincidence that Lego made their NXT mascot above resemble Johnny 5 who, you will recall developedconsciouness just long enough to feel the fear of being cast opposite Ally Sheedy. So think twice about programming inself-awareness, mkay?[Thanks, tempusmaster]
