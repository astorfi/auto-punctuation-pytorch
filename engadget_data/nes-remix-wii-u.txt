NES Remix is a new game collection from Nintendo for the Wii U that takes 16 classic Nintendo games -- from Super Mario Bros. to The Legend of Zelda -- and picks specific pieces of them for remixing. For instance, an Excitebike level is shown as if the driver had a headlight in a dark arena, and a famous Mario level is shown entirely backwards. In so many words, NES Remix is a series of classic game vignettes remastered and re-released in a new package for the Wii U, which sounds...fantastic? We're gonna call it fantastic.


Beyond sharing specific accomplishments in each piece of NES Remix, you can also share level clear times to compete with friends and the larger community -- the first real addition we've seen to MiiVerse sharing since it was introduced last year. The games on Nintendo's game page include: Donkey Kong (featuring Link!), Donkey Kong Jr., Donkey Kong 3, Excitebike, Super Mario Bros., Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Clu Clu Land, Wrecking Crew, Pinball, Urban Champion, Baseball, Tennis, Ice Climber, Golf and Balloon Fight. There are 16 games represented in total. We've dropped a trailer for it just beyond the break. It's available now on the Wii U eShop for a whopping $16.32 (w/ tax). Woof.
