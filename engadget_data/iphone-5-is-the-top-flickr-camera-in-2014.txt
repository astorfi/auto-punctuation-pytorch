Photo website PetaPixel gives us a peek into the 2014 camera stats from photo sharing site Flickr, and the times they are a-changing. Canon is still the most popular camera brand for Flickr posters (13.4%), followed by Apple (9.6%), Nikon (9.3%) and Samsung (5.6%).

Just looking at smartphones posting to Flickr, Apple's iPhone 5 wins with 10.6%, with the runners up being the iPhone 4S (7%), the iPhone 4 (4.3%), the iPhone 5c (2.0%) and the Samsung Galaxy S3 with 1.2%. That iPhone 5c number seems pretty surprising. It probably is really surprising to Samsung.

Last year's number had Nikon as the second most popular brand, and Apple and Nikon have traded places in 2014. The top smartphone cameras are the same as 2013, and those Apple iPhones rank number 1, 2 and 3. The new iPhone 6, which wasn't available during a good part of 2014 has sent 1% of Flickr photos, ranking in 7th place among smartphones. Apple's iPad and iPad mini offered 0.8% and 0.6% respectively.

When the iPhone was announced eight years ago few would have guessed that Apple would wind up a popular and dominating camera maker, but that is exactly what has happened.

You can see the two-year comparisons on this chart from PetaPixel.
