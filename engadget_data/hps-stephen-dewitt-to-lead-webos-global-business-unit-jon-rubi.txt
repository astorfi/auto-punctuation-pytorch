 

It's looking like there's a little shuffling happening at HP in the wake of the TouchPad's release -- and its somewhat less than flattering reception. The company has announced that Stephen DeWitt will be taking the lead in HP's webOS global business unit, while Jon Rubinstein will be taking over as Senior Vice President of Global Innovation for HP's Personal Systems Group -- DeWitt himself coming from PSG Americas. You'll of course know Jon as the main cheerleader for webOS in the past, appearing on our Show back in March to show off the TouchPad and the Pre 3. Will Stephen manage the same enthusiasm in extolling the finger-friendly OS's virtues, or will we instead be seeing more webOS printers? Let's all hope for the former.

Update: DeWitt was previously the head PSG Americas, not the global Personal Systems Group. Stephen DiFranco will be taking over the role of SVP for PSG Americas.

Update 2: The Official HP Palm Blog has added a post entitled "Next steps for HP webOS" providing a bit more context to the shift, indicating that this move is intended to "accelerate the scale and growth of its existing webOS business as well as to expand and enhance other HP product lines." So, printers, then?
