We figure there's been enough drama at this point, so just suffice it to say that if you have a MacBook C2D, MacBook Pro C2D, Mac Pro with AirPort Extreme or a C2D iMac that isn't the 17-inch 1.83GHz model, you can fork over your two bucks and update right now to glorious draft-n wonderment.[Via AppleInsider]Update: Apple let us know that you can't identify systems with the Network Utility; the 802.11n capability only shows up if you've used the software update, so know your mac and get the update if you need it. Also, the $1.99 update is considered by Apple to be a site license, so you can upgrade all the machines in your home with the single $2 purchase (if you didn't alright sign up for the router). Not bad!Update 2: It wasn't entirely clear before, but the launch of the Enabler coincides with the launch of the AirPort Extreme today, too. Don't let the "Estimated Ship: February" on their site fool you, Apple is definitely shipping now.
