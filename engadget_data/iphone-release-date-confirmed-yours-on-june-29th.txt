The commercial just aired on 60 Minutes, and now you can finally mark your calendar and get on with your life -- for the next 25 days or so, until you get in line for your spankin' new $600 iPhone (provided you're still willing to undergo that ugly but required two year service agreement).[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]Update: The ads are up on Apple's site! Check 'em out.
