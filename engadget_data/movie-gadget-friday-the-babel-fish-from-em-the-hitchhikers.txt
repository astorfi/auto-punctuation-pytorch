checked out the Doctor's TARDIS from Doctor Who, for
this week's Movie Gadget Friday she looks at the Babel fish The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy:

As a warm up to the impending (end of April in the UK) release of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (the
original film of the videogame of the television series of the stage production of the towel of the radio plays –
action figures and plush assortment already available) this week
I'm taking a look at the Babel fish.


 One of the many finest figments of the late, great Douglas Adams's
fantastic imagination, Babel fishes are naturally occurring biologically based gadgets. The fish lives in your ear
canal feeding off the energy you use to speak, and excreeting translations of others utterances.



  The fish is a cert for an appearance in the upcoming movie since it?s the device that allows all races and speciesto understand one another ? Adams?s ingenious solution to the conundrum of why the science fiction universe appears tobe full of English speakers. As a device that enabled everyone in the universe to finally understand what everyone elsewas going on about, it was also legendary for being responsible for ?more and bloodier wars than anything else in thehistory of creation?.   The unlikelihood of the fishes extraordinarily useful existence is also used in the storiesas an absolute proof of the non-existence of God ? an explanation probably inspired by Adams, like the rest of us atsome point in our lives, being subjected by the dubious argument that the eye is such a thing of wonder that it provesGods existence.  While you?re waiting for the film you can play Martin Freeman?s Babelfish game, or try out the award winning and timedevouring 20th Anniversary Issue ofthe original text based Commodore 64 Hitchhikersgame.
