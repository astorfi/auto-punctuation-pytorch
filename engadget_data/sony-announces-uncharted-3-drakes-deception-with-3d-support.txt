One of the top series on its PlayStation 3 console, it's not hard to figure out why this would join Killzone 3 and Gran Turismo 5 on the 3D shelf when it's released November 1st, 2011. Check out the trailer from the VGA's after the break and if you need more information, there should be some unveiled tonight on the Jimmy Fallon show.
