On the consumer front, the company's introducing a slew of new Pavilion laptops, including the dv2000 series, dv6000 series, dv9000 series, and the previously-announced beast that is the Pavilion HDX. Of the less gargantuan laptops, three new models pack 14.1-inch, 15.4-inch, and 17-inch widescreen displays, respectively, and each come loaded with a variety of Core 2 Duo processors, Nvidia GeForce 8400M graphics, built-in webcams (optional in some models), and integrated WiFi (including 802.11n in some models). Look for these to boast starting prices of $999, $949, and $1,199. For the more business minded, HP's also busted out a number of new laptops in its Compaq Presario line, including the 14.1-inch V3000 series, 15.4-inch V6000 series, the 17-inch 8710 and 8510 series, the 2710p convertible tablet, the 2510p ultralight and, last but not least, the 6910p, 6710, and 6510b "Balanced Mobility" models, which boast 14.1-inch and 15.4-inch displays. On the low-end, you'll be able to get a V6000 laptop starting at just $899, with starting prices going all the way up to $2,199 for the top-end 8510w model. As for availability, you can look for all the Pavilion laptops and the Compaq Presario 6910p, 6710, and 6510b to start rolling out immediately, with some more Presarios following in mid-July and the rest trickling out over the course of the summer.
