It's all pretty boring and corporate, but it could also be construed as a look at what a Microsoft take on an "Apple Store-style" experience might be. Result? It kinda looks like Circuit City plus a few Surface displays, Microsoft Tags and magical screen-equipped shopping carts (pictured above). Oh, and before you gather up your Zune pals for a road trip: the Experience Center is real, but the customers are fake -- the store isn't open to the public. Video is after the break.[Via istartedsomething]
