The newly announced NuVo Music Port is a hardware / software package that enables "home desktop and laptop PCs to act both as sources and as controllers" in either of the aforesaid systems. Essentially, the device transforms a PC into a multi-output source for a NuVo system and enables any web-connected device on the home network to double as a media controller. The software end of the deal tosses in a swank browser interface that includes cover art and the like, and just so you know, it can be added to existing systems or installed with new ones.
