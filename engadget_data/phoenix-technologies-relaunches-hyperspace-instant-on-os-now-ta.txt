 
Not that we've never seen this phenomenon before, but Phoenix Technologies' HyperSpace embedded OS was forgotten just about as quickly as it was introduced. Here at CES -- over a year since we first heard of the software -- it's being relaunched in very much official glory. Starting today, HyperSpace for Consumers can be downloaded directly onto any laptop in two flavors: Hybrid ($59.95 annually or $149.95 for three years) or Dual ($39.95 annually or $99.95 for three years). The former taps into the virtual technology in many Intel and AMD CPUs in order to let users toggle between systems; the latter forces you to stay in one or the other. Also of note, HyperSpace for Netbooks will begin shipping on pre-fab machines in just a few months, with Acer already signed on as a partner. The full release is after the break, and check out Laptop's hands-on at the read link.
      

 

PHOENIX HYPERSPACE FOR CONSUMERS DEBUTS AT CES, LAS VEGAS--Delivers Instant-On and Always-Connected Computing - Notebooks and Netbooks can now be as Fast, Fun and Friendly as Mobile Phones--Consumers can now take advantage of PC 3.0™ VisionMILPITAS, Calif.

(NASDAQ: PTEC), the leader in PC 3.0TM products, services and embedded technologies, today introduced HyperSpace for consumers, a revolutionary new instant-on and always-connected computing environment that makes operating a mobile PC as efficient, fun and easy, as operating a cell phone. HyperSpace dramatically simplifies and improves the mobile experience by allowing users to instantly launch important web-based applications (before Windows® even boots), automatically connect to the best available network, extend battery life, and achieve new levels of uptime and security protection. HyperSpace is immediately available for download at www.hyperspace.com HyperSpace will also be available for download and on display at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas from Jan 8-11 2009, at Phoenix booth# 9014 Central Hall.Solution for Mobile Computer Users:HyperSpace directly addresses the top frustrations of today's mobile computer users. In a recent survey, Get Vocal About Mobile, which was conducted by the Forum to Advance the Mobile Experience and its Reinvent Mobile initiative (www.reinventmobile.com), 1,300 mobile PC consumers listed their greatest frustrations as:1) Running out of power too quickly2) Finding a reliable wireless connection and, 3) Waiting too long to boot up and shut down of systems "Stop waiting for Windows to boot or worrying about finding the best wireless connection. Instant-on computing with HyperSpace transforms the mobile experience by providing cell phone-like connectivity, ease-of-use and efficiency for key applications," said Woody Hobbs, president and CEO of Phoenix Technologies. "In less than a few seconds, you're up and running – browsing the Internet, emailing, instant messaging, and using other important applications. By utilizing the power of virtualization technology, HyperSpace can run side-by-side with Windows Vista® on certain systems, making your computer far more power efficient, secure and frustration-free."Phoenix has been working with the world's leading silicon and software vendors to create an ecosystem for HyperSpace. HyperSpace is optimized for web applications like Google Apps and will include shortcuts to those applications so that consumers can easily access their favorite Google sites. Phoenix Technologies is also working with Yahoo's Zimbra division to add Zimbra Desktop email functionality to HyperSpace."Laptop and Netbook users typically surf the Web 90% of the time: instant access to the Internet, current information and online applications makes their time online more fun and productive. For over a decade many companies have tried to make virtualization ready for mainstream consumption. Phoenix Technologies has succeeded, and the consumer is the ultimate beneficiary," added consumer PC guru, Tim Bajarin, of Creative Strategies.

You can easily add and prioritize preferred networks to optimize performance and cost efficiency.Longer battery life – Using the web in HyperSpace extends battery power by more than 25% in some systems when compared to computing in Windows. With the right hardware and usage patterns, consumers can experience all day battery-life on certain platforms. A constant and significant increase in the number of platforms supporting all day computing is a high priority for Phoenix development. Security – HyperSpace is a personal computing environment that is far more difficult to infect with viruses, rootkits and spyware than operating systems like Windows. Applications are digitally signed and stored in a secure memory store that is locked after execution. Updates and additions to HyperSpace will only be made via a site approved and owned or audited by Phoenix. Uptime – If Windows Vista™ system fails, HyperSpace is still available and running.
