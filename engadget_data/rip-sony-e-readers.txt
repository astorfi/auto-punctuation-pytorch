Sony announced the closure of its own Reader store in favor of Kobo's platform earlier this year, and now it seems the company is nixing e-readers entirely. BBC reports that the Japanese outfit doesn't plan to release another device with last year's PRS-T3 serving as the most recent option. Thanks to Amazon's Kindle lineup and a growing number of tablet options, dedicated reading slates have seen declining sales since 2011.
