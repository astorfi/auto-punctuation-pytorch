It's been a few months since someone announced a major breakthrough with some fantastically capacious new storage
format, the last time around was Pioneer's 500GB ultraviolet laser optical disc, and then before that those 300GB
holographic discs from Optware, now InPhase is pimping a holographic drive that uses optical discs that could
potentially store as much as 1.6TB of data (as in terabytyes, as in a crazy amount of storage space). It's just a
prototype (there is nary a word on pricing or availability), which means our wiseass plan of skipping over
HD DVD and
Blu-ray and going straight to the
1.6TB motherlode probably won't fly, but InPhase says they're using the same kind of of blue lasers developed for
Blu-ray drives and Hitachi Maxell is developing the storage medium.
