During the 2008 MLB season, Royals fans can feast their eyes on a 100- by 85-foot Daktronics display that utilizes HD-X LED technology, which the ball club says is "the largest HD LED board in the world." Additionally, Kauffman Stadium will be receiving a number of other Daktronics-sourced upgrades in 2009 / 2010, including an outfield fence display that measures around 8- by 128-feet, a pair of "ribbon boards" measuring in at 4- x 380-feet, and two displays above the stadium's new Hall of Fame that each span 5- by 108-feet. Now, if the Royals themselves prove to be worth watching, taking in a game next season may not be such a bad idea.
