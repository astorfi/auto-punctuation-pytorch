Toshiba dropped a few more deets and a prototype SED (Surface-conduction Electron-emitter Display) television at the
IFA in Berlin. As we already told you, the first units
developed in cooperation with Canon will flaunt a 50-inch diagonal and hopefully sport an incredible
100,000:1 contrast ratio. We now know these super bright
and oh so thin boobs-o-tube will ship in March 2006 (Japan first most likely) with "full" HDTV resolution (1,920 x
1,080 pixels) and a response time of less than a millisecond. Damned impressiveâ€¦ with a price tag certain to
match.
