Microsoft announced today that Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition will be available as a disc-based game at all the usual US retail outlets on April 30th, where it'll set you back $19.99. The game will be otherwise identical to the downloadable version, and come complete with all the features and content that will be included in the forthcoming ninth update to the game. Gamers in Australia, Hong Kong, India, New Zealand, Singapore and Taiwan will have to wait a bit longer to get it, though, with release dates in those countries set for early June (other countries haven't been specified).
