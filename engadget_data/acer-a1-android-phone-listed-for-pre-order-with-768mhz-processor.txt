The spec sheet is rather intriguing, since it lists Android 2.0 Donut and a 768MHz Qualcomm 8250 processor, which is a 240MHz bump over every other Android set on the market right now. Pre-orders aren't insane at â‚¬389 ($571), but we'll see what official pricing and carrier support look like before we reach for our wallets.[Via Engadget German]
