The company would like to see higher margins from this business line, but whether this can be done by tuning its product offerings and retailers remains to be seen. In the worst case, the TV business could be sold off entirely. The fierce competition in the display market has already made for some strategic exits; could the venerable Philips be next? We'd suggest the company take a page from Pioneer's Kuro playbook in securing the high ground and emphasize high performance, not high concept. Work on the light coming from the display, not from around the bezel. [Via HDTV Reviews]
