  In news that should come as little surprise to anyone who's followed the decline of the ill-fated brand, HP is reportedly laying off 275 webOS employees as it transitions the division from producing hardware to open source software. The cuts have apparently been in the works since the company announced the move to open source back in December, and follow on the heels of former Palm chief, Jon Rubinstein's departure last month. A statement from the outfit cited the need for "a more nimble team" to "sustain HP's commitment to the software over the long term," and stated HP's intentions "to redeploy employees affected by these changes to other roles at the company." While reports have surfaced saying the cuts are primarily in engineering, we're told positions in multiple departments are at stake.
