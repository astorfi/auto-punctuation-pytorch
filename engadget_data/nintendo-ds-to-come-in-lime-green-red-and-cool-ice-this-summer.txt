Yes, kids, according to pre-order pages that popped up at a Spanish gaming retail site, Nintendo's ubiquitous portable gaming console of virtually every color will come in lime green, hot red, and ice blue starting some time around June 13. No other information is available just yet but we assume that the insides will be the same and the new colors will kick-start Ninty's summer sales massacre, at least in Europe. Bonus points for coming up with better color names than we did. Margarita? Cinnamon? C'mon.[Via NeoGAF]
