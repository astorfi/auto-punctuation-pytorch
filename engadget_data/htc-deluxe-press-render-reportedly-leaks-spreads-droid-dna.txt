 When the HTC Droid DNA leaked out into the wild, we'd learned that the DLX codename was really shorthand for "Deluxe," a title that was also attached to non-Verizon models like the J Butterfly. If @evleaks is correct, that's because HTC fully intends to have a reference version of the Deluxe on the market: the frequent rumor source has posted what looks to be a press image of the international model. There isn't much of a surprise if you've seen the Droid DNA, as it preserves all the red trim while replacing the Verizon logo with HTC's own. Most other details are left out -- there's no release date or hardware differences to pick out -- but the image may be a clue that those of us who live outside of Japan and the US could get own 1080p phone before too long.
