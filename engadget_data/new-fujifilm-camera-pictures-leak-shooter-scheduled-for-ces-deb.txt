The image above comes to you via Japanese forum, giving us a pretty good idea of what is allegedly Fujifilm's next interchangeable lens camera. Following in the footsteps of the retro-looking X10 and the X100, not much is known about the shooter's specs, but we'd venture that it probably isn't full-frame. Guess it won't take too long to find out, as the grapevine also muses its proper reveal will happen at CES. Too frothy to wait until then? Well, hop on past the break where we've conveniently culled an old mockup for ya.
