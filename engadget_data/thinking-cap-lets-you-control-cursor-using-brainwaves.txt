Getting us one tiny step closer to our goal of never having to use a mouse ever again, scientists at the New York
State Department of Health and State University of New York in Albany have figured out another non-invasive way for
people to use their thoughts to control an onscreen cursor. It involves wearing a special thinking cap with 64
electrods on it, and so far they've gotten it to work with four different people.


 P.S. - Since you're probably wondering, that pic at right shows a record of one person's thought-controlled cursor
movements, with blue where they were moving the cursor more slowly, and red where they were able to move it more
quickly.
