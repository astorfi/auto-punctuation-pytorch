Unfortunately, you won't be able to get your hands on the 12.3 megapixel fixed-lens beauty as early as anticipated. Turns out Fujifilm sold more on pre-order than expected and despite ramping up production, the retro shooters won't be available to US customers until the end of March or early April -- just a few more weeks, guys. Feel free to watch our hands-on video to occupy yourself whilst you wait.
