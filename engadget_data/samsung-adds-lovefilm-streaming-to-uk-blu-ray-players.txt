Samsung has just announced its intent to include Lovefilm movie streaming as an app on all of its Blu-ray players in the UK, enhancing both the subscription service's profile and its own claim to providing the user with multifunctional, "smart" technology. It's disappointing not to see this rollout effective across all of Lovefilm's European markets, but we guess small steps are better than no steps.
