 According to InfoWorld (via Yahoo News), contract manufacturer Quanta Computer has confirmed that they've received orders for one million of the long-awaited OLPC XO laptops anticipated by children and geeks alike, with orders expected to further increase throughout the rest of the year. If that goes as planned, Quanta says it could ship as many as ten million of the laptops before year's end, which would go a long way towards getting the little green laptop down to its intended $100 price point, possibly even ahead of the 2008 target date for a price drop. Quanta also revealed that NickNeg is apparently not the only one obsessed with the project, with company president Michael Wang saying "this is our chairman's pet project, it's his life." Not that there's anything wrong with being obsessed with a gadget, of course.
