As you can probably surmise, it's a slightly smaller version of the Galaxy S WiFi 4.0 (also known as the Galaxy Player in the US), with it boasting a 3.6-inch HVGA display, Android 2.3, a 1GHz OMAP processor, 8GB or 16GB of storage, a microSD card slot, GPS, a mic for VoIP calls, and dual cameras (2 megapixels 'round back and VGA on the front). Unfortunately for those elsewhere, this one is only confirmed for the UK so far, where it will sell for £149 and £169 (or roughly $240 and $270) in early October.
