       After last weeks disappointment with only one movie released for both formats which was the same movie and not even mentionable, both formats come out swinging. These are some of the heavy hitters we have been waiting for, like Batman Begins first and the every Dual Layer Blu-ray disc Click, which coincidentally was also recorded with HD cameras rather than film. Magnolia gets in the Blu-ray business with 6 movies and Warner continues to roll out the catalog titles like Army of Darkness. HD DVD's lead is by 22 movies, but at 3 more movies a week, HD DVD will probably still have the lead come Christmas time.This brings the total to HD DVD 90 vs Blu-ray 68.Blu-ray
