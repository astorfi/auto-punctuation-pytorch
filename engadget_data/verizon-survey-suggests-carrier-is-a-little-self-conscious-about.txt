A tipster to Boy Genius Report sent in some screenshots of an exit survey sent after canceling his service, and of the things Verizon could have "offered to keep you as a customer," the iPhone was the only hardware called out by name. Apple's baby goes on to appear in two more of the survey's questions, suggesting that there's some concern out there in Basking Ridge -- and considering that rumors of a CDMA iPhone for Verizon refuse to die down, maybe they're planning on doing something about it. Or... you know, maybe all you needed was an apology to be swayed to stay, you big softie, you.
