 Reggie Fils-Aime over at Nintendo has promised an "unprecedented" Wii supply boost for North America over the holiday season -- unfortunately, it's only "unprecedented" because Nintendo has never been able to keep up with demand. Doubly unfortunate for potential Wii purchasers, this extra supply will probably not meet demand over the holiday season period. Sounds like business as usual then: people wanting Wiis, but with Nintendo shipping just enough to be perpetually sold out. Marketing points 1 2, customer satisfaction 0.
