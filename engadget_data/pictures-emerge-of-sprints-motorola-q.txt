If you guessed "like any other Q but with Sprint logos strategically placed about its exterior," you'd only be partially correct. From these press shots, it looks like Sprint will be launching out of the gate with the new (arguably hotter-looking) black variant, a color that we've already heard CDMA rival Verizon would be picking up itself in the near future. Otherwise, we get a revised Sprint-specific theme slapped onto the handset's Windows Mobile UI, the aforementioned Sprint logos front and rear, and that's about it. We still don't have an exact drop date, but current rumors have customers being able to get their QWERTY on some time between mid-December and early January. Click on for more eye candy!
