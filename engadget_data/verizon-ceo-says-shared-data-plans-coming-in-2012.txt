 Verizon is gearing up to offer shared data plans sometime in 2012. That's straight from CEO Lowell McAdam, who told the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference this morning, "I think in 2012 we will see it... Getting to one bill and getting to account-level pricing is our goal." Sharing data the way they do family plan minutes is something many consumers have been clamoring for and AT&T's CEO Ralph de la Vega indicated earlier this year that his carrier was planning to offer such an option. Soon enough you might be able to buy a chunk of minutes and data then pile on the lines for a flat rate.
