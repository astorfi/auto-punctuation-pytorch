Nothing is ever easy for DVR pioneer TiVo. What
with being the first to market with an innovative product, and having that device become a generic verb a la Xerox, we
would have thought the company's future looked bright. Alas, several
atrophied partnerships and an ultra-competitive market
have left TiVo scrambling to survive as of late, even
after that quarter in the black. Their latest attempt to
drum up business follows a time-honored two-pronged approach: slash prices and give away prizes. The former is being
accomplished by dropping the cost of their
base unit by a whopping 75%, to only $50 (after mail-in rebate, natch). Next, they are searching for a fan so
addicted to his/her precious TiVo, that he/she and only he/she can be crowned TiVo Ambassador. Perks of the position
include an honorary title (nothing impresses the ladies/fellas like being King/Queen of all Geeks), $25,000 cold hard
cash, a MINI convertible, blogging privileges (clearly an oxymoron) on TiVo's website, and the chance to attend PR
events. Long live the TiVo Ambassador, may he/she be a wise and generous ruler.
