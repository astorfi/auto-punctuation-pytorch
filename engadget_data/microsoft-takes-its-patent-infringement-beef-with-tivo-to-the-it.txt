 The patent fight between Microsoft/AT&T and TiVo has entered a new venue today now that Microsoft filed suit with the International Trade Commission to stop importation of TiVo's DVRs. WinRumors pinged Microsoft about the latest development and predictably found it's still interested in pursuing resolution through some sort of IP licensing deal, so we wouldn't worry too much about any of those Premieres being yanked off of shelves or cable company trucks. We'll have to wait and see what happens next, and also what Verizon may plan to do to resolve its own infringement issues with TiVo, but those interested can check out the filing itself embedded after the break.
