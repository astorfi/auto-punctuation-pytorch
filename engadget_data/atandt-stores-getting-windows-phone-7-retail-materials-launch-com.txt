Don't get too excited, however: we're told that cards like this have hit in July for September launches in the past -- which would line up with that hint of an October Telstra launch -- and that the "QTY: 6" label likely points to two devices, not a sextuplet. (We'd guess... Samsung and LG?) Either way, it would be a big win for Microsoft if it can manage to get Windows Phone 7 in store shelves before that promised "holiday 2010" due date -- we'll see what happens.
