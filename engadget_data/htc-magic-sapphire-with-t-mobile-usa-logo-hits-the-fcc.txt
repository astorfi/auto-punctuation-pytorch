Well, it's back for Round Two, and this time the images clearly have the company's logo emblazoned at the top, just as it was at MWC when Google was showcasing its offline Gmail, and 7.2Mbps HSDPA. Yep, it's clearly heading to you-know-who's 3G network. No "G2" in sight, so for now we'll have to wait to see which of the three likely names -- or something else entirely -- T-Mo decides to run with.  [Via Cellphone SIgnal]
