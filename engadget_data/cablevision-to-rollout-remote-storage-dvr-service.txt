 Think DVR'sdisruptive? What happens when your cable company starts in with hosted VOD of your DVR? Sure, cable companies alreadyhave VOD for a lot of programming, but it's typically premium content like HBO, and doesn't have commercials anyway.Well, not anymore; Cablevision's apparently testing atime-shifted "remote-storage" DVR service so you can get the TiVo-effect without the TiVo, so to speak -- noone would have to touch their cable box or equipment to use a DVR, and it would cost less, they claim, than the current$9.95 they charge for DVR box rental. We don't know if it supports HD, but what strikes us as odd is that eachsubscriber gets 80 hours of storage on their RS DVR -- surely everyone will record everything, and that'll result inmassive dupes and a less useful service than just keeping a single central recording of every channel's video feed, andallowing all customers to browse through a completely 100% time-shifted television experience (like what Time Warner wasplanning with Mystro). This is going to ruffle some feathers though, content providers are having a hard enough timesmiling through their teeth at DVR-wielding cable companies. But now making it that much easier and taking the box outof the equation is sure to revive some of the old ire and arguments.
