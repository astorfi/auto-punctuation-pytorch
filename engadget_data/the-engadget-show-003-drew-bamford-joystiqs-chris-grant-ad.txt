 
This is a big one, folks. The new installment of The Engadget Show is jam-packed with goodness. First up, Josh sits down with HTC's director of user experience Drew Bamford to discuss Android, Sense, Windows Mobile and a whole lot more. Then we've got a charming little segment where Paul and Josh go hunting around NYC for KIRFs, and Chris Grant joins the gang on stage for a dissection of the holiday gaming situation... and some demos where the gang gets to show off their totally radical moves. Seriously, Josh and Nilay have a DJ Hero battle, and Paul Miller skates (but doesn't die) in Tony Hawk: Ride. Don't miss this one -- it might just be the best yet! Full video is after the break.
