On this quiet Monday, Samsung decided to do a little teaser for its upcoming "Premiere 2013" roadshow event in London on June 20th. The above poster only mentions "Galaxy & ATIV," which suggest the event will mainly feature Android and Windows-based devices. The remaining tiles show partial shots of three mysterious devices -- possibly a tablet or phone, a convertible laptop (Ã  la Sony VAIO Duo 11) and a camera (maybe the rumored Galaxy S 4 Zoom?). Obviously, we'll be at the event to solve this mystery, so stay tuned for more.
