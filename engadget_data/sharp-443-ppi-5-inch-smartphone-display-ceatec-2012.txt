Although the vivid 1080p displays were scurried away in the corner of Sharp's stand, we managed to grab a few photos of its 443ppi -- likely smartphone-bound -- tech. From these prototype samples (the screen will go into production later this month), it's looking pretty good, with Sharp's thinnest GS-Silicon technology reducing the layers between the LCD display and our eyes. Although we were told not to touch, viewing angles were also impressive -- we could see ourselves gazing at YouTube clips on this screen in whichever smartphone it ends up on. Sharp weren't talking manufacturers just yet, but you can take a closer look in our gallery below.

 Update: Sharp also quietly exhibited its 6.1-inch 498ppi panel on the other end of the booth, but we were told it won't be out in the market until next year.
