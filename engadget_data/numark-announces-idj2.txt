Other niceties include an LCD screen for track-profiling andwaveform display, scratch, pitch, loop, and cue controls, and USB and auxiliary inputs for hooking up nearly any audiosource. We do know that this model will support MP3, OGG, and AAC tracks, but have no idea when it will be released,nor how much it will cost compared to its $250 predecessor.
