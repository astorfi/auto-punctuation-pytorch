Students from the University of California, San Diego are taking Microsoft's much-hacked peripheral on an archeological dig in Jordan, using the device to help create 3D scans of the site on the cheap. The hack pulls data captured by the Kinect's camera and infrared scanner, turning the information into avatars that can be plugged into virtual worlds. The hack's creator is hoping that it might some day be able to capture information as complex as a buildings or neighborhoods. The first, decidedly less ambitious application is being referred to as "ArKinect," because what's a cool hack without a cool name?
