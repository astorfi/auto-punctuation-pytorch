Aimed at students and small businesses, the lightweight (4.6 lb), 13.3" laptops come in a range of configurations, but all feature Intel 965 chipsets, SuperMulti CD/DVD-R drives, and a 1.3 megapixel webcam. Here's a detailed breakdown of the models:

Satellite U305-S5097 - Intel Pentium 1.86GHz dual-core T2130 processor, 1GB RAM (maxium 4GB), 160GB hard drive, 802.11b/g, Intel GMA 950
Satellite U305-S5107 - Intel Core 2 Duo 1.73GHz T5300 processor, 2GB RAM (maximum 4GB), 160 GB hard drive, 802.11a/g/n, Intel GMA 950, Bluetooth 2.0, fingerprint reader
Satellite U305-S5127 - Intel Core 2 Duo 1.80GHz T7100 processor, 2GB RAM (maximum 4GB), 200GB hard drive, 802.11a/g/n, Intel GMA X3100, Bluetooth 2.0, fingerprint reader

In addition to the new Satellite line, the company has added three new variations to its Qosmio F45 collection, called the Qosimo AV. The entertainment-targeted laptops all include Harmon-Kardon speakers, built-in subwoofers, Dolby Home Theater technology, and boast Core 2 Duo 1.66GHz T5250 processors, 15.4" WXGA displays, and 802.11a/g/n. Toshiba also announced the addition of Intel Centrino Duo processors and HD-DVD drives to the current P205 gang.Read -- Satellite U305 press releaseRead -- Qosmio F45 AV press releaseRead -- Satellite P205 press release
