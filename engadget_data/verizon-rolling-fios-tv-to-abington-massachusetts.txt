Thanks to receiving a cable franchise in the region, the provider is gearing up to route its service to 5,000 more households, and when complete, The Bay State will have 66 FiOS TV-capable communities. Unfortunately, there's no definitive launch date set just yet, but judging by history, we'd guess that it won't be long now before orders are being taken.
