 The HD-A1 isn't the only next generation format player that was shipped with a few issues. In this day and age firmware updates are a way of life for almost every high tech device. As much of a pain as it can be, we are very happy that manufactures can admit when they messed up and send a fix out. Although Samsung has yet to release any updates for their BD-P1000, by signing up you can be that sure you're the first to know. Don't worry if you don't want to sign up, we got you covered.
