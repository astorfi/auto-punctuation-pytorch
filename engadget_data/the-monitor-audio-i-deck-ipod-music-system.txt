We've seen iPod speaker systems come and go (mostly go), and it's pretty fair to say at this point that if you're
going to bring one to market, it's got to stand out from the rest. Sure, i-deck's iPod Music System might not trump
Ignitek's Judge Reinhold-size iCarrier speaker cab, but
at least it does come in the surprisingly spacially inefficient shape of a parallelogram. And yes, it's also going to
set you back a couple hundred bucks.
