Users in Brazil, India, Japan, Russia, and South Korea are among those who can begin populating their phones with new apps, but this also means Microsoft has a long way to go before covering its entire user base. Fortunately, the Marketplace itself should receive a much needed shot in the arm because Redmond is now accepting submissions from seven more nations. While China hasn't made the "approved" list, Microsoft insists it's working to change this by early autumn. Developers who want more coin will need to enable access for these new countries in the App Hub, and if you've been working on readying your application for Mango, the company suggests it will begin accepting submissions one month from now. Curious which places made the Who's Who list? You'll find a complete list of nations with access to the Marketplace just past the break. Check it out, will ya?
