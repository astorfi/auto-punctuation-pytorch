 As per usual we suggest taking this with a grain of salt, but Joystiq pointed us to a CVG post rumoring Satoru Iwata's keynote speech Thursday at the Game Developers Conference in San Jose would be used to finally givethe Revolution a real name -- they even brought up the possibly of launching the console as early as June. If you askus (which you didn't) we think all things considered a June launch is highly unlikely, and they'd save theirannouncements for a larger platform like E3. But hey, we didn'texactly see that Revolution controller coming either, so whoknows with what or how Nintendo wants to surprise us in the next two months.[Via Joystiq]
