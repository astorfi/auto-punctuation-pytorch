The run was made in the Imperial Valley of California, by a team who somehow got access to a loop of closed (and presumably rather flat) roads and ran them over and over and over again through the course of two days. The result was quite impressive: 347.2 miles. Perhaps not entirely practical or attainable to the average driver, but impressive nevertheless.
