 Despite 2009 being the best box office year of all time hitting a record $10 billion, the Digital Entertainment Group has announced that the home media market continues to lose ground when compared to last year. The first six months of 2010 still managed to earn $8.8 billion for Hollywood, which is still a lot, but it is down 3.3 percent when compared to the first half of 2009. This is despite the fact that Blu-ray revenues were up 83 percent over the same period hitting a new record of $982 million for both sales and rentals. And digital distribution was also up to new heights gaining 23 percent and hitting the new record of $1.1 billion (which includes sales and VOD). Sales were actually almost flat in the second quarter, but it would've taken a lot to make up for the lost ground in the first quarter. This is obviously a white whine as not many industries would complain about only earning over a billion dollars a month and actually transactions were up 2.3 percent, which does indicate there might be a trend towards renting vs buying during hard economic times. The 30 day value rental window imposed by Warner and others might help explain why the second quarter fared better than the first, but one quarter alone isn't enough to call the practice a success. Full release with many more details after the jump.
