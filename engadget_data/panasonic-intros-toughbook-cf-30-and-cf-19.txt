Both laptops sport "record breaking" brightness, with 550 nits in the CF-19 and 1,000 nits in the CF-30, supposedly the brightest LCD ever to be stuffed into a laptop, so neither laptop should be much trouble to read outdoors. The new CF-19 (pictured) follows up the Pentium M CF-18 with a 1.06GHz U2400 Core Duo processor, 80GB HDD, 512MB of RAM (with room for a handy 4GB total), a 10.4-inch XGA touchscreen in regular or Tablet PC configuration, EV-DO or HSDPA WWAN, Bluetooth 2.0, a/b/g WiFi and an optional GPS and fingerprint scanner. They've stuck with the same form factor, which measures 1.9-inches thick and weighs 5 pounds, though the standard battery life has been bumped up to 7 hours. The CF-30 (pictured after the break) matches its swivel-screen sibling quite well, though the luxury of a 13.3-inch XGA touchscreen, 1.66GHz L2400 Core Duo processor and slot for extra battery or disc drive will really cost you in the size department: the laptop measures 2.8-inches thick and weighs 8.2 pounds, while "only" managing 6 hours of battery. Of course, the main point of these things is their magnesium alloy cases, sealed keyboards and ports, and shock mounted screens and hard drives which makes them quite drop-kick ready, and jacks the price to $4,700 for the CF-30 and $4,200 for the CF-20. Both laptops should be out this December.
