In case you need your memory jogged, Knox focuses on providing enterprise security features that let business and personal content coexist on the same handset. Like BlackBerry Balance, the solution cordons off work-related apps, email accounts and the like in secure containers, while keeping personal things without password protection. Though the GS4 will nab Knox first, other Samsung devices are set to receive it as well.
