Playing with Windows 7's new touch features, it almost seems feasible to use the OS with a finger (gasp!), and the screen can also accept pen input (based on pressure-sensitive Wacom technology) when your blunt jabs aren't getting the job done. The multitouch prowess is most evident using Microsoft's Surface-inspired Touch Pack applications, which come pre-installed, but it's also a nice way to get around in Internet Explorer. Other perks of the machine include a 360-degree rotating hinge, a hot-swappable drive bay, and all the internal accouterments (SSD, 3G) one could ask for. Video demo is after the break.
