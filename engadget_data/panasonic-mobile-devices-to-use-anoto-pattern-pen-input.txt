 Panasonic is pushing further into touchscreen technology at CES, and it's not content with finger control alone. Thankfully, Anoto is more than willing to help with a deal to drive the pen input behind multiple Panasonic mobile devices. Its technique, which tracks a stylus' position across a near-invisible grid of uniquely positioned dots, lets would-be artists draw on Panasonic's 4K tablet and other hardware with higher accuracy and fewer worries about the touch surface's size or composition. Anoto hasn't said how long the partnership will last, but the initial scale suggests that it's more than just a short-term union.
