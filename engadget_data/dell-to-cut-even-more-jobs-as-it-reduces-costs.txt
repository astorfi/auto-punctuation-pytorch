 Looks like Dell's plan to trim $3B in costs from its budget is going to involve even more job cuts than the 8,800 already announced -- speaking to analysts today, Michael Dell said that his company's management had "identified a very significant opportunity" to cut costs, and that it was "aggressively going after it." That means even more jobs will be slashed, apparently -- a further 1,000 this quarter at least, but Dell wouldn't say what the total would be in the end, just that it would be more than 8,800. Dell went on to say that no part of the company would be considered sacred as cuts are considered, and that Dell's brass thinks that it's "begun the journey to transform the company." Cutting jobs is one way to do it, sure -- but might we suggest focusing on delivering great products would also help?
