 It happens all the time -- someone misspoke. During an address at Build yesterday, a Microsoft employee told a crowd that the company has taken to calling its apps "Windows 8 Store Applications." Turns out that's not quite right -- the proper terminology is the slightly more elegant "Windows Store apps," as per a note from a Redmond spokesperson. So there you go. No more Metro, no more "Windows 8 Store applications" -- just plain, old "Windows Store apps."
