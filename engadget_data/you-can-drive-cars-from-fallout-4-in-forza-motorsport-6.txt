Can't wait until November 10th to wander through a desolate nuclear wasteland? That's a little weird, dude -- but if you need something to tide you over until Fallout 4 hits stores, Forza Motorsport 6 may have the ticket: starting today, players will be able to download a Fallout-themed 1956 Ford F100 for free.



For the most part, the new car is a standard model F100 draped in a rusted blue and gold paint job and adorned with Fallout logos and branding. According to the DLC's announcement video, it's "the next best thing to an atomic car: one that runs entirely on gasoline." Looking for something a bit more retro-futuristic? Sit tight: the announcement also teases "The Chryslus Rocket 69," a dome-topped space car "coming for Fallout 4 players only on Xbox One."
