The Gingerbread handset received warm welcomes on TurkCell due to its inexpensive cost -- and included NFC functionality included doesn't hurt either. Just as it officially launched there, however, we were pleasantly surprised to see the Huawei UMG587 -- labelled the "T-Mobile Sonic" -- get pushed through the FCC. The docs not only confirm 850 / 1900 / 2100 3G bands thrown on top of T-Mobile's AWS, but also bluntly mention HSPA+ download speeds will be maxed out at 42Mbps. We found it interesting that Turkcell's model only reaches 7.2Mbps, so we're hoping the full maximum speeds aren't tweaked or throttled here. The T-Mobile (or "T-Moblie," if you believe the image above) branding makes it difficult to dispute this phone's US destiny, but inclusion of AT&T frequencies has us curious if the Sonic will eventually Rethink Possible.
