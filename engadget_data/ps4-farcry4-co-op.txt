Looking forward to playing FarCry 4 with your friends? Sony says if you buy it for the PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 3, you'll only need one copy between you. Taking the stage at the company's E3 2014 PlayStation event, Sony VP of developer relations Adam Boyes explained that folks playing the game on PSN would be able to invite their friends to play with them even if they don't own the game. How is this possible? Boyes didn't say, exactly, but it sounds like an ideal use case for PlayStation Now -- Sony's Gaikai-sourced cloud-streaming service. Sony doesn't say how many of your friends you can share this gratis multiplayer experience with, but as a Sony-exclusive feature, it's a pretty killer draw for folks on the fence about what platform to buy for.
