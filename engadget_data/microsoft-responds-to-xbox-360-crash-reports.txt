We know Microsoft has a lot riding on the Xbox
360's success, so it makes sense that in response to the first
reports of Xbox crashes, they told Reuters there were "a
few isolated reports of consoles not working as expected" for a "very, very small fraction" of Xboxes sold, and that
their "number of calls was not unexpected." Maybe so, maybe no; there are always a certain amount of defective units on
any product launch — especially one as huge as this — and it's not usually something anyone can call just based reports
on forums alone. Molly O'Donnell, Microsoft spokesperson, called it "Par for the course." Then again, we did have to
call the Xbox support line about six times before we could even get on hold to talk to someone, and wound up on the
horn over two and a half hours because one of our retail units (the one that crashed a couple times) wouldn't (and
still won't) connect to Live. We'll have to chalk that up to amazing odds, since only time will tell how pervasive and
persistent the Xbox 360 crash problems really are, but in the mean time Microsoft says they'll overnight repair or
replace any defective 360s in your midst. So if you're seeing screens like those above, holla at 'em.
