This beauty forgoes the typical keys for a swank AV system, as users will be graced with dual Pioneer DVJ-X1 DVD Players, a trio of Marshal LCD monitors, and an Edirol V-4 video mixer -- and that's just the video front. As far as audio is concerning, you'll find an Allen and Heath Xone 92 audio mixer, dual 15-inch subwoofers, an 18-incher to handle the low-lows, a 12-inch subwoofer strictly for bragging rights, three Bullet tweeters, and an AB 1,100-watt amplifier to provide the juice. Furthermore, these bad boys can be customized to the hilt for those willing to pay the price, as deep-pocketed customers can add hydraulic legs and lid, neon accents, personalized paint jobs, and fog / laser adornments. Unsurprisingly, you'll have to contact the manufacturer and maintain a serious line of credit before you'll get a price range on this thing, but if you've got to ask, you know it's out of reach.
