 We're here at Nintendo's Wii U event in New York City where the gaming outfit's prexy Reggie Fils-Aime just announced US pricing and release details for the console, as well as it's own unique TVii service. And now that those important tidbits have been squared away, it's time to focus on the hardware. Yes, you may have seen the Wii U console many times before, but the House that Mario built's been notoriously stingy about giving media access to a non-tethered unit. Well, the time has come to see nearly every facet of this next-gen contender. As you'll note in the gallery below, the only area the Big N wouldn't let us photograph is this Premium version's backside. For whatever reason, the company doesn't want those ports shown, but we can tell you what they consist of: AC adapter, AV multiout, sensor bar, HDMI out and what looks like two ports for USB. Undecided on whether you should be placing that pre-order right about now? Then take a tour of this onyx pair and see if it changes things any.
