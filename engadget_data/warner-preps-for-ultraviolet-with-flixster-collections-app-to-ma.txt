Currently running on Macs or PCs, it's not concerned with where your media is -- it ties in with Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, iTunes then asks about your disc collection and downloaded files -- but it wants to index all of it. Once everything is imported, you can browse through them in a Netflix-style interface and even share them over different social networks. As Home Media Magazine points out, the access to titles from all studios is an important first here, but until UltraViolet actually launches, there's not much to do once all your information is out there. Hit the source link to try it out yourself, and make sure you've got the requisite logins handy, you'll be a while.
