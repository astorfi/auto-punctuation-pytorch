Well, Sony's jumping on the ballooning bandwagon of manufacturers with a heart for touchscreen PCs, putting forward its very first model with the all-new L series all-in one. Sony is billing it as part HDTV and part PC (in typical Sony fashion), with Blu-ray playback and what sounds to be a TV tuner tucked underneath, piling up to a $1,300 starting price. Not bad for a 24-inch multitouch screen.  Update: We just went hands-on with the VAIO L and it's got a pretty great touchscreen sensor -- quite responsive and accurate, even in multitouch gestures. Unfortunately, the TouchSmart-style software that Sony's packed in his woefully half-baked. Hopefully what we saw was just an early prototype of sorts, or Sony's got some serious work to before October 22. Overall the hardware is pretty Sony-ish and minimal, while the glossy display looks pretty brilliant. Pics below.
