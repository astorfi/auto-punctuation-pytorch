If you have a Mac and use an iOS device, Apple just announced an enjoyable feature to go along with the new version of OS X, also known as Mavericks: the ability to push iOS notifications directly to your Mac, regardless of whether or not Safari is open. The alerts show up as a banner in the top right corner of your display, much the same as any other Mac-related banner; additionally, any missed notifications will pop up in your lock screen any time you wake up your device.
