Seemingly, the WL-700gE is just another digital media server packing 802.11b/g WiFi, a 3.5-inch 160GB internal disk drive, 4 x wired Ethernet ports, 3 x USB 2.0 jacks, a built-in firewall, and plenty of on-board apps to serve-up data via Web browser, FTP, Samba, and UPnP/DLNA. It'll even share USB tethered webcams, speakers, and printers across your net. But did you know that buried in the product details (which might explain how we missed the product announcement earlier this year) is support for computer-less BitTorrenting directly over the box's WAN port? That little nugget not only frees-up your in-home bandwidth but allows you to put your computer to sleep as that sweet, sweet media rolls in overnight. So go ahead, pick up the roughly $250 box as priced on-line, slap on a few 750GB drives and put down a retainer for a good trial lawyer, you know, just in case you get carried away.[Via dailywireless]
