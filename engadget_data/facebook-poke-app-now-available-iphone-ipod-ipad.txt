 It's pretty tough to "Poke" someone -- digitally, anyway -- with a straight face. But toss a sophisticated smartphone into that equation, and... well, it's still just as tough. For those who'd like to make awkward family gatherings even more awkward way less awkward this holiday season, hit up the source links to get the (free) Facebook Poke app for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. With the Poke app, you can poke or send a message, photo, or video to Facebook friends "to share what you're up to in a lightweight way," with each message expiring after 1, 3, 5 or 10 seconds. If you ever see something you're uncomfortable with, you can click the gear menu and report it. Not that you have any friends that would weird you out or anything.
