When you have $75 grand to spend on your set and it has to
be a thin display, then nothing less than LG's 71-inch plasma will do. Able to display 1080p (yes, progressive scan),
it comes with a home theater system, and a digital set-top box for tuning into hi-def broadcasts, but it's only
currently available in Korea. If that's just a little bit too rich for your blod, there's always the Panasonic 65-inch
plasma, which will only set you back $22,000.
