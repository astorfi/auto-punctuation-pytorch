 
The Sony Defense Force has reason to celebrate today, as the circle is now complete -- where Netflix HD once spited PS3 for Xbox 360, today Hulu Plus has chosen the PlayStation for limited console exclusivity through the end of the year. Today, "a select group" of PlayStation Plus subscribers can download the Hulu Plus app and start watching immediately, while regular ol' paying members can ask nicely (via the same app) and wait patiently for the privilege of shelling out an additional $10 a month. Those who aren't dropping $50 a year on PlayStation Plus aren't entirely out of luck, they'll just have to wait till the end of the preview period to get their Hulu on. Press release after the break, more info at the official PlayStation.Blog.
