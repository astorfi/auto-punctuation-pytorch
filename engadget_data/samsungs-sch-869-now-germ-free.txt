What's up LG? Can't take Samsung's heat on having more
advanced antibacterial cellphones than you do?
Dude, better work quick on that — people are getting each others' flu all the time, and it's all because of you and
your filthy germ-ridden handsets. Samsung's new SCH-869 uses colloidal silver paint to kill germs; what, are you guys
still spraying down people's phones with solution? And
can't you guys release a SARS phone while you're at it?
