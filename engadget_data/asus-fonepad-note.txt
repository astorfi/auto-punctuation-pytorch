At its Computex 2013 showcase event, ASUS introduced the new FonePad Note FHD 6, an Android tablet with stylus support that rocks a slightly smaller form factor than the FonePad announced at MWC. On the front of the device is a 6-inch, 1080p Super IPS+ display, a 1.2-megapixel camera and front-facing stereo speakers (think: the HTC One). The main shooter packs an 8-megapixel sensor, and inside the slate-come-phone is a dual-core 1.6GHz processor (Atom Z2560) paired with 2GB of RAM. While this is billed as a tablet, a 3G antenna is on board for calling and DC-HSPA+ data, so it should handle download speeds up to 42Mbps. No pricing or availability details for the FonePad Note (we doubt Samsung's pleased with that name) have been announced, but we'll let you know if we get any additional intel.
