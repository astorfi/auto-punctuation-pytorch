 
Just as promised, we got a hold of the Marantz BD8002, the company's first Blu-ray player. It was hard to let it go once we did, but the $2100 price tag made it a little easier. Silicon Optix Realta, HDMI 1.3, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD MA support. We want it all, and we want it now; but even the well-heeled among you will have to wait until Q2 2008 for this rig. And if you're looking for a pic of the remote, trust us -- we asked, too. Sorry, it's not final yet.
