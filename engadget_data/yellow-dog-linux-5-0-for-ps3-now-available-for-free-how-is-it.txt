 It's been kinda sorta available since mid-November, but it wasn't since the past week or two that Terra Soft's Yellow Dog Linux 5.0 was freely available (i.e. you didn't have to pay $100 for the DVDs) to make all your open-source PS3 dreams come true. Granted, they've made it pretty damned difficult to find the free version online, but supposedly it's a done deal. For the uninitiated, anyone looking for a more refined and pre-packaged approach to getting Linux on their PlayStation 3 should look no further than the Yellow Dog for Sony's officially sanction build; so what we want to know is, for those lucky and brave enough to have a PS3 and try to install Linux on it (respectively), what have your experiences been like with the Dog? Has it been worth your while? We're still holding out until Ubuntu gives us the love we crave. Well, that or until the OSS community get started on making an XBMC-like PS3 interface, since Sony believes all of your home's media should live on the PS3, and not on a media server. Right.
