After all, the bizarre gray exterior (just a reflection, perhaps?) seems incongruent with the rest of the phone, the contents of the external display are obviously faked, and the coloration of the Verizon logo doesn't make a lot of sense -- not to mention that the concept of a CDMA-based MOTORAZR MAXX is a bit... shall we say, new to us. Alas, it turns out the picture's authenticity is rock solid (not to say it's not a Photoshop job, but if it is, it's an official one) seeing how we just downloaded it off Motorola's official site for press multimedia. We know nothing about it besides what we're seeing here, but truth be told, the picture alone is a lot to process: Verizon gets a strangely colored variant of a high-end RAZR we didn't even know existed. It looks like a 2-megapixel cam is in the cards, and if the specs mirror its GSM cousin, we can expect a QVGA display, microSD expansion, and 50 odd megabytes of internal storage -- not a bad piece to slot in right above the K1m, if we do say so ourselves. As soon as we catch wind of availability (or catch wind that Motorola is playing an extraordinarily unsportsmanlike practical joke on us), we'll pass on the good word.[Thanks, Pioneer]
