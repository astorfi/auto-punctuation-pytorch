While MobiBlu's offering still battles for the oft-contested crown ofworld's smallest digital audio player, the Easy Cube is a bit bulkier, at about 2.75-inches per side. That added bulkgives it room for an SD slot and speaker. There's no display or internal storage, and we can only imagine what kind ofglorious sound emanates from that 2-inch speaker, but it's only $50, which is less than some other display-free SD-basedplayers that don't have the Easy Cube's good looks or built-in speaker (though we're still not convinced there's areal need for any display-free SD players at any price).[Via The MP3 Players]
