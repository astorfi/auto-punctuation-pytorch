We were particularly taken with the HDR CX760V/B Handycam. Its Balanced Optical SteadyShot image stabilization feature moves the entire optical block, which significantly helped to maintain image stability during our hands-on. There's ample storage, with 96GB already baked in, while, like the rest of Sony's Handycam range there's also a back-lit Exmor R sensor.

The HDR XR260V/B manages full HD video capture, 8.9 megapixel stills, optical image stabilization, a wide-angle G lens capable of 30x optical zoom. Storage is provided by a 160GB hard drive. Other models arrives with a Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar and a 2.7-inch touchscreen, available in both 8GB (CX210/B) and flash storage-only (CX200/B) models. The CX190/B follows the same vein, although it's limited to manual controls.

The TD20V/S packs two sensors able to record high-definition 3D content at 1920 x 1080, or 24.1 megapixel stills. The 3D lens can also manage 10x optical, while there's a built-in glasses-free 3D display to showcase your content immediately. 64GB should ensure there's plenty of space for the data-hungry content.

The PJ760V/B (96GB) and PJ710V/B (32GB) forgoes the 3D bells and whistles in favor of a built-in projector. There's balanced optical steady shot and a wide-angle Carl Zeiss Lens. The projector itself is capable of expanding your content up to 100 inches. Sound quality is cared for by a 5.1 surround mic. The PJ580V/B (32GB), PJ260V/B (16GB) and the removable storage-only PJ200V/B lists similar specs, but carries the more standard optical stabilization. Prices aren't yet announced, but expect the family to arrive before the end of the summer.
