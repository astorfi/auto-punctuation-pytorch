Now that Alienware has ordered up themselves a bunch of these $130 Phantom Wireless Lapboards and Wireless Laser Mouse setups for sale with their Media Center PC and PC lineup, we suppose we'll have to admit that Phantom just might hit their projected November launch date after all. Of course, they could always pull a Sony and blame increased demand for some unforeseen delays -- we suppose we'll find out soon enough.
