       IOGEAR and DisplayLink are here with the second wireless USB demo at CES. This time, we've got an adapter that adds multiple "high-resolution" displays via a WUSB connection between laptops, desktops and their WUSB enabled monitors. IOGEAR's new WUSB to VGA Video Adapter supports "instantaneous mouse and keyboard movements" with output resolutions as high as 1680 x 1050 pixels and 16.7 million colors -- presumably less (they don't say) as you add multiple displays. Expect the Wireless USB Graphics Adapter (UGA) to be commercially available by mid 2008. We don't have a picture yet, but it's likely to look a whole lot like the DisplayLink reference design you're looking at to the right.
