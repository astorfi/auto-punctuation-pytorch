 
Been itching to get your hands on a personal supercomputer, as NVIDIA's ad wizards put it? The company has just announced that its CUDA-based Tesla C1060 GPU is now available in Dell's Precision R5400, T5500 and T7500 workstations. And just to put things into perspective, NVIDIA points out that a Dell workstation rockin' a single Tesla C1060 has enough going on under the hood to power the control system for the European Extremely Large Telescope project ("the world's largest," apparently). According to one of the developers, Jeff Meisel at National Instruments, a workstation "equipped with a single Tesla C1060 can achieve near real-time control of the mirror simulation and controller, which before wouldn't be possible in a single machine without the computational density offered by GPUs." Wild, huh? If you're curious about the workout that Tesla GPUs are getting on a wide range of projects, from Bio-Informatics to Computational Chemistry to Molecular Dynamics and more -- or if you're merely a glutton for long-winded PR -- check out the good stuff after the break.

 

Personal SuperComputing With DELL: NVIDIA Tesla GPUs Now Shipping In DELL WorkstationsNVIDIA Tesla GPU Computing Solutions Become Mainstream as Number of GPU Optimized Applications SoarsFor further information, contact:Andrew HumberNVIDIA Corporation(408) 416 7943ahumber@nvidia.comFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:SANTA CLARA, CA -MAY 6, 2009- NVIDIA Corporation, inventor of the GPU, today announced that the Tesla™ C1060 GPU Computing processor, based on the massively parallel CUDA™ architecture, is now available in Dell Precision R5400, T5500 and T7500 workstations."The Dell Precision R5400, T7500 and T5500 together with the Tesla GPU computing processors is putting the power of supercomputing on the desktop," said Greg Weir, senior manager, Dell Product Group. "We have seen early praise for the efforts of both Dell and NVIDIA to bring an economical high-performance computing solution to the most demanding customers.""National Instruments is developing the control system for the European Extremely Large Telescope project, which upon completion will be the world's largest. To tackle this computational challenge, we developed a CUDA interface with LabVIEW to simulate and control the M1 mirror consisting of 984 individual segments," said Jeff Meisel product manager for LabVIEW at National Instruments. "A Dell workstation equipped with a single Tesla C1060, can achieve near real-time control of the mirror simulation and controller, which before wouldn't be possible in a single machine without the computational density offered by GPUs."Another community sure to benefit from the mass market availability of this technology is the computational researcher. Based in the world's leading research schools such as Harvard, Cambridge or Tokyo Institute of Technology, these researchers fight for time on a shared supercomputing resource that consumes hundreds of kilowatts of power and costs millions of dollars to build and maintain. Dell Precision Workstations enabled with Tesla GPUs give each of these researchers their own "personal supercomputer" - the equivalent computing power of a cluster, at 1/100th of the price.CUDA applications actively in use today by these researchers and organizations include:Oil and gas* Acceleware: Kirchoff Time Migration library* ffA: 3D Seismic processing software* Headwave: Prestack data processing* Mercury Computer systems: 3D data visualization* SeismicCity: 3D seismic imaging for prestack depth migration* SMT: Kingdom – Seismic ProcessingComputational Chemistry and Molecular Dynamics:* GROMACS molecular dynamics* HOOMD molecular dynamics* NAMD molecular dynamics* VMD visualization of molecular dynamicsBio-Informatics and Life Sciences:* GPU HMMER: CUDA version of HMMER* LISSOM: Human neocortex modeling* MUMmerGPU: High-throughput DNA sequencingFinancial Computing and Options Pricing:* Aqumin: 3D Visualization of market data* Exegy: Risk Analysis* Hanweck: options pricing* SciComp: derivatives pricingMathematical Computing* Jacket CUDA plugin for MATLAB from Accelereyes* LabVIEW from National InstrumentsGeoSciences:* Tsunami simulation – Tokyo Institute of Technology* Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model* Geographical Information Systems - ManifoldMedical Imaging, CT, MRI:* AxeRecon CT reconstruction library from Acceleware* SnapCT tomographic reconstruction software from DigisensElectrodynamics and Electromagnetics* CST Microware Studio* FDTD solver from AccelewareElectronic Design Automation* ADS SPICE simulator from Agilent EESof* OmegaSim GX SPICE simulator from Nascentric* Sentaraus TCAD from SynopsysFor more information on the Dell Precision Workstation line, visit www.dell.com.
