 Look, EDGE Evolution trials are pretty cool, but we all know that's not where the action's really at -- the people want to know what's up with LTE, and by golly, Nokia Siemens' gonna tell 'em. The infrastructure-focused joint venture has recently completed what it's billing as the first LTE call on commercial software using base stations fully compliant with 3GPP Release 8's LTE specifications, which means that trial and commercial 4G deployments toward the end of this year into next should have an easier time going live. Sadly, no details were available on the nature of the call or the end-user equipment being used, but we suspect the term "call" is being used loosely here -- in all likelihood, it was pure data using modems that you'll never buy.
