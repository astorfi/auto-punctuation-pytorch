 Just as Sprint starts pondering ways to possibly rid itself of the massive WiMAX expenditure load that it has taken on, AT&T is apparently looking right on past the technology into the next-generation of HSPA. The company's VP of Government Solutions for Mobility noted at a recent interview that AT&T would be taking a "wait-and-see approach to WiMAX as it didn't see the value proposition in mobile WiMAX." Consequently, he hinted that the firm would rather set its sights on LTE (long term evolution), but did suggest that it would be "evaluating the use of WiMAX technology for backhaul." A tough day for WiMAX supporters, indeed.[Via PhoneScoop]
