Well The Newton Museum has been fulfulling thislatter task admirably by displaying their impressive collection of Newtons and peripherals, but as Boing Boing's XeniJardin (fresh off her victory as Sexiest Geek of 2005) reports, the museum is unfortunately closing its virtual doorsafter seven years. The public's loss, however, could be one lucky person's gain, as the museums entire collection is upfor sale on eBay. This motherload of all things Newton contains 13 of the PDAs (some still boxed) including at least oneof every model manufactured, seemingly every peripheral and piece of software ever released for the platform, andvarious developer kits and manuals for the hardcore fan. We'd love to see whoever wins this auction network all of theNewtons into a grid to create the world's most powerful palmtop supercomputer unable to perform satisfactoryhandwriting recognition.[Via BoingBoing]
