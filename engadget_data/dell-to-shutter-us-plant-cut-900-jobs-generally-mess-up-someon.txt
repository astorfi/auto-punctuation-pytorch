 A report just crossing the wires says that Dell is slated to close one of its US manufacturing plants and cut about 900 jobs -- though that's a pittance compared to the approximately 76,500 workers Dell employs. The company's Winston-Salem, North Carolina desktop production facility will shut down come January 2010, though Dell says around 600 employees will hit the road in November -- just in time for the Holidays. The company says the closure is "part of an ongoing initiative to enhance the long-term value it delivers to customers by simplifying operations and improving efficiency," or as we'd put it, "it looks good on the books." Obviously this isn't the happiest news for the employees being cut, but it's also a familiar tune given the economic events of the past year.
