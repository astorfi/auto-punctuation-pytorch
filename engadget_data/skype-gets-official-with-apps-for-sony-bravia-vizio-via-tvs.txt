 Both Sony and Vizio have already quietly dropped word that Skype would be heading to their respective internet-connected TVs, but Skype itself has now made the move fully official, a full year after it offered the first demo of Skype on a Panasonic VieraCast TV at CES 2010. Unfortunately, it isn't offering many more details than Sony or Vizio, and it's using both "coming soon" and "later this year" to describe the rollout on TVs from the two companies, which leaves open a depressingly long and confusing possible launch window -- we do know that Sony's Skype-ready Bravias will begin rolling out in February, but Sony hasn't confirmed a release date for the required webcam. What's more, Skype has also confirmed that it's working with Panasonic and Sony to bring some added connectivity to your existing TV with the aid of a Skype-enabled Blu-ray player and webcam -- look for those "soon."
