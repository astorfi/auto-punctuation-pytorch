 While we've seen lots of research revolve around battlefield-ready vests, new sensor-studded helmets could be headed to Iraq in order to "measure the shock from explosive devices." Due to mounting concern and a thirst for knowledge about traumatic brain injury (TBI), the US Army awarded Simbex -- the same company involved with Virginia Tech's data gathering helmets -- a contract to further develop technology for use in combat headgear. Furthermore, the firm hopes to "develop an automatic data-collation system" that could potentially relay information to bases or medics via RFID. It was noted, too, that the Army plans on testing Simbex's design along with "several alternative technologies," and the method that proves most useful could be deployed "as early as December of this year."
