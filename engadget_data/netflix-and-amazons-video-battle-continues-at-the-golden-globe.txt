Once upon a time awards shows had sources from a predictable list of sources, but now internet video has crashed the party. When the Golden Globe Awards are presented January 11th, Netflix will be up for seven while Amazon has snagged two nominations for its new show Transparent. The two are even going head to head in the Best TV Series, Musical or Comedy, where Transparent and Orange is the New Black are joined by Silicon Valley, Jane the Virgin and Girls. Last year Netflix broke through with its first win as Robin Wright brought home a trophy for her performance in House of Cards, and now it's back for more. The company's focus on original content is showing (has anyone watched Marco Polo yet?) and Amazon is quickly catching up, while Hulu has... a GIF generator and some episodes of Deadliest Catch. (That was mean, actually we'd keep an eye out for season two of The Wrong Mans December 24th, plus new series from Amy Poehler, J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions and Jason Reitman on the way. Maybe next year Hulu.)
