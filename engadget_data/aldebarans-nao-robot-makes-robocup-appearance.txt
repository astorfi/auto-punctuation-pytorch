What's more, the company's just revealed that it's decided to give Nao some companionship, introducing a new, slightly smaller model with added sensors, eyes, and "dozens of other improvements," not to mention a spiffy new red paint job. While Aldebaran will apparently have more to say about that particular bot "in the next weeks so," you can check out a video of it in action at the link below, along with one of the older Nao walking slightly more steadily than before, though apparently still not able to muster up a kick.
