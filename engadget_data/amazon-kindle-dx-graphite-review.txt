This time, it's got the new Pearl display from E Ink, which supposedly boasts a much higher contrast ratio and a faster page refresh rate over its predecessor. Other than that, you're looking at pretty much the same unit as before, and if you like a large e-reader, that's probably a good thing. Read on for our full impressions of the device.
      

 

Look and feel Yes, the new Kindle DX, like its predecessor, feels rather giant in comparison to most readers. That said, in our several weeks with the device, we grew accustomed to its size pretty easily and found it to be a more enjoyable reading experience than with many smaller readers. If you think of it as the difference between reading a cozy, convenient paperback and a large, stately hardback edition, you'll about have the feel of the size and weight difference. The DX feels heavier than the Kindle 2 or the Nook but light in comparison to its overall size, and while you will inevitably hold this reader with both hands, we'll go on record as saying that's how we hold most books -- even small ones -- anyway.
