 
 Along with tons of new notebooks, HP is unveiling a 23-inch display, the 2311xi. The screen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution with a brightness of 250 nits, and makes use of an IPS panel to promise wide viewing angles (178 degrees both horizontally and vertically, says HP). Also on board are VGA, HDMI and DVI-D input. The display will go for $240 starting June 24th. In the meantime, you can check out the gallery of press photos below and, if you're really curious, feast your eyes on HP's demo video below the break.
