 Late last month, Dell's 2007WFP woke up finding itself in a strange, unfamiliar skin. Next, both the SE1777FP and the SE1977FP woke up to find themselves in weird, rather dated, silver bevels. Now, just as swift and senselessly, the widescreen 27" 2707WFP has met a similarly silver fate. Dell's website is mum on changes -- it's mum on just about everything -- but pictures don't lie and the decidedly widescreen monitor pictured to the right definitely isn't a misplaced FP-series screen lost in the labyrinths of Dell's website.
