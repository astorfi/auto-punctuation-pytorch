Most importantly, it seems that Vodafone doesn't want to "give up as much control" as did AT&T here in the States, and below is a brief list of reported "iPhone enhancements [that] carriers are looking for:"

 Vodafone wants the YouTube application to "work much more like the Internet version."
 Improvements to Outlook and Exchange support
 Improved security and firewalls
 Tweaks to Apple's WEP and WPA security key requirements
 Web browser improvements, namely, the ability to simply "cut and paste"

So, there you have it -- now how's about we just start compromising and get a deal together for all the patient Europeans, yeah?
