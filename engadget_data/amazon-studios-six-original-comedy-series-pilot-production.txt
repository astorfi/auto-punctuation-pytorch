 After putting out an open call for original content last May, Amazon Studios is ready to begin production on six comedy pilots. Culled from a writer base consisting of industry vets (some award winning, some from the minds of Big Bang Theory stars, some backed by the adorably creepy Kristen Schaal) and unknowns, these scripted entries will be hosted for free on the company's Instant Video platform once completed. And since there's no better focus group than an existing customer base, Amazon intends take user feedback into account when selecting which of these pilots goes into full production. Series that do make it past that final greenlight will end up on the mega e-retailer's Instant Video and Lovefilm portals as exclusive content for Prime subscribers. Head past the break to check out the full list of eligible shows.
