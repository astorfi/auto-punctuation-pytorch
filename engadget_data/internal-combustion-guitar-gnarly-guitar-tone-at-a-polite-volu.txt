 
By adding a signal chain to the classic electric axe, the Internal Combustion Guitar takes the tone generated by a small amp and sends it on back to the guitar, where something called a "coupling mechanism" feeds the sound back to your strings -- much the same way that standing in front of an amp will cause the guitar to feedback into its pickups. Use the throttle to control how much righteous color comes through, or use the (optional) MIDI pickup to rock out virtually. Prices start at a cool $2,450 -- including medium gauge strings and an Extreme Gig Bag. Not convinced? Catch Woody B after the break.[Via Music Radar]
