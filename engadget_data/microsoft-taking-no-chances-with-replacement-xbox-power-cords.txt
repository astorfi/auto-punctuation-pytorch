The last Xbox power cord had a
nasty habit of, you know, getting a little toasty, but
Microsoft isn't taking any chances with any of the 14 million replacement cords they're going to have to ship out. This
one comes laden with warning labels, including one that gives you a toll-free number to call if the light on it flashes
or doesn't turn on when you press the reset button, and another one you're supposed to put on your Xbox that reads:
"This Xbox Protection Cord disconnects power to the Xbox console if it detects an electrical problem." Which is
probably going to only happen in the middle of some marathon Halo 2 action.
