Though impressive, that wouldn't make the Galaxy S Samsung's fastest-selling phone to the magical 10 million mark -- that honor is reserved for the Star, which hit it in just six months compared to the Galaxy S' seven. Considering that there's some form of Galaxy S sold on a staggering percentage of the world's major carriers, the success should come as no surprise; question is, can they keep it up in 2011 (hopefully thanks in part to a dual-core model or two)?
