Google really, really wants you to pick up a Chromebook this holiday, and it's sweetening the deal to make sure a Chrome OS-powered laptop is on your gift list. The company is now offering 1TB of free Google Drive space to anyone who buys a Chromebook between now and the end of 2014; while it'll only last two years, that gives you about as much value ($240) as a low-end Chromebook model. If you're particularly fond of storing your stuff in the cloud (or know someone who does), this is potentially a huge bargain.
