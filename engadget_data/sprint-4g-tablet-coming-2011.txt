Thankfully, we won't have to dwell on our frustration for long, because a Sprint executive told Forbes that a 4G tablet will arrive in 2011. Sprint's Paget Alves, president of business markets, wouldn't say where it would be made, but hinted that the company intends to sell tablets running different operating systems -- so it's probably not another Android device. What could it be, then? We can't say, but paired with the knowledge that Verizon also plans to debut LTE tablets in 2011 -- possibly including one Motorola Stingray -- it seems like 2011 will be a fine year for goodies on CDMA.
