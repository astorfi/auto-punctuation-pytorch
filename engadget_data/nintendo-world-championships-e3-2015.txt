The Nintendo World Championships, a gaming competition last held in 1990, return this year for E3 in June. Nintendo fans can compete for a spot in the Championships on May 30 at select Best Buy stores around the country, and the winners will join competitors selected by Nintendo at the Nokia Theatre on Sunday, June 14th, for a multi-round gaming competition. It's just like the old days. The Championships will be streamed live online and fans in LA will have the opportunity to attend the final event in-person. Nintendo promises more details in the coming weeks.



As for the rest of E3, Nintendo will once again host a Digital Event full of game announcements and (fingers crossed) puppets, this time on Tuesday, June 16th at 9AM PT. Nintendo Treehouse will stream live from the E3 show floor June 16th - 18th, and on June 17th and 20th, select Best Buy stores in the US will allow fans to play Mario Maker on Wii U. That's 4PM - 9PM local time on Wednesday, June 17th and 12PM - 5PM local time on Saturday, June 20th.
