Those fixes include remedies for the proximity sensor issue, Bluetooth, and iPhone 3G performance, while the new features include High Dynamic Range photos, HD video uploads over WiFi, TV show rentals, and, at long last, Game Center. That latter bit is pretty much what we've been seeing all along, and boasts a range of new capabilities for multiplayer gaming including the ability to challenge friends, keep track of scores, and new ways to find games -- of which there will be some pretty interesting new ones that take advantage of the added capabilities. Look for the update to hit iTunes sometime next week as a free download for your iPhone or iPod touch.
