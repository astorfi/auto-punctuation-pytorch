When we went hands on with its latest, the VAIO L, we found it to look just as good as those earlier ones, but its $1,300 price tag to be rather fair. Built into a 24-inch, 1920 x 1080 (1080p) touchscreen it's meant to serve as both an HDTV and a PC, featuring an HDMI inport where you can plug in your PS3. Yes, that's what mom calls it before she starts rocking out with the kiddos in the video after the break. It has a 500GB drive for your apps and for DVR recordings through Windows 7 Premium, packs a Blu-ray writer, a Core 2 Duo processor, and "loads of RAM." Sure, there are cheaper ways to get an all-in-one, but only one comes standard with an inport.
