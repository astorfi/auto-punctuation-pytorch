Anyhow, the screen seems pretty great -- we're not sure if it's IPS, but it's definitely high-res and should function really well for video and gaming. All told, it looks like it'll be about as easy to lug around as the Galaxy Tab, which makes sense considering we're looking at the same size display and roughly the same form factor. Peep the gallery!
