Looks like the company is ready to take one more baby step toward that eventuality, with what appears to be an official Bionic Twitter account (we're working to get confirmation) indicating a September 8th release date, while a product page with some new shots of the device has also gone live. The page is still sadly lacking in-depth specs, but the handful of photos should keep eager customers happy at least until our friend in the leather blouse slices the head off another robot.
