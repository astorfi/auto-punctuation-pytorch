Microsoft's spring update for the Xbox One is here! (Cue triumphant trumpets.) It's a few days later than anticipated but, as they say, better late than never. The first major update for the console packs a host of improvements, including better Kinect voice recognition, improved all-round stability, and some key fixes to the dashboard -- such as onscreen meters for the controller's battery and free HDD space (check after the break for a complete list). You'll also be able to plug a USB keyboard in, which should make web browsing and searching a whole lot less painful. The update is rolling out to customers during "off-peak" hours in their local time zones. Or as the ever eloquent Larry Hryb put it, "never fear you'll see it sometime over the weekend." If you're taking advantage of Xbox's Instant On feature, the console will check for an update next time you turn it off.
