You know, the one that might just stand a chance at breathing life into Moto's tired range and flagging financial performance if it turns out to be even remotely legit? Well, IT168 has what appears to be a shot -- albeit a relatively crappy, likely rendered one -- of the X PIXL / Z12 slider that had been mentioned as a part of that '08 roadmap, showing the 5 megapixel Kodak-branded cam we'd heard about along with the obligatory xenon flash. Now clearly, this shot is utterly trivial to fake, but we tend to give it a little weight here if for no other reason than the fact that Moto pretty much has to get out a 5 megapixel cameraphone with name-brand optics at this point just to keep up with the Joneses.[Via Just Another Mobile Phone Blog]
