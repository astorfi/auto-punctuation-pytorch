Tumblr has just updated its iOS app with a completely redesigned interface that more closely matches the aesthetic of Apple's latest mobile operating system. The most significant change is that the activity view is now in its own tab so it's that much easier to keep up with who reblogged, liked or commented on your posts. Additionally, posting a new entry is much more streamlined with a fast reblog button, larger post type icons, new animations, tag auto-completion, a drop-down schedule calendar and an all-new image uploader that presents your photos and videos in a friendlier grid view instead of just popping you over to the camera roll. So if you just can't get enough of those Ryan Gosling memes or that funny cat GIF, head on over to the source link to update the app right now.
