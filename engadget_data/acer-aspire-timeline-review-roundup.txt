If you're looking to get the long and short of it, here it is: those seeking great battery life in a relatively affordable package need look no further, but performance junkies should definitely hunt elsewhere. All told, Acer managed to concoct a few machines that'll go eight hours or so under the right conditions, but none of 'em will set any records in the benchmarking department. It's called compromise people -- are you willing to make it? Check the links below to help answer that.Read - PCPro ("Nondescript looks and plodding performance are elevated by absolutely stunning battery life")Read - Laptop ("Lightweight design. Eight hours of battery life. Good-enough performance")Read - ComputerShopper ("Delivers great battery life in a lightweight chassis; however, comes up short in terms of features and performance")
