 Not quite tired of all the big mobile news to burst out of September's gates? Well, you can add one more to the list as LG's just issued an invite for an upcoming smartphone launch. What is the company introducing to go head-to-head against the Lumias, RAZR HDs, iPhone and offerings from HTC and Intel? Well, we can't say for certain, but with Qualcomm onboard as an official host, our money's on a stateside version of the Optimus G, the first LTE smartphone packing a quad-core Snapdragon S4 APQ8064. No doubt we'll be there on the 19th to bring you the news live, so stay tuned.
