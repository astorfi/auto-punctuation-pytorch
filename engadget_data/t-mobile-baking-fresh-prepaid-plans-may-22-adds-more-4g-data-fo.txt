Pushing out a competitive and timely response to Verizon's Unleashed plans is vital -- especially given T-Mobile's paltry first-quarter results -- and the company will be ready to match wits with the country's number-one carrier on May 22. The official site is already saying as much, proclaiming to its prepaid customers that their monthly packages will become even tastier at that time. What it's missing, though, is a name, and TmoNews has uncovered evidence suggesting 'T-Mobile Monthly 4G' will be the re-branded title. So what will these new enhancements bring to customers?

Monthly rates will stay exactly the same as before, with additional 4G data supplying an extra oomph to the offerings. The top-of-the-line plan goes for $70 and will offer unlimited minutes, text, and web (a jump up from the 2GB currently in use); the $50 choice is identical in minutes and text, but will only allow 100MB before data gets throttled. This idea of cutting down internet use is a definite upgrade to the current plan, since at present time it gives out the same 100MB but cuts data use completely off as soon as that point is reached. We're also noticing that international and BlackBerry services are available a la carte for an extra $10, as well as a noteworthy day pass that bestows 24 hours of unlimited 4G data for $1.49. Color us impressed; all of the latest revamps to T-Mobile's prepaid options are a refreshing contrast to its competitors mandating more and more restrictions to their monthly data plans.
