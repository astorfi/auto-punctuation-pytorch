The good news is that the 2D picture quality was better than last year's model and in fact the black level reading was one-half of the V10's out of the box performance. So as if getting a better HD picture for less money wasn't enough, Gary says the "the 3D image (is) outstanding with considerably more brightness and pop than the motion picture theater 3D movie experience." So yeah it is the best 3D experience you can get anywhere.
