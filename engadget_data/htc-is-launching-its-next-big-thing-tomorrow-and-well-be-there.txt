HTC is hosting a little shindig in London the day after today in order to announce the latest hardware it has "dreamt up" -- and since we're suckers for hot new smartphones, we'll be there to liveblog the hell out of it. The event kicks off at 12PM British Summer Time or 1PM Central European Time. In American parlance, that's 7AM for the East Coast and a frightful 4AM for West Coasters. Our intuition says to expect the Desire HD and Desire Z to make their debuts, but there's only one way to be certain: keep it locked to Engadget and we'll demystify everything as soon as superhumanly possible.
