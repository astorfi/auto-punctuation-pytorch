The dust has settled on Apple's 2013-era iPhone launch, so it's time that we delved into what the damage is here in 'ol Blighty. EE, along with its buddies Orange and T-Mobile, has confirmed that it'll carry both the iPhone 5s and 5c from launch. LTE contract users who are six months into their EE deal will also be able to take advantage of the conveniently-announced Swap service. O2 has said that customers will be able to use O2 Refresh to upgrade their handset from launch, and Vodafone and Three have both given the thumbs-up to carrying the pair of handsets. No-one's talking about specific contract pricing, but we expect carriers will drip-feed this information in poker-faced chunks between now and the September 20th launch date.

Update: O2 has come out swinging, saying that the 16GB iPhone 5c can be yours for £50 up-front with a £32 per-month 3G calls & data deal, while signing up with an LTE plan will set you back £100 up-front and £42-per month. If you prefer the 5s, however, the up-front cost for a 16GB model is £120 on deals starting at £37 per month -- with LTE available on deals costing £47 and upwards.
