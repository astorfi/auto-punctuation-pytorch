Last but not least, Sony will be closing out our first day of E3 2013 press conferences at 9PM ET, and you can tune in several different ways. Of course our liveblog is the place to be, but you can also stream the video on this page (embedded after the break) or directly through your PS3. After the PlayStation 4 console stayed hidden backstage at its own preview event we're expecting to hear (and see) a lot more this time around, so get ready -- it's almost time to go.
