  Guess what just showed up in searches on Samsung.com? That's right, the Galaxy Nexus. The official product page isn't live so there's not much to see beyond front, back, and side shots of the device. Wondering what happened to that Nexus Prime branding? Several readers have let us know searching for that also pulls up the same result on Samsung's suddenly leaky homepage. We've gotten familiar with the soft keys and rainbow background after many leaks, so check your local Verizon coverage map and come back here 'round 10PM ET for a big bite of Google's Ice Cream Sandwich.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
