 
America has spoken (at least the TV-addicted, iPhone owning segment) and the cry is being heard: they want to control their DVRs from their handset! The Verizon FiOS DVR Manager sounds pretty straightforward: set your DVR! Set parental controls! Bookmark, browse, search TV programming, and more! And all from your iPhone. (Of course, plenty of Android users have been doing this for a while now.) Kind of makes that old iTunes-based media management system seem a little weak sauce, doesn't it? Of course, if you're out at dinner or in a meeting and you're being driven to distraction trying to remember if Ninja Assassin is a video-on-demand selection this month, you probably have much bigger problems than on-the-road DVR management. But that's none of our business. Compatible with your iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad sportin' OS 3.0 or later. Hit the source link to download now!
