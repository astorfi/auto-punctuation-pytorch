 If you're looking to the ditch the CRT for a more space-friendly LCD, but don't want to throw down $600 for Gateway's FPD2185W, the company has a new option for you that knocks only 2-inches but a full $300 off of its well-received 21-inch model. HDBeat points out, though, that you lose more than just desktop real estate with the 19-inch widescreen FPD1975W (pictured, not actual size), as Gateway has dropped both the Faroudja DCDi image processor as well as the 2185's composite inputs. You still get a decent set of specs here, with the 1,440 x 900 resolution and HDCP-capable DVI inputs ensuring that HD fans are well covered, while the 8-millisecond response time and 700:1 contrast ratio should probably serve to attract more than a few gamers. This model is available immediately from Gateway online, although if you don't mind spending a few more bucks, you should probably take a look at Dell's 2007WFP before making your purchase.[Via HDBeat]
