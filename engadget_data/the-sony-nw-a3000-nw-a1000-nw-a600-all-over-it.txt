Hey sleepyheads and slackersâ€”if you're like some of us who have a penchant for, um, sleeping in on a lazy Thursday
morning, you might have missed Sony's latest entrant into the portable audio market. But wait, now there's even more
info to check out, too. So in addition to what we know about the
NW-A3000 and NW-A1000 players (we prefer NWA-3000/1000
playas, thanks), we now know the screen the A3000 will be packin' is a 2-inch OLED display, and that it's a little
larger than we'd like at 2.5 x 4.1 x 0.84-inches (65.2 x 104.2 x 21.4mm); the A1000 (that's their 1-inch drive version)
will have a 1.5-inch OLED display, and both will feature
"Intelligent shuffle" (whatever that is). Still
more!




 Sony?s also given an update to theNetwork Walkman NW-E series; it?sreturning as the NW-A600 (over in Japan, anyway) with the 2GB A608, and 1GB A607 in a slew of colors?including limitededition gold (which did just so well for Apple) and emerald. They too will feature ?Intelligent shuffle,? and will bepriced between ?25,000 - 32,000 ($225 - 290 US).
