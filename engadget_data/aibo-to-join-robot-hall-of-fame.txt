 
To the list of those whose extraordinary contributions to our culture were not recognized duringtheir lifetimes -- think Vincent Van Gogh, Franz Kafka, Joey Ramone -- let us now add a coda for a creature whoseexistence was cut short far too early, but who will now be memorialized in a most fitting way: Aibo. Sony's late, lamented robotic dog will soon enjoy a place ofhonor in Carnegie Mellon University's Robot Hall of Fame, sharing the accolades with such other luminaries as Asimo,the Mars Pathfinder and Astro Boy (the Hall of Fame honors both real and fictional robots). The induction ceremony(which will also include Gort of "klaatu barada nikto" fame) will be on June 21. We only -- sob -- wish Aibohad made it just a little longer, to enjoy this honor.
