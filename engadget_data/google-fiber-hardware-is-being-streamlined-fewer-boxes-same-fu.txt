Remember that new Google Fiber box we spotted in the FCC last month? It's almost here. According to Kansas City residents in Google's beta program, a new router is on the way that combines the service's existing network and storage boxes into a single unit. The unit is also reported to be ushering in a Google Fiber Android app. There aren't too many other details (though forum users did confirm the WiFi upgrade we saw in the FCC) but Dave Zatz did find a new image lurking on Google's servers, pictured above.
