Tumblr and animated GIFs are practically inseparable at this point, so we're happy to report that the microblogging platform's latest Android app update enhances that marriage. The next time you hit the mobile dashboard you'll see that GIFs start playing automatically. What's more, you can now scroll through the app in landscape mode and make photosets within it too. However brief the change log may be, it's even more evidence that the Tumblr overlords have a preference for Google's mobile OS -- the company's post doesn't mention when these features might arrive on iOS.
