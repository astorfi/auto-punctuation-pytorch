Interestingly, all of them are running Windows Mobile 6.1, even though Stevey Ballms pulled the wraps off WinMo 6.5 earlier today -- and making matters worse, we're not seeing that required hardware Start button on the DX900 or X960, which means an upgrade probably isn't in the cards. Curious move, we'd say -- and we're also in the dark on what happened to that goofy dual-sided set we saw leaked earlier. We'll be on the lookout for answers, check all the detailed specs after the break.
