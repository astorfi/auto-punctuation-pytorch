There's one more thing you're going to have to start looking for in cellphones: whether or not it has a near field
communication, or NFC, chip in it. NFC is basically a super-short range wireless protocol that only has a range of a
few centimeters but would make it possible for people to use their cellphones to pay for stuff or unlock doors. Sounds
just like RFID, right? The main difference is that with NFC you're not just reading a tag, you can actually send
information both ways, which means it can also be used for transferring files to a PC (and it's supposed to be cheaper
and use less power than WiFi or Bluetooth). Anyway, Philips (and just to be clear
we mean Philips the company and not Phillip who writes
for us) just cut a deal to sell NFC chips to Samsung, so expect to see it show up in their handsets by early next
year.
