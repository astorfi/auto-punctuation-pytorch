Starting today, it'll apparently be offering one configuration of the Mini 10 for $559, which includes a 1.6GHz Z530 Atom processor, a 160GB hard drive, 1GB of RAM, a 1.3 megapixel webcam, Windows XP and, of course, that 10.1-inch SVGA display. Shortly thereafter, on February 26th, Dell will begin taking orders itself for a couple more configurations, including a base $399 model that includes a 1.3GHz Z520 Atom processor and a 3-cell battery. Dell isn't getting any more specific than "next month" with an actual shipping date, however, although those orders from QVC will supposedly be shipping out on March 20th.[Via NotebookReview.com]Update: It looks legit! QVC gets first dibs (saywha?), with Dell.com taking orders on the 26th.
