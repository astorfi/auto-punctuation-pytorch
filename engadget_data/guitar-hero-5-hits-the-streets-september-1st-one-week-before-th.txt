 Yeah, you heard it right: another volume of Guitar Hero -- the game you either love to hate or love to love -- is making its debut on September 1st. This one, Guitar Hero 5, promises a bunch of features that are party friendly, such as the ability to play through sets with no players actively playing, allowing anyone to join in at any time -- because we all know how many ragers are built around GH, right? It's probably no coincidence that the release date comes exactly one week before that other music game, The Beatles: Rock Band. So, which one are you buying?
