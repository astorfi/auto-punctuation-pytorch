 If you haven't heard of "wobulation"
just yet, chances are you will before the year is up. No, it's not the
theme to another "Dance Dance Revolution" video-game, it's a method
used to trick the human eye into viewing a higher resolution. Take a
look at the simulated example on the right. The bottom picture
illustrates the "screen door" effect of a high-def set. The top picture
represents the same image using "wobulation."So what the heck
is it and where did it come from? Ironically, the idea came from HP's
inkjet technologies. HP determined that printer output resolutions
could be increased by adding ink droplets over top of each other. Will
Allen of HP's Digital Technology and Products group applied the concept to light and "BAM!", wobulation was born.There are more interesting details on wobulation at Physorg.com,
but I'm more interested in you think of the technology. I haven't seen
an example of it yet, and the "purist" in me says that 720p is 720p,
not something more. However, if the picture quality can be increased by
projecting two overlapping light-points, it might have some merit. What do you think?
