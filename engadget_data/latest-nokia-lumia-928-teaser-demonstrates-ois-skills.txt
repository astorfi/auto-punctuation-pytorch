Nokia is continuing its trail of breadcrumbs to the official Lumia 928 launch, with today's drop including this rendering of the phone in white and a video meant to show off its optical image stabilization chops. The phone pulls off some high quality video recording attached to a remote control helicopter flying through the forest, as it attempts to keep blur to a minimum. It also shows off a flash that, to our eyes, looks like the xenon bulb featured in the 808 PureView. There's no comparison to other devices this time around, so you'll just have to imagine what other phones could capture in similar circumstances (or, do the test yourself and send us the video -- whatever works). Check out the demo after the break to see the results yourself, or hit the source link to sign up for more info.
