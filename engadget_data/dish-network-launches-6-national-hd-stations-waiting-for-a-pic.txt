You know it's a great day when you wake up and find new HD stations. Dish Network subscribers should know how that feels as their HD lineup increased with six new stations; that makes 37 national HD stations for Dish. The day just gets better when four of said stations are national premiers: Discovery HD, TLC HD, Animal Planet HD and The Science Channel HD. The other two stations, MHD and GolfHD aren't new but still a great additions to the largest national high-def lineup. We should mention that Discovery HD is a separate station from Discovery HD Theater and just like the other three new national stations are simulcasts of the SD flavor. Since these launches are in line with Dish Network's CES announcement, we don't see why September 1st shouldn't also be a great day being The History Channel HD's scheduled launch day.
