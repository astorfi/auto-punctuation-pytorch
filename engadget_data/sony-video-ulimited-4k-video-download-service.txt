Sony's betting big on 4K, with its movie studios shooting movies and television in 4K using its pro cameras. And now, to get that content to all those Ultra HD TVs, the company is rolling out its long-awaited Video Unlimited 4K download service. As of today, there are 70 native 4K movies and shows available -- Sony's aiming to have over 100 by the end of the year -- and users can rent or buy content through the service. Of course, you'll need one of Sony's FMP-X1 media players and an appropriately rezzed Sony screen to actually consume said video. Single show episodes are $3.99, with movie rentals starting at $7.99 for a 24-hour viewing window. Looking to buy? $29.99 gets you any film for good.

NEW YORK, Sept. 4, 2013 – Sony today launched the Video Unlimited 4K service, the world's first and only 4K Ultra HD video download service, with access to an expanding library of native 4K Ultra HD feature films and TV shows.

Beginning with a selection of more than 70 full length native 4K Ultra HD feature films and TV shows from Sony Pictures Entertainment and other notable production houses, Video Unlimited 4K will offer customers the option to rent and purchase content for download on Sony's 4K Ultra HD Media Player (FMP-X1) for playback on Sony 4K Ultra HD televisions.

To coincide with the debut of the Video Unlimited 4K service, Sony today expanded its 4K Ultra HD TV line-up with the addition of the X850A series, available in 55- and 65-inch screens (models XBR-55X850A and XBR-65X850A). With four times the resolution of Full HD and Sony's unique TRILUMINOS Display, the new X850A incorporates a slim bezel with an elegant design without the integrated magnetic fluid speaker system in the X900A series (models XBR-55X900A and XBR-65X900A) now on the market. This new design offers customers the flexibility of connecting to an existing or separate home theater system.

"We have been spearheading the advancement of 4K Ultra HD technology from the start, and have now reached another milestone as promised with the Video Unlimited 4K service going live," said Sony Electronics President and COO Phil Molyneux. "Sony 4K Ultra HD TVs featuring our exclusive TRILUMINOS Display have been receiving amazing feedback and now we are bringing the most immersive entertainment experiences to new audiences right in their living rooms."

Commenting on the announcement, Chris Cookson, President of Sony Pictures Technologies said, "Sony Pictures has been working in 4K for several years. 4K mastering and restoration allows us to capture and convey more of the information from a film's original 35mm negative, while new 4K cameras like the F65 offer higher resolution and expanded color palettes to help us create ever-more immersive experiences for audiences in theaters and at home."

Owners of the Sony 4K Ultra HD Media Player (FMP-X1) will receive updated content over the internet, enabling them to rent or purchase the latest entertainment.

The cost for TV episodes is $3.99, while feature films start at $7.99 for a 24-hour rental, or $29.99 for a purchase.
