The company's PlayStation 3 app is now hitting consoles across the pond, displaying the message you see above when it's launched. Unfortunately, that's about all we have to go on at the moment, but PS3 users can now at least rest assured that they won't have any waiting to do when Netflix does finally flip the switch -- one more shot after the break.
