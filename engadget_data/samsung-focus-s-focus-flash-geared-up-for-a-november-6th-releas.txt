The Focus S, brandishing its 4.3-inch Super AMOLED Plus display, 1.4GHz single-core CPU, front-facing cam and 8MP shooter, will be up for grabs at $200; the Flash, meanwhile, can be yours for $50 and still offers the same processor with a smaller 3.7-inch Super AMOLED display, front-facing cam and a 5MP rear camera. Get ready, get set...
