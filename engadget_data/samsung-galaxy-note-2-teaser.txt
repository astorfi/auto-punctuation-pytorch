Well, here's something to whet the appetites of anyone into big phones -- Samsung's new video teaser for its IFA show. Director Wim Wenders is involved in the trailer, talking up "all the things you can do in the blink on the eye, on such a small and light thing." We also get a glimpse of the new stylus -- but not much else. Take a look for yourself after the break.
