Our pal Wouter over at Pocketinfo has it on authority from two sources atMicrosoft's Windows Mobile baby mama that WinMo 5.0 AKU2 -- the update that puts the push in Mobile's push email, aswell as adding Bluetooth stereo headset support -- will not be getting the A2DP profile after all. This would seem alittle odd and inconsistent with everything we know about the release (having seen shots of the A2DP profiler before,like the one above), but if we really must wait until the AKU 2.2ROM, then wait (unhappily) we shall.
