So far, reports include the original Motorola Droid, the Droid X, and HTC's Droid Incredible. Lest you've been enjoying a lengthy holiday in the tropics, Google Instant throws up search results as you type your query, delivering either much faster results or a much more annoying search experience, depending on how you look at it. Reported operation so far aligns with our early hands-on, with Instant taking a bit of time to get its bearings, but the software is still at the beta stage, after all. Why not jump into your browser this morning and tell us if your Android's answering your questions before you even hit the Enter key?
