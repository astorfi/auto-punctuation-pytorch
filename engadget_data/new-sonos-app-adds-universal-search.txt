Here's the deal: streaming music services are great, but thanks to various content licensing deals with labels, there's no one-stop shop to cover all of your musical bases. That's where Sonos comes in with a handy solution by way of its new app. The refreshed Controller app for Android and iOS now includes a universal search feature that indexes your multiple streaming accounts to make finding and listening to Tool, or that haunting Banks track, less of a painful experience. Of course, you'll need a Sonos player to partake in this game of streaming musical chairs, and some patience -- the app won't be released until sometime this spring. Though, Android users can get in early and preview the pared-down, three-pane UI now by signing up for the beta.
