At least one owner, though, is getting an early treat: one of venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson's namesake managing directors, Steve Jurvetson, just picked up his red-hued EV sedan in the San Francisco Bay Area. He can also rightfully claim to have the very first production Model S anywhere, as he's since posted photographic proof on Flickr that his car was the earliest to have completed the factory run. The arrival is no doubt a milestone for taking purely electric cars into the mainstream. Even so, we'll admit that we're just hoping Jurvetson shares what it's like to live with Tesla's four-door -- both out of curiosity as well as a vain attempt to live vicariously through someone who's had more than a test drive.

 Update: Sure enough, Jurvetson has posted video of the delivery, which you can catch after the break.
