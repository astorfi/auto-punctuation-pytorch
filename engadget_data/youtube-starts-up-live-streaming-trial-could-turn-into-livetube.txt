Today and tomorrow, chosen partners will participate in a trial of a new live streaming platform, and so long as the traffic doesn't burn down too many server farms, the feature should be progressively rolled out to a wider audience in the near future. Alas, it sounds like Google intends to limit the capability to content partners only and not allow its masses of regular users the pleasure of livestreaming their cats' latest acts of mischief out to the world. Oh, such a shame.
