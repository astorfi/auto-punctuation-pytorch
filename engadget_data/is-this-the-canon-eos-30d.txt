While some Canon enthusiasts think it looks real enough, others are morecircumspect, pointing out the fact that everything after the "3" is covered in the photo, and that the camerabears at least a passing resemblance to the 350D (which is a little confusing consider the 350D's dial is on the rightside of the body, not the left). This isn't the first time alleged30D pics have shown up online, so we'll take this one with a grain of film, and keep our eyes open for moreconclusive info.[Thanks, Alex]
