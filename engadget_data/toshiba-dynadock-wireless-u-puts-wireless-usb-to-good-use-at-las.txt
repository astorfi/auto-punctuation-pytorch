The good news is that wireless USB makes the whole docking concept a lot more attractive, though we'd much rather have a solution that's integrated into the laptop -- the included wireless USB dongle looks quite precarious, and kind of ruins the whole idea of not having to plug anything in. The $300 pricetag also makes this hard to swallow, but there's a real logic to wireless docking that we hope can expand in the industry as the components become more integrated in laptops, or least a bit more miniature.
