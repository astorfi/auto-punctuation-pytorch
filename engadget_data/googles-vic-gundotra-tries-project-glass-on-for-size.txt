Seems like the augmented reality glasses need to make their way onto every head on the Google staff, before the company feels confident moving ahead with them. First we caught sight of co-founder Sergey Brin, then it was Sebastian Thrun of Project X fame, and now social exec Vic Gundotra is getting a crack. He looks reasonably happy, so that's probably a good sign, right?

 Update: Looks like Google employee Sebastian Thrun actually tried one on... and got a photo of what it looks like from the inside. Head on the past the break for a glimpse.
