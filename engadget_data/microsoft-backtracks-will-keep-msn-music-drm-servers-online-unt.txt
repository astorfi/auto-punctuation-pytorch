 Microsoft caused a tiny ruckus back in April when it announced that it was shutting down MSN Music's DRM servers, leaving all five customers with music stranded on already-authorized computers, but it looks like the company has had a change of heart: it's now informing MSN Music customers that they have until 2011 to authorize new machines. Of course, after that you'll still be stuck with DRM-laden tracks that won't play on new devices, but it you haven't learned to buy DRM-free content by 20-freaking-11, there's no learning anything, you know?
