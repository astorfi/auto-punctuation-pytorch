  
Get ready humans, because we have an all new, amazing Engadget Show fresh out of the box (for the second time this month!). For your viewing pleasure, we sit down with Samsung CSO Omar Khan to get the inside scoop on everything from Galaxy S, Android strategies, whatever is happening with Bada, the upcoming Galaxy Tab, and much more. Next, we check in with Engadget investigative correspondent Rick Karr who scales a skyscraper to chat up the man tasked with improving New York City's data infrastructure for AT&T. Then, Josh and Paul welcome fellow editors Joanna Stern and Chris Ziegler for an unforgettable roundtable before inviting Harmonix to the stage to show off Rock Band 3 (featuring a cameo guitar performance by the inimitable Ross Miller) and their first Kinect title, Dance Central. Thrill as Josh and Ross bust a move to Lady Gaga and watch with envy as a bunch of audience members walk away with big time giveaways. If that's not enough, we also have a mind-bending set of live chiptunes music from Zen Albatross with visuals by invaderbacca that you do not want to miss. What are you waiting for? Watch it now! Hit up the stream after the break!
