 While many of us are still twiddling our thumbs waiting for FiOS to take our town by storm, another section of New Yorkers are getting the opportunity to indulge. Reportedly, Verizon recently "won a video franchise for its FiOS TV service in Buchanan, NY," bringing the total amount of New York communities with FiOS access to 65.

Go on, you lucky souls, gloat all you'd like -- we'll just live vicariously through you until our day comes.
