 Not everyone feels comfortable using a mouse made out of modern materials like plastic or, y'know, mammoth skin. Fortunately for office cavemen everywhere, a Russian designer called Neko has filled this market niche by making a mouse out of stone -- or, more likely, made a plastic mouse with polished stones stuck on top. The beige scroll wheel and cable ruin the appeal slightly, although that wouldn't stop us from freaking out the Engadget interns by turning up to work with what appears to be a hunk of rock.[Via MAKE]
