Pantech is calling this thing the C600, but other than a boring posterior shot and the presence of the aforementioned 3G bands, we know depressingly little. From what we're seeing here, this could be a candybar, slider, or swivel, so if there's any definitively good news here, it's that Cingular's likely going to be adding an understocked form factor to its 3G ranks. Stay tuned, friends.Update: Sadly, it turns out the C600 is a clamshell after all -- we missed a couple shots of the culprit buried in the always fascinating SAR (specifically absorbed radiation) report. Follow the break for the evidence! [Thanks, Eric]
