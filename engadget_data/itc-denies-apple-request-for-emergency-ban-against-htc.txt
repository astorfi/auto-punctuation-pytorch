The news follows Apple's request for an emergency ban itself, in which the Cupertino outfit accused HTC of making false statements in order to bypass the terms of an exclusion order issued last December. In the most recent ruling, the ITC found that, "Apple has not demonstrated the propriety of temporary emergency action," and went on to state, "the commission will not direct Customs to detain all subject HTC products because the commission does not have the information necessary to determine whether the respondents are currently violating the commission's limited exclusion order." Just yesterday, the ITC began an investigation to determine whether HTC's products continue to violate a patent held by Apple, which would be a violation of December's exclusion order. Until the ITC issues a more definitive finding, however, it seems that HTC can breathe a sigh of relief.
