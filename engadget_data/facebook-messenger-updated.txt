 If you're an absolute Facebook addict, then today is the day you've been waiting for. Home should officially be hitting the Play store at some point today. In preparation for its debut, the company has just updated its Messenger app. The change log features the usual slew of bug fixes but, most importantly, it adds support for chat heads. Those floating IM shortcuts are one of the most anticipated features of Facebook's homescreen replacement, and appear to be as irritating as they are convenient. To get your update, head to the Play store now.

 Update: The official Facebook app has also been updated, with the permissions necessary to run Home. But, we're not seeing the launcher yet, either buried in the Facebook app's settings or in the Play store. We'll be keeping an eye out, though.
