Following its acquisition of HopStop and Locationary, Apple is seemingly on a shopping spree. The Cupertino company just bought Passif Semiconductor, a Silicon Valley-based company that was reportedly working on low-power communication chips. Initially reported by Jessica Lessin and confirmed by AllThingsD, Apple simply said that it "buys smaller technology companies from time to time," and that it doesn't discuss the reasoning behind its acquisitions. One of the components of Passif's chip technology is apparently Bluetooth 4.0 LE, which would go hand-in-hand with the rumors of that impending Apple watch. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
