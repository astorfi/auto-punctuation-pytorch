It's been a solid nine months since Amp'd announced
its intentions to take over the totally extreme youth-oriented EV-DO MVNO market, and since then we've run many a story
about their phones, music plans, and
network deals. We heard they were hemorrhaging cash fast,
and that they even might not make it out the door. Well, way to prove your early naysayers wrong, Amp'd â€” you launched
today in every major EV-DO-enabled market Verizon's got.


 Starting phone lineup includes the Hollywood (aka a Moto
E815) with a microSD slot, 1.3 megapixel camera,
Bluetooth, and EV-DO, of course, due early 2006; the Angel, a GPS-enabled device with a 176 x 220 screen and EV-D0 due
"late" 2005; and, of course, the $129 Jet, another
microSD, GPS, and EV-DO enabled slider (shown in reverse order above). So as of now you can pick up that Jet with a
rate plan between $29.99 to $199.99 on two year contracts, Push-To-Talk for $20 per month or $0.99 per day, but no
indication so far as we can tell as to what their data plans are actually going to cost.
