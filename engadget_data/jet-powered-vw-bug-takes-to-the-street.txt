But he also wanted to be able to drive it on the open road, rather than just on aclosed airport runway surrounded by fire engines and EMT crews. His solution? A dual-engine vehicle, with a normal VWmotor for day-to-day transportation, and a GE T58-8F helicopter turboshaft engine converted to run as a jet, to getthrough rush-hour traffic. All we know is we don't want to be caught behind Patrick when he flips the switch on thisone. That, and how much will he charge to add this little trick to our ride?
