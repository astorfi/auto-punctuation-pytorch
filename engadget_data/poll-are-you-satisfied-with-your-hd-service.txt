Of course, it's impossible for us to take a look at each provider out there and assess just how wonderful (or not) its deliverance of high-definition programming is, so we figured we'd put it out there for all of you readers. Bottom line: are you stoked about the quality of your high-def service? If so, by all means, let the world know who's treating you right. If not, shout out what's keeping you from extolling your carrier -- be it a shoddy HD DVR, inexplicable compression, a high level of outages, a dearth of HD offerings or simply charging too much for too little.
