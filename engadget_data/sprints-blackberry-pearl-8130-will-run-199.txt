One thing Sprint had been coy about revealing, though, was pricing. It doesn't take a genius to figure out the rough range Sprint would be looking to hit, of course, but it's nice to know exactly how many pennies we need to save up to make a particular phone materialize in our pockets, isn't it? It turns out that that holiday promotion site -- you know, the one that caused the whole Motorola Q2 confusion -- revealed that little gem, and the going price is $199 after a $100 mail-in rebate, two-year contract, and purchase of a data plan valued at $25 or higher. Sound fair?[Thanks, Terry S.]
