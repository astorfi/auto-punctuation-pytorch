If you need a memory jog, here's them telling the world that they loved creeping people out with Palm ads. The AdAge article says that the company is currently in talks with various other ad shops, though there's no clear word on who that new team will be, or when we'll see the fruits of their labor. We don't have much to add to this in commentary except to say that this is probably the second smartest thing Palm has done in a span of seven days -- the first was striking that amazing deal on Verizon for a super-cheap Palm Pre Plus along with free Mobile Hotspot service. Now, we can look forward to a future where our children won't cower in fear when they see a Palm ad on television, and we can sleep at night without the image of that pale woman burned into our minds. Of course, now that we've seen it, we can never un-see it.
