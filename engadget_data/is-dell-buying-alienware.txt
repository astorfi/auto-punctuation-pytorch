However, CNET is now reporting that the deal may already be done -- though they admit that theycurrently have no confirmation. CNET did speak to an Alienware PR exec, who provided a written statement that read, inpart, "at this time, Alienware will not comment on any speculative stories or rumors concerning Dell andAlienware's association." Dell, of course, has spent heavily to build its XPS brand as a high-end alternative for gamers, and purchasingAlienware would automatically give Dell a major share of that market -- though it's unclear what would happen to theXPS brand under such circumstances. At this point, however, it's all guesswork -- though we wouldn't mind picking up adiscontinued XPSRenegade in Dell's outlet if the deal goes through.
