 We were secretly hoping that RIM's acquisition of the blackpad.com domain name was nothing more than a joke (or a preventative measure, at worse), but it sure sounds as if that'll be the name the folks in Waterloo go with come this winter. According to unnamed sources who have unloaded new information to Bloomberg, RIM's first tablet will actually be "introduced in November," though there's no clear indication as to when it'll ship. Said sources have also stated that the device will sport a 9.7-inch display, inbuilt WiFi and Bluetooth, and a downright comical Blackpad label. We get the BlackBerry link and all, but really? Here's hoping for a last minute change of heart.
