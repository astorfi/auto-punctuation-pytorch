Microsoft was apparently planning on revealing these details tonight at a pre-E3 shindig, but the leaks got the better of them (including an Italian ad that also mentions the Kinect brand). There's still no word on price or release date, but hopefully we'll be hearing about that later this week. The USA Today writeup also mentions a few titles, including Kinectimals, Joyride, Kinect Sports, Kinect Adventures, Dance Central, and properties based on Star Wars and Disney characters.
