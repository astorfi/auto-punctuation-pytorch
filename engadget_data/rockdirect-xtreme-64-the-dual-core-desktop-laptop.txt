For gamers and enthusiasts, how could two cores in that lappie not be better than one? Well, for starters, if it's a
dual-core chip in a laptop right now (as opposed to next
year), it's actually taking that "desktop replacement" thing a little too literally by transplanting a real life
desktop CPU. Such is the nostalgic case of Rockdirect's Xtreme 64, and its fantabulous AMD Athlon 64 X2 processor, with
performance rounded out by means of an ATI Mobility Radeon X800 XT, PCI-Express, and a healthy price to offset those
thoughts of finally entering the boring world of home ownership.
