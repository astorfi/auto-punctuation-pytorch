The codenamed "Flagship" and "Advanced Amateur" models have since made their way onto Sony's official website, hinting that these two may be hitting shelves sooner rather than later. Of course, Sony isn't the only big gun with potential DSLR plans swirling in the backroom, so don't be surprised if these two happen to coincide with rival launches that are supposedly forthcoming. Unfortunately, details beyond face value are still unknown, but feel free to leap on through to take a peek at the Advanced Amateur Alpha on its best behavior.[Via AkihabaraNews]
