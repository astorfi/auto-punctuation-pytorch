Much like HTC itself, leaksters have also been hard at work to help promote this company. Courtesy of ePrice, the latest spy shots feature the upcoming 5.9-inch One Max, and specifically, this is a dual-SIM model destined for China Unicom. Like the One Dual (or better known as 802w, 802t or 802d in China), this much bigger device sports a removable metallic back cover for access to the dual SIM slots, along with what appears to be a microSD slot at the top right corner. There are also a set of docking pins towards the bottom right on the back, so chances are we'll see official dock accessories for this bad boy.




More interestingly, below the camera you'll find a square hole, which seems to be reserved for a fingerprint scanner (our understanding is that it's common for HTC prototypes to have missing components during development). In fact, last week the same website released a sketchy photo that showed a One Max with the square hole occupied, but the latest shots are more convincing albeit without the component. Regardless, this is further supported by the presence of a "Fingerprint" button on the quick settings menu (which has also gained an edit button for rearranging things), as shown above.


Last but not least, it looks like HTC's experimenting with dual-camera capture functionality. Like on the LG Optimus G Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S 4, you can move and resize the second viewfinder, but right now it is limited to just a simple rectangular shape. Until the rumored "end of October" launch date, you can head over to ePrice for more spy shots.
