In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line.

Richard Haberkern's pretty much got this Kickstarter thing nailed down. The Soundlazer and Lumapad creator has now turned his attention to Arduino-based location logging, and needs your cash to produce the GPS Cookie. Slam in a microSD card and some batteries, and the unit will track the time, route, speed and altitude of all of your journeys. Coming in cookie and sandwich-shaped versions, the unit's available to backers for $79, while solder-happy modders can snag the unassembled version for $25. Unfortunately, the early-backer editions have already been snaffled. Curious to learn more? The video's after the break.



Previous Project Update: Looks like Split hasn't yet captured your imagination, having raised less than $10,000 of its $435,000 goal. On the upside, there's still plenty of time to add your money to the pile.
