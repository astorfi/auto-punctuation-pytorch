Expected to launch August 27, they range in length from 1m to 10m, and in price from ¥4,000 ($42) to ¥20,000 ($210.) Sure you could import them just to stunt on your Monster Cable owning friends, but somehow we suspect most will be waiting for these to hit Monoprice, Blue Jeans Cable and the like, oh, and for equipment that can actually take advantage of their extra capabilities.[Via AV Watch]
