 If you picked up a Surface Pro or another pen-friendly Windows 8 tablet, you're likely eager to wring every ounce of productivity out of that stylus. Microsoft hears your call. It just updated the OneNote app for Windows 8 to give pen customization a shot in the arm: a new radial menu makes it easier to choose a pen's color and weight while saving favorite pens to quick-access slots. Whether or not drawing's your thing, Microsoft has also simplified syncing with support for pulling in Office 365 notebooks, not just those stored on SkyDrive. Avid note-takers only need to grab the upgrade from the source link.
