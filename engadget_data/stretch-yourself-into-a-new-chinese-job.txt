From the country that brought you thousands of years of traditional foot binding comes the latest craze in painful
bodily structure modifications: leg stretching! Ok, so we can see that when a nation's populace enters the billions the
job market becomes so flooded that the only way to confidently seek employment is to have the edge of a "stretching
machine," which will draw (but not quarter) a user into being a bit taller. We're not saying it's not disconcerting, of
course, but apparently jobs there actually list height requirements, so if nothing else one must appreciate the
recursion of creating jobs at companies making stretching machines for stretching people to help them get jobs.
