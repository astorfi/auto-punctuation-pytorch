Uncharted's swashbuckling adventures already looked good on the PlayStation 3, so how will they improve on the PS4? Quite a lot, apparently. Naughty Dog has just shown off the first gameplay from Uncharted 4 at PlayStation Experience, and we won't lie: it's gorgeous. Characters look so good in-game that you'd think you were watching a cutscene, while even cliff faces (and there are many cliff faces) appear all too real. You'll also see some new game mechanics that promise to inject new life into the series, including grappling hooks and pinions that get you across seemingly impossible challenges. It's a shame that you'll still have to wait until 2015 to play, but this preview suggests that it could be worth the wait.
