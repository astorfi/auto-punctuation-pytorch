Atmel and u-blox AG have just released SuperSense, a GPS weak signal tracking technology that supports Atmel's
ANTARIS GPS chipsets and GPS modules from u-blox. The companies claim the software will allow for accurate GPS
navigation inside buildings, in deep urban canyons, and in covered roads. The software also reduces the need for
external antennas in car GPS systems, which can instead be mounted in glove compartments or under seats, while
apparently still providing the same signal reception.
