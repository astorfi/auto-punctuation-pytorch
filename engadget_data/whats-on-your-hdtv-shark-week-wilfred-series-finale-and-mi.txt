This week sports fans can check out preseason NFL action, Little League World Series and the US Men's basketball team. Of course, it's also Shark Week and as usual, Discovery is trying to squeeze a few more specials out of everything related to the creatures. Our highlight for the week is looking at the ocean, but it comes from Netflix, where the Mission Blue documentary will premiere early Friday morning. It follows oceanographer Sylvia Earle on her mission to save oceans from threats like overfishing, pollution and climate change. Finales include a season wrap-up for Last Comic Standing and the series finale for FXX's Wilfred. Check after the break for a list of what's new this week plus a few trailers, and drop a note in the comments if you see any highlights we've missed.
