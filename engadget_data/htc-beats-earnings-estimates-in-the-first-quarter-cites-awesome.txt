 There's no doubt the impending legal antics are weighing on hearts and minds inside HTC, but for now, the company's got other fish to fry -- like the first quarter's financial results, for example. Fortunately, pretty much everything came up roses here with $1.2 billion in revenue, up some 19.3 percent year-over-year and nearly 11 percent higher than the high end of its estimate going into the call, though that still represents an 8 percent drop against the last quarter -- holiday quarters are typically blockbusters, so no huge surprise there. HTC credits a "successful" marketing campaign for its success; we credit awesome hardware, but we'd guess the real answer lies somewhere in between. Quietly brilliant, indeed.
