  HBO has slowly been bringing HBO Go to a multitude of connected platforms, from Roku boxes to some Samsung connected TVs, and now we finally know when it'll come to the Xbox 360. Tonight at an HBO event in San Francisco, company Co-President, Eric Kessler, gave us the good news that Microsoft's console will be getting the streaming service on April 1st. It'll make its debut alongside the premiere of season two of Game of Thrones, so you'll finally be able to jump straight from the hills of Tamriel to the fields of Winterfell with the greatest of ease.
