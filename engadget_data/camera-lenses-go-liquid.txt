Though people have been kicking around the idea of it for a little while now, it appears that French company
Varioptic's patents on water and oil based liquid lenses are finally ready to yield some early prototypes. This could
be a huge milestone for portable optics, as liquid lenses would theoretically have 1/10th the power consumption as
regular lenses, an extremely fast response rate (2/100ths of a second) and with no moving parts, have very small
dimensions in a durable, robust package. Sound too good to be true? Well, we'll see what develops, but apparently
Samsung and Philips are very anxious to get rolling with this, and we can see why.
