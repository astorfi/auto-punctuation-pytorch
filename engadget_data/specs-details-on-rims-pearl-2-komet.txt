 We don't have a picture in our hot little hands just yet, but sure enough, it looks like RIM's SureType torchbearer is getting a little (or maybe not so little) facelift in the coming months. Codnamed "Komet," the Pearl's successor allegedly gets hooked up with a whopping 3.2 megapixel camera sporting a landscape viewfinder, WiFi, an external microSD slot, and support for Windows Media. Oh, and you need some sort of listening apparatus for that Windows Media, right? Try your pick of A2DP support and a 3.5mm jack (hallelujah!). No word on when or where the Komet sees its debut, but we'll bide our time with the Curve in the meanwhile, thankyouverymuch. Click through for the full spec sheet!
