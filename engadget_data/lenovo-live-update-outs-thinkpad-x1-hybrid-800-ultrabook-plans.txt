Lenovo doesn't seem too thrilled about it either, and are prepping to launch a new twist on the X1 sporting a battery efficient "Instant Media Mode" sometime this month. A recent Lenovo Live update dubs the refresh the "ThinkPad X1 Hybrid, and shows the rig rocking the same media interface as the IdeaPad K1. The Hybrid promises Windows 7 / Media Mode switching, instant-on convenience and enough juice to get you through eight hours of video playback or up to 10 hours of web browsing. The document also details plans to release 13 and 14-inch Ultrabooks in May starting at $1300 and $800, respectively, as well as the ThinkPad x130e -- an apparent successor to the X120e, ruggedized and due in December.
