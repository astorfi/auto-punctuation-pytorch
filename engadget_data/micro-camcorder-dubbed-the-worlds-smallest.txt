Designed to actually slip inside an empty pack of gum, this device features a "one touch record button," captures video at a less-than-stellar 15fps, holds footage on a microSD card, and can be recharged via USB. Reportedly, users can capture up to 33-hours of low-res video on a 1GB card, and two hours of that can be captured on a single charge. 'Course, whether or not this all is worth the stiff $295 asking price is certainly debatable.[Via The Raw Feed]
