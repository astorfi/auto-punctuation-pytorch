The laptop will be similar to the N210 (pictured), with a 10.1-inch screen, 3G, WiFi, 2GB of RAM, 64GB of flash storage and a purported 12 hour battery life. There are also rumors that it'll be running a 1.5GHz Snapdragon processor, but the amount of straight up information from Phil makes speculation almost feel silly at this point. The netbook is supposed to be introduced later this year.
