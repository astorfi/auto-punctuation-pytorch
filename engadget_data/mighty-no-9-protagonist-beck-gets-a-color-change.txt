In an update post on the Mighty No. 9 Kickstarter page, game director Koji Imaeda explains that Beck's color scheme has gone from one dominated by gray to one defined by white.

"From the very beginning we designed Beck to have a neutral, grey base, with the idea of wanting to make something completely new and unique," Imaeda writes. "But development soldiered on, and as we approached the last leg, we started looking closer at Beck. As a protagonist that could absorb the abilities of his siblings and take on various forms, our image of his appropriate color shifted from 'neutrality' to 'containing all possibilities' ... and since white is a combination of all colors of light, we felt that would actually suit his character better!"

Makes sense to us. The justification also sounds a little familiar ...
