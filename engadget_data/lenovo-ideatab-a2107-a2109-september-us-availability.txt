The Chinese company's currently showcasing two new US-bound, ICS-based IdeaTabs on its website, starting with the 7-inch A2107 which had previously made the rounds in China under a different moniker, and followed by a 9-inch (1280 x 800) A2109 that's said to be "full size fun on a small budget." Unfortunately, full spec and pricing details are relatively scarce at the moment, though Lenovo's product page does tell us they should both be available at some point next month. For now, feel free to head over to the source link below if you'd like to give 'em a quick view.
