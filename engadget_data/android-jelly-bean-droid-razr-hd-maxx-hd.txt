 If this is the new Motorola, then we have to say we're fast becoming fans. Hot on the heels of the Droid RAZR M's recent Jelly Bean update, comes word that Android 4.1 will indeed be rolling out to the Droid RAZR HD and RAZR Maxx HD in December. Announced as an update on Verizon's site, the OTA is said to arrive "in phases starting next week," bringing with it the eerily prescient Google Now and ISIS compatibility. So, until then, you can hold off from manually (and obsessively) refreshing that system update setting.
