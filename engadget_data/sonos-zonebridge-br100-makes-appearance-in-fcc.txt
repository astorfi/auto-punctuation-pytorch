Well, not really FOR you, it's got confidentiality agreements all plastered all over any truly useful information, but we do have the above image, and know it's called the ZoneBridge BR100. Since we don't yet know for sure what exactly it does, we're going to take a wild guess and peg this as some kind of low cost box with no audio hardware which is intended to plug into your network, thus bridging to the Sonos's proprietary mesh wireless network so you don't have to keep a more expensive ZonePlayer box close to your router or nearest Ethernet connection. If indeed that's what it is, we'll take it!
