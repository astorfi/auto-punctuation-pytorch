There's an old cliche about high-definition television that the picture is so good
that you can count the number of pores on the actors' noses. The downside is that that extra level of detail is
going to prove cruel to some performers since you can actually see all the imperfections now.  Philip Swan watched
Showtime's recent HDTV broadcast of a Britney Spears concert and reports that things aren't looking too pretty for
her:



At the tender age of 22, Spears doesn't have to worry about crow's feet yet. However, during tonight's concert in
 Miami, she looked like she hadn't slept in days. Her face was bumpy and puffy, making her appear five to ten years
 older than her years. The pop princess, who reportedly has been partying hard at night spots across the globe, simply
 didn't look very healthy tonight under the naked lens of high-def. Her make-up artists apparently tried to conceal
 the imperfections with heavy rouge on her cheeks, but it just added to the overall mess.



Ouch!
