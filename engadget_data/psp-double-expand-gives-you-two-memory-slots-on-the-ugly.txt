The adaptor plugs into your regular Memory Stick slot, attaches to the back of your PSP, and offers up a pair of SD/miniSD/MMC/Memory Stick slots. It's also dirt cheap, at a mere $16.77 US, so if you can get over the clunky method (which is diagrammed after the break) then you can, um, do whatever you'd do with two memory slots instead of one -- for cheap.[Via PSP Fanboy]
