Kensington's new Laptop Desktop USB (whose name invokes many a fabled childhood session of "Red Light Green Light
1-2-3!") is almost a lot of things, like a Dell D/View, or a universal laptop stand, or even a docking stationâ€”but just
not quite. While it seems a good idea, they claim it won't fit all those lovely 17-inch multimedia laptops coming out
these days; and while we're totally into the USB docking station thing, four ports just isn't enough for device-heavy
users. And the laptop stand thing? Well, you can judge for yourself, but trust us, we've used the D/View stand before
(which is the exact same thing, but Dell-only) and we'd say your hard earned dollas might be best saved for that nice
new monitor you've been eyeing.
