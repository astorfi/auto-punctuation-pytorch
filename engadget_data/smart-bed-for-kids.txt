Sleep Number brought the world the smart bed at CES 2014. And now, for kids! The SleepIQ Kids bed, however, isn't simply a smaller iteration in primary colors. While it offers the same sleep monitor nous of the SleepIQ bed for grown-ups, there's also some simple features for parents to help gauge their kids' sleep, can be adjusted for firmness, as well as things like a monster detector. (Aww.)





The bed connects to Sleep Number's sleep "dashboard", which constantly monitors use. While this would include hours slept, it can also alert parents when a kid in out of bed or there's a lot of movement going on. As kids grow, the SleepIQ Kids bed can have its firmness adjusted, while like its predecessors, the bed can arch upwards for big picture books and bedtime stories. Parents can also turn of lights around the bed remotely, with under-bed lights also activating when a kid gets up. The future of beds doesn't come cheap: The SleepIQ Kids Bed will launch this year, with prices starting at $1,000 at Sleep Number's own site and its own stores.
