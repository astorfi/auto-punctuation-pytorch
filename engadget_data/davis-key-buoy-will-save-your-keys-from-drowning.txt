No, not key as in keyboard, but rather as in, "Dude, where's my (bump) keys?" or more accurately, "Holy crap, I just dropped my keys into the ocean." Fear not, because for the low price of $7 you can now buy a new keychain fob that promises to save your keychain from maritime disaster. When your keys hit the water, the Davis Key Buoy will open up and inflate a 14-inch long bright orange cylinder for easy spotting within 30 seconds and will hold them there for up to 40 minutes. Of course, if you carry a warden-sized set of keys with you then this won't work, as it only supports up to 4.2 oz (120 g) of weight. Now if some company could team up with Davis to make an inexpensive waterproof 2GB flash drive that would inflate to the surface in the event of a water landing, then they'd have a product we'd surely buy.[Via OhGizmo]
