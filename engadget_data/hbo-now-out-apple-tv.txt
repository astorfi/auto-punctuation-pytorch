HBO's cable-free streaming service, HBO Now, is available right this very second on Apple TV, iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, HBO says in a press release. Interested cable-cutters can see sign-up instructions and access HBO Now on desktops here. The service is exclusive to Apple devices for now -- Cablevision is offering its internet customers subscriptions too -- and costs $15 a month. Remember, the new season of Game of Thrones launches in just five days, so if HBO Now's exclusivity deal with Apple sounds as restrictive as a Dothraki barber shop, that's only because it is. The FAQ says an Android app is "coming soon" (probably outside Apple's 90-day exclusive window), and content-wise it should match what we've seen from HBO Go.
