 digg_url = 'http://digg.com/playstation/Netflix_shipping_out_PS3_instant_streaming_discs';  It's been a long wait for PS3 users, who had to look on in envy as their Xbox 360 counterparts kicked back and started streaming Netflix as of July last year. Well, the wait is finally over, as PS3 instant streaming discs are being sent out to Netflix users (who've requested them) as we speak. Looks like our friend Jonathan here has a Friday delivery in store for him, while the lazier ones among us hunker down for an XMB software update late next year to let us stream Netflix to the PS3 disc-free, in keeping with the natural order of things.
