 In the all hype that built up before CES this year we were really excited to check out the Quad HD display from Westinghouse. We went by the Westinghouse booth to check it out, the odd thing was the display was in the back of the booth and not marked very well. After receiving some help we found the display with some scientific data showing. Other than industrial uses we're not sure what we would use this 52" display with a resolution of 3840 x 2160. It would take one good scaler to scale the image that big.
