 
Sure, you lament about this or that certain smartphone not coming to your wireless provider of choice, but imagine if that phone hadn't even been released in your country. For those who are Russian and for whom That Certain Smartphone is the HTC Hero, your time is finally coming, and soon. HTC sent out devices to many members of the .RU press, but rather than providing functioning ones they received models made entirely of chocolate. Not entirely encouraging, but the company's Cyrillic Twitter page (which has been responsible for creating a stir in the past) is saying the phone is coming soon, as in the next few weeks, and HTC also created a Facebook fan page for the phone over the weekend. So, buckle up Russian readers; looks like you're getting your Hero soon.
