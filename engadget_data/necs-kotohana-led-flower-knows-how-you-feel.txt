Well dreams do come true, because NEC is going to be presenting their KotoHana (the talking flower) at CeBitthis year. It's pretty hard to tell what's going on here, but there seems to be a "Sensibility Technology"that recognizes the user's feelings, and then tells the flower over a wireless connection. The system works over theInternet, so even from far away the flower's LEDs can light up to reflect your true feelings to that special someone.
