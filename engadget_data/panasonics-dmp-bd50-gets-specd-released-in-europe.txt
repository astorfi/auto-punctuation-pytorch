Sadly, we're still left to wonder about the price, but the website does dish out a whole slew of specifications. Granted, there's not anything out of the ordinary: BD-Live, UniPhier chip, Deep Color compatibility, 1080p24 playback, Dolby TrueHD / DTS-HD support, VIERA Link, DivX support, SD expansion slot and an Ethernet jack. The site does warn, however, that these specs are valid "on the European model only," but we don't imagine the US edition being all that different. Now, if anyone across the pond actually finds one for sale, do us all a favor and holler, cool?[Thanks, Eric R.]
