If you live in a major city and usually spend your evenings and weekends bored at home, then you might want to give Facebook's new Events feature a try. Following on its recent commitment to improving its events calendar, the social media giant has just announced the ability to browse upcoming happenings by category -- they include Music, Food & Drinks, Nightlife, Sports & Fitness and more -- in ten major US cities. They are New York, NY; Los Angeles, CA; Chicago, IL; Washington, DC; Boston, MA; San Francisco, CA; Dallas, TX; Seattle, WA; Miami, FL and Houston, TX. You can look up what's happening around you or any of the other locales, which should be handy if you're making travel plans. The feature is currently only available on Facebook's iOS app -- just look for it in the Events dashboard -- with a rollout to Android some time in the near future.




Update: TechCrunch has more info about the update, and apparently, you can specify the date you want to party to narrow down events. You can also browse the new "Suggested For You" section to see what Facebook thinks you'll enjoy based on your information. Finally, those sections we mentioned earlier? They can all be sorted by date, so you can easily see which events are happening on the days you're free.
