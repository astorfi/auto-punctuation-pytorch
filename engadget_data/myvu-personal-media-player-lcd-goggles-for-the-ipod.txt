Well,manufacturer MicroOptical Corp. is pretty busy, because this week they're hawking the same goggles at Macworld as theMyVu Personal Media Player, which they claim will "accelerate" the adoption of the iPod by providing"hands free, head-up access to a large virtual image." We may be naive here, but we somehow don't think Appleneeds MicroOptical to accelerate the iPod's market growth. MicroOptical doesn't list a price for the MyVu, but theFrench version is â‚¬299 ($361), so we expect similar pricing here.
