 Apple's done its level best to lure help you over to iCloud from MobileMe, and it looks like it's not quite done yet. We're seeing reports from users who have received messages advising that the additional storage offered to ease the transition has been extended for another 12 months, sans cost to you. Whether a charge will kick in right away when that period ends, and at what price isn't made clear. But if you like to drag your data heels, or want to take your sweet time deciding if the new service is for you, it looks like luck is on your side.
