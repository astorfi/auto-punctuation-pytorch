 Making official what already appeared inevitable, the European Union says that it intends to add DVB-H as the standard of choice for mobile terrestrial broadcasts across its lands. For all practical purposes, the choice was little more than a formality; despite lobbying from South Korea for adoption of T-DMB, DVB-H was already gaining ground as the de facto protocol across most European countries (Germany being a notable exception), and it certainly helps when Nokia and the EU itself have both poured money into its development. Qualcomm's MediaFLO appears to have come in a distant third place, having being eliminated early on by the EU for representing a "proprietary solution." Someone want to clue in Verizon and AT&T on that bit?[Via mocoNews]
