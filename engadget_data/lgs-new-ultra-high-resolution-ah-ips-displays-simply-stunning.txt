Of course, written resolution claims merely provide verisimilitude; viewing is the only way to discern their veracity. We saw the screens, ranging from a petite 3.5 inches to a prodigious 84-inch panel, at SID 2011 and were impressed enough to begin scheming ways to get a wall of these for Engadget HQ. Unfortunately, we don't know how many dollars LG wants for its plethora of panels or when they'll go on sale, but you can bet we'll keep you posted. If our impressions and that mouthful of a moniker haven't sold you on the awesomeness of AH-IPS, then take a gander at the gallery and let the pixel-packed pics persuade you.
