 
OpenPeak is a company so open it just can't resist throwing the word into damn-near every product it makes, and the new OpenTablet 7 is no exception. The number refers to the size of the thing: a seven-inch TFT LCD tablet with LED backlighting, 802.11b/g/n wireless, Bluetooth, and 3G connectivity. It's all powered by an Intel Moorestown processor, and is designed to serve as a "fully functioning telephone and multimedia platform," the latter bit helped by a microSD slot and not one but two cameras. It will quite naturally run the OpenPeak platform, which is powered by Flash, meaning no concerns about back and forth name calling here. No concerns about pre-ordering yet, either, as the company hasn't seen fit to tell us when this will be shipping, or how much it will cost when it does.
