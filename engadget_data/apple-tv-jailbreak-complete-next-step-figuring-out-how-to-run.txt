MuscleNerd reports that the Shatter jailbreaking endeavor has claimed its latest iOS victim today, though as you can see for yourself, it's "not quite ready for prime time yet." App installations still have to be figured out, but at least the door's been opened for making some good, if not magical, things happen. You'll find video evidence of root access after the break.
