In a decision sure to make a few people elated while giving a hint of suspicion to most others, the merged company will offer customers a package that includes "less channels" at a monthly price lower than $12.95, one that seems "substantially similar" for exactly $12.95, and finally, a third option that touts even more channels for "a modest premium." We can only assume that the pricey third alternative will boast a nice mixture of both companies' existing lineups, but unfortunately, it also leaves open the possibility that the cheaper two options might exemplify the "you only get what you pay for" tagline.[Thanks, Frankenstein B.]
