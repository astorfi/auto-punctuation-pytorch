No sign of it at Best Buy yet so you're stuck with a $399 4GB model (only) at the moment. A $10.33 shipping insult is added to the failed expectation injury starting today.Update: Sold out! Of course, NewEgg's initial allotment could have been one unit for all we know. Fortunately for those on the hunt, it looks like NewEgg expects to restock tomorrow.[Via I4U News, thanks Jason H.]
