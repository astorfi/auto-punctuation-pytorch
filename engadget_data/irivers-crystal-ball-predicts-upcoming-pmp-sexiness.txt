Some of these we've already seen, like the P10, Unit 2 and W7, but the new Spinn and IAmoled P20 (pictured) and Wing are easily worth the price of admission. The Spinn uses iriver's new SPINN analog toggle wheel that we spotted on that APlayer DAP, but also tosses in a 3.2-inch 480 x 272 screen, Bluetooth 2.0, Flash 2.0 gaming and DMB in regions where available. Capacities hit 4GB, 8GB and 16GB of flash memory. Iriver is also prepping the IAmoled Photo Tank media storage unit, which packs a 80GB or 160GB HDD and 4.1-inch AMOLED screen. The unit uses the same SPINN interface and matches the Spinn on specs, but adds TV out and SD / CF slots. Finally, iriver's Wing ultraportable handheld features the Windows CE Pro OS, WiFi, a QWERTY keyboard and 4GB of flash memory. There's also a SD card slot and plenty of VoIP and web-friendly features, including IM and a browser. Obviously we have no idea when these will be hitting the market or for how much, but hopefully iriver will have them ready before the middle of the year. Peep Spinn and Wing after the break.Update: The iAMOLED is actually the P20 in two prototype flavors: a prototype 1 model for consumers (pictured) and a 120GB / 160GB photo storage solution for photogs. iAMOLED appears to refer to a partnership between iriver and Samsung to bring the world's first AMOLED display on a handheld device.
