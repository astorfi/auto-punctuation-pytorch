Needless to say, this can be a real headache for phone fanatics stuck on a carrier that doesn't support their desired devices, unless they don't mind surfing the web on 2G radio (if compatible at all). Luckily, nowadays Motorola tends to take good care of all potential Chinese customers whenever it rolls out a new Android phone, including the Droid RAZR (aka XT910, pictured right) in this case. Read on to find out what these two new phones are about.






Starting from the left we have the XT928 with CDMA2000 radio, a 13 megapixel imager and Dolby Digital Plus certification, but details on weight and dimensions are still guarded by the crouching tiger. While China Telecom has confirmed on Sina Weibo that we're looking at a RAZR variant here with the same screen and processor, it's obvious that externally this is more of a follow-up to the Droid X series. Interestingly, our reader Chris spotted a similar-looking prototype shown off in a Starbucks situated about a mile from Motorola's headquarters in Schaumburg, so there's a small chance that the XT928 will also show up in the US market (and we'd wager on the "Droid X3" moniker).Sandwiched between the two phones is the TD-SCDMA-friendly MT917 that first appeared earlier this month. Bearing much resemblance to the first Droid RAZR, this rounder-looking device gets bumped up with a larger 4.5-inch 1,280 x 720 LCD (according to its certification document) and the same 13 megapixel camera as the XT928. Similarly though, this model also gains 1mm in body thickness and 11g in weight.There's no concrete info on release dates just yet, but we heard through the Chinese grapevine that both phones are expected to be out over there by the end of the year. Not that it'd be of any use for the rest of us outside China, anyway, no thanks to all those different radio standards.[Thanks, Chris]
