 You've had a day to renew your membership, book plane tickets and beg, borrow or steal $1,600 from your neighbors. Now it's time to sit on the WWDC homepage and find out if you'll actually be able to attend Apple's annual software shindig. The tickets go on sale in just an hour, so here's a friendly heads-up that you should get a cup of coffee, charge that battery pack and practice hitting F5, just in case.

 Update: We've just seen a new definition of fast. As developers have noticed, Apple sold out of WWDC tickets in about two minutes -- and possibly sooner than that.
