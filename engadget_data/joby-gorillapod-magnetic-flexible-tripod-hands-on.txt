It wouldn't be with the fanciest of cameras, and we're sure wind resistance would throw you off your game, but we are curious if Joby's Gorillapod Magnetic would be able to hold tight. The flexible little tripod's tips certainly give it a surprisingly strong pull -- a shame it only holds 11 ounces, else we'd be putting our DSLRs in some crazy and unreasonable spots. Want one now? You're in luck -- it's on sale over at Joby's website for a pile of change less than $25.
