We've come across Tokyo taxis with cellphone
chargers before (hell, we've come across taxis here that are fitted with most things), but Kyoto taxi company Ecolo21
are playing up their planet-friendly image by fitting the roof-mounted lights on their fleet with miniature
wind-powered generators that you can use to charge your cellphone in the back seat. There are only two minor flaws in
their otherwise laudable plan; one, the generator charges directly so you only get juice while the fan on the roof is
spinning, and twoâ€¦they've only fitted out one car so far. They do promise to introduce a version that charges a battery
and to fit them to more of the fleet in future, however.
