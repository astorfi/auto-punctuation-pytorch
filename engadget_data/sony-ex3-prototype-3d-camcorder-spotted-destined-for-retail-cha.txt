That's unfortunately all we really know at this point, but if this two-eyed beaut does go to market (and we hear that it most certainly will), it looks like Panasonic's 3D camcorder will have some healthy competition. And hey, we're all for having more options.

Update: A trusted source just chimed in with some specs, and it's looking like Sony's basically just crammed the guts of two PMW-EX3 studio cams into a single shell for this prototype. That's not a bad thing: behind those proprietary hot-swappable lens cartridges are the same two three half-inch CMOS eyeballs that stream 4:2:0 MPEG-2 video at 1080p to SxS memory cards at 35Mbps per eye, or send uncompressed 4:4:4 footage over a new pair of HD-SDI outputs. Our source was pretty excited about how close together those eyes were, too -- he whispered something about an industry-first 1.5-inch interocular distance, before vanishing into the darkness without a word on price or availability.

Update 2: The EX3 has three CMOS chips, not two. [Thanks, The Advanced Kind]
