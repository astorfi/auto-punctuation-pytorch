Samsung's development labs are apparently overflowing with new products. We've seen a number of new Galaxy smartphones and tablets over the last few weeks, but the company has more to show -- or at least something notable enough to warrant its own soiree in London. We're expecting a focus on Samsung's Windows 8 ATIV range, most likely in several hardware options, but we're sure there has to be something from its Galaxy family that it still hasn't unveiled just yet. Is it a next-gen Note? An Android-powered ILC camera? Join us at the time (and link) below because we'll be covering it all.
