No, not the Coolslice homeslice, rather the Pocket Projector. Weighing just 1.1 pounds, this LED projector is either incredibly small, or that's a Texas-sized coffee mug... either of which could be true in Dell country. No word on release date though we expect it to pop with the rest of the Latitude E-series in Q4.[Thanks, William]
