Building on its broad line of innovative 3D and Internet connected TVs, Sony's 2011 BRAVIA LCD HDTV line include 16 new 3D capable models and 22 Internet connected models. In all, the line features 27 new models ranging in screen size from 22 inches to 65 inches (measured diagonally)."Sony's BRAVIA televisions deliver a complete entertainment experience – from instant access to online video content to the immersiveness of 3D theatrical features, sports, and video games, we're redefining the form and function of television," said Chris Fawcett, vice president for Sony's television business. "While innovative features are important, rest assured that Sony's hallmark picture quality and unmatched industrial design remains intact, making BRAVIA the perfect centerpiece for any home décor." Lean Back and SurfDelivering the entertainment you want, when you want it, the 2011 BRAVIA line offers 22 models that deliver instant access to online entertainment. Whether connecting to a home broadband network via Wi-Fi (802.11n) or Ethernet connection, compatible models offer access to over 40 free and premium movies, video, and music services through the BRAVIA Internet Video platform including Sony's Video On Demand and Music Unlimited powered by Qriocity™, as well as Netflix™, Pandora®, HuluPlus™, Amazon Video on Demand, YouTube™, Slacker® Internet Radio, Crackle, Blip.tv.Video On Demand powered by Qriocity is a premium video streaming service with instant access to Hollywood blockbusters, and Music Unlimited powered by Qriocity is a cloud-based, streaming music service which gives music lovers access at anytime to a constantly expanding catalog of over six million global music tracks from major labels.A number of the new BRAVIA models will also have Skype™ embedded.

Users can also make voice calls while simultaneously watching TV.The new connected models also make certain users will never have to wonder what that song playing during their favorite movie, TV program, or commercial is again. Sony's new Track ID powered by Gracenote, analyzes any selected song playing back on the TV, identifies it, and provides artist, album, and song information.Expanding 3DThe 2011 BRAVIA line includes 16 new 3D models that deliver outstanding performance with Sony's active shutter technology. Building on last year, the new line offers affordable 3D entry models all the way up to Sony's top-of-the-line flagship models that pack best-in-class picture quality with every feature for the complete entertainment experience.Improvements to this year's 3D models include panel drive enhancements that deliver quicker response time helping to reduce crosstalk, 5:5 pull down for a more realistic cinematic movie experience, built-in 3D emitters on all 3D models.Expanding the 3D content users can view, the new BRAVIA 3D capable models can display 3D images taken with Sony's new Cyber-shot cameras like the DSC-WX9 via USB input.Driving Picture QualityFrom full HD 1080p Blu-ray Disc, to broadcast HD, to user-generated Internet Video content, processing of incoming content is essential for an excellent picture. To this end, Sony has upgraded the BRAVIA processing power with the new X-Reality PRO and X-Reality Engine digital video processors.The X-Reality PRO Engine is a two-chip digital video processor that optimizes high definition content, compressed HD signals, standard definition, and other sources including low resolution Internet content. Utilizing a vast database of "ideal" signal patterns developed by analyzing and indexing and enormous library of film and video, the X-Reality PRO Engine compares incoming signals pixel-by-pixel with ideal scenes to display vivid and detailed images. Additionally, the engine's multi-frame analysis helps create missing resolution and Sony's Super Bit Mapping technology incorporates 14 bit up-scaling, processing and pixel mapping to smooth gradation and improve the quality of low-tone pictures.Found in select models, the single chip X-Reality Engine utilizes Sony's Intelligent Image Enhancer technology to deliver outstanding picture quality. Incoming video is separated into constituent parts (outline, texture, and color/contrast), and the appropriate image enhancement is added to each part. The engine also uses Intelligent MPEG Noise Reduction to automatically detect the incoming sources and noise level to apply the appropriate amount of noise reduction for each scene.Also new for select models is Sony's Intelligent Peak LED Backlight which uses full array local dimming for deeper blacks, while also boosting brightness in lighter scenes creating incredible on-screen contrast, while Sony's OptiContrast panel elevates the picture to the front surface of the TV and creates a dark background for rich, vibrant, high contrast picture even in well-lit rooms.Sony's MotionFlow™ XR builds on previous versions of the company's motion compensation technology and helps to reduce blur caused by quick camera movements, enhancing sharpness and creating a clearer picture.Simplifying User Interface and FunctionalitySelect new BRAVIA models feature Sony's improved user interface that delivers uninterrupted viewing and intuitive navigation. Retaining the intuitive operation of the award-winning Xross Bar (XMB™), the new UI provides uninterrupted viewing by disseminating the video and placing key menu functions and favorite along the bottom and side of the picture frame.Additionally, the models feature an improved remote control and offer control via the Media Remote application on iPhone, iPod Touch or Android mobile device. The app, which can be downloaded from the Apple App Store or the Android Marketplace, functions as a full remote with keyboard, allows online content search, and playback.BRAVIA XBR-HX929 Series 3D Capable HDTVAvailable in April, Sony's new 3D capable (with the addition of Sony active shutter glasses, sold separately), XBR-HX929 series features brilliant full HD (1080p) picture quality with Sony's Intelligent Peak LED backlight for outstanding contrast.The model also features Sony's MotionFlow XR 960 featuring a precise backlight control that is synchronized with the liquid crystal movement from frame to frame creating clearer, sharper moving images.The beautifully designed model features Sony's improved Monolithic Design Concept that draws viewers into the picture when the TV is turned on, and blends into the room décor when turned off.
