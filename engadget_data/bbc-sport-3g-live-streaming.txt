Not only will you be able to stream live coverage, like the current crop of Euro 2012 football matches, but also any existing video content that was previously desktop-bound. Hit up the source link to give it a try; you'll need Android 2.2 or higher or an iOS device that's packing version 5. Sorry, non-sporting Brits. You're going to find the Olympics pretty hard to miss this summer.
