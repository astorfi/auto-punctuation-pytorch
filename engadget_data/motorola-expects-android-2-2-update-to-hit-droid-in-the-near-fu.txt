But for those who purchased Motorola's first heavy-hitter since the RAZR, it looks as if they'll be close behind in enjoying the spoils. According to a Motorola spokesperson quoted at Slashgear (full statement is past the break), the company is expecting the original Droid to get Android 2.2 "in the near future," though he / she wouldn't go so far as to provide specifics beyond that. Better still, the same person stated that Motorola is excited about Froyo in general, and it's "looking forward to integrating it on [the firm's] Android-based devices as [the software] is made available." We hate to read too deeply into anything, but "devices" sure gets our digits tingling.

"We're excited to see Google's news of the next version of the Android operating system and look forward to integrating it on our Android-based devices as it's made available to the open source community."While I can't comment on specifics, we do expect DROID by Motorola users will receive Android 2.2 as a software upgrade in the near future."
