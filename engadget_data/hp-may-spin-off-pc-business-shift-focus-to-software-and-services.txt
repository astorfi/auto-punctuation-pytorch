 Word 'round the campfire is, HP may be prepping to spin off its PC business. Though Hewlett-Packard is the world's largest computer company, desktops and laptops are a relatively low profit margin business. Obviously, there's no confirmation yet that such a split will happen, but with the recent focus on tablets and smartphones, and CEO Leo Apotheker's own admission that he'd like to expand into software and services, the move would make sense. According to Bloomberg the announcement could come as soon as today, during the company's quarterly earnings call, where it's also expected to reveal a $10 billion purchase of software company Autonomy Corp. We'll be listening in live later, so check back this afternoon to see if HP sets its PC business free.
