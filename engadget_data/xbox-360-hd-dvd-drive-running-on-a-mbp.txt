It isn't really that extraordinary, but one step ahead of what you might have thought of. This is one of those videos where a Engadget HD contributor not only made his Xbox 360 HD DVD drive work with his computer, but took it one step further and got it running on his Mac Book Pro, unfortunately he used Boot Camp to make it happen. It would have been cool if it would work with OS X, but it appears we will have wait till Apple supports it, with any luck we will know more at Macworld Expo.
