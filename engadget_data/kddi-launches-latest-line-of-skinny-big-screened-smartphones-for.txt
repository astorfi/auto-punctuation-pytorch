There's plenty of similarities; they're all Android, all waterproof and are each packing an eight megapixel camera. Kyocera's Digno is a slimline offering available in three different colors, and puts some of Kyocera's US offerings to shame looks-wise. Sharp's AQUOS IS13SH has an IPS-rivalling ASV display, whilst the NEC's Medias BR IS11 will arrive in a choice of pink, white and blue. Sadly, there's still no sign of that mythical iPhone from KDDI. Check out the links below for all the full-fat details.
