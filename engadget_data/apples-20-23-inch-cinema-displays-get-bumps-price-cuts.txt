Their 20-inch is now down to $699 from $799, their 23-inch is way down to $999 from $1,299, and their 30-inch is way, way freaking down to $1999 from $2499; likewise, the 20-inch now has a 300cd/m2 brightness, up from 250cd/m2, while the 23 and 30-inchers hit a 400cd/m2 brightness up from 270cd/m2; all have a 700:1 contrast ratio, up from 400:1. Still not quite competitive enough to best Dell's 800:1 contrast ratio / 300cd/m2 20-inch 2007WFP, their 1000:1 contrast ratio / 450cd/m2 24-inch 2407WFP, but the 3007WFP 30-inch is a at a comparable 400cd/m2 brightness and 700:1 contrast ratio -- so but they sure are trying. How you like 'dem Apples?[Via TUAW]
