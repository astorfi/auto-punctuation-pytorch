 Sprint CEO Dan Hesse spoke at NXTcomm08 today, and he let it slip that Sprint is planning on launching its first commercially-available WiMAX network in Baltimore in September, and expanding the trial service currently operating in Chicago and DC by the end of the year. We're assuming that means Clearwire and not Sprint itself, of course, but Hesse also touched on the carrier's WiMAX-based 4G strategy, saying that consumers "can't seem to get enough data" and that devices like digital cameras and GPS systems will eventually connect to WiMAX directly -- allowing Sprint to "break free of wireless cellphone group think." Sure, whatever -- but let's get that network lit up before we start counting chickens, shall we?[Via Phone Scoop]
