 Rumors were rampant last week as Warner's Blu-ray contract was set to expire and at the same time a exec from the neutral studio was quoted as saying they planned to change their HD movie strategy. The crew over at HiDefDigest went right to the source, and Warner was quick to let them know they had no plans to support either camp exclusively. While we believe this to be true, this is one of those cases when we doubt the studio would tip their hand in advanced. An announcement this big, would most certainly be followed by a PR barrage like no another, so while Blu-ray fans might be breathing a sign of relief, we're reminded of a time when the head coach of our favorite pro-team talks about how much he loves a player, the day before he's cut.
