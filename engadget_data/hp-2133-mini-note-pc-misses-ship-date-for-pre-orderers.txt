Just a week after HP's totally adorable 2133 Mini-Note PC popped online for purchase, we've received word that pre-orderers aren't going to be seeing their new machine quite as soon as originally expected. Reportedly, HP has sent out notifications to customers who pre-ordered to let them know that their lappies won't be shipping today as promised, but there's no word on how long the delay will last. Hang in there, subnote lovers -- a tracking number is bound to come soon (er, we hope).[Thanks, Brian]Update: Some commenters are claiming that their unit did in fact ship today -- just keep those fingers crossed that you get lucky.
