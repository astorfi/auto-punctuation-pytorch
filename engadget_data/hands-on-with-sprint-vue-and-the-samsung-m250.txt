One such report on SprintUsers says VUE offers a surprisingly clear, crisp picture (when reception is strong enough, that is) though we're guessing that mileage varies depending on how good the user's eyes are. The channel lineup looks solid, with CNN, MTV, Starz, and Comedy Central all on board (among others) for a trial that'll apparently last at least four months. Godspeed, Sprint, and good luck with the trial -- from the looks of it, you've got would-be customers anxiously awaiting you on the other side.
