PSP Updates forum moderatorand presumably Sony Enemy #1 Fanjita has posted a version of his eLoader software that works with 2.01 through 2.50versions of the firmware, and utilizes the same Grand Theft Auto exploit that has been previously used to load homebrewswag. So far only a handful of games and emulators have been tested with the new boot loader, but the list seems to begrowing literally by the hour. Never underestimate what a dedicated group of fanboys can pull off with enough time andRed Bull.[Thanks, Clay]
