Sony hit us hard with the HDR-FX1, their first
consumer-grade high-definition camcorder a couple of months ago, and now they're back with the HVR-Z1U, their latest
camera that's compatible with the High-Definition Video, or HDV format. Only this one is more on the professional tip,
and besides costing a lot more ($4,900 vs. $3,600), the HVR-Z1U can also record at video at 24 frames per second,
something which is supposed to give digital video more of a cinematic look, a feature that was conspicuously absent
from the HDR-FX1. Should start rocking retail beginning in February.
