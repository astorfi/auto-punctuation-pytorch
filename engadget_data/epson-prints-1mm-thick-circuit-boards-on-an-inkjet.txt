Really brings new meaning to the term "printed circuit board" when Epson goes and creates a process by which an
inkjet printer can literally spit out complicated boards. Circuit paths are drawn by conductive ink and layered between
coats of insulator ink. Naturally you shouldn't expect to be able to download and shoot out the latest nVidia or ATI
board every 1.3 days they release a new one, but this could mean really, really big things for portable electronics and
wearable computing since these boards are only 1mm thick at 20 layers (trust us, that's pretty amazing).
