 Jonathan Tsang, ASUS president of Sales and Marketing, announced a, uh, announcement this morning. On October 16th, they'll announce the prices for their anticipated low-cost, ultra-portable laptop, the Eee PC. He did, however, offer some meat with that small potato: Best Buy and Newegg will carry unspecified configurations by the end of this month with prices not to be below $199. The $199 model? Sorry, it's only available for contract purchases.
