Of course, nobody's saying exactly what Apple's response entailed, with the EU only going so far as to say that they are "carefully" studying it. The EU's prime concern here is Apple's practice of preventing users in one country from downloading music intended for another which, in some cases, results in some users paying more for music than others. No word on what'll happen next, although we somehow doubt this latest response will suddenly put the EU at ease.[Via MacNN]
