 While owners of new HD DVD gear might be miffed at Toshiba's plans to scrap their HD DVD format, investors are stoked. Toshiba's shares are up nearly 6% in mid-day Tokyo trading on unusually high volume. A clear sign from investors that it's time for Toshiba to cut its HD DVD losses and run. Now go ahead Toshiba -- investors, consumers, retailers, and the content owners all agree that it's high time to end this format war once and for all. We're all just waiting for you to make it official.[Thanks, Karl]
