Fortunately for us, today the Korean giant decided to give us mere mortals a sneak peek at said device, and it sure looks promising -- as you can see above, the bulge seems to imply that the tablet's general thickness almost matches the headphone jack's height. If true, this would put Samsung's 8.9-incher head to head with Apple's 8.8mm thick iPad 2 in a fitness contest. Bring on March 22nd!
