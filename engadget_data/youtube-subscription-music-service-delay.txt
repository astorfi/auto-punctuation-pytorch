According to AllThingsD, however, the launch has been pushed back into early next year. While YouTube has all the licenses it needs to launch a sub-based music service, it's apparently not quite satisfied with how it all works at the moment and what was once an almost certain 2013 launch has now been rescheduled to Q1, say ATD's sources. However, if or when it is ready for rollout, it'll battle not only the likes of Spotify and Rdio, but also the video service owner's very own All Access streaming service, which already sells a similar monthly-billed music offering. C'mon -- a bit of sibling rivalry never hurt anyone, right?
