Back in February, broadcast television group Discovery Communication -- known for BBC America, Travel Channel, TLC, and Discovery Channel, naturally -- filed a patent for its own digital book reader back in February that's now surfacing online. There isn't a lot of concrete detail here, other than it runs the gamut of possible distribution options, including public libraries Ã  la Sony's Daily Edition. In the picture above we've got hints of Cos News Services and US News and World Report, but that could very likely just be filler for the filing. It won't be nothing without partners, but if Discovery's serious, we're sure they've got a few phone numbers to call up and try to make a deal with.
