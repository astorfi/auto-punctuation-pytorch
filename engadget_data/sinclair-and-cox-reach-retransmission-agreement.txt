 Seems like the negotiators over at Sinclair are earning their paychecks this year, as the broadcasting group has now settled with Cox Communications on a four-year retransmission consent agreement that "includes high-definition programming." The deal covers cable systems owned by Cox spanning over 1.25 million subscribers in six markets owned by Sinclair. Notably, Sinclair stated that this agreement has allowed the firm to complete "long-term retransmission consent agreements with all major multiple system operators in its markets," but as we've seen from our Mediacom-strapped brethren, they're still watchin' the locals in SD in some areas.
