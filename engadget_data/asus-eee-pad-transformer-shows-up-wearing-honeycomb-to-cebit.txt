The Eee Pad MeMO, for instance, is now being promised with a Qualcomm port of the platform in time for its June launch -- and along those same lines, the company is showing its Eee Pad Transformer here at CeBIT with a Honeycomb upgrade. Unlike the MeMO, the Transformer is just a straight Tegra 2 setup like the already-launched Xoom, which is likely why they were able to get it loaded on here and functioning relatively well in time for the show. The build ASUS has here doesn't appear to be final -- the Android Market is missing, for example -- but what was there seemed to be running smoothly; considering the internals, we'd expect no less. Follow the break for video (pardon the lack of audio -- there was some talking going on that we found distracting).
