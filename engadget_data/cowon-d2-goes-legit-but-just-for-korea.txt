Capacities range from 1 to 4GB, the 2.5-inch LCD is of the QVGA variety, and you can upgrade the memory via SD. We can't decide if the touchscreen interface or 45 hours of battery life (in MP3 mode, 8 hours on DMB) is our favorite part, but we suppose that's why Cowon included 'em both. There's also TV-out, hefty format support, FM radio and voice recording, and Cowon manages this all in a mere 0.65-inches of thickness. Still no word on price, and we won't give up hope on a DMB-less version that might, just might, grace our shores, but it doesn't look like we'll be getting no D2 in our stockings this year, that's for sure. Keep reading to view the rest of the colors.[Via dapreview]
