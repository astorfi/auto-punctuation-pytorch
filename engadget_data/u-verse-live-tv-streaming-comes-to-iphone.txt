AT&T is ahead of schedule in bringing live U-Verse TV streaming to mobile devices: it just updated the service's iPhone app several days earlier than promised. As on the iPad, U-Verse subscribers with iPhones can now watch up to 108 live channels while at home, and as many as 25 when they're away. They also get improved remote controls, new parental tools and a fresher-looking interface. Viewers can grab the iPhone app through the App Store today. There's no surprise upgrade for Android users, however; they'll just have to wait until October 21st.
