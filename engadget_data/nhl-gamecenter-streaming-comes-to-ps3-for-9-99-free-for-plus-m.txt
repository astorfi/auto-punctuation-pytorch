 
In addition to an updated app for Boxee, the NHL just announced its GameCenter streaming app is coming to the PlayStation 3 and Roku players. Free to PlayStation Plus members ($9.99 for all others, free on Roku) gamers get access to the app with its highlights, stats and information, while subscribers to the $169 GameCenter Live service get the full package including streaming out-of-market games and some playoff matchups. It's pretty similar to the MLB app that's also available on PS3, but similarly the lack of locally blacked out games makes it more of an alternate way to catch more sports than a cord-cutters best friend. Additional details are in the press release after the break, or check for the app under the video section of the PlayStation Network store.
