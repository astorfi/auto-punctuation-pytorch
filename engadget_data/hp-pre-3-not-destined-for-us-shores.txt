HP broke the news to PCMag, explaining that the smartphone won't be hitting the States. European webOS fans will be getting a pretty sweet deal from all of this, however, with the handset running a rather affordable $75 unlocked in France and the UK. And what about Germany? HP is reporting that the Pre 3 has sold out in that country.
