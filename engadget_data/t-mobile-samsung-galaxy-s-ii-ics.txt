T-Mobile is the first to announce an official date for its flavor of last year's flagship device, with its version of the GSII rolling out on June 11th. Unfortunately, it's not an OTA refresh as we'd prefer -- you'll have to surrender yourself to the will of Kies, but at least it's going to be available. AT&T and Sprint, the move is now yours to make.  [Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
