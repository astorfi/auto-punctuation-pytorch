Now, thanks to XDA member pershoot, Viewsonic's Tegra 2 tab has a little extra spring in its step. He's managed to get it running at 1.4GHz (a 40 percent boost over stock) and, with the ability to run CyanogenMod 7, this 10.1-incher is definitely earning a reputation as something of a hacker's delight. Now it's even easier to afford, too, with Amazon knocking the price down to $280. Cheap and tweakable? Really, it doesn't get any better than that.
