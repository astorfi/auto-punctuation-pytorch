Garmin has rolled out a series of updated GPS units designed specifically for bicyclists. The Edge series includes
features to track heart rate, speed, cadence and altitude. The GPS is based on the SiRF SiRFstar III chipset, which
Garmin says should allow for more accurate and reliable tracking in urban areas. Prices range from $249 for the basic
Edge 205, which doesn't include any heart rate or speed tracking capabilities, to $349 for the Edge 305CAD, which
includes cadence and speed tracking, and a barometric altimeter.
