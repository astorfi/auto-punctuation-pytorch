 Nikon's 1 series of mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras may not be the first choice among professional photographers, but they're apparently selling like hotcakes, and they're a big hit at CES, too. Front and center in Nikon's booth, there's a pair of professional dancers practicing their craft on continuous shifts, surrounded by a ring of J3 and S1 bodies and a variety of colorful lenses. Both cameras look and feel very similar to Nikon's first model in this series, the J1.

 There's a handful of new colors available, and the internals have gotten a bit of a boost, but all in all, the cameras would feel mighty familiar to any 1 series user. The 14.2-megapixel J3 is Nikon's premium model, if you can call it that, while the 10.1-megapixel S1 is the entry-level variant, with kit prices set at $600 and $500, respectively. Both cameras are set to ship next month -- catch all the specs at our announcement post, and jump past the break for a closer look in our hands-on.
