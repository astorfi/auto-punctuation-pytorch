Previously promised to be released during 2009 and then delayed until sometime in 2010, Multichannel news now says it is actually anticipated in the spring of 2010. Which means that if it doesn't get delayed again, it will have taken just under two years since the announcement for it to hit the street. Does that sound ridiculous to anyone else?
