  Having braved the wilds of Tanzania and emerged with some brilliant photos, but a camera destroyed by a lion, the remote control BeetleCam is back at it. This time around, the buggy's got a Canon 550D, is sporting an armored shroud and it brought a buddy with some serious imaging chops to help it get up close and personal with a pride of lions in Kenya's Masai Mara. The new BeetleCam, dubbed the Mark II, has six wheels, two flashes, a Canon EOS 1Ds MK III for stunning stills and GoPro camera capable of streaming HD video. How did round two in Africa turn out? Pretty darn well, but as they say, the proof is in the pudding, so check out the amazing shots taken by the twin BeetleCams at the source below.
