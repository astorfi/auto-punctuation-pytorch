Sure, Philips' color-changing Hue light bulbs can give you calendar or weather reminders, but if you buy them for practical reasons, you're doing it wrong. To bust out their fun side, Syfy has just announced that its 12 Monkeys series, based on the cult Terry Gilliam film, will sync in time with the home WiFi lighting. The cable channel first did the Hue trick with Sharknado, an experience we found to be hit-and-miss. You'll need to install Syfy's iOS or Android app, then set it up to work with your Hue Bridge and bulbs. From there, it'll provide special effects that "enhance" the show in a way you'll either find cool or cheesy, depending on your state of mind.
