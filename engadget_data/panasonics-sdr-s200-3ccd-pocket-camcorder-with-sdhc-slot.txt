Hot on the heels of their SDHC card announcement, Panasonic brings us their SDR-S200 3CCD video camera capable of recording MPEG-2 video directly to their new 4GB SDHC cards. And that trio of 1/6-inch CCDs will shoot 3.1 megapixel stills to boot. This followup to the SDR-S100, features the same 10x optical zoom, optical image stabilization, and 2.8-inch LCD, but measures in just a touch heavier and hair bigger – still tiny though by camcorder standards. So all you're really getting is a doubling (for now) of recording capacity -- up to 3.5 hours or a scant 50 minutes if you're after the cams top quality. Still with higher capacity SDHC cards on the horizon (up to 32GB theoretically), at least the S200 won't suffer that 2GB capacity cap like the S100. Expected in Japan starting next month for about ¥100,000 or close to $882.[Via Impress]
