The 3-in-1 iPad camera connection kit (available in black or white) is a single dock connecting apparatus with a trifecta of ports: USB, SD and microSD. In order of mention, you can offload photos from your camera onto your iPad via a direct USB connection, offload photos from your SD card and offload photos from your microSD card. It's all pretty self explanatory, and at just $29.90, there's hardly a reason to even consider the official version. Hit the links below to get your order in, but don't expect it to ship until early next year.

Update: And now, we introduce to you the 5-in-1 iPad camera connection kit. This is getting out of hand.
