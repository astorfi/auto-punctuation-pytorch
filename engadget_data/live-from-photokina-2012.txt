 Germany just can't get enough of Engadget, it seems. Just two weeks after the close of IFA in Berlin, we're back in the land of Bier and Honig, for a camera-fueled journey to Cologne. This giant photography trade show is held only once every two years -- the last Photokina was way back in 2010 -- and it's arguably the industry's biggest event, drawing manufacturers the world abound to launch their latest prosumer and professional devices. We won't likely see a blockbuster product like Samsung's Galaxy Camera, but there could be another Android shooter or two in store, along with plenty of updates to last year's advanced compacts and mirrorless cams, and a modest spattering of full-frame DSLRs. We'll be bringing you all the news as it happens, so keep your eyes peeled to this very site to catch the action as it goes down.
