 The fifth season of Lost comes home on Blu-ray December 8, and for anyone still enthralled bythe question of what exactly is the truth behind that freaky island it's packing a special BD-Live extra. Viewers can log into "Lost University" where they can further explore the mysteries of the island. Fans can check out LostUniversity.com right now to register early, word is the first 108 graduates will receive a hand-signed diploma from Lost University presidents Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse -- count us out of the annual Spring Break trip, just in case.
