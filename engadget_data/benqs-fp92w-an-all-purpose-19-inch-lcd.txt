The FP92W delivers a 1440x900 WXGA+ LCD with a 5ms response, 700:1 contrast, 300cd/m2 brightness, and 160-degree top/bottom and 170-degree left/right visibility. It also features 2x DVI and D-Sub 15 inputs. Set to roll in Japan on October 16 for an estimated street price of Â¥33,000 (about $276) making this a decent, all-media panel for dorm room livin' on the cheap. [Via Impress]
