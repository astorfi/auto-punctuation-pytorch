You might actually be able to pull off some extended gaming sessions on the 11-inch screen -- it's certainly a crisp enough screen, from the time we spent with it -- but the real selling point here is plugging it up to an external monitor for your FPS / RTS / MMO needs and using it solo for productivity purposes. Of course it's a good bit heavier than other portables of the same size, but what do you expect with all it's trying to pack in?
