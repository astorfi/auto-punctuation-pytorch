The unit is capable of sucking down 2GB of data per minute and claims to be "the only storage device in the market that can decode and display true RAW images from any camera on its 3.2-inch (QVGA) color LCD screen." Furthermore, it orientates images automatically depending on how it's held, and the included data synchronization functionality enables the drive to sync information with another external HDD or your main rig. Oh, and it can understand 14 different types of memory card, so you're probably fine on that front. Check it out next month for between $339 (80GB) and $599 (500GB), depending on capacity.
