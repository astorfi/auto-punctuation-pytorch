 "If it ain't the latest, it ain't the greatest" -- a consumer war cry we're all certainly very familiar with. Not so for Dell users apparently. According to the BBC, users "swamped" Dell's feedback site with a demand for the return of the ol' XP pre-load. In response, Dell has reversed their Vista-only policy which loaded Microsoft's latest onto nearly all Dell machines destined for home use. Why the outcry? It's not exactly clear. Analysts cited XP's familiarity and its ability to work with all the peripherals people have amassed. So, if you've been holding out for a Dell with XP, now's your chance... you know, in case you somehow missed it for the last 5 years.[Thanks, Josh]
