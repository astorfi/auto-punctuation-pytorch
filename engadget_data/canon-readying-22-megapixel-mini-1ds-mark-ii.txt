 You guessed it, this here is nothing more than somewhat believable rumor mill material, but it seems that Canon just might be readying a 22-megapixel beast of a digicam that would come in "around half the size of the firm's EOS-1DS Mark II." Unsurprisingly codenamed the 1DS Mark III, this DSLR is said to have been behind a few photo shoots seen in recent editions of Vanity Fair, and Canon is reportedly "hustling to make lenses that will work with what this body can resolve," not to mention the possibility of a "new mount for an entirely new lens design." While this certainly isn't the first big-name digicam to start in depths of shadows, we purportedly won't see it surface (or not) until this fall, as the elusive 1DS Mark III won't be shown to the public before the PhotoPlus Expo in October (if it's proven real at all).[Via Image-Acquire]
