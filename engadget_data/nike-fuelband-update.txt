Worried that your first generation Nike Fuelband would be left in the cold in favor of the revamped model? The sportswear company has announced that early adopters will get a firmware upgrade that'll provide better tracking algorithms, double-tap for the time and sessions support. Of course, since the SE now comes with Bluetooth LE, you won't have total feature parity, but at least it'll save you $150 while you wait for the next one.
