Up first is the HT-BD8200 Blu-ray soundbar, which -- as the name implies -- is actually a soundbar with a Profile 2.0 Blu-ray player baked right in. The bundle also includes a wireless subwoofer and promises 5.1-like sound despite being just 2.6-inches deep. Moving on, we've got the 2.1-channel HT-BD2700 and 5.1-channel HT-BD1250 Blu-ray HTIB systems, which offer up 400- and 1,000-watts of power, respectively along with WiFi support. Per usual, dollars and ship dates remain a mystery, but the more we look at those glossy black coats, the harder we find it to be patient.
