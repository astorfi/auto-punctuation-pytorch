To be designated as either the V9m or the V9c, the 2-inch external display on this thing looks positively huge in comparison to the KRZR's stamp sized external screen, and the first side shot of the phone makes us really appreciate the trimmed design: no more hump! Phone News says that Motorola's flagship will feature internal and external touchscreens and the BREW user interface with Flash support, and that it'll launch on Verizon Wireless first. We can't attest to the accuracy of these claims, but we certainly wouldn't say no to the former two's inclusion.
