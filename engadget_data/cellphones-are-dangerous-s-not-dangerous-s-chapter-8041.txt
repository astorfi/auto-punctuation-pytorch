According to London researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research in England, a ten-year study concluded there is
no increased risk of tumor generation in use of cellphones near the ear or headâ€”but they're unsure about what their
study may find in the years ahead. Uh, that's about it. Gee, where have we heard that song and dance (or directly
contradictory evidence) about thirty or
so times before, hmm?
