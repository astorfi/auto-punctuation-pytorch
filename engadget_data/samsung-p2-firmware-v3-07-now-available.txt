 Firmware version 3.07 just went live over at Samsung's download center. This is the 2nd firmware update for Sammy's slick little P2. Word on the street has it delivering on the promises already peeped in the video preview. Just be sure that you're downloading the newest version as Sammy's site seems to have cross-linked v3.07 with the older v2.08 download. Nevertheless, between this and the PSP 3.90 M33 release, our weekend is pretty much set.DownloadAlternative download links[Via 4th Dimension Thinking, thanks Oscar M.]
