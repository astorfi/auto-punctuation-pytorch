Amazon's order page for the $400 Android 3.0 tablet appears to have gone from "in stock" to "out of stock" within mere minutes, while Target -- the supplier fulfilling orders on behalf of Amazon -- also lists the Transformer as presently unavailable. ASUS' own Where To Buy page leads us to a bunch of dead ends as well, with Best Buy being the only retailer we can currently find with stock in the US. We can't say for sure whether we're looking at overwhelming demand or just limited supply, but it's hard to argue with ASUS' excellent value proposition here: a 10-inch IPS display, a dual-core SOC and a feature-rich tablet OS all for less than four Benjamins. You'll just need to be quick on the trigger if you want one.
