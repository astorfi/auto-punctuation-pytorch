After springing for that 103-incher last year, Panasonic has made a mockery of your spendy home theater with a 150-inch display at CES, and now an upgraded version of the original 103-inch behemoth. The new TH-103PF10UK upgrades the video processing, anti-reflective coating, "wireless presentation capabilities," media card reader and adds dual HDMI, but the actual display seems to be the same as last time around. There's also a 100,000 hour warranty included, which is only fitting since we're guessing this new 103-inch won't be selling for much less than $70 grand.  [Via Crave]
