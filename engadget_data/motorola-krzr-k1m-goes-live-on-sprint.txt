Fortunately, as foretold by our friends at Phone Scoop, Sprint's K1m comes relatively hot on the heels of Verizon's. Thanks to a different UI and color scheme, the Sprint variant barely resembles its stablemates and it'll be interesting to see whether customers ultimately do a better job warming up to it. The Sprint K1m can belong to anyone willing to part with $200 and sign on the dotted line -- or, as Sprint likes to say, $399.99 minus $200 in "instant savings."[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
