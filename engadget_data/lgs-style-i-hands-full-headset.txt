Well, it's not a phone itself, just a Bluetooth device meant toemulate the experience of using a phone when your real handset stays safely in your bag / purse / pocket / wherever.Yeah, we might think a non-hands-free headset wasn't such a good idea either, but you'd be surprised how many peoplewe've heard ask for something like this. Though the "below $150" price tag (i.e. $149.99) could definitely betweaked a little, this much we know.
