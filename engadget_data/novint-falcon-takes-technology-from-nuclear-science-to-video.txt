Novint Technologies is showing off their Falcon video game controller at the
DEMO conference in Scottsdale, Arizona this week.  If you think it looks
more like a scientific instrument than a game controller, you're right.  It was originally developed by Sandia
National Laboratories to help perform complex information modeling and has since been used for applications ranging
from dental education to geological exploration.  But the folks at Novint say the force feedback device is equally
well suited to simulating a golf club swing or hunting down orcs.  It looks like it might run into problems with
some games though, seeing as it doesn't have any buttons.  Retail price should be around $100 when it goes on sale
early next year.  Only for PC initially, but the company says console versions are a possibility.
