Your Twitter feed is probably already overflowing with breaking news, sponsored ads and play-by-play reactions of the latest Game of Thrones, but a new element may soon grace your timeline: a buy button. Documents found on Fancy.com's website propose a method of selling goods directly to Twitter followers by embedding miniature product pages directly in Tweets. The images, uncovered by Re/Code, show expandable, sponsored tweets that feature a sales blurb and product image underlined by a price tag and "Buy with Fancy" button. The mockup also demonstrates that purchases and package tracking could be handled completely within Twitter's own app. 

Fancy's images call the setup 'Twitter Commerce,' but it's unclear if the documents are merely a proposal to the microblogging service or something that's actually in production. A Re/Code source, however, claims that Twitter is actively working with several companies to build a working commerce solution. We'd crack a joke about Facebook Gifts, but let's wait until we hear something official, shall we?
