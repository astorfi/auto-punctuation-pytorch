 Microsoft may be happy with the number of copies of Vista it's pushing out the door these days, but it seems that at least some recipients of the OS are finding that it puts as big a strain on their patience as it does their hardware, with numerous complaints cropping up of delays and stalls while moving, copying, or deleting files. According to The Register, Microsoft seems to be aware of the problem, and has already issued a "hotfix" for a related issue that may or may not also apply to this particular problem, although that's neither as easily accessible or as easy to apply than a proper patch. On that latter point, a Microsoft spokesman would only go so far as to tell The Reg that they'd check to see if a proper patch was in the works, though there doesn't appear to be any further word on that possibility as of yet.[Via Slashdot]
