Love sharing photos on Twitter? If you're an Android user, it just got a little easier. The microblogging service's latest app update adds a simple photo-editor that allows users to crop and rotate images without the aid of a third-party program. It also flashes a reminder to @mention friends whenever you upload pics with people in it, emulating Facebook's photo-tagging feature. Pulling down on the timeline reveals other new features: if there aren't any tweets to load, the app will show recommended tweets, trending topics and will suggest users to follow. In the US, that list also includes news, sports, TV and events updates. While these new additions to the Twitter feed are only available for Android right now, the company promises that they'll soon arrive on iOS.
