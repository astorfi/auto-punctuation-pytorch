 Hey, check out this beaut. It's the 8.9-inch version of Amazon's new Fire HD tablet. The company trotted out several of the 7-inch models, but the big daddy was a rare bird indeed -- and it's almost a shame that it shares a name with last year's model, since it feels like a completely different device. Amazon set out to make a slate that can compete with some of the top models out there, and from some passing impressions, it seems to stack up -- not least with that pixel-disguising 1920 x 1200 display and 8.8mm thickness. Of course, we're going to have to wait until we can actually spend some more time with it before passing judgement. Peep some more photos of the newer, bigger Kindle Fire in the gallery below.
