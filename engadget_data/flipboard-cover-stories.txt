In an effort to predict what you want to read, Flipboard is updating its Cover Stories to learn from your perusing habits. This section of the app learns how you navigate content and will feature articles from sections that you spend the most time reading -- rather than displaying selections in the order they're posted. Here, stories will also be sorted by source, social network and topic for quick scanning, and the mute function is still in play for the text you wish to hide. The outfit plans to integrate the functionality in other areas of the app too, like its curated magazine The Weekend. Android and iOS users can expect to see the new Cover Stories features soon, as the roll out has already begun.
