Thankfully, the firm known for astounding consumers with low-priced flat-panels will reportedly be doling out a soundbar of its own this fall. According to CNET, Vizio will be releasing a faux-surround system with a wireless subwoofer for the low, low price of $299. There's no mention of the specs just yet, but even if it just sounds slightly above average, it'll probably be worth three bills. Keep an eye out for this one to land in September (possibly at CEDIA?).
