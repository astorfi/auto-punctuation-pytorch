 Makes sense, right? By smartphone standards, the 8525 is getting a bit long in the tooth (its unbranded cousin, the TyTn, is even longer) -- so we've gotta believe AT&T has something in the pipe to grab another several hundred dollars out of owners' wallets (or purses, or money clips, or however it is folks stow cash money these days). Known internally to HTC as the Kaiser, the supposed 8925 is a dream come true for lovers of the Windows Mobile slide-out QWERTY form factor thanks to its nifty flip-up display, spring loaded slide, HSUPA support (though it could be a while before AT&T subscribers get a crack at it), and out-of-the-box Windows Mobile 6. If this is legit, look for it to allegedly go down some time in August.[Via Boy Genius Report]
