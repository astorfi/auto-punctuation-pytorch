So, the Xbox 360's been available for, what, 15
minutes, and already the crash reports are streaming in. According to postings on Xbox-Scene and other fan sites, some
early adopters are discovering that waiting on line in the cold for two years to snag a box was the least of their
problems: the game consoles are allegedly crashing during a variety of games and reporting a range of error messages.
There's even a pic up on flickr that purports to show the 360 crashing as the Microsoft logo loads. Sure, it's too
early to declare this a pandemic and start hurling Xboxes out of windows, but it still has us wondering: How's your 360
holding up?


P.S. And yes, our Xbox has crashed a bit too â€” though nothing too terrible.
