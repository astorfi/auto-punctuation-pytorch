 During its quarterly earnings call, Sirius finally gave the world some info about its upcoming Sirius XM Satellite 2.0 service. For those of you who can't get enough Underground Garage and Howard Stern, version 2.0 will pack more programing and you'll be able to pause and rewind broadcasts. Starting next year, the company will offer personalized music stations, similar to Pandora, and on-demand listening, in case you missed a particularly juvenile funny Opie & Anthony bit. The first two pieces of hardware will be landing before the end of the year, but don't expect to find a Sirius XM 2.0 option at your car dealership for a while -- vehicles won't be getting the upgraded hardware until 2013.
