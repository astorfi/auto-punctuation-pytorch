       In another blow to Blu-ray, Sony Pictures announced that they have delayed their second wave of Blu-ray titles including S.W.A.T. and The Terminator, which were originally supposed to be released on June 27th and will now be released on July 27th. This delay corresponds with the hardware and other titles delays already announced. We don't know about anyone else, but we can't wait till they get this party started.
