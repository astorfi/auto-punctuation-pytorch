 While most folks can impress their friends simply by running a few lines of code that instantly turns their Wiimote into a make-believe light saber or drum machine, when you work for a place called US Mechatronics, you're pretty much required to raise the stakes a bit. Heeding that call, a pair of employees at the company decided to take the (relatively) harmless remote into dangerous new territory, putting in some extra time at the "office" to turn the humble Wiimote into a real-time interface for an over-sized robotic arm. After engaging in a quick game of tennis, the pair decided to up the arm's destructive power considerably and outfit it with a sword, which they thankfully caught on video (check it out after the break). Impressive stuff to be sure, although we have to admit that we're a little frightened to think of the possibilities once they finish the robot.[Via Hack a Day]
