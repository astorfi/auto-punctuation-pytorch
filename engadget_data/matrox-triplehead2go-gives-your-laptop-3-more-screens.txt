Like Matrox's earlier DualHead2Go,the device connects to your computer's VGA port and tricks the PC into believing that the three 19-inch displays nowgracing your desk are actually one mammoth 3840x1024 display (and, yes, you can still use your laptop display, givingyou a total of four screens). The TripleHead will be available in April for $299, which seems like a small price to payto get behind three screens. Of course, that price doesn't include the actual displays themselves -- or the bigger deskyou'll need to buy to hold them.
