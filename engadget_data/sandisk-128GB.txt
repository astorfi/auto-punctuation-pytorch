SanDisk just took the wraps off of its new 128GB Ultra microSD card. On sale today for your favorite microSDXC-enabled phone or tablet, the card offers twice the storage of current cards, making it the largest-capacity microSD card on the market. Doubling up the storage space wasn't easy, in fact SanDisk used custom manufacturing to stack 16 memory dies -- each thinner than a human hair -- within each card. It's an impressive engineering feat, but let's be honest, we really only care because it will let us store 24 hours of those HD cat videos that help us make it through the day.
