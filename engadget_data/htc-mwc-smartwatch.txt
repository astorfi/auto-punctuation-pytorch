Remember when HTC's Cher Wang said that her company solved the smartwatch battery life conundrum? Rumor has it the answer was Mirasol. According to Bloomberg sources, the company is preparing to share its smartwatch prototype with carriers at Mobile World Congress next week, a wearable that's said to be based on Qualcomm's Toq. If the would-be watch matches that model blow for blow, it'll have a Mirasol touchscreen, wireless charging capabilities and the ability to handle calls, music, calendar data and limited text messaging (read only) directly from the device. Bloomberg's leaker also said that the firm is also working on a second watch that leverages the power of Google Now as well as an "electronic bracelet that plays music." Variety may be the spice of a good product portfolio, but we'll admit, we're not sure what to make of that last item.
