Here's the takeaway: when Kafka asked him the chance of "getting on Nintendo," Hastings replied, "our chances are excellent." It's not much, but after at least a year of hints and teasers, it's by far the best confirmation we've got. Of course, he didn't say which system, but let's be honest... the only logical choice is DS, right?
