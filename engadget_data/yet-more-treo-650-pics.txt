We're almost stifling a yawn this time around, but yet more "leaked" pics have turned up of the
Treo 650. Not that we aren't patiently waiting for its
release or anything, it's just that this is getting to be sort of a tease and we want the damn thing to finally come
out so we can buy it and experience a week or two of complete gadget-fulfillment before we start hearing all the rumors
about the Treo 700 and how it's gonna put the Treo 650 to shame.
