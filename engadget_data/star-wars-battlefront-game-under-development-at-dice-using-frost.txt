At its pre-E3 event today, EA confirmed the Star Wars Battlefront franchise will return. The game is currently being developed by DICE and will use the same Frostbite engine that powers the Battlefield games. EA snagged the exclusive rights to develop Star Wars games after the end of game development at LucasArts, and this is a blend of IP and developer that certainly makes sense. A brief teaser trailer appeared to show off a battle on Hoth, we'll find out more details as they become available. Take a look at the trailer embedded after the break.
