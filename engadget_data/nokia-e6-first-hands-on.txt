The E6 is extremely compact, stainless steel accounts for its back cover and camera bezel, but weight is feathery and general feel in the hand is terrific. You're limited to a 2.46-inch screen, but Nokia's otherwise standard resolution of 640 x 480 looks pretty awesome when squeezed into such dimensions. Check out the gallery of pics below and we'll have video for you soon as well!

Update: Video hands-on can now be found after the break. Let's start off with the headline spec, that 326dpi pixel density. In practical use, it's not resoundingly noticeable, as the UI icons are resized accordingly, but where we expect to really see the benefits of it will be in web browsing, where you'll be able to fit oodles of content on your screen without losing detail. It's not AMOLED like the rest of Nokia's current line, but it's a very high quality LCD, not much of a loss to our eyes. We're still very much liking the size and curvature of the E6, although we noted a touch of UI lag with it as we did with the X7. Symbian, in spite of the update, is still not perfected. That said, you're getting a massive 1500mAh battery, which will be used sparingly by the smaller display and 680MHz CPU. Up to nine hours of video playback are promised, while 720p recording is also available for those keen on making the most of the 8 megapixel camera on the back. Construction is solid, the keyboard feels as good as what you'll be used to on the E72, but the OS still fails to convince. Good thing, then, that Nokia plans to keep updating the software as we move forward.
