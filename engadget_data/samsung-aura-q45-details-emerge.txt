The 12.1-inch little monster, which we first spotted in concept form at CeBIT, sports a 1.8GHz Intel T7100 Core 2 Duo on an 800MHz bus with a 128MB NVIDIA Geforce Go 8400M powering a 1,280 x 800 screen. No word on that oh-so-hot integrated HSDPA / WiBRO modem or the built-in DMB tuner on Sammy's CeBIT concept, but the 1.3 megapixel webcam and the multiformat memory card reader seem to have made the cut. The Q45 is expected to drop in Europe "shortly" for â‚¬1,159 ($1,578) -- not bad, not bad at all.[Via Electronista]
