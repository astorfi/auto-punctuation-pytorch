 It's no secret that Google has an interest in the automotive industry, but over the years the popular search giant has also managed to amass quite the collection of aircraft. So many, in fact, that the company is in the process of inking an $82 million construction deal that would bring its fleet to San Jose International Airport. Pending city council approval, the privately funded facility would generate an annual $2.6 million in rent and around $400,000 in fuel revenues, while also creating some 236 jobs. If agreed upon, the 29-acre Googleport will take up to two years to build and will include an executive terminal along with hangars to house the company's fleet. Google currently parks its jets at Moffett Federal Airfield, where the company has offered to renovate NASA Ames' Hangar One in exchange for two-thirds of its facility space. There's no word if either deal will affect the other, but as it stands San Jose's city council is expected to vote on its proposal sometime in April.
 Update: Initially, we incorrectly reported that Google owns a fleet or 747 aircraft. We have corrected the error.
