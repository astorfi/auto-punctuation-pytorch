The Taiwanese firm announced today it'll purchase S3 Graphics and its patent portfolio from VIA for a cool $300 million, giving the smartphone maker 265 new weapons in its IP arsenal. Also part of the deal is a perpetual license to the patents' former owner, so that the chipset manufacturer can keep cranking out silicon without fear of legal reprisal. Given HTC's competitors recently went on a giant patent shopping spree, we'd surmise that strengthening its warchest is, dare we say, quietly brilliant.
