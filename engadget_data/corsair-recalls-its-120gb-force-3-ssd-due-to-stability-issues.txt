If you're one of them you need to know that this particular drive is subject to a recall due to "stability issues". Sweclockers has reported rumors that other SSDs might also be affected, but the manufacturers in question have swiftly denied it -- so it is only this very specific Corsair drive that is being recalled. Backup your data and hit the source link for further instructions. Don't get mad, get a replacement.
