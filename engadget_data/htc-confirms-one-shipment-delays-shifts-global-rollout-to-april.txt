 If you've been hearing whispers across the net that HTC's newest flagship, the One, has been beset by delays, consider those rumors confirmed. A company rep has corroborated those reports, stating that all global shipments, save for those from O2 in Germany, have been pushed back until an unspecified time in April. Fortunately, there is a slight silver lining, as those wise enough to have pre-ordered the One should start to see their units arrive by the end of this month -- though it's not a guarantee. As for the cause of this setback, no specific reason was given, but it's likely HTC's dealing with some manufacturing issues. We'll update you should we hear more on the official cause soon. For now, you can find HTC's official statement after the break.



  "We will start fulfilling pre-orders by end March in certain markets and will roll out to more markets as we approach April."
