Last year the Pre stole the spotlight, while this year we were more focused on technologies and concepts like 3D, tablets and e-books. That said, there sure was plenty of it, and we've sifted through some of our favorites to present you with a highlight reel -- just in case your carpal tunnel or general lack of motivation prevents you from clicking through all 631+ posts we did last week.
