That's the best clue we've got about the stuff Sony Ericsson plans on showing next Monday, when it'll be holding a webcast at 11:00AM GMT+1 to "see how the way you listen to music changes forever." Given that PlayNow Plus is still a big up-and-coming push for the company, the announcement could be entirely software and service related -- but we know we've got some Android goods in the pipe that need to get shown at some point, and let's be honest, there's always room for another miscellaneous Walkman-branded phone or two in the lineup. We''ll know what's what soon enough.  [Via Mobile Phone Helpdesk]
