   Shortly after Huawei's Ascend D1 made a trip to the studio for some glamour shots, an incognito slate is following suit. A set of photos from Russian site hi-tech@mail reveals what could be in store from the Chinese outfit at MWC 2012 (you know we'll be there), though the lack of full-body pics makes us question whether it's in fact the 10-inch tab it claims to be. Aside from the questionable size, we do see a tour around its purported metal casing, which is very reminiscent of that T-Mobile-bound MediaPad we showed you last year. Allegedly, the tablet will come sporting an 8-megapixel rear shooter, Ice Cream Sandwich and will be priced at about 20,000 Russian Rubles (or around $670). Those of you feeling intrigued can hit up the source link below to catch the rest of the sneaky shots.
