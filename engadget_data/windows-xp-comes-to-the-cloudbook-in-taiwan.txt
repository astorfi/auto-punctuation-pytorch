The Cloudbook SC1200T is basically the same as the regular-spec Cloudbook, only with 1GB of RAM and limited availability -- that "T" stands for "Taiwan-only." No word on if Everex is planning on bringing this bad boy Stateside, but really, it's not like we're hurting for ways to run XP on an underpowered VIA C7M, you know?[Via Liliputing]
