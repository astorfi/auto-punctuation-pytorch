       Scoot over, Orlando -- it seems your 15 minutes are up. According to an internal memo, West Palm Beach, Florida residents that are subscribed to DISH Network should receive a trio of HD locals today. As of March 27th, customers in the region will find ABC (WPFB channel 25) on slot 5180, FOX (WFLX channel 29) on slot 5183 and NBC (WPTV channel 5) on slot 5182. Regrettably, CBS is singled out here as the lone channel from the Big 4 not included just yet, but we're keeping our fingers crossed that it shows up before March Madness is completely over.[Thanks, HDjunkee]
