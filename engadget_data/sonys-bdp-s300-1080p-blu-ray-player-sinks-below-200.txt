On sale at Amazon "while supplies last," the deck combines a name you've heard of with a price point you can probably stomach, and moreover, we're hoping this is just the beginning of an industry-wide effort to lower the barrier to entry for BD. Scoop it on up if this is the moment you've been waiting (and waiting) for.[Thanks, Tyba]
