 Just in case you had any doubts regarding Hitachi's vision to move up a few spots in the plasma market share ranks, here's a tad more proof. Apparently, the firm has been "lowering procurement costs and increasing the product lineup of bigger TVs," and it's looking to satisfy the growing overseas desire for larger sets in the PDP arena. Currently sitting in the five spot amongst worldwide plasma producers, the company is looking to raise its global market share from 9-percent to 13-percent over the next year by moving some 1.4-million PDP sets. Of course, Hitachi didn't fail to mention just how critical North American sales would remain, but we still maintain that it'll have a tough time fighting off the brutal competition brought on by the increasingly inexpensive LCD.[Via About-Electronics]
