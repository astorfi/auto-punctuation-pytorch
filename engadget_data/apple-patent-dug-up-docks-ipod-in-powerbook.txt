You know how much we love patent
applications—especially Apple's patent applications, since they love to stonewall everyone on their plans. Which is
why we're totally giggling to ourselves at their latest to surface, which proposes
iPod integration directly into a laptop. Granted,
this patent application also proposes iPod
docking into just about every device imaginable, including images of the device docked in a regular dock, speaker
dock, wall mount, and so on. And yes, they specifically outline that the "[media player's] user interface may be the
primary user interface of the notebook… for example, the touch pad of the media player shown… may be used to perform
actions on the notebook computer." Take it for what it is though, people—something that not gonna happen by Apple's
hand (at least not anytime soon).


 It's also worth noting that a huge portion of the patent covers a "wireless media player system that includes a hand
held media player capable of transmitting information over a wireless connection and one or more media devices capable
of receiving information over the wireless connection," which could imply anything from PAN networks, WiFi devices,
cellular data, to FM transmitters—so don't be too surprised to see Apple as the eventual sole patent owner of all
wireless music and media transmissions.
