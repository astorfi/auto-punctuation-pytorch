 Intel has announced that it is to acquire Havok, a company that specializes in providing physics algorithms for a lot of big name games, amongst other digital content. The gadget link here isn't totally clear right now, but we're certain that the Ageia guys will be feeling rather antsy at the news: it ain't no coincidence that Havok CEO David O'Meara mentioned Intel's scale in the company's official press release. Intel's big, baby.[Thanks, Yubal]
