  Looking to accessorize your fresh HTC look? Then how about the Media Link HD wireless dongle for starters? It'll mirror the display from your One X or One S on any HDMI-equipped TV. We're told it'll be as simple as plugging the adapter into a free HDMI input and then performing a three-finger swipe on your phone. We're not yet sure of the price, but expect to see the add-on in stores from mid-April when the new One family becomes available.
