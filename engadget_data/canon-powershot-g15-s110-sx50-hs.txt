 Canon already outed a pair of superzoom cameras prior to Photokina 2012, but it turns out the company wasn't done adding to its PowerShot family. First, we have the PowerShot G15, which has a 28 - 140mm wide angle f/1.8 - f/2.8 lens, 12.1 megapixel sensor and Canon's DIGIC 5 image processor. Its sensor has a max 12,800 ISO, shoots RAW stills and records 1080p video, and you can view your subjects using the optical viewfinder or the 3-inch, 922,000 dot LCD on the back. It replaces the G12 in Canon's lineup when it goes on sale for $500 this October.

 The PowerShot S110 replaces the S100, and like that camera, it's got a 12.1-megapixel sensor, max 12,800 ISO and an f/2.0 lens. Unlike its predecessor, however, its got a 3-inch, 461,000 dot capacitive touchscreen on the back and ditched GPS in favor of WiFi. That wireless capability lets the S110 pull GPS data for geotagging from Android or iOS devices using Canon's CameraWindow app and share photos and videos on the web. It does RAW shooting, has a 10fps burst mode and records 1080p 24fps video as well. It'll come in both black and white versions that run $450 when it goes on sale next month.

 Lastly, there's the PowerShot SX50 HS superzoom camera. It packs a 24-1200mm, f/3.4 - f/6.5 lens and optical image stabilization to ensure clear shots even when using the camera's full 50x zoom capability. Like the SX40 HS is replaces, it has a hotshoe and a 12.1-megapixel sensor. It has a max 6,400 ISO and like its new PowerShot mates, it has a 10fps burst mode, shoots RAW photos and 1080p video. The SX50 HS can be had in October for $480.
