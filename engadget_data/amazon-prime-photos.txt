If speedy delivery, a subscription music and video service wasn't good enough, Amazon is now throwing another sweetener in to convince you to sign up to Prime. The retailer has announced that it'll offer Prime subscribers unlimited photo storage in the company's cloud drive. According to the release, users will be able to upload their collections in full resolution to ensure that their image is always protected. As well as the company's own smartphone and tablets, the service will work on iOS and Android devices, and the snaps can be accessed with a variety of hardware including the Fire TV, Stick, PS3, PS4 and, presumably, any device that can already access the company's other online attractions.
