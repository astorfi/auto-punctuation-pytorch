They actually compare quite well in person, even though the Arc actually has the same 854 x 480 resolution as the Droid X -- you can definitely see some pixels up close, but since the panel is a hair smaller than the X at 4.2 inches, the pixel density is a little tighter. The real noise behind the Reality Display is Arc's Bravia Engine, which Sony claims will enhance colors and detail just like on Bravia TVs, but we didn't get to play with it too much beyond finding the option in settings to turn it off. We'll obviously be diving deep on that once we score a review unit, but for now check a macro shot and a Droid X comparison after the break.
