Google's white space wireless database got the FCC green light for commercial use this summer, and Mountain View is now moving forward with an API to make exploring and utilizing available spectrum easier. Developers and businesses can set up commercial accounts and register their equipment with Google's database in order to operate on available TV white space. One company, Adaptrum, is already certified to use the database -- in cooperation with its own equipment -- to provide public WiFi to the West Virginia University campus. The hope is to encourage more collaborations between device manufacturers and the spectrum database to, say, bring more broadband access to rural areas.
