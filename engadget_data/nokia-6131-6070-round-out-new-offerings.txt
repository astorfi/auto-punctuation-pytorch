 They may not have the WiFicapabilities of the 6136, but the other phones Nokia's rolling out at 3GSM are none to shabby. Both the 6131 (pictured)and 6070 are GSM phones with EDGE and FM radios, and the clamshell 6131 includes Bluetooth and a microSD expansion slot.The 6070 is a basic candybar phone with a VGA camera. Both phones will be out in the second quarter.
