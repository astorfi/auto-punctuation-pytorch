In a blog post entitled "Apologies" -- which, amusingly enough, is published just after "We Blew It" -- the King of the Red Envelope says, "we are looking at adding a streaming-only option for the USA over the coming months." No prices are discussed, but our educated guess would place it parallel to Canada's streaming-only plan, $7.99 monthly. Would we be willing to drop all physical media in exchange for at least one extra dollar per month? Now that's a good question.
