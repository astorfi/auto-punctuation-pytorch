 Remember last month when Dell announced an all-in-one, Ultrabook and dockable 10-inch tablet, all aimed at enterprise users? Well, they've finally gotten some proper prices, and are now up for sale on Dell's site. Starting with the Latitude 10 Windows 8 tablet, it starts at $650 -- about right for a 10-inch, Atom-powered slate with an IPS display and 1,366 x 768 resolution. Other specs include two gigs of RAM, up to 128GB of eMMC NAND storage and, most notably, a swappable 60Wh battery. On the tablet itself, you've got a USB 2.0 port, a micro-USB socket for charging, mini-HDMI, a headphone port, micro-SIM slot and a full-size SD reader. The dock adds four USB 2.0 connections, along with Ethernet, HDMI and audio output.

 Moving on, the Latitude 6430u Ultrabook has a 14-inch matte display with 1,366 x 768 resolution. As it happens, it's one of those 14-inch displays crammed into a 13-inch chassis, so the bezels should be pretty narrow. Configuration options include your usual array of Core i3, i5 and i7 processors (vPro optional), with up to 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of solid-state storage. Prices start at $900. Lastly, in case you missed it last month, the OptiPlex 9010 is a 23-inch all-in-one desktop with 1080p resolution and vPro-equipped processors. Design-wise, it's identical to a model Dell announced earlier this year, only now it runs Windows 8, not 7. That starts at $1,200.
