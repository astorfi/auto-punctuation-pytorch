 Nokia Drive+ is still in beta but, starting today, more people can take part in the navigational fun. The app has been freed from its Lumia exclusive bonds and is now available in the US, Canada and the UK on any Windows Phone 8 device. The download is free, but it's important to keep in mind that this is still a beta product -- so we can't make any guarantees about stability or compatibility. Still, the turn-by-turn navigation and offline maps are likely a huge improvement over whatever carrier-branded substitute you've been saddled with until now. Hit up the source for a few more details and to dig up a download link.
