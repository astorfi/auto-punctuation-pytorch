Samsung's pushed Monday's New York press event back a day due to that little east coast storm you may have read something about. Fortunately, these handsets haven't exactly kept a low profile, so we weren't expecting too many surprises anyway. We'll be there covering it live, but in the meantime, stay safe and if you're a Verizon customer, you might want to find a dry place to continue your seething.
