The hotly anticipated Micro Four Thirds shooter is indeed getting priced at $1,499.95 when it lands in the US in "early June," and that MSRP will include the LUMIX G VARIO 14-140mm/F4.0-5.8 ASPH/MEGA O.I.S. lens. Speaking of the lens, it'll boast a silent motor and continuous auto focusing (AF) capability for HD video, a feature that's sorely (sorely!) lacking from video-capable DSLRs. The cam will ship only in black and will capture video in AVCHD 1080p/24p (or 720p/60p) form, and Panny also tells us that users can adjust shutter speed and control aperture during motion recording. Can you say: "want?"
