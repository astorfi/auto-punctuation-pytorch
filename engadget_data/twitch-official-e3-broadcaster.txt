If you aren't among the lucky few attending the Electronics Entertainment Expo each June, Twitch wants to take a bit of the sting out of that. 2014 is the start of a three year deal with the ESA making it the official streaming partner for the tradeshow. According to Twitch, this means its broadcasts will be integrated into every facet of the show, and it's bringing news, original interviews and behind-the-scenes programming from the LA Convention Center directly to your Xbox 360, Xbox One or computer (unfortunately, there's still no Twitch viewing ability on PS4). It's also likely that you'll be able to catch all of the major press conferences this way too, similar to last year. Of course we'll be on the ground with liveblogs, breaking news and and hands-on coverage making the remote experience just as informative and much easier on your feet, however it gets to you.
