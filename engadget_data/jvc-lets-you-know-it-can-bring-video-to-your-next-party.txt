If it's good enough for pros, it will do just fine in high-end home settings. Send in video to any of the four HDMI 1.3 inputs and out pops a 1080p-24/25/50/60 signal. The THX-approved magic inside the box will also allow you to remap the color space of the input signal with 14-bit accuracy. Dedicated scalers are definitely in the upper-crust of the market, but getting this kind of functionality for $3695 would have been unimaginable even just a short while ago. Keep the prices coming down, and we'll keep our dreams alive![Via WidescreenReview]
