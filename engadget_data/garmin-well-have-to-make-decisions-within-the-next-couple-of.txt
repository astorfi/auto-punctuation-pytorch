Indeed, it wasn't long ago that the company went public with the fact that Garmin-Asus' financials weren't where they needed to be, but things are getting a little more serious now: CFO Kevin Rauckman has mentioned in an interview that they'll need to decide "within the next couple of quarters whether [they] continue to invest or whether [they] pull back." Of course, "pull back" is probably code for "cut and run," since there's really no good way to half-ass your smartphone presence and still earn customer loyalty and turn a profit. Looking at Garmin's bigger picture, it still doesn't really need to make smartphones to survive -- the PND market remains healthy, and the company has a huge presence in the marine and aviation industries -- but we're sure they'd like a piece of the cellular pie. Touch nut to crack, isn't it, guys?
