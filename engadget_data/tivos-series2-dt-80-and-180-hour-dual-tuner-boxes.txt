 
Remember the dual tuner TiVos weheard about a few weeks back? Well, surprise, surprise, they're real and are more or less exactly as called. The two models feature asingle cable / RF in jack with internal splitter, which allows you to record two analog programs simultaneously, or oneanalog and one tuned from your digital cable box. Beside the fact that now your TiVo now has dual tuners, it (freaking finally) has integratedEthernet; starting May 1st you can expect to pony up $199.99 for the 180-hour TCD649180, or $99.99 for the 80-hourTCD649080, both after $150 rebate and service activation. Baby steps to the Series3, patience people.
