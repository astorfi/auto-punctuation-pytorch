 
We know you're all partyin' up a storm at the Adobe MAX conference, but just in case one of you missed it, RIM's announced the availability of the Adobe AIR SDK for BlackBerry Tablet OS -- not to mention a little something called the BlackBerry PlayBook Simulator. Needless to say (but we'll say it anyways), we're more than anxious to get our hands on the latter. Unfortunately, it requires Adobe AIR 2.5 to run, while the latest release RIM's site is offering is 2.0.2. Buzzkill, right? That said, we suggest you keep an eye on the source link if you're looking to get in on the action yourself. Otherwise, if you're not willing to go all the way, we have some fine PR explaining matters after the break.

Update: The source link has an active AIR 2.5 toolkit link. Huzzah!
