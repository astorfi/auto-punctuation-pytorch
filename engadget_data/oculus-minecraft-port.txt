Earlier this year when the Facebook purchase of Oculus VR went down, there were more than a few detractors but none as prominent as the man behind Minecraft. At the time, Markus "Notch" Persson said that his company Mojang was in talks to bring the blocky construction set to Oculus Rift, but cancelled the deal because Zuckerberg's social network creeped him out. That's all changed now. Notch recently tweeted that he's officially over being peeved about the transaction, and was now more upset about a hole in one of his favorite socks (yes, really). That musing didn't go unnoticed by Oculus. Specifically, the outfit's chief technology officer and all-around game-industry legend John Carmack, who offered:



"Say the word, ship the source and I'll make sure it runs well on you-know-what..."




Yep, that's right: one of gaming's most prominent programmers has formally offered to help port Minecraft to VR. Oculus courting one of the, if not the, biggest indie developers and his absurdly successful games makes a lot of sense. Minecraft is infinitely more recognizable to a mainstream audience than something along the lines of, say, EVE: Valkyrie is, and this sort of deal might land Notch enough money to buy another Aphex Twin record -- everyone wins.
