Preliminary intel's a bit slim, but we know the device will be both EV-DO for the states and GSM for across the pond -- and get this, there's even a possibility of HSDPA data to boot. Other than that, the feature set appears to be status quo for the i760's world-traveling sib, but we'll pass along more details as we get 'em.
