 If you needed a reason to switch to any of AT&T's TV services, this could be it. Simply by signing up for Dish Network or DirecTV, or their U-Verse system, through AT&T, they will give you one year of HD service for free. That's it. Keep in mind though that you would be fueling a gigantic monoply but if it will save you some cash, go for it. You have up to May 31, '07 to sign up the Dish Network's offer, June 26, 2007 for DirecTV's and June 30th for the U-Verse deal.
