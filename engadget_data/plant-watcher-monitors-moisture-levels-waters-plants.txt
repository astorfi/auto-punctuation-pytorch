Kristofer Vahlstrom's Plant Watcher simply senses when your foliage needs more moisture and waters your plants
accordingly from a built-in container (which looks a bit like an IV bag from here). Collectively personally responsible
for hundreds of plants, our MO to date was hiring ever-more interns to mind the Engadget greenhouse; looks like we can
finally automate the whole process and send those lazy students back to Lincoln Tech where they belong.
