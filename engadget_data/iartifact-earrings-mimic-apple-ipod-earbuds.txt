The iArtifact iPod earbud earrings look to be made from sterling silver, sport the tell-tale dimples across the top, and on top of all that, they're wireless. All jesting aside, these completely non-musical body adornments should light up the eyes of your favorite lady, and while these haven't gone commercial just yet (probably some papers left to sign regarding that whole Made for iPod agenda), we could definitely see these things selling like hotcakes in Apple stores worldwide.
