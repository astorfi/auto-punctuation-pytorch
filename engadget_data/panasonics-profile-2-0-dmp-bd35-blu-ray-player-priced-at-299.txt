Just a day after we realized that Panasonic's DivX-lovin' DMP-BD55 would be hitting the streets at $399, in comes confirmation that its little brother -- the DMP-BD35 -- will be offered for a full Benjamin less. Yep, that means you're looking at a UniPhier-equipped Profile 2.0 Blu-ray deck that's launching at under $300. We're still not told how soon it'll be in stock, but $299.95 for a BD-Live-capable standalone player is something worth paying attention to. Now, how's about we dip down even lower for Black Friday?[Via Big Picture Big Sound]
