We revisited a few products we had flings with at CES, were introduced to some new panels, and taken through the ins-and-outs of the company's fresh Cloud TV interface. Was there anything to get excited about? Head past the break for the full tour.



 2013 LED HDTV lineup 
 Not everyone wants or needs monolithic displays and internet services, which is where Toshiba's 1 and 2 series come into play. As you would imagine, the 1 series is the most basic of the range, with full HD (1,920 x 1,080) panels ranging from 19 to 40 inches. There are a few configuration options which chop and change features, such as D1, which denotes a built-in DVD player, and L1, which signifies USB support and picture / music / video capabilities. Moving up to the 39- and 50-inch 2 series grants you MHL support, but no other bells and whistles. Prices for these entry level sets start at below £200 (around $300) for the 1 series, which are available now, and go up to £600 (approx. $900) for the biggest 2 series TV. There's no word on when the 2 series will hit stores, but they're expected "shortly."

 Toshiba's common 2013 design features and Cloud TV functionality (more on that later) starts with the L4 and W4 series, spreading up through the 6, 7 and UHDTV 9 series displays. Surprisingly, the 32-inch W4 is only 720p-ready, but has on-board WiFi, WiDi and USB storage program recording. However, the L4 series steps back up to 1080p, and will be available in three sizes up to 50 inches. We didn't see any of the 6 series at CES, which'll come in 32- and 40-inch options with all of the aforementioned features and "super slim design." Also boasting a skinny profile are the 40-, 50- and 58-inch 7 series HDTVs, with active-shutter 3D and 2D-to-3D conversion joining the spec list for these models. All of Cloud TV-equipped flatscreens will go on sale in May starting at £330 (circa $500) for the W4 and up to £1200 (around $1815) for the 58-inch 7 series.

 A quick note on the shared aesthetics of the 4 series and above. Their rounded edges and slim bezels are intended for the "modern" living space, but what we liked most were the bases, which are clearly intended to be as discreet as possible. The bezels aren't that slim, but probably won't put you off picking up any of the TVs if the features take your fancy. They are either all black, or a mixture of black and silver plastic, and don't look or feel particularly "premium." That being said, you wouldn't consider them offensive or cheap-looking.
