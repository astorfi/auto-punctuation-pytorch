When
we mentioned a couple of weeks ago that a judge had
determined that police had the right to plant GPS units on suspects' cars without their knowledge, one thing many of
you asked was how they could do that. Wouldn't the suspect see an antenna somewhere? Well, here's one answer (though we
don't think this specific bug has been used by law enforcement agencies yet). U.K.-based security and defense company
QinetiQ has unveiled what they say is the world's smallest GPS tracking device. The unit, developed with Global Point
Technologies, Durham University and the Centre of Excellence for Nanotechnology, Micro and Photonic Systems, does not
require an external antenna, and is being marketed specifically as a theft-prevention device that can be "fitted to any
moveable asset such as vehicles, containers, pallets or packages." At least it's not small enough to be implanted,
unlike some RFID chips.
