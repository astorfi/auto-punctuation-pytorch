Not a YouTube partner? That's okay -- Google's streaming video outfit is letting you access some of its premium features anyway. In a recent blog post, the company announced that it will be lowering the subscriber threshold for live streaming to 100, down from 1,000 in May. The feature should be available to all channels in good standing sometime in the next few weeks, provided users hop into their Account Features page and click on the "enable" button. The blog also reminds users that they can maximize their channel's exposure by uploading custom video thumbnails, compiling videos into playlists and by linking out to associated websites via YouTube annotations. More features for the little guy? We can get behind that.
