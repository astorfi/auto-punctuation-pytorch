Now that Twitter Music has been revealed there will be more anticipation of potential TV integration, and it appears BBC America will be among the first to participate. The network, which is owned both by BBC Worldwide (the Beeb's commercial arm) and Discovery Communications, sent out a tweet saying it's signed up to "offer 1st in-Tweet branded video synced to entertainment TV series." Its Tumblr page promises details to come, however so far there have been no further updates. We were told by the network that the deal has "literally just been signed", and to expect more info in the coming weeks. This sounds similar to deals with Viacom and NBC that were rumored a few days ago, but what shape this may all take by the time it arrives remains to be seen.
