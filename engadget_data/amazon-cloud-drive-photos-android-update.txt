 Despite being a little too busy scooping up companies and striking new streaming deals, Amazon hasn't exactly been overlooking its set of mobile and desktop applications. Most recently, the online retail behemoth announced a refresh was on hand for Cloud Drive Photos on Android, providing users of said app with an auto-save option that, as you likely guessed, allows pics to be automatically uploaded to ones cloud account -- this, according to Amazon, was "the most requested feature from our customers." Better yet, version 1.2 also brings camera integration to devices running Android 4.0.4 or later, which will make it easier for some folks to quickly snap a shot and save it to the cloud-based drive without too much effort. Other tidbits like multiple file downloads and uploads made it to this release as well, making for a pretty plentiful update overall -- links to download from Google Play or Amazon's own app store can be found down below.
