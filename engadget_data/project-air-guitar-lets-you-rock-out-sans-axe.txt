Sure, that whole Minority Report-style gesture-based input technology has a ton of potentially useful applications,
but a partnership between groups in Finland and Italy know that what we all really want from this nascent tech is a way
to play virtual air guitar. Started as part of the EU-funded ALMA project, Project: Air Guitar uses a video cam to
capture Slashes-in-training as they rock out wearing brightly-colored gloves, and translates their movements into
audible music using proprietary software. The air guitar app recognizes a user sliding his/her hand up and down the
virtual guitar neck, performing "hammer-ons" and "blues bends," and is compatible with a floor pedal that adjusts
chords. The team is currently working on a method of duplicating the experience for people at home, presumably using PC
webcams along with the prototype software and neon gloves. If they are able to commercialize this product, along with
the usual off-key crooning, we may soon witness people flailing their limbs like idiots at our favorite karaoke
bars.
