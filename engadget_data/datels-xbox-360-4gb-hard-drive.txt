 The guys at Datel pulled anice trick with their 4GB PSPHDD/battery, and now they're back with the slightly less impressive feat of building a 4GB external HDD for the Xbox 360. Yes it's "100% Xbox 360 compatible," but sois every other external USB drive, so take that away and all you've got left is a pretty green LED. The drive pulls itspower over USB 2.0 from the 360, measures around 2-inches square, and at least it won't look out of place on yourconsole, but we're sure you could get better bang for your buck from a higher capacity 2.5-inch drive.
