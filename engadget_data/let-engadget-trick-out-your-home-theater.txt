We know there are some of you out there that shop longingly at your local electronics retailer, dreaming of the day you can dump that crappy rig and get something the neighbors will be envious of -- or hear all the way down the block, anyway. That's where we -- and about five thousand dollars worth of gear -- come in. Let us trick out your home theater with a brand new LCD or plasma HDTV, Onkyo 7.1 surround system, TiVo HD DVR, Xbox 360 (with HD DVD), PlayStation 3, Harmony remote, Slingbox Pro, and more.
