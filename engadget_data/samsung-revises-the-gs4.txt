Samsung tends not to hop around when it comes to design language, instead, choosing to gently sail the calmer waters of familiarity. Probably the biggest deviation from those well-worn design notes of late was the leather-look plastic back that adorned the Galaxy Note 3. We certainly preferred it to the recent smooth, fingerprint-friendly affairs found on the Galaxy S III and S 4. It seems the phone giant did too, and has released a new version of the GS 4 in Korea (Samsung Galaxy S 4 LTE-A, if you're interested) that features the same textured effect on the rear -- along with the not-so-needed faux stitching. Oh, and "rose gold" makes a comeback on the metal-look details too! So, while this might be no good to you, with your slippy-slidey OG Galaxy S-whatever, with number five potentially being just around the corner, it could be a suggestion of what it might look like.
