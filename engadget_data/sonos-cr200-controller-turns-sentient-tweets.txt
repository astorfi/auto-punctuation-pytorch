Easy, Sonos just launched a private beta while here at IFA that gives a few heroes the ability to Tweet sweet nothings about the audio currently bouncing around their home audio zones. The beta adds a new "social services" (hint: that's plural) menu letting Sonos owners configure up to 5 Twitter accounts. Fortunately, it will not tweet every track you're listening to -- you have to purposely invoke the option from the "i" information icon off the now playing screen. The free update is coming "later this year" (read: Fall) for all CR200, iPhone, and PC/Mac controllers. Want it on the touchwheel-based CR100? Surely you can't be serious?
