 
Hey -- are you in love with the PSP 3000 but can't stand the fact that a pink one doesn't exist? Well, your life just got a lot better. Playstation Japan's just officially outed the handheld in "Spring Blossom Pink" for a March 2010 launch. Other than its new, more girlish figure, this PSP 3000 is exactly the same as every one on the market, but you know, looks sure are important. Sadly, this beauty's only been announced for Japan so far, but we'll keep our eyes open for other availability. This one's going to run Â¥16,800 (that's about $183). There's one more looker after the break.
