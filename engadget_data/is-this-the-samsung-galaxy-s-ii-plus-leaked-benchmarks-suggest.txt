 
 Pinch of salt time. As mobile manufacturers polish up those final test models ready for us to pore over in just a few weeks, someone's possibly jumped the gun. What you're looking at here are apparently benchmarks from the Galaxy S II Plus -- yep, another incremental step-up for an existing Samsung device. According to the results, the phone will carry the same resolution screen of the original (800 x 480), but will purportedly be the first device to carry a dual-core 1.5GHz Exynos processor -- placing it just ahead of even the Galaxy Note. Unfortunately, the benchmark read-out also lists Android 2.3.4 for the phone -- a little old (and unlikely) when we're seeing version 2.3.7 if not a leap to Ice Cream Sandwich. Benchmark results featuring a Galaxy Nexus with a 2GHz processor (possibly overclocked) has also got us all kinds of suspicious. We'll be keeping our eyes on this one.
