Today, the company detailed the package, formally known as BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10. The big story here is that already-existing IT tools like BlackBerry Mobile Fusion, BlackBerry Device Service and Universal Device Service will be accessible from a single web console. The company also clarified that BlackBerry Device Service and Universal Device Service can run off separate servers, or just one. Take note, though, that the older BES 5+ will still need its own server for the time being. As we previously reported, too, the newest version of BES will offer legacy support to older devices -- specifically, it can support PlayBook tablets, phones running BlackBerry 7 OS or higher as well as iOS and Android devices.
