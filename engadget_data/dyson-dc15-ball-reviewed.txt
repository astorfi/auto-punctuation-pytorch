Is Dyson's $600 DC15 Ball worth the price â€” or is
anyone who hands over that much for a vacuum cleaner a bigger sucker than the machine he's buying? Apartment Therapy
set out to answer that question with a hands-on review of the Ball. The reviewer found the vacuum to be powerful, easy
to maneuver and well-made, though a bit of overkill for urban apartments (though clearly not for the swanky Engadget
Mansion). The review's endorsement: "honestly, we've never had so much fun using a vacuum." Our response: honestly,
guys, you need to get out of that apartment a little more.
