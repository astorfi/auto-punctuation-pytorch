The N95 8GB for North America is pretty much exactly what you'd expect it to be -- an exact replica of the European version with the 2100MHz WCDMA radio surgically removed and replaced with an 850 / 1900MHz counterpart for speedy data in these lands. The screen is up to 2.8 inches versus the original N95's 2.6, but the 8GB of internal storage comes at the cost of the microSD slot, so don't get all cocky on us about rocking 16GB of storage in your pocket, alright? Check it in stores this quarter for $749.
