Fortunately, it's just been given a clean bill of 802.11 b/g/n health and can be yours for $240 from Best Buy Amazon. That outlay gets you an 8-incher with a front-facing camera, 4GB of built-in storage and a microSD slot. Watch out though: like previous Cruz tablets, it omits Android Market support out of the box, which tells you something about its target audience.

Update: Looks like the T408 isn't available from Best Buy, at least not yet. But, you can put in your pre-order over at Amazon if you so desire.
