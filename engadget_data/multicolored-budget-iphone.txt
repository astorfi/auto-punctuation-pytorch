While previous rumors surrounding a  future budget iPhone have largely shown it in monochromatic white, a fresh batch of photos suggest that it could be more colorful. Apple Daily, Nowhereelse and Sonny Dickson all claim to have leaked images of the device's back shell in pastel shades of blue, green, pink and yellow. There's little available to verify the photos' accuracy, but they are at least consistent -- all of them show the same camera holes and logo positioning. Although we likely won't know the truth behind these shots for a few months at best, we won't be surprised if Apple's next starter iPhone is especially vibrant.
