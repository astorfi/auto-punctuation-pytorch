Say what you will about Sirius vs.
XM (actually nah, we've heard it all before), Sirius
has been hard up to keep pace competing with the ever-smallish hardware of XM's portable offerings. Well, apparently
only until the Starmate Replay hits the streets, which appears to feature their smaller 3G chipset, and finally
incorporates a 44-minute time-shifting window into the device, as well as having an FM transmitter. Glowing index
finger option version also available.
