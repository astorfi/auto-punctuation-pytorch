 In the fight against unwanted jerks checking out and/or messing with your sensitive files, IOGEAR has taken matters into its own hands with a new fingerprint-reading mouse. The mouse -- which contains a convenient, built in biometric reader -- will scan the identity of you and four loved-ones with a confidence-stoking accuracy of more than 99%. In addition, the device is coated with the company's "Nano Shield" which prevents totally gross garbage like bacteria, fungus and algae from surviving on the surface. So, if you're super-paranoid about both germs and computer security, your wallet is probably going to get about $80 lighter real soon.
