Virgin America is often the domestic airline leading the way in in-flight entertainment, but Southwest Airlines is doing its best to keep up with Sir Richard Branson's stateside flight outfit. Earlier in the year, Southwest rolled out pay TV and on-demand video in many of its aircraft. Today, the airline announced a partnership with Dish Network to bring free satellite TV to passengers' mobile devices on its 400 Wi-Fi equipped planes. Why the shift to a gratis service? Dish decided that ponying up the necessary dough was worth it for the branding it'll receive as a part of the new deal. So, go forth, friends and fly Southwest's friendly skies -- assuming the free TV is enough to entice you to brave its first-come-first-served seating methods.
