 In the last update before analog TV goes off after June 12, Nielsen's results indicate 2.5% of, or 2.8 million U.S. homes are still completely unready and will be cut off after it goes through. That's around three million less than it was the last time we were this close to the DTV transition, hopefully all reading this are on the digital television ready side (six easy steps right here.) Don't forget, many stations are switching at different times, so check your local broadcasters before rescanning so you don't have to do it twice, Friday night / Saturday morning is probably your best bet.
