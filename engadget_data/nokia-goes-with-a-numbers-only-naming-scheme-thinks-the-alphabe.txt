 There had been rumblings that Nokia was going to switch up its naming scheme and ditch the letter prefixes. Today, with the launch of the Nokia 500 (previously known as the Fate) that shift in convention has finally taken effect. The all-number nomenclature is brilliantly simple -- the higher the number, the higher-end the handset, and the higher the price. So, if and when Nokia unveils the 790 (which the Finnish company denies exists with a wink), you'll immediately know it will be costlier and more powerful than the 500 or the 670. Now we can all stop wondering what the "C" and "X" in C7 and X7 are supposed to tell us about our choice in Symbian handset and, by extension, ourselves.
