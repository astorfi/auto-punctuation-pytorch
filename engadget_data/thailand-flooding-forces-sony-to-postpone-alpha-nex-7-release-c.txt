According to the manufacturer, the flooding has impacted operations at two of its three factories within the country, thereby delaying production of both the NEX-7 and Alpha A65. Reuters is reporting that one camera plant has been completely flooded, while operations at a semiconductor factory have been suspended due to supply shortages. The NEX-7 was originally scheduled to hit the market next month, though Sony now says it has been delayed indefinitely. "It is difficult for us to say at this time when production will re-start in Thailand," spokesman George Boyd told the BBC. "However, we are taking measures to move production to our third factory in Thailand which is operational and also to other sites."
