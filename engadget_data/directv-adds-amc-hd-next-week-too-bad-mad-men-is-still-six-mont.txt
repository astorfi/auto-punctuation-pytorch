There's still a pretty long list of channels it's not offering yet, but if you're on contract and just want to enjoy some Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and Mad Men (when it returns in March) in HD then today's Facebook posting (just hours after it was dug up by the satellite sleuths at DBSTalk) is exactly what you've been waiting for.
