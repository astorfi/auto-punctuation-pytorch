Okay, so we admit that we aren't much into kayaking here at Engadget—it might be the fact that the darn things never
seem to go in a straight line when we're doing the paddling—but we've got to give props to a hydroplaning version of
the infernal boats. The Flyak doesn't actually fly, but it does rise about half a foot out of the water, giving you far
less drag than a traditional kayak. Should be just the thing for breaking some world records in, but you'll need a
solid 4 to 8 second sprint to get the thing up and some definite skillz to keep it going. We'll stay on dry land thank
you very much.
