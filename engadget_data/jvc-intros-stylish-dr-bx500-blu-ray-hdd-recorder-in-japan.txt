Today, we Europeans, North Americans, et al. are being forced to lust after this here piece of electronic goodness, which goes by the sobriquet DR-BX500. The JVC-built Blu-ray recorder packs twin digital TV tuners (along with a single analog tuner), a 500GB internal hard drive and a built-in EPG to boot. You'll also find an SD card slot for loading up multimedia stored on flash cards, and the HDMI port (among other lovely sockets) ensures that your BD flicks get outputted in 1080p. Check it in Japan next month for a currently undisclosed price.[Via Impress]
