It seems a limited edition 18 carat gold One just isn't enough for HTC. Today, the Taiwanese smartphone maker unveiled another golden variant of its Android flagship, swapping the soft and expensive exterior of its MOBO-themed One for a familiar aluminum chassis. We first saw the front half of HTC's latest variant in September, suggesting the company would make a fifth color available alongside its silver, black, blue and red designs. As for specs, there's no change internally, which means it's still powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 600 processor and features the same 4-megapixel UltraPixel sensor. The latest variant does come late to the game, with Apple's gold iPhone 5s enjoying huge demand and Samsung launching the Galaxy S 4 gold edition, albeit in limited markets. HTC says the device will be available across Europe with a number of partners -- when we hear more, we'll let you know.
