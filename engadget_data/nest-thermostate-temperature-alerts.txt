Nest didn't just show off its first self-branded home monitoring camera and a revamped smoke detector at its big event. The home automation firm also gave its Learning Thermostat an update that, if you like, will warn you if the temperature falls outside of a preferred range. You'll know if it gets so cold that the pipes are likely to freeze, or if it's scorching enough that your pet will pass out. The climate controller also works in closer harmony with the Protect. It'll show carbon dioxide and smoke alarms that you might otherwise miss, and can shut off your air conditioning or heating to prevent smoke from spreading. It'll take about two weeks for Nest to push the thermostat upgrade to your home, but you can grab the necessary mobile app revamp (which unifies control for Nest's devices) as of today.
