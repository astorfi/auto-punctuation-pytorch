 After having received so many SlingBox cakesfor our second birthday, we figured alot of you would want to know that SlingPlayer Mobile forPocket PC in now available to download for free as part of a public beta program. The SlingPlayer software  --which lets broadband-enabled WinMo devices stream live and recorded TV from a remote SlingBox -- works as a 30-daytrial, after which time it can be purchased for $30 (although it's free with any new  'Box prior to April 26th).Despite the fact that wireless carriers seemlukewarm about the new service, until people start getting busted for violatingtheir contracts' provisions on data usage, SlingBox owners are about to get their money's worth and then some onthose $15 all-you-can-eat PowerVision packages.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
