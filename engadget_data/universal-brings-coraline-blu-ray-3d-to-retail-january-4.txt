 So far, promotional exclusives have tied up many Blu-ray 3D titles, but that tide may start to turn, now that Universal has announced it's releasing the previously Panasonic-exclusive Coraline to retail on January 4, 2011. The only extras noted on the 3D disc itself are a commentary track with the director and composer and English DTS-HD MA soundtrack. We're sure fans of the animated flick will be happy to put away those red/blue glasses and get a better quality version, we'll be keeping an eye out to see which title is released from the bonds of exclusivity next.
