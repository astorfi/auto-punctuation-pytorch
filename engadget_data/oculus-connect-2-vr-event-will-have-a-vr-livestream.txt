Tomorrow when the folks at Oculus show off the latest developments in their plan for VR world domination at the Oculus Connect 2 event, a select few will be able to experience remotely just as if they were there. If you have a Samsung Gear VR you can download the Next VR app and get your 360-degree immersion, just like I experienced with the first live stream several months ago. One day we'll all put on headsets and take a virtual trip to press events like Oculus and OnePlus, but since that's not universally available yet, we will be there liveblogging all the action. Assuming you have a compatible Samsung phone and one of the plastic Gear VR headsets, the app will be available before the keynote speech starts at 1PM ET tomorrow. (If you're not VR ready yet, yes there will be an old-school 2D live video broadcast as well.)



Can't make it to #OC2 this year? Download our app on Gear VR and experience our live VR stream of Connect Keynotes tomorrow beginning10am
