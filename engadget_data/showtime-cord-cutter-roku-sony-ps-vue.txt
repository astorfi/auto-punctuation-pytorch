 We already know that Showtime's internet-only service is coming to Apple TV, but that's not the only home entertainment platform that's been invited to the party. The company has revealed that if you own a Roku device, one of the TVs with the hardware built in or Sony's PlayStation Vue, then you're all good, and it will launch for all three on the same day. The outfit also mentions that Showtime (yes, that's what it's called) will be the only "premium" offering that broadcasts its live East and West Coast feeds to its users, just like its Anytime apps on various platforms. No matter what device you use, you'll be asked to cough up $10.99 a month for the privilege of catching the forthcoming Twin Peaks revival. The system is due to launch "early July," although given that the new seasons of Ray Donovan and Masters of Sex premiere on July 12th, we're gonna say July 11th is a good guess.
