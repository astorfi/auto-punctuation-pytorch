If you want an 84-inch 4K TV, you've really gotta be a one-percenter, but fortunately for the rest of us that's not a very big market. That's why it's high time that companies started to trim those ultra high-definition panels down to a size and price point that's suitable for the everyman. It's Toshiba, therefore, that's leading the charge to affordability with a concept 50-inch 4K TV. The M9/L9 Series Concept is currently just that, but it combines the usual breathtaking imagery with a more apartment-friendly size. Naturally, there aren't currently any plans to bring this to market, but hey, the company will happily sell you a 58-inch model for Â£3,000.
