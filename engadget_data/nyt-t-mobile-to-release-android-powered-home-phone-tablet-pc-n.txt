We're a bit light on details, but we do know the phone itself has a docking station and will come with another device for synchronization. That device's supposed resemble a small, keyboard-less laptop with a 7-inch touchscreen and could check the mail and manage data for devices across the house. Here's hoping T-Mo's been taking notes watching its AT&T HomeManager / Verizon Hub predecessors.
