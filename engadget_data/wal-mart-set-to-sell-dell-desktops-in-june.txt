 We've already heard talk of Dell moving into retail, but it looks like the company is now set to take its first big step in that direction, partnering with none other than Wal-Mart to sell a couple of its desktop computers in all 3,500 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club locations across the U.S., Canada ,and Puerto Rico. Details are still somewhat light, but there will apparently be two different Dimension desktops offered at Wal-Mart stores to start with, both running under $700 for a bundle, and each "exclusive" to Wal-Mart. Sam's Club and Wal-Mart Canada will apparently carry slightly different, but equally exclusive models. Both companies are promising to reveal more details about the specific models soon, but you won't have to wait too long to check 'em out for yourself, as they're set to begin hitting store shelves on June 10th.
