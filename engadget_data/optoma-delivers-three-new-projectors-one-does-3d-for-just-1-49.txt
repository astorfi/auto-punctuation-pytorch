Watch those tiny LCDs and plasmas if you want, but it's time to go big or go home and Optoma is delivering three new beamers to help that happen. The new HD33 model (pictured above) makes its claim to fame as the first 1080p 3D projector available for less than $1,500, while the HD3300 and HD8300 make their bones in slighly more upmarket segments, priced at $1,999 and $4,499, respectively. All three make 3D happen in conjunction with the company's new RF-synced active shutter glasses, while featuring PureMotion3D and PureDepth for frame interpolation and brightness control. Those extra bucks spent on the HD8300 has ISF certified controls, lens shift for extra placement flexibility, PureMotion4D motion interpolation and a lamp rated at 1,500 lumens. The HD33 is available now, while the other two are expected to start shipping later this month, however with CEDIA 2011 just around the corner we'd probably hold off on pressing the buy button before everyone shows off their latest home theater wares.

Incorporating several new proprietary technologies and design		features, the HD33, with an end-user price of $1,499, is available now through leading		brick & mortar and online retailers.		Attention Editors: Links to hi-res images are at the end of the release		"3D is best done big, and you can't beat projection for big screen cinema," said		Jon Grodem, Optoma's senior director of product and marketing, "The HD33 makes 3D		available to millions more consumers than ever before, and is a great example of why		Optoma has earned a reputation for delivering industry-leading innovation and outstanding		quality."		According to Grodem, the 1800 ANSI lumen HD33 offers more than just full		compatibility with all 2D and 3D standards. It incorporates several new proprietary		technologies that deliver a truly dynamic cinematic experience. Optoma's new		PureMotion3D frame interpolation processing reduces judder to create smoother video		sequences in both 2D and 3D content. PureDepth, a brand-new technology developed		by the company, optimizes the projector's brightness and image configuration, ensuring		stunning image quality, again in both 2D and 3D. And a new color processing system		provides improved color accuracy, contrast, black levels and shadow details in image		sizes ranging from 35 inches to more than 300 inches.		The HD33 has also been developed in parallel with the company's new 3D-RF		glasses, which use RF (radio frequency) technology and have been specifically		designed to maximize brightness & contrast while eliminating the line of sight and		synchronization issues commonly experienced with systems using infra-red (IR)		emitters. The new glasses are fully rechargeable; the emitter is included with the		projector, while the glasses will be sold separately.		The HD33 supports all the HDMI 1.4a mandatory 3D formats, including both		Side-by-Side and Top & Bottom formats, and more. To further enhance 3D		compatibility, Side-by-Side and Top & Bottom formats can be manually enabled to allow		other non-HDMI 1.4a compatible devices, such as older set top boxes, Xbox360, or		PCs, to display 3D via the VGA or HDMI ports. Accordingly, the HD33 offers two		HDMI 1.4a ports, one VGA port, as well as connections for component video, composite		video, RS-232, a +12V trigger, and a VESA 3D Port.		3D content can be viewed with RF glasses or DLP Link-based 3D active shutter		glasses when used with a 3D-ready player.

Incorporating its newest		technologies and design features to deliver uncompromised performance, both the		HD8300 ($4,499) and the HD3300 ($1,999) will begin shipping later this month.		Attention Editors: Links to hi-res images are at the end of the release		"These new projectors are shining examples of why Optoma has earned a		reputation for delivering industry-leading innovation and outstanding image quality," said		Jon Grodem, Optoma's senior director of product and marketing. "Both deliver		tremendous performance and will give installers options to meet their customer's		needs."		According to Grodem, the DLP technology in Optoma's projectors is the same		as is being used in today's professional digital cinemas, "Now anyone can have that		same professional quality in their home for everyday use."		The HD8300 builds on the company's award-winning HD8200 model and		represents its top-of-the-line 3D projector. Delivering a robust 1500 lumens, the		HD8300 employs the company's latest generation frame-interpolation processing,		PureMotion4D, which allows the user to easily customize the level of processing		to suit the content. At its lowest setting, PureMotion4D maximizes the detail of		every frame while still retaining the "dream-like" quality of film. At its highest setting,		it virtually eliminates motion blur, making it ideal for fast-paced sports and non-stop		action films.		The HD8300 also incorporates Optoma's proprietary PureColor technology		and a new color management system to optimize and fine tune primary and secondary		colors for calibration precision. PureColor provides unprecedented control over the		image and makes it possible to achieve vivid, balanced, and uniform color for vibrant		and natural looking 2D and 3D images that remain smooth and judder-free for greater		realism.		For increased placement flexibility, the HD8300 offers PureShift lens shift and		a wide 1.5x zoom ratio. And, ISFccc (Imaging Science Foundation Custom Calibration		Configuration) controls, with day and night modes, are available for adjustment by		certified installers.		The HD8300 has been developed to take advantage of the company's new 3D-RF		glasses, which use RF (radio frequency) technology and have been specifically designed		to maximize brightness and contrast while eliminating the line of sight and synchronization		issues commonly experienced with systems using infra-red (IR) emitters. The new glasses		are fully rechargeable; the RF emitter is included with the projector, while the glasses will		be sold separately.		The HD8300 supports all the HDMI 1.4a mandatory 3D formats, including both		Side-by-Side and Top & Bottom formats, and more. To further enhance 3D compatibility,		Side-by-Side and Top & Bottom formats can be manually enabled to allow other		non-HDMI 1.4a compatible devices, such as older set top boxes, Xbox360, or PCs, to		display 3D via the VGA or HDMI ports. Accordingly, the HD8300 offers two HDMI 1.4a		ports, one VGA port, as well as connections for component video, composite video,		RS-232, two +12V triggers, and a VESA 3D port.		The HD8300 ships standard with a back-up remote in case the primary remote		is lost or damaged. The backup remote is magnetically held onto the unit for emergency		usage.		Optoma HD3300		For custom installation customers looking for a more budget-friendly alternative		but who still want a projector with full 3D compatibility, Optoma's HD3300 is designed to		fit the bill.		Powered with 2000 lumens and delivering a contrast ratio of 5000:1, the HD3300		incorporates the company's PureMotion3D and PureDepth technologies to deliver a truly		dynamic cinematic experience. PureMotion3D frame interpolation processing almost		eliminates judder to create smoother video sequences, and PureDepth optimizes the		projector's brightness and image configuration, ensuring stunning image quality both in		2D and 3D modes. The HD3300 also uses Optoma's new color processing system to		improve color accuracy, contrast, black levels and shadow details. Further image		customization is achieved through ISFccc controls.
