Call us over-excited, but the manufacturer's last party bore plenty of exotic fruit so we reckon those Dre-approved headphones in the flyer might be connected to yet another new handset -- unless the mystery guest happens to be the aging hip-hop star himself. In any case, we'll be there and we won't hit a single canap√© or rap pose until we've brought you the news.
