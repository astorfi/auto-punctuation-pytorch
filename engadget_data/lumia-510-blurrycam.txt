 If a rolling stone gathers no moss, then the rumors surrounding Nokia's ultra-low-budget Lumia 510 have grown very mossy indeed. The folks over at GSMArena have snagged this glare-a-riffic snap of the prospective handset catching some rays in the finest of blurrycam traditions. Their tipster is also reiterating the specs we've seen before, talking up a Windows 7.8 handset with 256MB RAM, 800MHz CPU and 5-megapixel camera that's destined to stand between the Asha and Lumia 610 at the lower end of its smartphone pantheon. For those who prefer blurry pictures that move, My Nokia Blog has turned up a brief hands-on video of the phone -- check it out after the break.
