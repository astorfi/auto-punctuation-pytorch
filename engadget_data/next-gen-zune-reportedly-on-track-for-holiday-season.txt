 We've already heard some talk that a new Zune would be coming before the end of the year, but it looks like things now may be starting to get a bit more certain -- at least according to the folks at Whiz Byte, who say they've heard as much from a Microsoft press representative. Specifically, the rep reportedly said that we can "expect an update later this year prior to the holiday season." While there's no word on exactly what form that "update" will take, the rep did give a few less than surprising general indications of what we can expect from the Zune in the future, stating that there's "three predictable paths along which we'll expand Zune." Those include updates to the device family itself, including "new sizes, styles and price points," along with new features that'll help the Zune "move towards parity with iPod" and new geographic markets for the Zune.
