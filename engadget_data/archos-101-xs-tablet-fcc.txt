While the French tablet maker kept quiet on the specifics at its debut-- with not even a mention of the hardware's OS -- a filing at the FCC helps plug some of those information gaps. Courtesy of the user manual, we can see that the tablet will be running Android 4.0, while the as-yet unspecified storage capacity can be expanded by microSD. There's a mini-HDMI port that looks like it will require its own proprietary cable, and the keyboard dock? Well, it's absent from this FCC gallery, but it does appear in the user manual, demonstrating a twist and lift mechanism that creates a pop-up stand for the slab. Gaze on in horror as those FCC technicians prise open the Archos 101 xs' shell and scope out the internal works -- it's all in the source below.
