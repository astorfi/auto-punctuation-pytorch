Sounds like the SD850 / SD950 are the different badges it'll get in the US and overseas, but at the end of the day you've got an 8 megapixel camera with a 4x optical zoom, image stabilization, 1600 ISO sensor, DIGIC III processor, SDHC support, and 2.5-inch display. The PowerShot S5, successor to last year's PowerShot S3, also features an 8 megapixel image stabilized 1600 ISO sensor and 2.5-inch display, but naturally has a 12x optical zoom and hotshoe. They should retail for $400 and $500, but we don't have anything official on that or a release date.Read - PowerShot S5Read - SD850 / SD950
