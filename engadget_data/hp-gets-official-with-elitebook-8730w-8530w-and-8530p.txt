 Not that these units are a complete surprise or anything, but HP's taking the time to get really, really official with its minty fresh EliteBooks. Up first is the beastly EliteBook 8730w (that's the 6830s pictured), which packs a 17-inch DreamColor display, a quad-core Intel CPU, 8GB of RAM and one of NVIDIA's 1GB Quadro FX graphics cards. Keeping things going are the EliteBook 8530w and 8530p, both of which boast a 15.4-inch display, 8GB of RAM, a Core 2 Duo chip (8530w supports optional quad-core) and HP's own brushed anodized aluminum DuraCase. As for pricing and release information? Good luck on the guessing.[Thanks, Christopher]
