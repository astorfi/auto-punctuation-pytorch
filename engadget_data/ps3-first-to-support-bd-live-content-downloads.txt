 Interestingly, because Kevin mentioned similar HD DVD functionality during the Major Nelson podcast last night, English website T3 has information that the Playstation 3 will be one of the first first Blu-ray players to support BD Live content downloads. Basically movie studios can incorporate the capabilities to download new trailers, additional behind the scenes footage or even a whole website can be pulled up when you insert the disc in the console. With the included 20GB or 60GB hard drive this could be an interesting feature; however as noted in last night's podcast, apparently this functionality is not required in all Blu-ray players so it remains to be seen how much content providers will take advantage. Also up in the air are if this feature will potentially cost extra and will someone please start the timer for the first Digg front page post calling it spyware?[Via PS3 Fanboy]
