Another year, another Call of Duty. That's the sentiment, right? It's a series that's become as staid and expected as the turning of the seasons, and is consistently a "safe" bet if you're looking for a few hours of mindless fun in a tightly-scripted shooting gallery masked as an interactive narrative. And then of course you have adversarial multiplayer that's left an indelible mark on gaming as a whole. Does it carry over to freshman studio Sledgehammer Games' turn at the franchise with Advanced Warfare? Well, that's a complex question. For starters, there are lasers in this one. And jump-packs. And robotic exoskeletons. And a whole lot of Kevin Spacey. So there are quite a few new aspects to the franchise. And naturally, we're going to give you a grand tour starting at 7 p.m. Eastern / 4 p.m. Pacific, via Twitch on PlayStation 4. 



[For the record, I'm playing Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare on a PlayStation 4, using a retail copy (disc) provided by Activision. I'm streaming the game over wired internet using the PlayStation 4 Twitch app. All that to say, "This game will likely look prettier and run more smoothly on your home equipment. Streaming conditions vary!"]
