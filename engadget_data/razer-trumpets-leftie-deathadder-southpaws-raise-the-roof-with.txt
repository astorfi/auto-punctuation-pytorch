Razer is finally taking a stand for the under-appreciated (and vastly underserved) left-hand gamer market, and while we would've given these guys even more credit for developing an all-new mouse for lefties, we'll take a redesigned DeathAdder any day of the week. In essence, the DeathAdder Left Hand Edition is the exact same mouse that debuted last September, but in left hand form. The best part? Razer's not charging a dime more for this version than the obviously more viable right handed model. Hey, guitar makers -- care to take a hint?
