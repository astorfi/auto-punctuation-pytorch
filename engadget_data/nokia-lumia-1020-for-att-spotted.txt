Wondering what the Nokia EOS (aka Lumia 1020) will look like in US trim? This may be your first glimpse: @evleaks has posted a press image of the device in its AT&T form. If accurate, it represents our first proper view of the flagship Windows Phone's front side, and it suggests that we're looking at a subtle evolution of the Lumia 920 from this angle. Look closely at the software, however. There's a previously unknown Nokia Pro Cam app, which hints that Lumia 1020 owners will get more than just a tweaked version of the Smart Camera app on the Lumia 925. Presumably, this would include extra controls to tame the camera's 41 million pixels. There's no launch details or other tidbits included with the as yet unconfirmed image, although there's a real chance that we'll see a lot more around July 11th.
