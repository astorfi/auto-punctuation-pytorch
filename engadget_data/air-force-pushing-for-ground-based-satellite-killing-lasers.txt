 In a proposal that would surely bring a tear tothe late Ronald Reagan's eye, Air Force officials are attempting to co-opt $5.7 million from the 2007 budget fordeveloping high-energy lasers that could be used to destroy enemy satellites (because, you know, al Qaeda is launchingbirds left and right). So far a subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee has "shot down" theprogram, which would build on a 1997 Pentagon study of a two-million-watt laser, although the full committee couldreinstate the provision following analysis of the entire bill. While certain military interests have pushed foranti-satellite weapons since the Cold War, concern over the space junk that destroyed sats would create has kept theinternational community from serious pursuit of any "Star Wars"-like programs. Although we're always keen onnew military tech (hey, it gives us something to write about), we're gonna have to side with the Doubting Thomases onthis one, because the impending "ROBO-ONE in theSpace" satellite is simply too important to risk even a single stray laser strike.
