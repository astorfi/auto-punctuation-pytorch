 It's not just going to be "some" iMacs that bear a USA legend, but a whole line of Cupertino's computers from next year. In a TV interview with Brian Williams, Apple CEO Tim Cook has said "we will do one of our existing Mac lines in the United States," vaguely confirming that production of either iMacs, Mac Minis or Mac Laptops will make a wholesale move to the US in 2013. As the company doesn't own any manufacturing facilities itself, Cook has committed to invest more than $100 million with a partner -- following through on his previously stated desire to see production move to the US. After the break, we've got the relevant clip of tonight's show, where you'll also see Cook sharing his thoughts on the US' "skills gap."
