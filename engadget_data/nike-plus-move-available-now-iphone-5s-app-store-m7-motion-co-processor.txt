During the iPhone 5s launch, Apple decided to show off its fancy new M7 co-processor with Nike+ Move. The free fitness app brings FuelBand-esque features to your smartphone, without the need to buy a $150 wearable. Of course, Nike was keen to stress that the app is only an "introductory experience," so if you still want to brag about how much of an athlete you are, you're still gonna wanna splash out on an SE. For everyone else? We'll probably stick with Nike+ Running.
