Needless to say, the half dozen images of the rocket being rolled onto the launch deck and erected on the launch pad during final testing is a pretty good sign that things are going to plan. No word yet on exactly when this thing will head for space, but judging by the shots in the read link, we're guessing it'll be sooner rather than later.[Thanks, Vanbrothers]
