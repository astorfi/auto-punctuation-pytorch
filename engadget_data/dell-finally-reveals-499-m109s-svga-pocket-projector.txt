Formally christened the M109S, this 0.8-pound beamer arrives with a native 858 x 600 resolution, a projection distance of up to 94.5-inches and a mercury-free LED light source that lasts up to four years. Moreover, it packs the ability to suck power from a Latitude or Vostro AC adapter if you're caught in a pinch, and yes, it's available today for $499 in the United States. As for the rest of the world, you wait.[Via AboutProjectors]
