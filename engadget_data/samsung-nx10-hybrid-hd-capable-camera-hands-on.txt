If you're one of the many in this previously underserved crowd, you'll go crazy for the Samsung NX10. Our hands felt right at home on the camera body, which was just the right size for our tastes. That 3-inch AMOLED display around back is a thing of pure beauty, and it's sure to make any other DSLR owner green with envy. As if that wasn't enough, it does 720p video and boasts an HDMI out. Yeah, we know you want one.
