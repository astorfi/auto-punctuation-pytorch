And contrary to popular belief, there's no real ammunition in there -- unless you consider the kind required to shoot digital clay pigeons "real munitions." Spotted at a nondescript trade show over in Hong Kong, this here Wii controller actually comes with Wiimote, nunchuck and MotionPlus functionality built right in (wild, right?), so there's no need to slip your own Wii controller in before greasing up your face, jumping in the fatigues and mashing that diminutive power button on your console. Who knows if this thing will actually ship Stateside, but man, can you imagine the line at your local GameStop if it does?[Thanks, TheLostSwede]
