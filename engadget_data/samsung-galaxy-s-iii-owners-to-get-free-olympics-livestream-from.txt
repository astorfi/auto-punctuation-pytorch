Eurosport has announced that it'll be offering a free month of access to its streaming app for Galaxy S III owners -- as long as you're a resident in one of the participating European countries. (Hint: it's most of 'em, aside from Italy). Free access can be activated from July 14th and will last through August 12th. You can, however, grab the Eurosport app before the Olympics kick off by hitting the source below.
