For the hardcore SquareEnix RPG fans out there, Hori has released the
Dragon Quest Slime PS2 controller.  Sitting on your floor or shelf, this controller looks just like a Slime from
the Dragon Quest video game.  Flip it, and you have a fully-functional Dual-Shock controller.  For those
confused readers, Slimes are the most common monsters encountered in SquareEnix's Dragon Quest Role-Playing Game
series.  They've become something of a Dragon Quest icon, with fan fiction sites and FAQs and other
unmentionables.  For those in the know, you can get one of these from Japan for around $30.
