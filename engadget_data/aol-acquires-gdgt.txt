 Yes, the rumors are true! The gadget database and website launched by Engadget founder Peter Rojas and founding editor Ryan Block, gdgt, has been purchased by our parent company, Aol. On gdgt's blog, Block explains that the site will bring its community and core technologies to web properties like, erm, this one -- in addition to its comprehensive product database, which we've been embedding since 2011. It'll also team up with Engadget on live events throughout the year, which means more gadget-filled fests in cities like Austin, Boston and San Diego, along with the usual suspects, such as our inaugural Expand conference in March. We'll have plenty more details to fill you in on later today, but you can hit up the post at our source link to see what we're able to share right now. Let's give Peter, Ryan and the rest of the gdgt team a warm Engadget welcome!
