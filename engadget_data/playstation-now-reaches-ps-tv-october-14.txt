If you're planning to snag a PlayStation TV with game streaming in mind, you'll be glad to hear that it will be ready to go on day one. Sony has posted an FAQ confirming that the PlayStation Now beta will be available on the PS TV (and the PS VIta) in North America on October 14th, the same day that the mini console hits store shelves. As with the Now tests on bigger PlayStations, you'll have the option of renting 150-plus PS3 games with multiplayer support and cloud-based saves. Whether or not you're bent on using Now from the start, the FAQ is a handy primer for all the less-than-obvious things the PS TV can do -- it's worth a trip to the source link if you're at all curious.
