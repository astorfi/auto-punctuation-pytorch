 Following a weekend of stiff-drinks and intrepid mulling, Vodafone Japan Softbank just went official regarding the supposed iTunes playing cellphone they are co-developing with Apple â€“ officially denying it, that is. Well, kind of. See, our brethren over at Engadget Japan tell us that Softbank's response (in Japanese) to the claims made in that un-sourced Nikkei article are mere "speculation. The source is not us. We have nothing to say about it." Hmm, that sounds more like a plea to Apple not to kill the deal than a denial that they're in cahoots on the popularly dubbed, and oft speculated iPhone which is not pictured to the right.
