SK Telecom's and Earthlink'sjoint-venture Helio is officially lighting up today withtheir first two devices -- the Hero and Kickflip. We're all pretty well briefed to date on thecapabilities and general offerings the service was supposed to have, so let's get to the plans and pricing, of whichthere are two types: the All-In Membership, which includes unlimited data, video, MMS, texting, nights and weekends,roaming, and long distance with the plan; and the A La Carte plan which is as the name implies. The All-In buys you1,000 anytime minutes for $85, 1,500 for $100, or 2,500 minutes for $135 (which we think is a pretty good value,considering what some are charging for that many minutes and unlimited phone data); the A La Carte gets you a 500minute $40 monthly plan straight up. Oh, and the devices now have prices, too: the Hero will set you back $275, and theKickflip will ding you for $250. We have a sneaking feeling we know which will outsell the other. So if you're not readyto wait until the end of the month for their retail rollout to switch carriers (or join Helio as your first),fortunately you can just order direct and cut the middle man.P.S. -More info on the media services Helio's offering over at Engadget Mobile.
