What's nio, you ask? Why, it's a Bluetooth security tag that links up your mobile phone and practically anything else you'd like: a briefcase, a set of keys, a pack of Doritos, etc. Essentially, it gives you the ability to be buzzed if your tracked belongings hover too far out of range with your cellie, though the inability to remotely taser the thief is a definite shortcoming. Seems that you'll have to be real serious about this to even inquire about a price, but a totally explanatory video is waiting just past the break.[Via Gadling]
