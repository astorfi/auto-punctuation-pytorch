As you can see, Panny has dropped most of the external controls wesaw on their prototype at CES, and implemented a cleaner look that more closely matches the design of their other hometheater products. Unfortunately no new info is available concerning pricing, but hopefully we'll be able to nail down aMSRP a little less vague than "under $1,500" well in advance of this product's scheduled September release.
