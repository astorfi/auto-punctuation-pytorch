Ever rush to identify a song with Shazam with your phone, only to be frustrated as the tune ends before you've even reached into your pocket? That won't be a concern with the latest update to Shazam's iPhone app. Much like on the iPad, the new audio recognition software can listen for music, live events and TV shows in the background, even if the device is locked; a night at the bar could leave you with a full playlist. There's still no corresponding Android update, but iPhone owners can start producing the soundtrack of their lives after a quick trip to the App Store.
