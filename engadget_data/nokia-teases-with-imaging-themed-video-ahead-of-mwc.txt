  Well what do we have here? Nokia just posted a delightful little video on its YouTube channel hinting at some kind of announcement during Mobile World Congress next week. The imaging-themed video entitled "Get ready to capture a pure view" shows beautiful snowy landscapes and uses words like detail, depth and definition. While we've enjoyed Nokia's recent foray into all things white, the company's current imaging flagship is getting a bit long in the tooth. Could this be about an N8 successor running Symbian Belle? Guess we'll have to wait until Monday to find out.
