Over the course of this past week, gaming-minded geeks descended upon Los Angeles for the industry's annual summer shindig. In the latest issue of our slate magazine, we hit the show floor at E3 2013 to offer up impressions of the latest gaming gadgetry. We also chat Wii U with Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma, examine the uphill climb for said console and look back at the history of the entire event. There's loads more of game-centric goodness packed into this edition, so we'll let you get to it via the usual download sources.
