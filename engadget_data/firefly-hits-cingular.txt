It may not be the coolest phone in town — hell, your kids may not even want it — but if you've had your eye on a
Firefly for making sure your little schmoopies
are safe, looks like Cingular's got 'em, and for $50, too. We'll probably see that price drop below the free-threshold
once they're actually in stores (and with holiday promotions you could walk out getting who knows how much cash paid
out in rebates on top), but really, who can put a price on your child's wellbeing?
