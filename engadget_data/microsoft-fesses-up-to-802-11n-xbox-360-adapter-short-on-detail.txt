Unfortunately, the company stopped there, failing to mention price, launch date or the all important HOT or NOT score of the upcoming unit. As Joystiq points out, Microsoft did say that the adapter will offer "another choice to consumers," which means the original adapter might be sticking around for a bit -- at hopefully a cheaper pricepoint -- but that's about all we've got to go on at the moment. So... we're pretty much back where we started from, but now we're officially in the dark.
