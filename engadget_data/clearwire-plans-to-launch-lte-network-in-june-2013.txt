   Clearwire's been promising us that speedy LTE network for quite some time now. The good news is, we may have a clearer view of when to expect the waves to start flowing. During yesterday's Q4 earnings call, CEO Erik Prusch said his company plans on rolling out its LTE tides by June of next year, with the help of 5,000 wave sites around the US and a "longer-term" plan of adding about 3,000 more. The 2.5GHz spectrum will take over the WiMAX regime you've grown to love, and while we're still many handsets and slates away from testing it out, it's something all you Now Network users can happily look forward to.
