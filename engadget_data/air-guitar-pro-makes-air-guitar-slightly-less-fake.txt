Like the bastard child of Guitar Hero and those keychains you bought as a kid that make explosion noises, this handheld device works by allowing you to press chord buttons on its fretboard and then strum your fingers across IR sensors in the neck. If you're not sure of your soloing abilities, you can play along to preloaded tracks like Walk This Way or Smoke on the Water. Available on July 25th for around $27.[Thanks, Veronica B.]
