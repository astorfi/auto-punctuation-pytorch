 Wekind of wish iRiver Japan wasn't always skipping ahead of the rest of iRiver with their own 2GB players (except Korea, ofcourse), but Engadget fav portable-portable media player U10 istopping off at 2GB over there now, too. It'll set you back Â¥22,980 (about $200 US) when it launches the 26th ofthis month, but be patient, we have a feeling this'll make it Stateside sooner than later (and really, how often do youhear us say that?).
