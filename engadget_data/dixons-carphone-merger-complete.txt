After almost three months and a number of important approvals, Dixons and Carphone Warehouse have officially become one. Dixons Carphone, as it's now known (no, we're not making it up), is getting straight down to business, opening seven "store-in-stores" across the UK today with plans to open another 23 by the end of the year. When you enter one of the new "combined" shops, there will be dedicated areas for white goods, computers and now contract phones. That approach is mirrored across its websites too, pointing customers to new branded areas to better serve their needs. As time moves on, though, you may notice smartphones and tablets are given more prominence inside Currys & PC World stores as Dixons Carphone tries to lure you away from Amazon and offer everything under one physical and digital roof.
