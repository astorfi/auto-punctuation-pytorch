	With Mango finally on its very official way -- that'd be one day away for certain AT&T owners -- it's hardly surprising to see OEMs jumping on Redmond's mobile bandwagon. ZTE's joined the allied Windows Phone 7.5 ranks, outing its Tania phone at the China International Postal and Telecommunications Exhibition 2011. The modestly specced 4.3-inch device runs Microsoft's latest OS atop a single-core 1GHz processor, with 512MB of RAM, 4GB of storage and a 5 megapixel rear camera on-board. It's certainly no HTC Titan, but then again, not every smartphone needs to be a roided-up beast. Let's just hope MS gets those regional marketplace availability issues squared away before this handset's Chinese launch. After all, what fun is a live-tiled phone without the apps?
