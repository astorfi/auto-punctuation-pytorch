Well, that was quick. Just a few hours after an HTC product manager tweeted the good news, Verizon Wireless customers have found that the much-anticipated KitKat update is landing on their HTC Ones. Start mashing that software update button if you haven't already, friends.


In addition to Android 4.4.2, the update also packs a handful of performance improvements and HTC's Sense 5.5 UI. Fans of the HTC One Max are already familiar with HTC's new Sense tweaks -- BlinkFeed is more easily customizable, the Gallery and Music apps have gotten a facelift, and there's a new Do Not Disturb mode for those private moments -- but it's nice to see them trickle down onto a slightly smaller handset. For those of you keeping score, Sprint earlier this week became the first major US carrier to update the One with KitKat. That leaves just AT&T and T-Mobile to push through the update, but sadly, there's still no word on when they'll follow through.
