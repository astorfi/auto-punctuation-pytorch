When Nokia launched the Verizon-friendly Lumia 928 with some imaging improvements, it looked as if GSM users would have to wait for the company's next flagship to catch up. If those people couldn't wait for the mythical "proper" PureView Lumia, then they can grab the Lumia 925 to keep 'em going in the meantime. The company has taken the 920, put it on a diet, swapped out the polycarbonate for aluminium and tweaked the camera, while still retaining everything that made the handset our reader's choice for 2012. If you're having trouble telling the difference, however, then head past the break for our handy comparison table.
