Starting today, Facebook Home is finally including non-Facebook content on the lock screen, though only a few users will be able to take advantage of the option at first. Facebook for Android Beta testers can now access content from Flickr, Pinterest, Tumblr and Instagram as well as standard Facebook fare by following a few easy steps. All you have to do is select which apps you want to sync up in Home's settings menu and punch in your account information. After all is said and done, you'll be able to browse and like posts right from Home with the option to view the content on the original site with a conveniently provided link. There's no word yet on when a wider audience will be able to access the feature, but we'll keep you posted as we learn more. To see the new Home in action, check out the video after the break.
