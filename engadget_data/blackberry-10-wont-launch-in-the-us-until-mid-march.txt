According to an interview with the WSJ, RIM chief exec Thorsten Heins confirmed that while the touchscreen Z10 will launch in the UK tomorrow and Canada later this week, it won't be ready for the US until March. (Update: And he's just confirmed it on stage) Mr. Heins said the delay was due to the longer time it takes for American carriers to test new devices. No precise date was revealed, although we know that all the major carriers will be stocking BB10 devices on their eventual launch.

 Update: Bloomberg has added that the device will cost $599 unsubsidized in US. When it gets there.
