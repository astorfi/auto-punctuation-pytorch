Believe it or not, it's possible to to be a star within the six seconds of a Vine video -- just ask the likes of Riff Raff or Will Sasso, whose Vines are nearly as popular as their usual work. Social media guru Gary Vaynerchuk is starting up a talent agency, Grape Story, to make sure those celebs are getting paid in more than just likes. While Vaynerchuk isn't naming initial clients beyond co-founder Jerome Jarre, he expects the agency to be profitable enough that a wildly popular Vine user could make a living from posting 20 clips a year. There's also no word on when the agency will be open for business, although it already has a partnership lined up with Virgin Mobile. Just don't expect a rush toward Instagram videos -- for now, Grape Story is focused on the more established platform.
