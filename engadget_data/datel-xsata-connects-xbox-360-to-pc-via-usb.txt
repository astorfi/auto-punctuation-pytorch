The XSATA connectsto your 360 and your PC, letting you back up your console data to the PC, freeing up space on the 360. Once your 360'scontent is on your PC, you can also email unlocked files. Oh, and it has a blue glowing LED base, just 'cause. Expectto pay about $40, which is a lot less than you'd pay for an external drive for your 360 (though if you must have one,Datel would be happy to oblige). [Via GadgetReview]
