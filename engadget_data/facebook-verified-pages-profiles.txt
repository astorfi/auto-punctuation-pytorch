Taking a page out of the book of other social networks, Facebook is now making it possible to verify celebs and other high-profile people and companies. The feature, which consists of a small blue checkmark sitting next to their name, extends to Pages and Profiles of popular individuals and businesses, as a way to limit the confusion a reader may experience when trying to filter between real and fake accounts. It appears that Facebook is taking upon itself the duty of deciding who to verify, but it's still a good way to ensure that your favorite Engadget Facebook Page is manned by -- you know -- actual Engadget editors (nudge nudge, Mark!).
