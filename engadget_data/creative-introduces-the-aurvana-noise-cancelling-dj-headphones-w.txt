 Creative continues to roll out its X-Fi audio enhancement technology across its product line, this time in the latest addition to the Aurvana headphone line. The noise-canceling headphones rock the classic DJ style and feature a frequency response of 20Hz - 20kHz, as well side-mounted controls for the X-Fi modes, which Creative claims restores audio information lost during digital compression. No word on pricing or availability, but Creative isn't shy about getting its products out there, so chances are you'll know when these things hit.
