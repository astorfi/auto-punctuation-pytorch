As VP of corporate communications Nancy Morrison explains, Logitech "has not been asked by Google to suspend production of its Google TV products," and that such a suspension wouldn't even be necessary as "every Logitech Revue companion box will receive free over-the-air updates whenever Google and Logitech release software enhancements." That statement has now also been backed up by Logitech's official blog, which assures customers that "all's well with Logitech Revue," and that Logitech will be out in force at CES next month to demonstrate "how Google TV is transforming the TV-watching experience."
