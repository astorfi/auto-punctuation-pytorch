The adapter lets you use your standard wireless 360 peripherals, such as the Xbox 360 Wireless Controller and Wireless Headset, with your Windows PC. That means Windows users, which have been enjoying the fruits of a USB 360 controller since before the console launched, can finally get in on some wireless action, and it'll only cost them $20 for the privilege. It also means that much more fun for upcoming Games for Windows titles such as Shadowrun, UNO and Halo 2, along with generic game controls and VoIP functionality. Microsoft is also releasing a $60 package which includes a receiver and a wireless controller. Both items should be available at retail now.
