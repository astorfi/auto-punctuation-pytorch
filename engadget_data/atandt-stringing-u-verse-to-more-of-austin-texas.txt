Right now, greater than 150,000 living units in and around Austin can access U-verse TV and internet; more specifically, we're talking about regions of Cedar Park, Leander, Pflugerville, Round Rock, Sunset Valley, and West Lake Hills. Better still, AT&T's looking to take the service even further from the city center, and given that the Lonestar State was U-verse's first (and remains its favorite, some would say), we don't doubt that one bit.
