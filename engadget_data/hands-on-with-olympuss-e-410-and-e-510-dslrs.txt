The live LCD thing is a trend we can certainly grow to love, but we'll be honest, the interface wasn't doing much for us, and since we're not talking about full frame DSLRs, it's often going to be more about the glass you slap on your DSLR than the DSLR itself -- especially in the budget consumer range like these two. But hey, inquiring minds, so check out the gallery.P.S. -We also got some shots of their unnamed high-end DSLR prototype (aka what we've been calling the P-1).
