It was a wild few days at this year's Electronics Entertainment Expo. Just think -- nearly a decade after the last generation of consoles was unveiled by Microsoft and Sony, we've gotten our first close-up look at the next generation. Unlike 2012's lackluster showing, the convention floor felt invigorating for gamers waiting on the next reveals for Xbox One and PS4. While Nintendo tried keep steam going for its Wii U, the teams at Oculus Rift and Ouya brought light to the recent rise of indies and startups.


As Engadget staffers board planes for our respective trips back to HQ, we're leaving you, dear readers, with a carefully collated collection of the big show's highlights -- and of course, a number of feature stories and interviews. We've also put together a recap video with Joystiq Reviews Editor Richard Mitchell wherein we recount the show with our best attempts at witty banter. Join us past the break and relive all the virtual magic.
