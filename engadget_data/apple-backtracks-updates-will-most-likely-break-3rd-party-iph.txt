Apple didn't seem to want to let it get around that they've taken a completely neutral stance on 3rd party application development for the iPhone, and apparently got back with Gearlog to clarify that future iPhone "software updates will most likely break" 3rd party app compatibility. Not ignore, not possibly break -- most likely break. In other words, don't set your hopes too high that the NES games you're enjoying on your iPhone today will be around tomorrow, since it sounds like Apple won't be playing Switzerland after all.
