It looks like the Xbox One won't be as widely available at launch as originally planned. Citing a need to meet demand, Microsoft said today that its new console will be available in 13 countries at launch, instead of the 21 initially promised. Instead, the remaining eight markets will get it sometime in 2014. All told, those 13 lucky countries include: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand. The other eight -- Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden and Switzerland -- will still sell it eventually, but for now Microsoft isn't committing to a firm launch date. For now, all we know is that it's promised to arrive "as soon as possible next year." As a "show of appreciation for your patience," to use Microsoft's words, people who placed pre-orders in those eight cut-off countries will receive a free game. Feeling consoled, guys?
