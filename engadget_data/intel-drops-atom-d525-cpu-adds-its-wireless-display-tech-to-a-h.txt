Up first, the 1.8GHz dual core Atom D525 and the single core D425 which we first spotted at Computex 2010 are now available for low powered desktops, and both are paired with the Intel NM10 Express Chipset. Up next, Intel's made its wireless display technology available on about 25 systems and at 10 retailers. Finally, Clearwire's announced the nationwide availability of 4G-enabled laptops and netbooks based on Intel CPUs at Best Buy. Some of the systems grabbing up the 4G set-up include the Dell Inspiron 14, Dell Inspiron 15, Dell Mini 10, and Toshiba Satellite M645.
