Well, we think it's safe to say that the ViewPad is a rebranded version of the same tablet. ViewSonic swapped some internals and moved to a smaller 16GB SSD, but it's still the same 1.66GHz Intel Atom processor underneath. The tablet dual-boots Windows 7 Home Premium and Android 1.6 (sans MarketPlace access). Both operating systems run smoothly, and yes, you can pinch to zoom. Some inputs on the machine include USB 2.0, mini-HDMI, microSD and 3.5mm headphone jack. The 10-incher also sports a 1.3 megapixel shooter on the front for your video chatting needs. The company says it'll retail for around $629 when it ships next month.




The 10's sister, the 10s (also a 10.1-inch slate), is launching later this month. However, this tablet is running a skinned version of Android 2.2 on Tegra 2. On the top of the device you'll find the power button, orientation lock and back button. Don't ask us why the back button is up there -- we're just as puzzled as you are. On the right side, you'll find a hinged door hiding an HDMI, USB 2.0 and Micro SD slot. Don't worry, there's a 3.5mm headphone port and volume rocker so you can awkwardly rock out connected to the giant gadget piece. The 10s is only launching in Europe, Asia and Russia and is said to cost a rounded 430 smackaroos.
