 Coming directly on the heels of Fox announcing we will see Blu-ray Java enabled movies in 2006, the Blu-ray Disc Association has announce Sun Microsystems is joining the Board of Directors. Sun will continue to play a key role in supporting content providers enabling BD-J support in future Blu-ray releases. Reuters reports that the BDA is looking for "more muscle" to join with the various CE manufacturers and content companies although they did not indicate who that is specifically. If this truly leads to more announcements like the one earlier today and advanced BD-J features in an increasing number of Blu-ray movies then we applaud the move.Read - 20th Century Fox, Sun, Time Warner boost Blu-ray - ReutersRead - Blu-ray Disc Association Welcomes Sun Microsystems as Newest Board Member - BusinessWire
