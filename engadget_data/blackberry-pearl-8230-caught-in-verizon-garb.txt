Sure enough, we now have a shot of a Verizon-branded 8230 doing its thing -- not really what Bold hopefuls on Verizon were hoping for, we'd imagine, but a solid consumer-grade offering nonetheless. The fella who posted the shot over on CrackBerry's forums doesn't know what colors will be available at launch, but mentions that he expects it'll be "coming soon." CTIA in April, perhaps?[Via Boy Genius Report]
