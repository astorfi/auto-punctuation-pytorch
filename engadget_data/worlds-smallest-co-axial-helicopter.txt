Jetpack shmetpack, we'll take a personal eggbeater instead! Ok, maybe it's only a prank but pictured here is what is
claimed to be the world's smallest
co-axial helicopter capable of transporting wee humans
(read: less than 155-pounds) for about an hour on a 5-gallon tank-o-gas. With four independent engines, the two-stroke,
air-cooled, 125cc craft is capable of normal flight on just three, or a fully controlled landing on two — with a
ballistic parachute provided otherwise. The best part…it's also radio controlled. Oh the fun we're going to have with
our interns if we can track down the manufacturer.
