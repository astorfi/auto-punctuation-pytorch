 Well, it was only a matter of time before Apple bumped up the MacBook Pro line to Core 2 Duos -- after all, we've seen laptop after laptop after laptop already packin' the Merom love. AppleInsider reports that anonymous sources have told them that within the next few weeks, Apple will make start production of Merom-powered notebooks in time for the holiday season. That said, there's no mention in their latest article of the MacBook getting the bump as well, but it makes sense that Apple would upgrade the higher-end products first. Still, even though we want to believe this rumor, we've been burned so many times before that we're, like, beyond jaded when it comes to Apple gossip.
