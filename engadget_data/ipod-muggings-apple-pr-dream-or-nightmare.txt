Ok, you've heard all the rumors and mumblings about iPod
crime
waves in New York (and abroad)â€”and no, we're not talking
about the Hipster iPod or music piracy, we're talking
about people getting their little white jukeboxes swiped. So the NY Times laid it down: yes, the NYPD has that report
linking the iPod to a rise in subway crime in New York, but it gets a little more bleak when they call in Beckerman PR
vice-prez David Brooks, who claims, "Half of you is cringing, but half is bursting with pride" over the news. And then
it gets downright scary when he goes on the record saying, "The first time somebody gets shoved onto a subway track in
a scuffle over an iPod, all bets are off." Oh, is that all it'll take? What can we say? At the end of the day, maybe
statistically you'll be safer not wearing the signature white headphones, but we're more likely to encourage you to to
use something else just to keep the PR vultures from beaming about other peoples' gadgety misfortune.
