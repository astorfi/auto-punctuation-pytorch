The 85-inch plasma screen comes encased in a high-grade aluminum frame, and combines anti-reflection coating with automated image controls, to guarantee crystal clear, Full HD viewing at any time of day. B&O's first foray into the 3D/Full HD realm also features a BeoLab 10 central loudspeaker, which uses Acoustic Lens Technology to deliver consistently high-frequency sounds, regardless of where you're sitting in relation to the speaker. And, much like its 103-inch brethren, this 85-incher comes with a motorized stand, which automatically elevates and tilts the screen to ideal viewing position whenever the system is turned on. Once you've finished marveling at the BeoVision 4-85's robust design, you can turn it off and watch in awe, as the display magically lowers itself to "within inches" of the floor (where, incidentally, you'll also be able to find your jaw). No word yet on the price of this experience, but we're gonna go out on a limb and assume that it's pretty steep. The beast is set to be unleashed in Moscow tomorrow, but you can check out an appropriately slick car commercial video on the BeoVision 4 family, after the break.
