 
Lest you weren't glued to your television sets last night, our own Josh Topolsky raised quite a bit of mayhem on Jimmy Fallon's Late Night show. After doing the professional thing and showing off the minuscule Apple TV and Roku XDS media streamers, Josh proceeded to power up an AR.Drone quadricopter and fly it around the studio in a decidedly menacing fashion. For video of Jimmy's courageous reaction and the fallout from this robot invasion, jump past the break.

[Thanks, Sonny]
