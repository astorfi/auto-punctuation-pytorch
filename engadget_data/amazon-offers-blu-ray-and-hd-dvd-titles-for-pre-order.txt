Of the 60 or so titles listed, at the moment only "Chronos" actually shows anydetails calling for a drop date of 14 March at $22.49 in both BD and HD-DVD formats (hey, wasn't Blu-ray supposed tocost more?). And in case you’re wondering, the same title is available on straight-up DVD for $9.98 giving you anidea of what that hi-def fix is gonna cost ya. [Thanks, Eric]
