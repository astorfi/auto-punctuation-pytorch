Merely hours after Barnes & Noble came out swinging with a $149 WiFi-only version of its Nook and a price-reduced $199 3G Nook, along comes Amazon to rip a massive hole in B&N's billowing sails. As of this very moment, the $259 Kindle 2 -- complete with global 3G and the 6-ink E Ink display you've come to know and love (or hate) -- is now the $189 Kindle 2. Oh, and there's also free 2-day shipping. Looks like the undercutter just got undercut, huh?
