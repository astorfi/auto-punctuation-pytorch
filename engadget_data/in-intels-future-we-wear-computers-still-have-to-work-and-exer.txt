Thankfully Intel escaped the oh-so-tried Minority Report concepts and skipped straight to wrist-based computers and a myriad of OQO and iPhone look-alikes. Mostly it's just a ploy to promote Intel's upcoming McCaslin UMPC platform, which can do few of the actions depicted, but it's always fun to peep one manufacturer's vision of the future, no matter how unlikely or impractical its vision might be. Peep the video after the break.[Via GigaOM; thanks Dillon]
