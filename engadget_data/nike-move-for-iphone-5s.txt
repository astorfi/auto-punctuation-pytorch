While Apple was explaining the iPhone 5s' new M7 motion coprocessor, it mentioned a Nike+ Move tracking app that left us wondering about the FuelBand's fate -- is it redundant? In a word, no. Nike tells us that Move is simply an "introductory experience" that generates a Nike Fuel score based on day-to-day movements. Those serious about activity tracking will want to continue using a FuelBand or the Nike+ Running app, the company says. While that news may prove disappointing for some fitness gurus, we wouldn't be too worried at this stage -- there are likely to be at least a few apps that combine M7 support with advanced features.
