 If the rumor mill is to be believed, Intel's about to have a pretty busy January -- first delivering Penryn on the sixth, and then shipping the first dual-core Celeron processors alongside those long-rumored Yorkfield and Wolfdale chips on the 20th, according to Digitimes. The new Celeron E1000 will apparently run at 1.2GHz and sit on an 800MHz bus with 512K of cache. The report also lays out specs on the 45nm Yorkfield and Wolfdale chips that are pretty similar to what we'd already heard: quad-core QX9000-series Yorkfields at from 2.5 to 2.83GHZ, and Core 2 Duo E8000-series Wolfdales from 2.66 to 3.16GHz. Hmm, the 20th seems pretty close to a certain keynote, doesn't it?[Via TG Daily]
