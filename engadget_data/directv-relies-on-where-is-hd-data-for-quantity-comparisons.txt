In reality, there's no question that DTV currently holds the crown as the provider of the most HD in America, but given the pool of complaints from commenters about the accuracy of Where Is HD?, we're curious to know if the figure shown is just an average of zip codes sampled or something else. Overall, it's a petty matter -- after all, 55 HD channels on cable is a heck of a lot more than a huge chunk of cable users get today, so it's not like DirecTV is giving coax an unfair rub. Check the full spread below.[Thanks, Cody]
