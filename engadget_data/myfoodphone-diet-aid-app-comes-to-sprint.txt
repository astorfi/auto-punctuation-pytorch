 Dieting just got a little easier (or a little harder to cheat at, depending on how you look at it) for Sprintcustomers with cameraphones, thanks to the company's exclusive rollout of that MyFoodPhoneservice we first spotted nearly a year ago. Although the cost is much lower this time around -- only $10 per monthcompared to the pricey $150/month it once was -- the service works essentially the same as before, by providingcustomers with video feedback based on photos they snap and upload of each and every meal or snack they consume.Besides the bi-weekly vids from nutritional advisers, subscribers also have access to an online food journal, wherethey can log the all-important dieter's stats of weight lost, exercise performed, and calories burned. Sprint ispositioning MyFoodPhone as only one part of an overall health and fitness regimen where your Vision-enabled phone canbe of assistance, joining other services such as BIMActive exercise tracking, skynetMD medical info, and Hitech Trainerguided workouts.[Via picturephoning]
