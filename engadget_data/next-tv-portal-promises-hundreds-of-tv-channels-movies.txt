First and foremost, we're quite pleased to see that this portal is compliant with PCs and Macs, and it seems that this venture is seeking to be your one-stop shop to online entertainment. The service, which is currently shipping on select HP Pavilion laptops, is all set for a public launch in March, and will purportedly provide access to "over 100 free, ad-supported channels" including CBS, Hearst, HSN, TV Guide, Showtime, Endemol, Fremantle and National Lampoon. Additionally, folks will soon be able to rent or buy "high quality, ad-free versions" of many titles from studios such as Fox, Disney, Lionsgate, MGM, New Line Cinema, Paramount, etc. No word on what exactly will make up those "hundreds of hours of HD content" just yet, but you can certainly consider our interest piqued.
