That now includes Amazon in addition to Sony's own site, as well as Best Buy and Future Shop in Canada which are each listing a slightly later September 23rd availability date for the country (but the same $499 and $599 price tags). As expected, those interested in the smaller, dual-screened Tablet P instead still have a bit more waiting to do.
