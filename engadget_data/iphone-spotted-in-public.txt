The pic was snapped by Engadget pal Mark Trammell on the CalTrain -- which we know many an Apple employee uses to commute from SF to Cupertino. But with the hype this device has, we almost wouldn't put it past some San Francisco supergeek to cruise around with a faux iPhone just to raise some eyebrows boost his geek cred.[Via BGR]Update: We talked to Mark further -- it was definitely an iPhone, no chance of being a fake. He said its user was flipping through songs and playing back music on the device. Note to iPhone obsessives: ride the CalTrain more often.
