Well if researchers from the Emerging Art and Architecture Research Group, or RASTER, and Singapore's MixedReality Lab have anything to say about it, pet owners will soon be able to kick those old fashioned games to the curbin favor of video games that let their animals get in on the action. The group is in the midst of designing a gamecalled "Mice Arena", wherein the human player is pursued by an on-screen avatar controlled by a real worldhamster, which chases a piece of motorized bait corresponding to the human's position on the in-game map. What's more,the hamster's game space -- a specially designed tank -- actually adjusts its terrain to match the on-screen actionthrough a series of actuators underneath the floor. Future games from the collaborative -- and we'll leave the jokes toyou on this one -- will incorporate decidedly less pet-like animals in the fun, with tentative titles such as (we're notmaking this up): "Chicken Petman"Â  and "Jellyfishtrone."
