 Welcome to Engadget's Back to School guide! We know that this time of year can be pretty annoying and stressful for everyone, so we're here to help out with the heartbreaking process of gadget buying for the school-aged crowd. Today, we're settling down in front of a few of our favorite HDTVs, but you can head to the Back to School hub to see the rest of the product guides as they're added throughout the month. Be sure to keep checking back -- at the end of the series we'll be giving away a ton of the gear featured in our guides -- and hit up the hub page right here!  The bad news is that unless you chose your major very carefully, your assignments will not often include a directive to plop down in front of the TV for any large amount of time. The good news, however, is that you'll probably end up doing plenty of that anyway, so whether you're zoning out to some reality TV drama, enjoying an enlightening documentary, or playing video games in the dorm, you'll want a nice set to watch on. Jump past the break for our recommendations, and another opportunity to enter our back to school giveaway. Simply leave a comment below to be entered to win, and head over to our giveaway page for more details. 
 
 On the cheap Panasonic TC-L32C3

This slightly refreshed model still brings Vizio Internet Apps including Netflix and Amazon, WiFi, and LED backlighting -- for $30 less than last year. Good luck finding something wrong with that.

  Price: $228 from Amazon
     Sony NSX24GT1    Google TV's slow start is your gain, if you can  find one of these edge-lit LED HDTVs kicking around at clearance prices at your local store.

  Price: $299 from Best Buy
  Mid-range Vizio E3D320VX 
 Vizio has owned this price category in sales, and the new E3D line bumps its specs with Vizio Internet Apps and 3D playback.

  Price: $499 on Amazon
     LG 32LK450   Need a slim display to match your skinny jeans? This 32-incher is less than 3 inches deep and still cranks out a picture to match any of the other models on the shelf. Plus, at this price you can still afford a few Blu-ray discs to watch on it.

It commands a premium price but delivers premium features with a WiFi dongle, 3D and apps.  Deal pricing at local retailers like Fry's can make this one an even easier choice.

  Price: $1,419 on Amazon
     Samsung UN46D6400    Samsung also has some excellent plasma options available, but if you want to pack in the most features for your dollar -- LED, 120Hz, 3D, ultra thin bezel, 4 HDMI inputs and apps -- this one is in the sweet spot.
