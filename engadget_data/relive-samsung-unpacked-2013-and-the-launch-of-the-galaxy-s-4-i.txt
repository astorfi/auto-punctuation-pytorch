 Came in late and missed the live festivities as Samsung took the wraps off of its new Galaxy S 4? No problem -- thanks to its livestream on YouTube, you can check out the unedited video stream right now in full, or just skip to your (least) favorite parts. There was a tapdancing kid, a host from a TV show you probably don't watch and a dancing group of bridesmaids. No, seriously, that happened. There was also a new phone, so check out our event hub if you want to get straight to the details, or strap in and experience it all in video form, embedded after the break. 

 Update: Samsung has posted the edited video on YouTube, so now you can just press play.
