Coming from their DVD International division, the most high profile release is the high definition edition of Joe Kane's Digital Video Essentials calibration disc. DVE HD will include 720p and 1080p-encoded versions on the HD DVD side, various test patterns for all manner of A/V setups, and is "HDi capable" -- hopefully this means the menus are easier to navigate, some complained about that on the DVD release (included on the flip side). The seven HDScape discs? Your basic travelogue fare, Exotic Saltwater Aquarium HD DVD, Fireplace HD DVD, Antarctica Dreaming, Visions of Sea: Explorations, Serenity: Southern Seas, HD Window: Hawaii, HD Window: The Great Southwest provide what we're sure are crystal clear looks at various landscapes if you're not already bored to death by them on INHD2 into that type of thing. DVE HD will retail for $34.95, while the HDScape discs will all go for $29.95. A sampler (pictured) is currently on sale at the website for free plus $3.95 shipping.
