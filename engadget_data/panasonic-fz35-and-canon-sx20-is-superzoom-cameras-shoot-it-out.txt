Both the Panasonic FZ35 and Canon SX20 IS were singled out for boffo kudos (that's right -- boffo kudos). Apparently they're "the most refined models in this test," with lenses deemed "sharp across the zoom range," and kickass quality images and HD video. Of course, each of these bad boys has its own character, with the Canon feeling more like an entry-level DSLR to the reviewer, even with "by far the best viewfinder in this test." Panny's entry, on the other hand, gets points for portability and an intuitive user interface. Besides those two guys, there are a half dozen or so other cameras in the test. How did your favorite hold up? Hit the source link to check it out for your own self.
