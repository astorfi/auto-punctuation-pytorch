 If you were worried that you might have to wait until Mobile World Congress to learn whether or not a 5.5-inch version of the Optimus G Pro was real, your mind can rest at ease. While hoping to drum up buzz for a launch beyond Japan, the company has ever-so-casually mentioned that at least the South Korean edition of the G Pro has a 5.5-inch, full HD screen -- half an inch larger than the Japanese model, and just as large as the panel on the Galaxy Note II. Want to know more? That's part of the promo. Borrowing a page from Sony, LG promises to reveal more of the phone the more Facebook Likes it receives. While previous tips suggest that the 5.5-inch edition will mostly be a larger take on an already supersized device, it's still very tempting to click that Like button -- just don't expect one of the mentioned prizes if you live beyond LG's native borders.
