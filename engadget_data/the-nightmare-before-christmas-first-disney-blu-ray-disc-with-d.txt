If whispers prove accurate, Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Collector's Edition will be Disney's first film released with Digital Copy, which the studio will of course rechristen Disneyfile. As of now, there's no word on what types of devices will be able to play back the copy, but we are told to expect quite a few extras / featurettes with the movie. You'll need to save up quite a few pennies to throw this one on your shelf -- the Blu-ray edition will retail for $39.99, while the two-disc DVD set rings up at $32.99.[Via TheManRoom, image courtesy of KensForce]
