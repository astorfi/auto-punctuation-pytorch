Ok, so you're finally going to be able to get a Cinema Display that matches the brushed aluminum of your G5
PowerMac: a friendly anonymous tipster sent us what are supposed to be (and yes, they could be/are probably fake)
photos of the new aluminum Cinema Display LCD that Apple is said to be introducing at their Worldwide Developers
Conference next month. We don't have an exact screen size for the line (it looks like a 30-incher), just that'll have
better resolution and consume less power than previous models.
