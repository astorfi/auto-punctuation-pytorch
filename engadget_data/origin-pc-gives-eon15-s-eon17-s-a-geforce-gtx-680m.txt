Springing for the upgrade gives them a more miserly, 28-nanometer Kepler-based graphics engine that will no doubt be a bit gentler on battery life and heat than the GTX 675M of old. While it's not shedding full light on NVIDIA's technology, Origin PC's adaptation is known to stuff in a whopping 4GB of video memory as well as 1,344 CUDA (graphics and general-purpose processing) cores, or more than many desktop-level graphics cards. The company hasn't initially said how much it costs to equip NVIDIA's latest, though the previous $197 upgrade to a 675M might just be a clue as to how much of a premium you'll need to pay for a speed lift in Max Payne 3.
