We'd like to take a brief moment to name check Kaws, Dalek, Takashi Murakami, Yoshitomo Nara, and the rest before
proceeding to discuss the Mimoco's Mimobots. There, thank you. So, the Mimobots are USB flash drives designed by Yahid
Rodriguez which come in sizes ranging between 256MB and 1GB, and are preloaded with a DJ DB mix to get you kicked off.
Sold at Giant Robot shops in a major metropolis near you (LA, SF, or NY, anyway).
