The Big Four (that'd be Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile and AT&T) have all confirmed that they'll be stocking Samsung's newly-introduced Galaxy Gear and Galaxy Note 3, but none of 'em have been bold enough as to give us two precious details: pricing and availability. We're still waiting for the damage, but VZW has come forward and alerted its customers that pre-orders will open up on September 6th. Given that the Note 3 just sailed through the FCC (and that the Gear is due to land in October), we're guessing that you'll have to wait anywhere from one to eight weeks for shipment. We'll keep you posted if we hear anything more concrete.
