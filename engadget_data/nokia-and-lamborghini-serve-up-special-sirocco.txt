The high-end 8800 was recently reworked and re-released as the Sirocco Edition; the Lambo variant adds the aforementioned crest etched on its front, "automobili Lamborghini" and the handset's serial number on the posterior, along with the expected selection of exotic Italian wallpapers, screensavers, ringtones, and a "short documentary video by Lamborghini." No word on pricing or availability, but with only 500 in the pipeline, it might not even be worth trying to find one unless you've got a Gallardo parked in your driveway.[Thanks, James]
