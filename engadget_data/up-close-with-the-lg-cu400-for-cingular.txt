Well, turns out it's real -- and as the model number implies, it looks like it'll slot in right under the CU500 in Cingular and LG's 3G lineup. Granted, most of what we know about the clamshell is hearsay at this point, but we think it's safe to say that the monochrome external display and stub antenna foretell a lower-end 3G offering. As long as Bluetooth is in the box, we'll keep our complaints to a minimum. According to our sources, look for the CU400 to drop before the year's out (and possibly by the end of November) for $50 or less on contract.
