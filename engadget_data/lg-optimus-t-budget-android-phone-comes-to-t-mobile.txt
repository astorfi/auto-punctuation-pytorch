In that regard, T-Mobile's Optimus T is a bit of an anti-myTouch -- a relatively low-end Android smartphone fit for the masses with a 3.2-inch HVGA display (touted as being fashioned of tempered glass), a 3 megapixel cam with video capture, Froyo, and Swype pre-installed. As you can see from the press shot up there, the UI isn't quite stock -- but happily, it doesn't look like LG has done anything too egregious to muck it up. We don't have a price yet, but needless to say, we're sure it'll be reasonable... and it'll be ready in time for the holiday season. Follow the break for a picture of the burgundy version.
