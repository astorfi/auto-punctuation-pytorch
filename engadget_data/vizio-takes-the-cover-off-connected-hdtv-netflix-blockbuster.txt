Widgets, Flash, Blockbuster OnDemand (!), Flickr, Pandora, Rhapsody and Accedo Broadband. Due Fall 2009, owners can feel free to go wired or 802.11n style to connect to any of these services in HD, if supported. Clearly missing? Yahoo!, Media Center Extender, but the 2H 2009 fight of Internet-ready televisions is on - set-top boxes better watch their back.
