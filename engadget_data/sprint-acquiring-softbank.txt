 Sprint's situation continues to get even more complicated, as it's being reported by CNBC that the Now Network is currently in "active negotiations" to acquire the remaining half of Clearwire, just two months after it took 51 percent stake in the company and had 70 percent of its own entity acquired by Softbank. That said, there is no guarantee that this particular buyout will occur, as the deal will have to get the Japanese carrier's blessing before proceeding. According to the all-knowing "people familiar with the matter," Sprint's vision in fully acquiring the company is to add Clearwire's spectrum to its own. It aims to close the deal around the same time the Softbank deal is finalized, which both companies are hoping will take place in March or April.
