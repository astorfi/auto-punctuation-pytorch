  Iran has restricted access to the internet for years now, but it seems the land of Persia is clamping down even further on its citizens' ability to surf the web as they wish. Bloomberg has confirmed with Google that Iranians haven't had access to Google's encrypted search, YouTube and Gmail since February 10th. Iran's Mehr news agency has reported restrictions on other email services, including Hotmail, plus increased difficulties getting to domestic and news websites as well. 30 million folks, give or take, are currently locked out of their email, and there's no indication when, or if, access will be granted again.
