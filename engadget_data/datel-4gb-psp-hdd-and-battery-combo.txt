Datel Design & Development—the creator of the X2 replacement battery for the
PSP—is combining a 4GB HDD with their X2 battery to
get around the current 2GB storage limit of the
Memory Stick Pro Duo. A
cable connects the drive to your PSP through the Memory Stick slot and you're up and running; which means a lot less
mess than a totally external drive. You'll be paying about the cost of your PSP for all this storage convenience,
though, at £139 ($248). Should be available October 20th.
