Rival software developers (including open-source) can now access and use Microsoft interoperability information 
Royalties for this information will be reduced to a one-off payment of â‚¬10,000 / $14,000 
Royalties for a world-wide license to use Microsoft's product and patents will be reduced from 5.95% to just 0.4%

While Microsoft can technically still appeal the September ruling on the original 2004 decision, it certainly looks like this dog has been beaten into obedient, doe-eyed submission.
