That's right; silent, durable, lickity-quick SSD making this the world's lightest 12.1-inch laptop at just 1.89-pounds. Hell, it even extends the standard 6-hour battery an additional 30 minutes or 12.5-hours off its fat, extended-use cousin. Of course, the SSD will cost ya: a Â¥65,000 (about $545) price premium over the staid, 40GB hard disk option. But damn, it's tempting.[Via Impress]
