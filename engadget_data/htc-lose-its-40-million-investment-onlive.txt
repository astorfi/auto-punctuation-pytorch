OnLive began streaming its gaming selection to Android smartphones and tablets at the end of the same year but we never saw any exclusive features for HTC hardware. Following some tough financial results, it packed up its Korean office and recently returned half its stake in Beats, although its involvement with OnLive had never resulted in the same degree of publicity.
