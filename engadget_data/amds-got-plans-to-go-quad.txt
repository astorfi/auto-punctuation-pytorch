We know Apple just annoucned they're going Intel, but
AMD would just like you to know that by the time Apple's moved over to x86 in 2007, they're planning on having
quad-core CPUs on the marketâ€”and we ain't just talking dual-core Hyperthreaded devices. Later plans include scalability
to up to 32 processors in their devices, but since most applications still aren't multi-threaded and won't take
advantage of such systems, we're hoping they've got some tricks in their bag for making faster really mean
faster.
