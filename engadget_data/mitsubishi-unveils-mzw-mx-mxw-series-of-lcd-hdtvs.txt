The higher-end MZW series includes the 46-inch LCD-46MZW200 (짜400,000; $3,643) and 40-inch LCD-40MZW200 (짜300,000; $2,732), both of which pack a 1080p 10-bit Diamond panel, 120Hz technology and an October 21st release date. For those with tighter spaces (and smaller budgets), the MX / MXW series spans from 19- (짜100,000; $910) to 42-inches (짜280,000; $2,550), with the most expensive sets offering a Full HD display and the lesser ones topping out at 1,366 x 768. Oh, and it looks as if Funai won't be the only one delivering a Blu-ray / LCD combo, as Mitsu's already working up a concept.
