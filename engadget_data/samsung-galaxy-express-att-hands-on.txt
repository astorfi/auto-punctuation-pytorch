 
 Samsung's Galaxy Express got a bit of a short shrift last month, revealed alongside a slew of other Samsung AT&T 4G LTE phones and not getting its own day in the sun. Here we are at AT&T's New York City event, providing that sun (albeit on a rainy evening). The 4.5-inch Super AMOLED Plus screen looks great, even running the aging Ice Cream Sandwich version of Android, and the 1.5 GHz dual-core processor is no slouch at speedily navigating the OS. The rear and front cameras leave a bit to be desired, with just 5-megapixels out back and 1.3 up front, but let's be honest -- you're not exactly looking for a top of the line camera in a Galaxy Express, are you? It'll be launching later this year on AT&T, though pricing and an exact release date have yet to be confirmed. Follow us past the break for a quick video of the device, won't you?
