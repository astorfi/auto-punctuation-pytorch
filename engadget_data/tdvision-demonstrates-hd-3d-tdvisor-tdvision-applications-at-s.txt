Both the visor and a "complete suite of TDVision applications including the stereoscopic virtual world, the AlterSpace, Dejaview and the 3D media player" will be showcased, and even more interesting will be the demo "of the 2D and MPEG-compatible TDVCodec running on a Blu-ray Disc." If you'll recall, the TDVCodec (a stereoscopic 3D format) was designed to be backwards compatible with 2D systems, and it's suggesting that the same BD flick can carry the traditional 2D imagery as well as 3D scenes thanks to its technology. Now, all that's left to do is wait and see how fantastic the results really are (or aren't).
