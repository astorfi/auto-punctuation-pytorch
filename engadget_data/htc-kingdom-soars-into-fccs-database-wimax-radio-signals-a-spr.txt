Now, however, HTC's going to have an awfully difficult time denying the existence of its so-called Kingdom, known to the FCC as PH44100. The filing itself doesn't reveal a whole heck of a lot beyond what we already knew -- a 4.3-inch qHD display, namely -- but the presence of both a CDMA and WiMAX radio assures us that it'll be heading for Sprint sooner rather than later. A qHD contender for The Now Network? Yes, please.
