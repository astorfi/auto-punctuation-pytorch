What looks at first like a Droid 4 with the edges rounded off instead looks to be a completely new creation that has the same buttonless front face plus Android 4.0 combo as the rumored Droid RAZR HD. Other than a Sprint Music app icon giving away the phone's ultimate destination, though, we know little else about what the design will entail. It's logical to imagine Sprint wanting LTE and at least a qHD (540 x 960) screen, however. The tipster didn't give a clue as to when Motorola's device would officially join the ranks -- not to mention any device names -- but we'd say that the lack of any QWERTY phone on the soon-to-launch Sprint LTE network might serve as a strong incentive for both the carrier and Motorola to get cracking.
