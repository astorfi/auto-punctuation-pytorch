We're reserving judgment on this one big time, but apparently BT Laboratories analyst Ian Pearson believes flexible
plastic electronics can (and should) be made to sit inside breast implants. About it the pragmatic Mr. Pearson says,
"It is now very hard for me to thing [sic] of breast implants as just decorative. If a woman has something implanted
permanently, it might as well do something useful," like play audio over A2DP Bluetooth for instance, or monitor heart
palpitations, blood pressure, diabetes, or breast cancer. We'll hereby defer to our female readership on this oneâ€”no
comments from the peanut gallery!
