It still costs $300, and with a good number of laptops retailing for that price these days, it's certainly hard to justify, but forget all that... who on earth thought this packaging was a good idea? It kind of looks like a dumbbell, but not. We're really at a loss for words here. It's almost like ESPN wants to fail.
