Last week's ICDL 2007 had LG.Philips demonstrating their 47-, 26-, 15.4-, 12.1-, 8-, and 7-inch LED backlit LCD panels. The big daddy 47-inch panel appears to be the guts of the LG HDTV we heard rumors about. And just like we heard, this panel brings a Full HD 1920 x 1080 resolution and a "Mega CS" 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio for truly black, black-levels obtained though a process of local dimming. It's listed with a 500cd/m2 brightness, 178-degree viewing angle, 8-ms response, and 1.07 billion colors covering 105% of the NTSC color gamut. No word on release so we'll have to cling to the original "as early as Q2" hearsay for now. Meanwhile, the 26-inch panel brings a 1366 x 728 pixel resolution, 540cd/m2 brightness, 18,000:1 contrast ratio, 178-degree viewing angle, and covers a hot 136% of the NTSC color gamut. The 15.4-inch and 12.1-inch LED-backlit LCDs are destined for laptops. The 15.4-inch panel matches the equivalent LED-backlit Samsung panel spec-for-spec only it comes in a bit dimmer at 300cd/m2 vs. Sammy's 330cd/m2. The 12.1-inch panel measures just 3.15-mm thin yet packs a respectable 1280 x 800 resolution, 400:1 contrast, 250cd/m2 brightness, and 16-ms response. The 20-mm thick 7-inch panel and 16-mm thick 8-inch panel are destined for navigation devices offering both a wide temperature range of operation and high-brightness. Great, nice to see LG, now please get that 47-incher onto the shelves with your 120Hz TrueMotion technology mkay? Oh, and less than $2k... pretty please, with sugar?Read -- 47-inch Read -- 26-inch Read -- 15.4-inch Read -- 12.1-inch Read -- 8-inch Read -- 7-inch
