While there's not a whole lot to help it stand out from other similar devices, it looks like should get the job done well enough, with a promised 60 foot range and data transfer speeds of up to 70 Mbps, along with four USB 2.0 ports to accommodate your various peripherals. As with other wireless USB devices, however, the pleasure of operating your gadgets from across the room doesn't come cheap, with Gefen currently asking $399 to take your order, although it still isn't giving any indication as to when it'll actually ship.Read - Gefen product pageRead - FCC documents
