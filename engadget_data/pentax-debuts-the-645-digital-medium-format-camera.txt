Pentax is joining the small-but-growing number of camera-makers who produce
medium-format digitals, with the rollout of their 645
Digital at the Photo Imaging Expo in Tokyo. The camera boasts a new Kodak CCD that captures a whopping 18.6 megapixels.
No word on pricing yet, but as with other cameras in this class, if you have to ask, you should just forget about it
right now.
