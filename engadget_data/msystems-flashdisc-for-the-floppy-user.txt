 It's news tous, but apparently there's an untapped market of people out there who want a USB flash drive, but don't want it to beespecially capacious -- or as msystems claims, they just want something with "storage density higher than floppydiskettes." msystems believes these people are apparently happy to rock 16 or 32MB; we're not entirely sure whatthey'd be doing with such limited amounts of memory (or why they wouldn't just lay down a couple of bucks more for acheapie 64 / 128 / 256MB flash drive), but we definitely know marketing snake oil when we see it, and the FlashDisc,sir, is not "an exciting new category poised to radically transform the way people share their data." TheFlashDisc is just a flash drive -- but relatively small, and presumably pretty cheap -- so you guys can stop talkingdown to consumers, because unless you're pricing this thing at the present cost of a floppy disc (about $0.25) you'reabout five or six years too late to be posing a flash drive as their alternative.[Via GizMag]Update: So according to anmsystems rep, these things will come in packs of three (hence the image) for $20. Cost for 640MB CD-R: less than $1.
