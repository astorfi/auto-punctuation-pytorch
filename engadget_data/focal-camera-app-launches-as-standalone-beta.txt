Not everyone is happy with Cyanogen as a company. Guillaume Lesniak, the creator of CyanogenMod's Focal camera app, doesn't like that licensing changes accompanying the new venture would limit his control. Accordingly, he has just removed Focal from CyanogenMod and launched it as a standalone beta. The app includes all the features from its ROM days, including burst shooting, a panorama mode and an equivalent to Google's Photo Sphere. While the release is a mild inconvenience for CyanogenMod users, it's ultimately a win for anyone who wants to try Focal -- they can now give the app a spin regardless of the firmware they use. If you're curious, you can download Focal through Google Play.
