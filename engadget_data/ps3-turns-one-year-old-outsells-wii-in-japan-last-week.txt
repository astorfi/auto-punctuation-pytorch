What's more, it seems that the PS3 actually beat the Wii by a fairly wide margin, selling 55,924 units in the week ending November 11th, as opposed to just 34,546 for the Wii. Of course, those numbers could also have a little something to do with the Wii's short supply, but we don't expect that little detail will put much of a damper on Sony's enthusiasm.Read - Sony Computer Entertainment America Celebrates First Birthday of Playstation 3Read - Joystiq, "PS3 outsold Wii in Japan last week"
