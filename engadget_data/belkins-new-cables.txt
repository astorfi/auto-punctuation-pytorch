 Belkin has a new line of "cables" coming out called RazorVision. They utilize a microprocessor to improve the picture quality. I
have to confess that I had major doubts that these will do anything for
the picture. But the more I read about these and consider Belkin
is making them, the more I am intrigued in them. I am going to try to
get a set of these for testing and post a review because they seem like
they would work. To prove that they are doing something there is a
button that switches on a split screen demo for a visual inspection of
your expensive cables.Wait to pass your judgment till you see
a review. We will try to a review posted as soon as possible, but if
you happen to see that someone beat us to the punch, drop us a tip so
we can take a look at it.Read [via Smarthouse]
