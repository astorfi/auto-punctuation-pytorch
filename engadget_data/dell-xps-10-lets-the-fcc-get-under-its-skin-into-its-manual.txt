 We already got a pretty good look at the Dell XPS 10's outward facade, but if it's internal hardware you're after, you may want to take a look at the FCC's latest: they tore the transforming tablet apart. The federal teardown is garnished with the standard trappings: FCC labels, frequency tests and Dell attestations -- one of which notes the WiFi and Bluetooth radios' shared antenna and its inability to simultaneously transmit both signals. The XPS 10's manual is available for browsing, too, in case you need a refresher on how to pinch, zoom or swipe. Check it for yourself at the FCC, or just pop on down to the attached gallery for a gander at the device's innards.
