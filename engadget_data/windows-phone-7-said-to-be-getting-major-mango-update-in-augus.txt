According to her sources, the update is codenamed "Mango," and it will effectively amount to Windows Phone 7.5, which she says might even be the actual name when it's released. That update will apparently bring Silverlight runtime and HTML5 support to the OS, along with Far Eastern language support, and some other unspecified features and functionality. It will also presumably be the most significant update until Windows Phone 8, which Foley says is codenamed "Apollo," and is on track for a release in late 2012.
