 It was only a matter of time before the iPhone 5 was freed from its rigid, stock iOS constraints, and months after first seeing the handset be liberated, any and all users can now do the same. That's right, folks, the evasi0n untethered jailbreak for iOS 6.0 and 6.1 is now just a download away at the source link below. To accomplish the task, you need only have a computer running Windows XP and up, Mac OS X 10.5 and up, or your favorite flavor of Linux x86 / x86_64. Of course, before you go hacking your hardware, it's advisable to back up your data -- and to check out evasi0n's FAQ first, so you know what you're getting into. After that, you're mere clicks away from total iPhone freedom. Enjoy.
