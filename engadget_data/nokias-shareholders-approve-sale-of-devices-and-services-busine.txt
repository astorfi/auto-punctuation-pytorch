As expected, the sale of Nokia's devices and services business to Microsoft has been given the stamp of approval from the Finnish handset maker's shareholders. The group met this morning in Helsinki to give its official vote of confidence on the $7.35 billion transaction includes not only devices, but also Nokia's mapping service too. It remains to be seen if CEO Stephen Elop will be tasked with the same job at Microsoft after Ballmer's departure, or if the company will decide to take another road toward its future.
