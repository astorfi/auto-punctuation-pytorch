 XM Radio, after
scrapping their XM PC Receiver because of piracy
concerns, is launching their an online service next month. They're gonna charge $7.99 a month for unlimited listening
(we assume one PC at a time), but if you already subscribe to XM they'll give you a discounted rate of $3.99 per.
Buying a Dell computer next month will get you a free trial subscription to XM Radio Online. Getting satellite radio
over the Internet does sorta eliminate one of its main appeals (that, um, you get it by satellite), but we definitely
dig the whole commercial-free radio thing.
