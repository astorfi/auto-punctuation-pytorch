Advertisers will be able to share browser-related details with Twitter, which can then match it to a specific user. Such information could include where they're browsing from, as well as the sites they visit, aiming to offer "highly relevant" ads, according to the social network's official blog. Twitter is quick to mention that if you want to opt out of its highly-targeted ads, you just need to uncheck the promoted content box within your privacy settings. It also reiterates its support of Do Not Track, and says that it will not receive any cookie IDs if you already have DNT enabled in your browser.
