 Oh, Sony, how you tease us so: first you (maybe) confirmed a PS3-related announcement on the 12th, and then we got wind of that lower-priced 40GB model, and now you just up and take it all away. That's right, Sony Europe has officially denied that any announcement -- let along a "Big Bang" -- is taking place on the 12th, thus dashing our hopes of blowing $399 the good way. We're still pretty convinced a 40GB SKU is coming -- the circumstantial evidence is just too strong -- but it looks like we'll be waiting a little bit longer than we thought.[Via Joystiq and PS3 Fanboy]
