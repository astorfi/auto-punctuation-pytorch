Back in April, Plastic Logic told those who pre-ordered its QUE proReader that they'd have to wait until June 24 -- after already having been delayed to April. Now that device is being delayed again, and while the company has wizened up and not actually given a new estimated date this time, it also took the unfortunate and ominous move of canceling all pre-orders. In the e-mail sent to those affected (which is after the break) the company says it has "decided that delaying the device a bit longer will result in a better product for you." Hopefully it results in a cheaper product, too, as we're not sure how a $800 reader is going to fare in a world where both the Kindle and nook are available for less than $200.
