 Anyone keeping a pulse on the S60 scene knows that for Nokia's complex little pieces of smartphone machinery, firmware updates tend to come fast and furious. Normally, getting in on the updates requires a trip to your friendly local service center -- or, for the 95 percent of us outside driving distance, saying goodbye to your mobile buddy for a couple days. Over-the-air firmware updates (FOTA) are all well and good, but manufacturers and carriers have been a little slow on the uptake, and even plain ol' PC-delivered upgrades are oddly difficult for the average user to come by. Thankfully, it looks like Nokia's started to roll out user-initiated updates for reals with the N70, N72, 6131, 6630, 6680, 6681, and 6682 all currently supported; more promised in the not-too-distant future. Only 6131 users can opt for FOTA right now -- the remainder require a PC and cable -- but we're guessing we won't be hearing many complaints from Nseries owners now happily humming along on the latest cuts.[Via MobileBurn]
