 As news continues to pour forth from CEDIA 2006, Sharp has confirmed their 42-inch 1080p Aquos LCD will be hitting the US in October. Previously announced in Japan, the 52- and 46-inch models were already announced for the US, and their 42-inch 8G brother does not disappoint. The Sharp LC-42D62U carries an MSRP of just $2,499, has a native contrast ratio of 1,200:1 (6,000:1 dynamic), 450 nits brightness, 6ms response time and the same piano black cabinet with recessed bottom-mounted speakers of the larger Aquos LCDs. The specs don't quite match up to the 4ms response time and 2000:1 contrast ratio of the two larger models but the price reflects that. This time last year we were drooling over a 45-inch 1080p Aquos HDTV with lesser specs for around $4,500, but we're not looking back to that dark, hellish time. The 52-inch is pictured here, but it should look the same.UPDATE: Fresh pic of the 42-inch LCD right from the floor of CEDIA
