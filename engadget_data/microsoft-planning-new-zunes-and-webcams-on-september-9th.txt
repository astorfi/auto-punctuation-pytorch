Sadly, the new mice might still be the most exciting things on the ticket -- the LifeCam VX-5500 and LifeCam Show NX-8000 are pretty much just webcams, and we're not expecting anything Zune hardware-related beyond bumps to 120GB and 16GB and perhaps that blue flash number. Still, there's a chance we could be surprised by those rumored new software and service announcements, but Microsoft's going to have to reach deep into the wow box to steal attention from a certain black-turtlenecked raconteur who'll be taking the stage in Cupertino to announce some minor new PMPs that day as well. Let the games begin!
