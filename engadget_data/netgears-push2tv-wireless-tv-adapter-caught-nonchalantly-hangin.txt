Looks like Netgear's Push2TV wireless TV adapter is already on the shelves of at least one Best Buy, right in front of a $99 price tag that matches the press release from before. The back of the box photo, seen after the break, doesn't shed any new light on the device. Unless you're really into (near term) future proofing of your wireless display needs, it might be best to wait for a few more options when it comes to fancy-schmancy new compatible machines.
