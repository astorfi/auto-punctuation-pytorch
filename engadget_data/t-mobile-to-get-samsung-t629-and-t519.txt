       We hate to spoil T-Mobile's fun and all, but it looks like the FCC's once again spilled the beans on some unreleased devices. This time it's Samsung's quad-band GSM EDGE-enabled T629 slim slider, and the rather lovable T519; both will likely have MicroSD and 70 / 80MB of internal memory respectively. There's not telling when they'll actually get launched, but we all know it's not too long after devices pass FCC muster.
