 ASUS may have confused some of us with its similar-sounding Windows hardware range and it's showing no signs of stopping. It just announced that the Vivo Tab Smart (now the Vivo Tab ME400 to UK readers) will arrive in the British Isles on January 31st, priced at £399. The 10-inch tablet will be running the full Windows 8 experience on a dual-core 1.8GHz Atom processor, with the rest of the specs also tallying with the US-bound iteration we got to play with earlier this month. It'll be available from both Argos and Carphone Warehouse and although there's no word yet on pricing for the optional (and slightly familiar) cover-stand yet, we'll update you when we hear more.
 Update: ASUS has been in touch, pricing up the cover at £39.99, while the cover with keyboard will ring in at £89.99.
