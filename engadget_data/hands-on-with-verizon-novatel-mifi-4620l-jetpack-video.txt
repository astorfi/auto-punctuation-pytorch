At about the same size and thickness as previous endeavors, the quad-band 4G LTE unit boasts a gimmicky OLED display that apparently makes interfacing with the unit easier. We weren't convinced, but we did like its removable 1500mAh battery, which can be swapped for a more potent (but not included) 3000mAh unit. Its final party trick is the ability to relay location coordinates over WiFi to up to 10 devices (like say a tablet) that support GPS streaming. We couldn't get the Novatel rep on hand to confirm pricing or availability, but we got the sense this little guy will ship soon.
