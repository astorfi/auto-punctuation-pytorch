 Asus is wondering back into the wilderness that is the portable GPS market with the R600, but we'll admit, it certainly did a fair job differentiating this one from all of the middle-of-the-road alternatives. For starters, you'll find a 4.3-inch WQVGA touchscreen, Samsung 400MHz processor, 128MB of Flash ROM, 64MB of SDRAM, a SIRFstarIII chipset, SD expansion slot for up to 4GB of additional media, a rechargeable battery good for six hours or so, optional TMC module, a multimedia player, and handsfree calling via Bluetooth 2.0 for good measure. Additionally, it features an auto light sensor which automatically adjusts the LCD backlight when the time comes to make viewing the screen a bit more pleasurable. Unfortunately, mum's the word on pricing and availability at the moment.[Via FarEastGizmos]
