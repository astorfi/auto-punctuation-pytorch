There's now some pretty strong evidence suggesting that might not be the case, however, with none other than Intel letting slip that the Slider would actually pack its brand new Atom Z670 processor instead of NVIDIA's silicon. That evidence you see above cropped up on Intel's press page following its announcement for the new Atom processor, although it's since been removed -- suggesting that it was either a colossal mistake or, more likely, a reveal that was a bit too premature for ASUS' liking.

Update: We've yet to receive any confirmation ourselves, but Tweakers.net says it has confirmed that ASUS will indeed be producing an Eee Pad Slider that has an Atom Z670 processor and runs Windows 7 -- apparently in addition to the Android-based Tegra 2 model.
