 The feds are done debating and are all prepped to introduce RFID e-passports readable up to 20 feet away to US citizens who frequently travel to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean in either April or May of 2008. The new passports should allow traveler info to be read as they're shuffling up to the border agent, who can verify their info and wave them along with little delay. Privacy advocates are obviously concerned about people capturing data or cloning the passports, but you can always "accidentally" destroy your RFID chip if that's enough of an issue for you -- the rest of us welcome our benevolent Big Brother with bellyfeel![Via Slashdot]
