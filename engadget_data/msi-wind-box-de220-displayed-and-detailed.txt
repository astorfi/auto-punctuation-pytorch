 In all the CES madness, we somehow missed MSI's previously-teased Wind Box DE220. Fortunately, Liliputing didn't; the site's just now putting up impressions and along with it some specs of the novel-sized nettop. It's packing Pinetrail for starters, in the form of a single-core Atom D410 or dual-core D510. Also included are an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4330, up to 1TB HDD / 4GB memory, 802.11b/g/n, and Windows 7 home premium. Mum's the word on price or release date, but from what we've seen, you can at least start decorating around its known color options: blue, red, and black.
