Sure enough, Gizmodo has scored an alleged shot of said phone, showing Froyo (Android 2.2.1, to be specific) along with a front-facing camera and a model number of SCH-i520; it's said to feature TouchWiz (as most non-Nexus S Android phones from Samsung tend to do) and, fortunately, lacks the Bing integration that Verizon's been pushing on its low- and midrange smartphones lately. Given the company's iffy track record on getting Froyo deployed in a timely manner to the Galaxy S line, we're not sure how we'd feel about buying a new Froyo model when Gingerbread's now available -- especially with all these other LTE models that Verizon's going to have on top -- but options are good, we suppose.
