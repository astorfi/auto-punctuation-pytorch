Yeah, well we get the impression that the first week in December will be the go-live date for a smattering of new units. Just hours after hearing that Samsung's BD-P2500 and BD-P2550 Blu-ray decks would be receiving a free update to enable high-def Netflix support, along comes a strikingly similar release from LG tipping us off on a strikingly similar update for its BD300. Said BD player, which has supported Watch Instantly from day one, will also support HD streaming after a gratis firmware upgrade in "early December." Mmm, we definitely like where this is headed.
