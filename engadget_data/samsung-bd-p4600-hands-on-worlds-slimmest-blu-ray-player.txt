Also like its ToC muse, it seems to have a knack for catching and showing off dust particles. We didn't see the touch controls on top of the unit, and we weren't allowed to pull it out and get a clear shot of the ports, but did manage to snap a image of the disc loader on the right side of the unit. Still no word on pricing, so keep guessing.
