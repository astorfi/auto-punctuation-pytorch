 In yet another gimmicky attempt to revitalize sagging boxoffice sales, NTT Communications Corp will be installing fragrance-releasing equipment (think:giant Glade Plug-Ins) in several Japanese theaters that mixes different herbs and oils to create aromas that supposedlyenhance key on-screen plot elements. According to Kyodo News, NTT "will use the Internet" to synchronize thescent generators -- which are located under what we assume to be more-pricey "aroma premium seats" -- duringseven scenes of the multi-theater April 22nd premier. Colin Farrell lovers will be pleased to learn that the firstmovie to get this 21st century "Smell-O-Vision" treatment is the actor's 2005 film, 'The New World,"whose tale of love between Pilgrims and Native Americans will no doubt result in a heavy odor of turkey, stuffing, andpumpkin pie lingering in the theaters for weeks.
