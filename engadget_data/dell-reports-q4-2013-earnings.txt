 Dell hasn't had good news to share during its quarterly earnings reports in quite sometime. And on the eve of it going private, things don't appear to be on the verge of changing. The fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2013 saw the company rake in revenues totaling $14.3 billion, which is up slightly from Q3, but down 11 percent from the same period last year. The story gets even worse when looking at profit. A net income of $530 million represented a 31 percent drop year-over-year. Again, not nearly as bad as last quarter, but still a stunningly steep drop off for a manufacturer that was once at the pinnacle of the industry. The crash is particularly stunning when you look at the consumer division, which was once Dell's bread-and-butter.

 Revenue there was down 24 percent year-over-year and operating income has dropped by a staggering 87 percent. In fact, almost every division within Dell has seen its revenue and income drop, with the exception of servers and networking, which enjoyed an 18 percent growth from Q4 of 2012, pulling in just over $2.6 billion. As we've said before, though, the few enterprise-related bright spots are likely not enough to hold off the company's continued slide. Lets just hope that loan from Microsoft is put to good use. Check out the full financial monty after the break.

   Segment Realignment:

   In the first quarter of Fiscal 2013, Dell made certain segment realignments in order to conform to the way Dell internally manages segment performance. These realignments affected all of Dell's operating segments, but primarily consisted of the transfer of small office business customers from the Small and Medium Business segment to the Consumer Segment. Dell has recast prior period amounts to provide visibility and comparability. None of these changes impacts Dell's previously reported consolidated net revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, or earnings per share.

   Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

   This press release includes information about non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP earnings per share (collectively with non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating expenses, the "non-GAAP financial measures"), which are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In the following tables, Dell has provided a reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure under the heading "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures." Dell encourages investors to review the reconciliation in conjunction with Dell's presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures.

   SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

   The following tables include information about non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP earnings per share (collectively, the "non-GAAP financial measures"), which are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Dell has provided a reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the below tables. A detailed discussion of Dell's reasons for including the non-GAAP financial measures and the limitations associated with those measures is presented in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in Dell's annual report on Form 10-K for the financial year ended February 3, 2012. Dell encourages investors to review the historical reconciliation and the non-GAAP discussion in conjunction with the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures.

   (1) In the first quarter of Fiscal 2013, Dell made certain segment realignments in order to conform to the way Dell now internally manages segment performance. These realignments affected all of Dell's operating segments, but primarily consisted of the transfer of small office business customers from the Small and Medium Business segment to the Consumer Segment. Dell has recast prior period amounts to provide visibility and comparability. None of these changes impacts Dell's previously reported consolidated net revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, or earnings per share.
