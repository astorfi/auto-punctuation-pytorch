Sony had size, Sharp had a ginormous LCD, and Panasonic had a virtual fireplace, but Pioneer's booth took the award for sexiest -- if that's even possible. Pioneer's exhibit was doused in glossy black accents and showcased quite a few beautiful devices, including a couple Elite KURO plasmas, HTS-LX70 flat-panel based theater system, the SC-09TX 1,400-watt AV receiver, and a X-Z9 integrated SACD / Network Media audio system for those still clinging to the format. And yes, the stunning BDP-95FD was on hand too, but we'll be giving it some special attention.
