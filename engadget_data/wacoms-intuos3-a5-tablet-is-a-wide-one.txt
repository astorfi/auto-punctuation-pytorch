It seems like widescreen or bust these
days, and Wacom is jumping into the fray with a
16:10 aspect ratio drawing tablet for better reflecting the on screen action you're getting with one those fancy new
monitors. With a 6 x 11-inch drawing area, according to Digit Online news, and an overall size of 8 x 11-inches
a bit larger than the drawing area, the Wacom Intuos3 A5 is sized for slipping into your laptop bag, ready at a
moment's notice for an airport-based Photoshop session or an improvised—yet fully buzzword compliant—sledding
apparatus. Wacom isn't bundling a mouse with this new Intuos, apparently nobody was really using them, but if that's
not a deal breaker for you, this snazzy widescreen tablet could be yours for £249.90—about $444US.
