       With HD DVD still on hiatus after the big holiday rush, Blu-ray rolls on with twelve new titles this week, mostly just cataloge titles from Fox and Buena Vista like Planet of the Apes, Ladder 49 and The Usual Suspects. New to the Blu-ray game this week is Koch, with the documentarary Chronos, a time-lapse tour of natural and man-made wonders. The big title for both HD DVD and Blu-ray this week is The Departed, which should be enjoyable on both formats. Contrary to what Sony tells us the format war isn't over, but it might be if HD DVD doesn't start to release more movies.HD DVD 159 vs Blu-ray 171. Blu-ray
