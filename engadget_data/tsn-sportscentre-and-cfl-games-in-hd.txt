 Football, futbol or Canadian football, it's better in high definition, so it's certainly nice to see our neighbors to the north will be getting more of it next year. Along with every CFL game being televised, TSN (Canadian ESPN) will be showing at least 17 games in HD next year. CBC has yet to make an announcement on regular season games, but they did show last seasons Grey Cup for HDTV viewers last season, so we'll see.

Also, TSN announced today that they will be switching their nightly Sportscentre program to HD in September. TSN HD will be the first Canadian broadcaster putting out daily news of any kind in high definition.
