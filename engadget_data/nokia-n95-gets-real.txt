For one thing, it means we can move past the frustratingly blurry spy shots and onto some glamorous press photos, but more importantly, it takes the guesswork out of the spec sheet. Let's just put it this way: for anyone who thought the N73 was a half-baked effort, the N93 oughtta fit the bill. Nokia seems to be challenging naysayers to find a missing feature or buzzword, cramming in a 5-megapixel cam, integrated GPS, 802.11g, a 3.5mm audio jack (if the A2DP support isn't your cup of tea), 150MB of internal memory, microSD expansion, and HSDPA support (a first for Nokia). Word on the street has the everything-to-everybody N95 dropping in Q1 of 2007 for around â‚¬550 -- that's about $700, just in case the possible US release actually goes down.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
