CNET was able to feast its eyes on Samsung's 50-inch PN50A550, and while we'd still recommend doing a bit of side-by-side comparing before committing your dollars either way, it seems that this set should surely be one you consider. Overall, reviewers found the unit to display "highly accurate primary colors and color temperature," above-average video processing and enough picture controls to satisfy all but the most calibration-obsessed viewers. Of course, not everything was perfectly peachy, as critics noted that the anti-reflective screen could use some work, and folks who place a high priority on deep, deep blacks won't find their winner here. Still, an 8.0 out of 10 isn't half bad, so be sure and give the full review a once over if you've been closing in on pulling the trigger.
