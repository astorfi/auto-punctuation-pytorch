An Amazon spokesperson has confirmed to Engadget that at least the Kindle Fire HD's 7-inch and 8.9-inch forms have had a taste of Ice Cream Sandwich to go with their new interfaces. We don't know yet if the sped-up original gets the same treatment, although it's using an older and only slightly tweaked interface. Similarly, there's no word on any upgrade path to Jelly Bean; it's not something to count on, knowing the conservative path for the original slate. We're just glad that Amazon is keeping up with the times where it matters the most.
