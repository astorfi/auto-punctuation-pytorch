Given its CEO's stance on the importance of mobile, it's only natural for Pinterest to keep polishing its apps. The newest iPhone version, for instance, brings with it an animated shortcut for repinning, liking and sending pins to pals when you press on an entry. Though similar in function to Tumblr's sharing tools, the menu boasts fancier graphics that fit the social networks' aesthetic. As a nice bonus, Pinterest's also adding an Edit Home Feed button for speedier housekeeping on the iPhone and the ability to send pins to your friends from the iPad. Assuming you're willing to wade through a deluge of recipes, inspirational quotes and bridal photos, you can check out the app via the links below.
