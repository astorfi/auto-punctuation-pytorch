 The official specifications and the real, non-numerical name of Samsung's T519 have been revealed on a "coming soon" page on T-Mobile's official site. From now on, Samsung expects you to refer to the T519 as the Trace, which certainly suits the handset's 0.3-inch thickness. Other specs that we weren't too sure of until now include the phone's 1.3 Megapixel camera with video capture, built-in Bluetooth, MP3 / WMA / AAC player, AOL and Yahoo! instant messaging support, and a speakerphone, on top of the microSD slot that we already knew about. Nothing special specs-wise, although we're sure the target demographic of these ubÃ«r-thin fashion phones will be happy with what's on offer.[Thanks, Phil G]
