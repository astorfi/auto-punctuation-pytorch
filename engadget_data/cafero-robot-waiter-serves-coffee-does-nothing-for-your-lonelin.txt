Details are scarce, but apparently the automaton takes orders on a touch screen and fills them with the help of a human operator (though it's only a matter of time before the carbon-based barista is obsolete). Robot waitresses don't flirt and they don't ask for tips: does CAFERO represent food service utopia or a chilling vision of the future? Only time will tell.[Via Hallyu Tech]
