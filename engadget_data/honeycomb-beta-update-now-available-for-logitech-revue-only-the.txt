As expected, the folks over at GTVHacker have leaked their Android 3.1 beta update for the recently discounted set-top box, now available for download and flash without even requiring a root. You can find all the requisite details and downloads at the source link, though you'll have to register with the site to do so. It's also worth noting that the update is still in a buggy, beta phase of development, and that once you upgrade, you may not be able to go back. If you're willing to dance with danger, let us know how you fare.
