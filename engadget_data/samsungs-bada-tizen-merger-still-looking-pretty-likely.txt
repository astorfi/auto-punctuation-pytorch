   Last week, rumors began circulating around Samsung's Bada OS, with Forbes reporting that the platform would soon be merged with Intel's Tizen project. If finalized, the move would reportedly allow Bada apps to run on Tizen, though it remains unclear whether or not a decision has been made yet. On Monday, a company spokesman apparently confirmed these rumors to Reuters, though Samsung later denied these claims, in a statement provided to All Things D:  Samsung and other members of Tizen Association have not made a firm decision regarding the merge of bada and Tizen. We are carefully looking at it as an option to make the platforms serve better for customers. As Samsung's essential part of multi-platform portfolio, bada will continue to play an important role in democratizing smartphone experience in all markets. Samsung will also support open source based development and continue to work together with other industry stakeholders.So, um, is it happening? We'll let you know.
