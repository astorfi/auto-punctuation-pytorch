 As if WowWee didn't give us all enough robotic video action during last week's CES, now we've got a more domesticated rendition showing off in front of the camera as Aldebaran Robotics' Nao flashes its lights and waves to the crowd before emerging onto the market. Right on schedule, the company's previously elusive humanoid bot is finally making some appearances, and while we're still not sure how it'll look entirely, the firm's site has been recently updated to showcase bits and pieces, and to presumably prove the whole thing wasn't a shenanigan. Nevertheless, the Nao prototype is indeed looking mighty fit, and while we've no way of proving his waving video was actually triggered via a WiFi controller programmed with Linux, that's precisely what we're led to believe. So go on, hit the read link for a few sneak peeks at the robot itself, as well as the crew behind the creation, and hopefully we'll get a finalized product here before too long.[Via LinuxDevices]
