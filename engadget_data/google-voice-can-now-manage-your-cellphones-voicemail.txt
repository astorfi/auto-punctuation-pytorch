 
You read that headline correctly, Google Voice now works with your existing mobile phone number -- no need to choose a new Google number that must be communicated to friends, family, and co-workers. This "lighter" version of Google Voice then lets you hand-over voicemail responsibility (and your data) to Google's authority where you can listen to (or read via automatic voice to text conversion) your voicemail on a computer in any order you like, read them as text messages on your phone, and choose personalized greetings by caller. A side-by-side feature table that compares Google Voice when choosing a Google number versus your existing cellphone number can be found after the break. We've also dropped in a cutsie video overview of the change -- surely a company that produced it can't be evil, can it?
