 Not one to leave its business customers out of the loop, Google updated its Chrome for Business browser today with a couple of new features: legacy browser support and cloud-based management for Google Apps. With the former, those who are obliged to use older apps at work (poor you) will be automatically switched to an alternate browser when needed, while the cloud-based management allows employees to log in to their Google Apps for Business or Education accounts from any device. Of course, both features require the approval of your friendly neighborhood IT administrator, so do remember to offer him or her a token of appreciation the next time their special day rolls around.
