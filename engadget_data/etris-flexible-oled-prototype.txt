This and other FOLED prototypes are on display right now at the Next Generation Computing Show in Korea. Ok, you can't knit a sweater with it or anything, but Flexible OLED technology is certainly progressing beyond the staid FOLED displays seen thus far. Ready for the Nokia 888 communicator? Certainly not, but definitely a step in the right direction. More prototypes after the break.
