According to the changelog, we can expect better battery level reporting and fixes for problems with the Japanese Kana keyboard and some mysterious issues where third-party apps would fail to launch. Sounds good to us!

Update: As usual, we're hearing blackra1n (and presumably redsn0w) has been busted by 3.1.3, so you probably want to hold back if you're jailbroken until you've gotten the all-clear. Thanks, Eric!
