We've already seen a couple of updated apps slip out, and we now also have what appears to be our first look at Google's refreshed widgets for the new OS. Those include both Gmail and Calendar, as well one for your non-Gmail email, all of which boast a similar appearance that's been further streamlined from their Honeycomb counterparts. As Android Police notes, there's curiously no labels in the Gmail widget, although we'd assume that's just due to the particular messages being displayed (we hope so, at least). Hit the source link below for a look at the rest.
