While that may or may not also work directly on your skull, it will definitely work with a range of helmets, including bike helmets with the included TuneStrap, or skate helmets with the included Gecko Mount. Look for it to be available by the end of the month for $119.95, along with the more conventional Vibe SurfaceSound speaker, which will set you back $69.99.
