As if that wasn't proof enough, the "Current Launch" section of the site details the entire mission and provides a link to tune in via streaming video once the trip is underway. Hang tight, DTV subscribers -- it seems that even more HD will be on the way sooner rather than later.[Thanks, Jeremy K.]
