A HowardForums member has managed to hook us all up, putting down his glossy black bundle of joy just long enough to snap a few shots of the VX8500 being extracted from its packaging materials. As might be expected, the phone looks to quickly get covered with smudges and fingerprints, but such is the price one must pay for mobile exclusivity these days.[Thanks, Damian]
