 We know it must be terrifying, Milwaukee, to think of all those poor television viewers you may end up leaving in the dark, but at least you've seen other cities come before you and survive. Hot on the heels of Wilmington, NC killing the analog beams for realz, in flies word that a dozen Milwaukee, Wisconsin stations will be having a test of the digital TV conversion at around 5:10PM (local time) on September 15th. Obviously, viewers in the area will be warned beforehand, but we're sure a select few will choose to ignore the flashing hazard lights and suffer through a few agonizing minutes of fuzz. It's better they learn now, though.[Image courtesy of CCAuthority, thanks John]
