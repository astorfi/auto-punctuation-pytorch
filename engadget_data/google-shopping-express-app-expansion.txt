Google began testing its new same-day delivery service, Shopping Express, with a limited trial for San Francisco customers back in March, and it's apparently proven successful enough for an expansion. Starting today, residents of the greater Bay Area -- from San Francisco to San Jose -- can streamline their to-do list by having local stores deliver straight to their doors. Included on the list of participating retailers are national giants like Target, Toys R Us, Walgreens, Staples and Whole Foods (just to name a few), though some smaller businesses will also take part. The service is also expanding to mobile phones, as Google is launching a new Shopping Express app for both Android and iOS devices; with it, you can search for items, browse different stores and place orders from your phone.
