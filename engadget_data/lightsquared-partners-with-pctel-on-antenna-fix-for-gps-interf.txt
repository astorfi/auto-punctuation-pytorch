  It's the problem that won't go away for LightSquared, and one that has prompted a number of different "fixes" and "solutions." The latest, as announced by the LTE wholesaler last month, is an actual hardware fix that overcomes the interference issue affecting high-precision GPS units -- the only problem being that all existing and future units will need to be upgraded with said fix. Now the company's back with yet more details, announcing that it's partnered with PCTEL to develop an antenna that lets users of high-precision GPS units easily retrofit their devices to make them "LightSquared-compatible." There's still no word on the cost for it, but LightSquared has also announced that Partron America has created a filtering component that costs $6. The company's press release is after the break.

PCTEL has developed an antenna that will allow existing high precision users to retrofit their GPS devices to make them compatible with LightSquared's network. This antenna provides high precision GPS users with another in a series of solutions to make their equipment LightSquared-compatible.  "PCTEL has developed GPS antenna solutions that have solved a variety of interference issues that others said were unsolvable. Their wideband antenna provides an efficient and elegant solution for thousands of high precision device users," said Martin Harriman, executive vice president of ecosystem development and satellite business at LightSquared.  PCTEL's antenna solutions address applications including public safety, agriculture, construction and aviation. The new antenna will be independently tested with a range of receivers at the world-renowned Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ.  "Over the last year, we have worked closely with LightSquared to develop a narrowband solution to interference issues. Our current work with LightSquared will enable wideband high precision users to have a state-of-the-art solution for their unique positioning needs. We look forward to developing other multiband and wideband high rejection GPS antenna products with LightSquared to bring high precision technology to new levels," said Jeff Miller, PCTEL's senior vice president of sales and marketing.  Despite claims by some GPS device manufacturers that an interference solution would take ten years and billions of dollars to develop, the private marketplace has continued to develop inexpensive solutions using existing technology in just a matter of weeks. PCTEL is the third company to collaborate with LightSquared on a solution to high-precision GPS interference issues. Earlier this month, GPS device maker Javad GNSS announced the design of antennas that can be retrofitted onto existing devices and the development of new receivers that are compatible with LightSquared's network. Additionally, Partron America has created a filtering component that costs only $6.  These solutions will undergo extensive National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) testing in the coming weeks. Preliminary testing results leave LightSquared confident that the debate over its network and interference from GPS signals will be resolved.  LightSquared's mission is to build a world-class 4G-LTE network that will bring lower prices, better service and more competition to 260 million Americans by 2015. It is through these alliances with engineering experts that new GPS interference solutions have been developed, keeping the company's deployment plan on track so that all Americans can realize the benefits of a new nationwide wireless broadband network.  About LightSquared  LightSquared's mission is to revolutionize the U.S. wireless industry. With the creation of the first-ever, wholesale-only nationwide 4G-LTE network integrated with satellite coverage, LightSquared offers people the speed, value and reliability of universal connectivity, wherever they are in the United States. As a wholesale-only operator, LightSquared will deploy an open 4G wireless broadband network to be used by existing and new service providers to sell their own devices, applications and services – at a competitive cost and without retail competition from LightSquared. The deployment and operation of LightSquared's network represent more than $14 billion of private investment over the next eight years.
