You'll have to make do with a mere 1GB of memory, however, but you will get a decent 15 hours of battery life, and you can rest assured that it'll float to the surface for easy retrieval if it slips off while you're plundering the ocean's depths (up to ten feet deep, at least). Look for this one to set you back â‚¬99 (or $150), with it set to start shipping in July.[Via Crave]
