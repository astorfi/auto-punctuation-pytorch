Some folks attempt water into wine, while others go for turning wine into laptops. Rather, a case of vintage
Sicilian wine has been turned into a laptop, along with some leather, pine wood, oak, beech, mahogany, silk, iron and
brass screws. Each wooden part was painstakingly cut, finished and assembled to convert the otherwise utilitarian Dell
Latitude C600/Inspiron series notebook into a hand-crafted work of art. We're sure that having to go through all that
wine in the process really sped this project along.
