 
Verizon has a press conference lined up in a few minutes to officially drop all these details, but they've thrown their official LTE site live already where you can see almost everything you want to know: chiefly, that the initial 38 markets (and 60 airports) will go live this Sunday, December 5th with two USB modems in tow -- one from LG and another from Pantech. We've already heard all of that in one form or another, but it's nice to see it spelled out officially on Verizon's site. The one crucial detail we're still missing, of course, is plan pricing -- so we anxiously await that here in the next few minutes, but in the meantime, feel free to play with Big Red's LTE coverage locator.
