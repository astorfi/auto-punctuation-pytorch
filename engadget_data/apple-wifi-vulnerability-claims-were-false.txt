 Here's a great way to build some hacker cred: make some serious claims about a major breach of a high-profile product, whip the PR machine (us) into a frenzy, and then fess up to lying about the whole thing. That seems to be the case with the recent claims by SecureWorks of hacking Apple WiFi drivers to expose a MacBook to their whims. Turns out they actually hacked the drivers of a 3rd party wireless device driver, but apparently their desire to shatter that "Mac user base aura of smugness on security" got in the way of the truth. It also looks likes it took a denial from Apple of the whole affair to get them to fess up, Apple hasn't even seen any of the supposed documentation of the hack -- so no brownie points there either.[Via TUAW, thanks Joshua S.]
