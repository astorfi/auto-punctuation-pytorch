No shocker here: T-Mobile and Danger are officially unveiling the new Sidekick 3 today. (Note that it's not called the "Sidekick III". T-Mob has requested that it only be written as "Sidekick 3".) The specs are no surprise, either, since they've been rumbling around for weeks now, but we'll run down the official details for ya:

Size: 130 x 59 x 21.8mm 
Weight: 6.7 ounces
240 x 160 pixel, 65,000 color display
Trackball (!)
Tri-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE
Bluetooth 1.2 (limited to Hands-Free profile and vCard exchange)
1.3 megapixel digital camera w/LED flash
miniSD memory card slot (supports up to 2GB cards)
64MB of SDRAM/64MB Flash memory
Music player software

Word has it that T-Mobile will be opening up pre-orders to current Sidekick owners first, with the rest of us getting a crack at it sometime around July 10th.Stay tuned for a slew of hands-on pics.
