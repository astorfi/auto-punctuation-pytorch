Cingular may not have gotten the memo, having apparently decided to bundle theirs (the 3125, as you may recall) with a larger battery, necessitating a bulged-out hindquarters. Granted, we're guessing the benefit to standby and talk times justify the growth for some folks -- but we think we'd rather have seen this as an option, leaving the stock product true to form. Either way, get all your humptastic, Cingular-branded 3125 shots after the break.
