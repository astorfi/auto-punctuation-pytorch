 If you can't wait until next year to see the future for RIM, N4BB has obtained what it claims is a picture on the BlackBerry 10 L-Series, aka London. The screenshot shows a launcher pane full of app icons including BBM, Facebook, Maps and StoryMaker, which could be an iMovie-style video editor. Other leaks, including one from a video posted by BlackberryItalia.it (embedded after the break), indicate it could pack a removable 1800mAh LS1 battery and will be gunmetal colored. Of course, we don't know how far along the software is on this unit compared to the ones we had hands-on experience with, but if you're committed to sticking with the team from Waterloo then any news is likely welcome.

 Update: CrackBerry has a more revealing version of the image now seen above, which surfaced in its forums and on Instagram.  [Thanks, John]
