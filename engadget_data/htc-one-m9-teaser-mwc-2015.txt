While we're still in the middle of January, some of us are already hearing bits about the upcoming MWC. One e-mail that caught our attention comes from none other than HTC, who is already teasing its very own Barcelona event on March 1st -- the day before MWC kicks off (full invitation image attached after the break). We understand that this will be the launch of the company's next flagship device, which sounds about right; the One (M8) was unveiled back in March 25th and went to market soon afterwards.



The invitation itself doesn't show much other than a "utopia in progress" line over a cosmic background, though the latter plus the two "o"s bounded together may be teasing some new camera technology. One likelihood is the optical zoom rumor we heard a little while back. We're also hoping that like the recently-announced Desire 826, this new phone may get an UltraPixel front-facing camera for brighter selfies. As always, we'll be at Barcelona to find out what HTC and others got up their sleeves, so stay tuned.
