The EM-K3263 purportedly allows users to shove a variety of characters (or tater tots for future snacking, we presume) into the bottom of the device, and the seven shades of LED light up the inside for the ultimate in handheld fun. Then again, you may not get much mousing done if you're busy staring at all the action inside, but there's just something strangely right about housing a mouse in your mouse. Look for this sucka to hit Korea later this month for a currently undisclosed amount.[Via I4U]
