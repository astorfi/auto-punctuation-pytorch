We've always known that the Roomba was something of a bad-ass -- iRobot, after all, has quite a reputation within the defense industry -- so we weren't surprised when one of the autonomous vacuum cleaners took down a certain Vipera palaestinae (a venomous snake found in the Middle East). Considered a leading cause of snakebites within its geographic range, the snake was found mangled 'round one of the robot's rotating brushes when Eli and Efi Frida returned to their home in Galilee, which they share with their two children, aged four and seven (as well as several cats and dogs). "We were very lucky," said Eli, "If the snake would have hid in the house and bitten one of the children it could have ended badly."
