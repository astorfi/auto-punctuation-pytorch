 We can't say we're exactly surprised to see Apple's next-generation MacBook Pro show up on the company's "Certified Refurbished" online store -- still, it's good news for folks looking to save a little cash while getting a taste of Retina MBP straight from the source. Currently, Apple is only offering the 15-inch model (with a 2.3GHz, quad-core i7 CPU, 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD) for $1,869, making it about $330 less than its non-refurbished counterpart -- of course, that premium price tag also includes the accustomed one-year manufacturer's warranty, which is a good security blanket to have when shelling out this much capital. As is usually the case with Cupertino's rejuvenated goods, though, supplies may be somewhat limited, so now could be a great time to jump on the MacBook Pro with Retina display bandwagon.
