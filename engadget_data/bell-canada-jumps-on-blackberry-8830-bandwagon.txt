 Somehow Bell Canada missed the boat yesterday when Sprint and Verizon announced the BlackBerry 8830 (or we missed it) but we have it today, and Bell should have it this summer. Sporting the same features as we mentioned in a small pile of lead up articles, Bell customers will now have the luxury of wandering the world while staying connected to mail from home. Nothing is up on the site yet as far as pricing and plans go, but they will definitely appear between now and release day X.
