 Don't worry, East Coast, we haven't forgotten about you. We haven't even gotten around to that whole Seattle meetup, and we're already ready to let you in on our next big event. We're holding another reader meetup exactly a month later in the Big Apple. The big event is going down at Roseland on Thursday, November 29th, so mark those calendars and make sure you're on the list by snagging a ticket here. Come on out, meet some editors, check out some great gadgets and, yes, win some fabulous prizes!

 We'll be revealing more information about the festivities in the very near future. In the meantime, if you're interested in sponsoring the event, drop us a line at sponsors [at] engadget [dot] com.
