The sleek set, to be offered in both 65- and 55-inch models, features a 7.9mm bezel and arrives with a chip on its shoulder: it received the CEA Innovations Honoree Award. It's also paired with that same uniquely contoured remote we saw back at IFA. In fact, the dual-sided controller's folded over shape bears a distant similarity to the magazine fold of the Xperia Tablet S. On the remote's back is a full QWERTY keyboard for search queries, but despite its broad layout, you'll likely be thumbing this much as you would a smartphone. Flip it around, and users will be presented with a trackpad that sits between dedicated buttons for Netflix, guide, voice navigation, home button, in addition to an option to toggle 3D.

 From what we can see on the idle 65-inch set at this presser, the internet connected XT780's homescreen loads up with a shelf on the upper right, playing host to YouTube, Netflix and HiMedia apps, with a list of frequently used applications (all available from Google Play) just below. Taking up space on the screen's lower half is a bar arranged with shortcuts for Home, settings, Chrome browser, Google Play and Search. It's not the freshest innovation to come from Hisense -- for that you'll have to stay tuned to this week's showfloor coverage.
