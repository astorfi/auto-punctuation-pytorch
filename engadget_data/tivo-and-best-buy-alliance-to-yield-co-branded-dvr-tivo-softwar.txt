Under the multi-year alliance, Best Buy will "heavily" promote TiVo products at its 1,100 stores across the US. TiVo, for its part, will develop a special flavor of its set-top box that will be sold in Best Buy stores and lets the retailer advertise its products and services directly to TiVo subscribers -- items can then be purchased via the TiVo remote. The alliance goes even deeper as it will see TiVo's software and search tools added to Best Buy's own-branded consumer electronics (like Insignia and Dynex HDTVs) and Best Buy's Napster music service will become available to TiVo subscribers on their TVs. While this all sounds like a win-win for the two corporations, TiVo CEO Tom Rogers says that the Best Buy-customized TiVo with Napster won't likely arrive until "early next year" while the inclusion of TiVo's interface on Best Buy's Insignia or Dynex TVs is even "further out." Until then the benefits for us, the consumers, are less clear.P.S.
