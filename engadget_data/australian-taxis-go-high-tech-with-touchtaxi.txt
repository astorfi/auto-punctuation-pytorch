TouchTaxi have updated cabs in Australia with headrest-mounted
touchscreens connected to computers that are connected to the Internet via GPRS and sport GPS receivers (so you can see
where you're at and whether your cabbie is taking you for a ride) and WiFi (if you want to piggyback on the PC's GPRS
connection with your lappy).  The obvious internet search, directory, and mapping services will be included, but
TouchTaxi have also added a proximity home search service in which users can enter their cellphone number to alert
nearby salespeople.  When notified, salespeople will automatically get the user's cellphone number and be able to
call with loan rates and nearby available homes.  That won't be annoying at all.
