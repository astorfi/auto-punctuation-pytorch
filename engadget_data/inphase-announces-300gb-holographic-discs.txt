 Forget about
perpendicular recording;
that's so last week. If Colorado- based InPhase Technologies has its way, the next big advance in data storage will be
holographic media. The company — which rolled out a
prototype holographic drive earlier this year — announced
today that it has produced a holographic disc that can hold 300GB on a single disc. InPhase says that the discs (which
will be write-once media) and compatible drives should ship next year, with terabyte discs available by 2009. According
to the company, its holographic technology records "through the full depth" of the storage media, and can record data a
million bits at a time. We figure it should be able to hold our whole movie collection, with room left over for some
lossless music as well.
