As expected, CES '10 is all aflutter over 3D -- and as expected, it's the glasses that are the sticking point for most people. What if we told you that you could get really "cool," "stylish" glasses -- ones that look so good that you'd want to wear them all the time? An outfit called Gunnar Optiks is pleased to announce its new i-AMP specs "for the most widely used 3D platforms in gaming and video." Apparently, this guy will become available in Q2 of 2010 (for iZ3D gaming systems and RealD video), at prices starting at $90 -- with prescription eyewear to become available in Q3. But why wait? We took a look, so you can decide for yourself if these are worthy of a repeat viewing of U23D. The Fly is unavailable for comment.
