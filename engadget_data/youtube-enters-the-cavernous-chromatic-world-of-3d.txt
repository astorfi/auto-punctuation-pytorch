As you can see in the video there in the read link, 3D videos that are uploaded can now be shown in a variety of formats in order to suit a variety of viewing styles. Believe it or not, this little addition just made YouTube the most pervasive and most useful outlet for bringing 3D content into the home, blazing right on past Panasonic and an entire consortium devoted to making said concept a reality. And with all these 3D cameras and camcorders making their way out onto the market, we're guessing this may up being more than just a fad. We will say, however, that watching the video (posted past the break) sans the appropriate glasses is murder on your brain. Engage at your own risk.[Via CNET, thanks William]
