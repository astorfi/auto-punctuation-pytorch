Hot on the heels of Asus' Tegra 3-equipped Tablet 600 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4-based development tablet, Texas Instruments is showing Windows RT on its very own OMAP 4470-based system. The 1.5GHz dual-core SoC features a PowerVR SGX544 GPU and leads the competition with a dual-channel memory interface. We chatted with Bill Crean, Product Manager of the OMAP Processor Business Unit who showed us Microsoft's latest OS running on TI's development tablet. The demo looked snappy enough, providing some insight about what to expect from some of Toshiba's upcoming devices. No word yet on a quad-core version. Enjoy our hands-on gallery below and take a peek after the break for our demo video.
