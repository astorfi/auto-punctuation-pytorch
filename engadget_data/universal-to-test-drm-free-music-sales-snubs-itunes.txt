Apparently the restriction free Universal tracks will start popping up on those other music distributors next January, during which time the company intends to closely monitor sales, increases in music piracy, etc. before going all-in; for the time being we've no idea which artists Universal intends to free up or just how much of its total catalogue will be distributed in this little toe-dip of theirs. But one thing we do know: between EMI and Universal, two of the top four music businesses in the world have now announced or begun distributing music without DRM, and there's little we can find fault with about that.[Thanks, somebody]
