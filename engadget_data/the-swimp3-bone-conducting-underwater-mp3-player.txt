Finis just announced the SwiMP3, a waterproof MP3 player which uses bone conduction to vibrate the sound directly
into your head via your cheek bones (it actually attaches to your goggle straps, but we've also seen a prototype for
goggles with a bone conduction MP3 player built right in). They don't much storage capacity, but they say it has enough
space for 30 songs, which sounds like it should clock in somewhere around 128MB.
