 The launch of BlackBerry 10 and its debut devices is slowly creeping up on us, and some details about the handsets are finally starting to emerge. According to N4BB, RIM has two models up its sleeve -- the all touchscreen L-Series and the QWERTY keyboard-sporting N-Series. The L branded models will be very similar to the dev devices we've already seen, with a 1280 x 768 OLED display (a first for a BlackBerry) that crams an impressive 356 pixels into every inch. The N-Series is more for the BlackBerry purists who cling desperately to their physical keyboards. Originally leaked with the codename Nevada, the N-Series shrinks the display to 720 x 720, but still keeps the pixel density impressive at 330ppi. N4BB's sources say that the L will hit shelves first in September, with the N to follow in Q1 of 2013.
