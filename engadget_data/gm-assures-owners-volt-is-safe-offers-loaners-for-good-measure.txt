Well, unless you're the type who lingers for several weeks in the vicinity of your wrecked auto, there probably isn't much to worry about. GM apparently feels the same way, as it's began contacting all 5,329 owners to "reassure them" their gasoline-electric whips are safe to drive. Those who remain unconvinced can bug the General for a presumably non-electric loaner while the whole investigation sorts itself. Or if your name is Jay Leno, you could just choose one of the other hundred in your garage.
