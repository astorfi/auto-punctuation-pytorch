The shows, which kick off September 5th, will tour various locations to drum up trade for the new kit. The news agency is also reporting that any revamped Lumia phones will be ready to purchase for the Holiday buying season -- hopefully dropping close to the October 26th release date for Redmond's newest OS. Unfortunately, Nokia isn't giving anything away, saying that it "never comments on rumor or speculation," but at least we don't have long to wait.
