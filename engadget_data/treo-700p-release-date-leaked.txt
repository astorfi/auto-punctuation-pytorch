The 28th happens to be a Sunday, which seems odd timingfor a launch, but it could just be a general target, and it lines up with the mid-year rumorings we've heardrecently. The scanned product sheet also mentions EV-DO, a 1.3 megapixel camera, Bluetooth, 128MB of memory, and DUNmodem capability, none of which contradicts previously leaked specs. So while themid-year timing might be a blow to those of us barely scraping by on a 650, the feature set is looking good for thosewith patience. That is, of course, if any of this checks out at all.[Via Palm Infocenter]
