We've seen it as the E-P1 and P-1, but now, after what seems like countless months brand-free glass-encased trade show appearances it looks like Olympus has officially titled launched it's E-1 DSLR successor, the E-3. We don't yet know much about it, but we understand it will have a live view LCD, work on the 3/4ths mount standard, and be available at least somewhere in November. (That in addition to the other stuff we heard, like it having a 10 megapixel sensor, 11 point autofocus, etc.) We'll update with information as it continues to trickle out.[Thanks, Adam]
