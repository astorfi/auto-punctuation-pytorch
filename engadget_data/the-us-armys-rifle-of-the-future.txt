It's almost scary how high-tech the military is getting these days, and Heckler & Koch are working on a
futuristic replacement for the venerable M-16 rifle called the XM-8 that has interchangable barrels for converting it
from an assault rifle to a sharpshooter to a compact submachine gun on the fly, attachable grenade launcher and
12-gauge shotgun, and swappable skins for changing colors that a soldier can change depending on whether they're
fighting in a city, jungle, or desert
