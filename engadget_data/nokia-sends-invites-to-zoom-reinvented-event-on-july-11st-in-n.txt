We just received invites from Nokia to an event in New York City taking place on July 11th. The name of the event, curiously, is "zoom reinvented" and the imagery features a magnifying glass. Given the recent barrage of EOS leaks, we naturally have to wonder if an 808 PureView-like Lumia device will be the star of the show, though it could be something as simple as the Lumia 925. We've pinged Nokia for more information and will update you as we learn more about this mystery event.


Update: It turns out that a lot of invites have been sent out to international media, not to mention high-level Nokia employees are teasing the EOS on Twitter, lending credence to the rumors that next month's event will likely feature a Lumia device with much greater imaging capabilities than anything else in Nokia's Windows Phone lineup.
