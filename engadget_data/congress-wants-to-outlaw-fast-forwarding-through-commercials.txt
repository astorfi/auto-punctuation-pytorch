We thought we lucked out when Senator Orrin Hatch stopped
pushing the INDUCE Act, but the RIAA and MPAA are at again, and are trying to push another copyright bill through
Congress that does a lot of the same things, like criminalizing copyright infringing file-sharing and punishing anyone
who brings a video camera into a movie theatre for recording purposes with up to three years in prison. But there's
another part of the Intellectual Property Protection Act that should perk up your ears (assuming they aren't already
suitably perky). They want to make it illegal to use software or hardware to skip all of those commercials and previews
that the studios are placing before the beginnings of movies on DVDs, something which is freaking ridiculous since it's
your DVD playing on your DVD player in your home. How about making it illegal to not pay attention, too?
