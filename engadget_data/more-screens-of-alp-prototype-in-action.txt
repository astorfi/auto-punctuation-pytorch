After being teased by shots ofAccess PalmSource's new Access Linux Platform OS running the Memo app in emulation last week, we've finally got somescreens of the rest of the OS. This is, of course, an early prototype, so a lot can change between now and the finalrelease. It does seem, though, that they're coming along well, and the source article claims a developer SDK will beout before the end of the year, with the first devices appearing in 2007. Check the read link for a bit of hot ALPMinesweeper action, along with another shot of Memo in emulation.[Via PalmInfocenter]
