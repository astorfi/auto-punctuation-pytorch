While the initial response to the idea of a leggy robot crawling around your guts is naturally one of shock and awe, if you really think about the other surgical and endoscopic options, they're all a little offputting as well: tubes, little cameras on wires, so why the hell not a tiny-legged robot pill? The 25mm long and 10mm diameter crawling capsule was created by researchers in Italy and Korea and once the pill is swallowed the soft coating dissolves and the crazy-legged robot starts its course. The only issue might be one of control, since we're sure the patient won't be none too pleased when some rogue robot starts aimlessly inspecting his intenstines.
