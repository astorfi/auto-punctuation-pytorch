	LG's biggest, fastest phone to date, previously known as the Optimus LTE, has made its first landing outside of Korea. In a not-so-thinly-veiled reference to the retina display-beating resolution density, it's now answering to the name, Optimus Eye. The smartphone's been leaked in a preview video from The Source, a Canadian retailer which is owned by Bell -- who'll evidently be making the phone available on their network. We also get to see LG's latest AH-IPS display technology in action, alongside a dual-core 1.5GHz processor and the increasingly standard eight megapixel shooter. No whisperings just yet on pricing or a launch date, but we'd expect these top-drawer specifications to be matched with an appropriately top-drawer price tag when it does arrive. You can eye it up for yourself after the break.
