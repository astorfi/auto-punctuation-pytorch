 Just 'cause Skype gets all the coverage doesn't mean vendors have forgotten about other VoIP alternatives. Take the lovable Google Talk, for example. Taiwan's Alpha Networks is all ready to produce a WiFi phone with Google Talk compatibility, they're just waiting to sync up with "clients' product roadmaps" -- whatever that means. The phone should also have Gmail capabilities, and Alpha is planning to develop a video phone as well. Whether that points to Google Talk-based video chat, and whether some sort of forthcoming Google Video Talk product is on one of those "clients' product roadmaps" is purely irresponsible (and entertaining) speculation on our part.
