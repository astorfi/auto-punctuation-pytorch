 After cluing us in on the state of its ever-stuffed coffers, Apple's given us a quick progress report on its App Store, noting that it's reached a total of 45 billion downloads -- a 5 billion jump since the end of its last quarter. Cook's crew also divulged that they've doled out $9 billion to developers who've sold their wares on the digital storefront, and they're paying out $1 billion every quarter. Cupertino gave a quick nod to iCloud too, revealing that the service now has 300 million users under its belt, 50 million more than it claimed at the end of the firm's last quarter. By the sounds of it, Apple's data centers are being put to good use.
