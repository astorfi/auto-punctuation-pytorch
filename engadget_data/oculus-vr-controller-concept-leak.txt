The Oculus VR crew has been doling out hints about what the mainstream version of its headset will do, but the controller? It's been pretty tight-lipped so far. However, the company just gave an inadvertent clue as to what it's been working on. Fans have discovered a concept image that Oculus' Palmer Luckey says is an early "placeholder" for the company's controller work. The peripheral is "nowhere close to final," the executive adds, but it's implied that some of the underlying ideas will show up in the products you see at Oculus' big consumer event on June 11th. Not that it spoils much -- it's little more than a touchpad with basic navigation controls, so the odds are that there are some surprises left in store.



Update: VRFocus has a full image of the leaked site, including this shot below. As we explained, it's unlikely the finished Rift will look exactly like this, but it's still interesting to see the design evolve. 


For what it's worth, that rear design looks very similar to the teaser image on the official Oculus site right now.
