The coolest new feature we noticed -- other than tru2way of course -- was the fact that the new line of Pace HD STBs have a built in DOCSIS modem. This will allow the STB to access the Internet, but also via the included Ethernet port on the back, you can say goodbye to your dedicated cable modem. Anytime we can get rid of yet another box and accompanying wall-wart, we're happy.
