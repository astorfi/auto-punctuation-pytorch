Apparently WiFi syncing still isn't in the cards, but the source that sent these along notes that WiFi encryption will work, as will subscription, but you can't send it to another player until you sync back to your PC. Sounds kind of annoying -- so we're not ruling it out.Update: According to Zune Insider (i.e. Cesar Menendez, from the Zune team), these shots ain't real. That that for what it's worth.
