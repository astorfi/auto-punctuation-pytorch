Well, not a lot else except that you really like it, in TrustedReviews' case; the gave Samsung's Q35 an average 9/10, finding notable "improvements" over its predecessor the Q30, like an integrated DVD burner and PC card slot (so sue us, we like our ultraportables to have external drives and maybe an ExpressCard slot, where possible). And that's not even to mention the nice widescreen display, a 5-in-1 media reader, solid keyboard, and a semi-reasonable Â£993 ($1,830 US) price tag that TR thinks makes this thing "impossible not to recommend."
