       Looks like BlackBerry Internet Services is having a rough night, with a number of sites reporting it being down not just in North America, but also elsewhere around the world. A handful of tipsters have expressed similar issues, and though we've had some weirdness with our service tonight, it seems to be working well enough. So tell us, how's BIS doing for you tonight?
