 At 70-years old, it's hard to think of Pinocchio as a boy anoymore, but he'll be coming to life on Blu-ray as part of Disney's 2009 Blu-ray releases. Approximately seven titles will be released in the Blu-ray+DVD combo packs that families love for portability, including classics that will get the Platinum Edition treatment, like "Pinocchio: 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition" and "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Platinum Edition." All in all, the Mouse will be turning more than 30 titles loose in North America on Blu-ray, with about 14 packaged with a DisneyFile digital copy for the kids' viewing enjoyment.
