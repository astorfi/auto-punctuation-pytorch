When HTC launched the HTC Mini+, everyone wondered when the company would release a phone large enough to justify buying a companion device. These images, from Android Central's forums, makes the arrival of the 6-inch HTC One Max that much more of a foregone conclusion. The anonymous Verizon employee who took the pics also says that the large smartphone does indeed carry a fingerprint scanner and a removable back. Still, if we're at the point where conspicuously carrier-branded devices are leaking out already, it can't be long before an official release, right?
