   We already had the deep-dish on Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4 development platform during our on-stage pow-wow with the company's Rob Chandok but we wanted to get some extra time with the device. The MSM8960 is a developer tablet: which means it'll never retail and it's packing some serious kit including a dual-core 1.5GHz CPU, 13-megapixel cameras on both side and Qualcomm's beefy LTE gear inside. We got a few minutes to play Fight Game Heroes: a tech demo game where your character fights a musclebound company executive in a steelworks. The action was fluid and rapid, particle effects like smoke and sparks were well rendered -- we think the chip's obviously got gaming gravitas considering the early nature of the software. It's harder to see if this is more noticeably powerful than Tegra 3, but on current evidence we think nVidia's a step ahead. Just as we left, 15 Nokia executives swarmed the booth, but would it be too much to hope that the company's thinking about building a Tablet? Well, yes, obviously. But it doesn't stop us dreaming, okay? After the break we've got footage so you can decide for yourself.
