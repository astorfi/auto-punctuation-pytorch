Samsung seems to have a little spec bump for the Q1 every week or so: a flash drive here, a new processor there, but this time they're doing it up right and sticking HSDPA into their UMPC. The new "Q1P" also packs that new Via processor from the Q1B, which extends the battery to a purported five hours. The Q1 really does take on a whole new level of hotness with a respectable battery life and 3G internet access, and supposedly the Q1P will include "several additional interfaces" as well -- whatever that means. We sure wouldn't complain to have an easier time interfacing with the thing when it's released Q4 this year, but we're not going to get our hopes up too high.[Via jkOnTheRun]
