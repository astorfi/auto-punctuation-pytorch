Perhaps in a move to justify stalling the implementation of ICT, AACS LA will include Macrovision's analog content protection technology in their next update. This isn't that surprising as ICT or no, the analog hole is still a major concern for content providers, in fact Macrovision VP Adam Gervin predicted this back in 2004 (he also predicted that high definition DVD formats would be very slow to take off, DVDs had 5 years of growth left in them and that AACS would be cracked). Of course, one has to wonder how this will affect Toshiba's HD DVD player and PC Blu-ray drives that are already on the market.
