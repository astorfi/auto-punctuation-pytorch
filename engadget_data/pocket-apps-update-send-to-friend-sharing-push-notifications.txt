 In celebration of its one-year anniversary, Pocket has updated its Android, iOS, Mac and web apps with a new Send to Friend option. This feature allows you to pass content directly to friends along with a comment and highlighted quote from the article being shared. The app kicks out an email to anyone receiving your reading recommendations, and sends an optional push notification to folks already on the Pocket bandwagon. In addition, the updated share menu creates shortcuts for recently used social networks and contacts, which makes it easier to keep your cohorts up to date with your daily web habits. If you're ready to overrun your friends' inboxes with clips of Engadget editors forgetting to chew their food, head on over to your app store of choice to grab the update.
