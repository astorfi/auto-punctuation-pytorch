For those that can think back pre-feast, Samsung promised that a firmware update was on the way in order to bring HD Netflix streaming to its BD-P2500 / BD-P2550 Blu-ray players. Exactly one week later, it's here. Officially, the firmware v2.1 adds support for "Netflix VC1-AP HD Streaming" and "improves playback compatibility of some movie titles." We needn't tell you how urgent it is you download this and give it a try -- but be on the lookout for less-than-stellar image quality. Best of luck, brave ones.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
