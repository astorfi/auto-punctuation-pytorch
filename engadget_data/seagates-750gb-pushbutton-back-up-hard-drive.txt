 We'd heard it, it leaked, it got reviewed, then announced, nowit's time to get your 750GB perp drives on people. Seagate's new 750GBPushbutton Back-up Hard Drive isn't by an means out of the ordinary -- it's an external drive with USB 2.0 and FireWire,the only difference is it's 750GB in a single drive, not two drive in RAID 0. For what you're getting the $559 doesn't even really seemthat out of control, and you'll have your chance to get one starting next month, according to Seagate. We're not goingto ask what the hell kind of data you've got that requires you to go buy a 750GB drive (or a couple of 'em for anarray, as it were), but copious storage early adopters, we tip our hats to you.
