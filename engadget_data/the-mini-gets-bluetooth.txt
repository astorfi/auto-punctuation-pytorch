In Europe, where phones with Bluetooth are fairly common, cool affordable cars are starting to roll off assembly
lines with Bluetooth hands-free kits built-in. In the US, it's a different story. There are only a handful of
cars that come with a Bluetooth kit. Sure you can have an aftermarket one installed, but then something winds
up sticking out, ruining the clean lines of your ride's dash, no matter how pro the installation is. The Bluetooth
Weblog, one of our blog cousins, has good news for all you hipsters craving a new Mini. A press release has
just hit the web revealing (as often happens) that the new Mini Coopers will have a hands-free Bluetooth with noise
canceling technology. Let's see if Toyota follows suit and sneaks Bluetooth into their Scions (they've already put
into the new Prius).
