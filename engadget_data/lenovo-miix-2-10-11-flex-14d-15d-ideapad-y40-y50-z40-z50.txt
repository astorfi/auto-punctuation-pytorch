Well, this is a little confusing. After releasing the Miix 2, an 8-inch Windows tablet, Lenovo is announcing two more products called the Miix 2, except these aren't even tablets, but rather, detachable laptops. True to their name, the Miix 2 10 and 11 have 10.1- and 11.6-inch screens, respectively, and come with both a tablet and keyboard dock. In particular, as you can see in the photo above, you can insert the tablet with the screen facing either in or out -- yep, just like on last year's ThinkPad Helix, not to mention Lenovo's growing Yoga line. Either way, you get a 1,920 x 1,080 IPS display, an eight-hour battery, dual 5MP/2MP cameras, optional 3G, a microSD slot, micro-HDMI, JBL speakers and a full-sized USB port on the dock. 

Aside from screen size, the biggest difference is in processing power: The 10-inch model uses a low-power Intel Bay Trail processor with up to 128GB of storage, whereas the bigger guy packs a more powerful Core i5 chip. What's more, that model goes up to 256 gigs of space, not 128. The Miix 2 10 is slated to arrive in March, starting at $499, with the 11-incher following in April for $699.





Additionally, Lenovo refreshed some of its existing laptops, including the Yoga-like "Flex" series, the powerhouse Y series and the multimedia Z line. Starting with the Flex 14D and 15D, these are basically the existing Flex 14 and 15, which can contort into many of the same shapes as the Yoga, except they can't fold all the way back into tablet mode. The real difference between these and the existing models is that the 14D and 15D make use of quad-core AMD A6 chips and a 1GB AMD Radeon HD8570 GPU -- a move that allowed Lenovo to lower the starting price even further to $499. Those are already shipping now -- in fact, if you've got a watchful eye, you may have already noticed them pop up in some online retailers.
