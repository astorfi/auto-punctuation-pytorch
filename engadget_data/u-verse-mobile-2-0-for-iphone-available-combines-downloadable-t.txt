Now dubbed U-Verse Mobile, it still allows users to manage and schedule DVR recordings on the go, but now has an updated UI, a favorite channels list, and most notably will allow users (with the U399 or U450 packages) to download a limited selection of shows directly to their phone. While that should make it easier to catch up with Lost, Grey's Anatomy or whatever other shows AT&T makes available while on the subway or otherwise out of streaming reach you won't be downloading your own DVR recordings, and you won't downloading any of them over 3G since that's WiFi only. While AT&T is loudly proclaiming it's the first to allow downloads, by comparison Dish already lets users Sling whatever they want from its 922 -- if they can get it to work right now. Check out the press release and a quick video demo after the break if you're still not exactly sure how all this will go down, or just go straight to iTunes and grab the free app right now. Blackberry Torch fans should keep an eye out too, since a compatible version is on the way -- no word yet on Android or webOS.
