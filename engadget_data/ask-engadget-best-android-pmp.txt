   We know you've got questions, and if you're brave enough to ask the world for answers, here's the outlet to do so. This week's Ask Engadget inquiry is from Livebriand who wants the Android equivalent of an iPod Touch. If you're looking to send in an inquiry of your own, drop us a line at ask [at] engadget [dawt] com.  "What would be the best Android PMP (basically, an Android iPod Touch) to get? I don't want a data plan and I'm normally within WiFi, so I just want to run apps and surf the internet from it. The best thing I've found so far is the Galaxy Player, but that's only got Gingerbread. What suggestions do you guys have?"If we're honest, we're not sure if he'd just be better off with a small tablet, but his wish is our command. A PMP-class device that runs Honeycomb or better, that's a more attractive prospect than the Gingerbread-running Galaxy Player? Does such a device exist, or would it be better just to get the ROMs out and pimp one of Samsung's devices that way? You know the answers dear friends, don't let us down.
