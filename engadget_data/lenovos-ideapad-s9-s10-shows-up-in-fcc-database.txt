Long after coming to grips with the fact that Lenovo was indeed producing an IdeaPad S9 and S10, the netbook(s) have surfaced in the FCC's lair. Interestingly, the User Guide looks to tackle both machines in one fell swoop, suggesting that there's not enough difference to warrant the writing of two whole pamphlets that no one will read. There's not too much here that you didn't already know, but it's always a great sign to see a machine make it past this federal hurdle.
