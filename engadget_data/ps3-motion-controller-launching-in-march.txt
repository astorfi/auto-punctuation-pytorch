That's the name attributed to the author of a Microsoft Word document sitting on SEGA America's official FTP site at this very moment. The .doc file resides in SEGA's otherwise benign "news" directory. Now, it's very possible that the document could have been uploaded in jest as an Internet prank. But assuming it's real, then these meeting minutes between SEGA and Sony on August 5th reveal quite a few tantalizing details. Chiefly, that Sony will be launching its PS3 motion controller in Japan in March of 2010, Spring elsewhere. There's also discussion of PlayStation 2 emulation on the PS3 with a note that "SCEA wants to sell all PS2 titles on PSN (GTA Vice City/Sonic/etc)." Want more? Then hit up the read link and download the document yourself. Else, you'll just have to hope for news from the Tokyo Game Show kicking off Thursday. Update: The document has been pulled. We've added the full text after the break.[Via Gamesindustry.biz, thanks DarKlar]Read [Warning: FTP link]

Initial level too challenging for players. "Mass Effect felt more RPG." * Review notes sent to John Merlino a few weeks prior. After meeting Gerald mentioned AP is a high priority for his team.Planet 51* Sell in of PS3 SKU – SCEA noted that other movie titles on PS3 had underperformed as well (inc. Transformers) this cycle.* Dyer suggests contacting Susan at Walmart and asking what she wants in the pack to sell this SKU (movie tix etc)* Other possibilities are Hybrid movie disc (BD 25 or 50 with Game and Movie on same disc).Bayonetta* Collectors edition with Bayonetta Action Figure* Novo recommended launching PSN demo around Xmas based off a Jan 5th Ship date with 2-3 week run out to launch.* 3-4 weeks is usually ideal demo timing with fresh content every week leading up to launch (trailers, insider video about PG heritage, video blogs).Vancouver 2010* HOME, Olympic destination would garner a lot of positive attention from SCEA* Should be doing same with Bayonetta, Marvel etc. Easy to launch in all territories. * HOME merchandizing opportunities (clothes etc).Sonic Racing* Open to DLC to differentiate PS3 SKU – not ratchet and clank but other characters o maybe characters from Rare or Fable universesYakuza* Could put Japanese games directly on PSN for download in a special Japanese Import section (pricing $9.99 to $39.99 for full game). * Might need to localize menus at least with subtitles. * SCEA interested in helping on MKTG side if they can have period of exclusivity.AVP* Another great HOME candidate* AVP avatars* Hybrid BD disc with movieIron Man 2* Great candidate for HOME space – explore Tony Stark's lab etc. * Should have one for Marvel in general.PSU2* Could do bundle at GameStop with PSP 30-35K units on UMD, Go, or both. Valkyria 1937* Could bundle with PSP as well.Vanquish and Aliens: CM* Opportunity for PS3/PSP interoperability (see Eidos Batman, Army of Two, Assassin's Creed for good examples). * If we offer that SCEA would be really interested in having us at their booth next E3.ThorSCEA would like a look at the code soon.Sonic Anniversary* Could put out collectors edition with all old sonic games on one BD disc. * "Best of Sonic" for around $99.* SCEA would love PSN exclusive power ups/different game modes (like Castlevania's flip it over/backwards)PS2 emulator for PS3 (confidential)* SCEA wants to sell all PS2 titles on PSN (GTA Vice City/Sonic/etc)* For co Marketing money show PS3 controller on TV ads – similar to EA Madden Spots, NCAA, etc...London Olympics* Perfect opportunity for Motion Controller integration.DC Digital Titles* If we provide a list of DC titles SCEA will let us know which ones they're interested in having exclusively. * If we give them a long period of exclusivity they'll give us more marketing support.PSP Titles* For SKU differentiation it's best to offer features that are slightly different from PS3 version. * Titles that are coming up on PSP are Assassin's Creed II, GTA China Wars, Resident Evil, Little Big Planet – all massive franchises.* SCEA has a specific PSP deck which they can send up with their hardware director for a chat.
