Now live in v2.5.0 is a basic search function (titles or episode name only, keywords, cast and crew are coming soon), support for closed captions and the ability to block certain channels on the app for parents. There's also a few bug fixes for those experiencing audio issues or not seeing their HD channels in the lineup -- subscribers can check out the official blog for more details or just grab the free app on iTunes.
