The carmaker announced this week that the 2012 Volt base price will come in a grand lower than its predecessor, thanks to the sorts of additional configurations that come with increased availability. The 2011 version was available in seven states and the District of Columbia and came in three configurations -- 2012's Volt is available nationwide in seven different packages, ranging from $39,995 to $46,265. And keep in mind that those prices don't factor in potential tax credits. The latest version of the plug-in vehicle is available now for order and offers up features like MyLink media streaming, OnStar driving directions, and passive locking (though the new base model does strip away a couple of features found in its predecessor). Also there's the whole lessening your dependence on gasoline, if you're into that sort of thing.

The suggested retail price for the award-winning Volt will start at $39,995 (or $32,495 assuming a full federal tax credit of $7,500, which is subject to the customer's eligibility). The price includes an $850 destination freight charge but excludes tax, title and license fees. The starting price of the 2012 model is more than $1,000 below the 2011 base model. 			The lower base price is possible in part because of a wider range of options and configurations that come with the expansion of Volt production for sale nationally. The 2011 model was available in just seven states and the District of Columbia. 			For 2012, consumers will be able to choose from a total of seven option packages compared with only three for the 2011 model.
