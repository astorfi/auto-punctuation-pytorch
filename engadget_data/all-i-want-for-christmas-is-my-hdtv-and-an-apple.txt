HDTV (35%)
Windows-based notebook (20%)
Digital camera (17%)
Windows-based desktop computer
GPS car navigation
Cellphone
Digital video camera
Nintendo Wii
Sony PS3
HD DVD or Blu-ray player

So where's Apple, the big bad daddy of consumer electronics? Well, their best showing was the MacBook with an 11 ranking followed by the iPhone at number 15. Pretty good when you consider the level of brand awareness this represents in a field of otherwise unspecified laptops and cellphones. In fact, 1-in-6 consumers are hoping for some type of Apple gear under the Chanukazaa tree this season.
