Nintendo's cutting out the middleman and going straight to consumers. Today, the company's UK outfit launched a full-fledged online shop that aims to sell a range of games and consoles from its existing product lines. Unlike Nintendo's US online retail effort, which is really a "store" in name only, this UK site doesn't redirect consumers to third-party retailers and instead ships to consumers directly from the company's stock.


Apart from offering games and consoles across the Wii U, Wii, 3DS and DS product lines, the UK online shop will also offer exclusives like limited edition 3DS consoles and pack-in figurines like this Wind Waker bundle, in addition to free delivery (orders over Â£200 qualify for next day) and 12-month extended warranties for consoles. There's no word on whether or not other regions like the US will see a similar service or why Nintendo chose to launch this first in the UK. We've reached out to Nintendo for comment and will update you when we hear back. No matter, though, as this is definitely a welcome move for the sometimes stubborn gaming legend.
