It's not easy when the Taiwanese computer company pumps out new ones nearly every month, but we doubt we'll easily forget the Eee PC 1015PW's distinctive shade of purple. Otherwise, TechinStyle reports it's much the same as the 1015PEM, which isn't a terrible thing -- it's got a dual-core 1.5GHz Intel Atom N550 CPU, 802.11n WiFi, Bluetooth 3.0 and a 250GB or 320GB hard drive under that chiclet keyboard, plus the usual 10.1-inch, 1024 x 600 LED-backlit screen. No word on pricing or availability, but the way these things usually go, you'll find it in Europe well before the States.
