Nikon went back to training, pledging to take the G11 to the ropes, and now we have the first indications of what the new competition will look like. Called the P7000, the follow-up compact will naturally be quite similar to its predecessor (pictured above), but is said to move up to a physically larger 1/1.7-inch sensor with a lower, 10 megapixel resolution -- just like the G11. It's also said to offer a 28 - 200mm zoom lens with an f/2.8 - 5.6 range, rather more flexible than the G11's 28 - 140mm, f/2.8 - 4.5 glass. No confirmation from Nikon on these specs yet, but we reckon it won't be long before this fighter gets its trunks on.
