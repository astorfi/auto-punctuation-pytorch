Palm just dropped a bomb with a Mobile Hotspot app that'll bring WiFi routing to up to five devices, not unlike the MiFi devices already offered by both Sprint and Verizon. That's awesome, right up until the moment that the networks totally saturate -- but until then, you'd best believe we're going to be riding this wave of glorious 3G. The company says that the app is subject to a monthly data plan from your carrier of choice -- no surprise there -- so don't expect to get in on this action for free.
