  Tobii has managed to impress quite a few folks with its eye-tracking technology -- most recently in the form of the "Eye Asteroids" arcade game -- and it looks like Intel has been paying particularly close attention to the company. As Computer Sweden reports, Intel (or Intel Capital, specifically) has now shelled out roughly $21 million to buy a ten percent stake in the Swedish company, which hopes to soon see its eye-tracking system used in everything from desktops and laptops to phones and even vehicles. Presumably, having Intel at the table will give it a considerable boost in those endeavors.
