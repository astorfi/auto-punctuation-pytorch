Still, there have been murmurs of a comeback, and Unwired View's historically reliable @evleaks has obevleakstained specs for what's supposedly the follow-up. The HTC Myst (Myst #UL, to be exact) wouldn't have any special tricks on the surface beyond preloaded Facebook apps, but it could be surprisingly well-equipped for a mid-range Jelly Bean device: a 4.3-inch 720p screen, a dual-core 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4, LTE and 16GB of non-expandable storage would be nothing to sneeze at. About the only sacrifices would be the 1GB of RAM and a potentially UltraPixel-free 5-megapixel rear camera. While there's no guarantee that these details will reflect a shipping device, there's talk of the Myst reaching the US as early as the spring -- we won't have long to learn the truth. Just don't expect that other Myst in the box.
