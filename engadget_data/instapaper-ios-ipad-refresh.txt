Instapaper's likely working just fine on your iDevice, but its latest update brings more oomph to the iPad. Although it doesn't get a complete overhaul, the upgraded app has notched a fluffed up interface for Apple's slate, along with the capability to better parse and organize videos. Betaworks' recent acquisition now also boasts a sorting and filtering function that's essentially the Android version's InstaRank with an iPad-specific UI. That means the app can order your articles based on several factors like popularity, length and date that could make choosing what to read first a lot easier. Unfortunately, those fond of its charcoal-colored dark mode are now stuck with gray text on a stark black background. If that's not a dealbreaker (and you like sepia mode better anyway), you can download the newest version of Instapaper right now from the App Store.
