While most of the information is locked down, it's pretty clear by that label that we can expect at least one version of the X-Fi to ship with 32GB of flash memory. Testing was done across a trio of 802.11b/g channels so that's a lock as well. While an appearance on the FCC site doesn't guarantee that the device will be sold in the US (we're looking at you, Japanese FOMA phones), we're guessing that a US launch announcement will come any day now. Although at this point, we'd settle for Creative just making the X-Fi series official so all this speculation can come to an end.[Via Pocketables]
