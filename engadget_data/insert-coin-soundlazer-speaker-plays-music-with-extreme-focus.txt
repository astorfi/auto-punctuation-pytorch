 In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line. Here's a neat little project -- a parametric speaker that can only really be heard from the front. According to its inventor, the Soundlazer utilizes ultrasonic carrier waves, focusing its output in a single direction. The Soundlazer has a 20 to 30 foot range. You can hear it from head-on, but if you move to the side or shift the direction of the speaker a bit, the output drops off. The project has 52 days to go, to reach its goal of $48,000. Interested parties who pledge $175 or more will get a fully assembled speaker kit. To see the device in action, check out the video after the break.
      

 

    Previous project update: Well, lookee here -- it seems the public can't wait to get its hands on one of those cool Galileo iPhone platforms. The device has gone well passed its funding goal of $100,000, with 24 days left to contribute.
