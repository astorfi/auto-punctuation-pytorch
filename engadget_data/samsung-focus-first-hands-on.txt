The curvy, glossy slate has a 4-inch WVGA Super AMOLED display, and feels a lot like the Samsung Vibrant. AT&T's touting that the 9.9-millimeter / .3-inch device is the slimmest Windows Phone handset yet, and we do have to say it's pretty darn slim. We'll be going back for more soon, but feast your eyes on the gallery and video below...
