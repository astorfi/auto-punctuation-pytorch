The second installment of Samsung's 2013 "Unpacked" event series is scheduled for the first Wednesday in September, just before the annual IFA consumer electronics show kicks off in Berlin. As the sketched invite above confirms, the Galaxy Note III will undoubtedly be the star of this show, which is set to begin at 7PM local time (1PM ET) on September 4th. We'll of course be there to cover the festivities live from the German capital, and Samsung's promised to provide a YouTube livestream feed that you can follow along with as well.
