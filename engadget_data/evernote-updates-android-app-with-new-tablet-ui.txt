Today the app steps up to version 4.1, and it includes a new UI for tablets that matches the interface on phones, complete with a streamlined list view and swipe interactions, such as for making the note list full-screen. Both phone and tablet users can now create sub-lists, and Evernote included the requisite bug fixes and performance tweaks as well. Check out the latest version for yourself by nabbing the free download on Google Play.
