Our tipster let us know these screens were a part of a survey that focused on which version of the guide was best (Verizon - we've got plenty of suggestions for you right here.) We like the widescreen layout they're indicating, and that 1080p notation underneath the Quantum of Solace box shown above isn't too shabby either. The price of $29.99 to buy an HD copy? Not so sweet. Check out the rest of the screens in the gallery and let us know if they pass the test.[Thanks, Matt!]
