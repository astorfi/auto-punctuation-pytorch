Actually, we already knew about the Samsung u540, but last time we visited it we were a bit slim in the details department; a tipster has since managed to fill out the blanks for us. We don't have a price, but we're guessing that a minimal cash layout (after $50 mail-in rebate) is going to get you tethering capability with an EV-DO radio (albeit Rev. 0), microSD expansion, navigation, 2.1 inch primary display, and all the usual VCAST goodies -- minus VCAST TV, of course. Expect a launch rather soonly.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
