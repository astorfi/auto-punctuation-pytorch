Worried that the all-electric Formula E racing league will somehow be less exciting than its gas-powered Formula 1 counterpart? Don't be. The inaugural Beijing race ended on Saturday with about as much drama as you'd expect from conventional motorsports. The last lap involved a neck-and-neck battle between Renault's Nicolas Prost and Venturi's Nick Heidfeld that ended in a spectacular crash at the last corner (shown below); Prost says he inadvertently clipped Heidfeld while jockeying for position. Audi's Lucas di Grassi ultimately claimed the historic first win by waltzing past his wrecked rivals. There's no guarantees that the upcoming Malaysia race will produce such a spectacular finish, but it's clear that eco-friendly competitions don't necessarily lead to friendly driving.
