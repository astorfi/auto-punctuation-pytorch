Wait, just January? Seriously, people, you'd have thought this would've come up by now. Anyway, Activision says that Gibson is still a "good partner," just that it "disagrees with the applicability of their patent and would like a legal determination on this." We're sure it would. Gibson's patent apparently involves playing an instrument of some kind along with a pre-recorded concert while wearing what is described as a "3-D headset," so there seems to be some overlap, but we'll see what the court says -- something tells us explaining Guitar Hero to the judge is going to be relatively amusing.Update: On reading the patent, Gibson's system is designed to be used with a "musical instrument" -- and no matter what the Guitar Zeros have to say, we don't think Guitar Hero controllers really qualify. It'll definitely be interesting to see what the court has to say about that, no?
