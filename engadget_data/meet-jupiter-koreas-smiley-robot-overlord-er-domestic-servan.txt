But the tiny terminator has come a long way in just a few shortweeks. It now has a name -- Jupiter -- and there are photos of what looks to be an actual working prototype interactingwith a human who foolishly thinks she's controlling it. Jupiter can reportedly emulate emotions, body language and dolots of other creepy stuff, including recite stories to the kids. It also comes equipped with a handy flip out LCDdisplay, so it can double as an entertainment unit -- and boasts pointy appendages that we can only assume are usedboth as sensory devices and for defensive (and offensive) purposes. Jupe is able to plug itself in to recharge withouthelp, and can respond to voice commands -- or pleas for mercy. As previously noted, the bot will get its marchingorders wirelessly over the net. The invasionbegins in October.
