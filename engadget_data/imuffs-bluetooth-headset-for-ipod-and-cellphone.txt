Aight, people, we're not gonna lie to you and pretend these things weren't rather unfortunately named. Still, they
promise Bluetooth integration between your iPod, your phone, and your ears, which is potentially a good thing no matter
what they're called. When the phone rings, the iMuffs pause your tunes and answer the call, allowing you to speak
through the integrated microphone. They charge by USB and reportedly will go for about 12 hours between charges.
Controls live right on the headset itself for play/pause, volume, and track skip. They're not taking any orders yet, so
no word on price for these â€” if you're curious, sign up on the website to get an email when they're ready to take your
money.


 [Thanks, Skip]
