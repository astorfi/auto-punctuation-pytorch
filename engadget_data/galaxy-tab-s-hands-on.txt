When Samsung first made what it considered to be the definitive Android smartphone, it called it the Galaxy S and has stuck with that naming convention for every flagship phone it's made since. That tiny little badge of distinction has never wound up on one of the company's many, many tablets... until now. As if you still had any lingering doubts, Samsung firmly believes that the new Galaxy Tab S family are the best tablets it's ever crafted... and it's mostly because of those tremendous Super AMOLED screens. We got a chance to take those new beauties for a spin -- read on to see what we thought.





By now you know Samsung crafted two different flavors of the Galaxy Tab S -- an 8.4-inch model and a 10.5 model -- and aside from the one obvious difference, they're just about identical. Both look like stretched-out Galaxy S5's, both pack the same Exynos 5 Octa chipset (a mashup of a 1.9GHz quad-core chip, a 1.3GHz quad-core chip and 3GB of RAM), and both run Android 4.4 KitKat underneath Samsung's usual TouchWiz UI. Finally, both pack fingerprint scanners in their home buttons. Let's put all that stuff aside for a moment, though. The screens are the real stars of the show here, and they are something to behold.

People have been singing the praises of Super AMOLED for what feels like ages now. Stop me if this sounds familiar: colors appear richer and more vivid, blacks are deeper and more sumptuous, and whites come through very crisply. All those of observations still hold true for the Galaxy Tab Ss, but they seem so much more pronounced and impactful on those bigger, 2,560 x 1,600 screens. Remember: the last time Samsung experimented with a Super AMOLED screen in a tablet, it was in this weird little guy from years ago. If we're picking nits the 8.4-inch model is technically more pixel dense, but my eyes couldn't discern individual pixels on either tab.
