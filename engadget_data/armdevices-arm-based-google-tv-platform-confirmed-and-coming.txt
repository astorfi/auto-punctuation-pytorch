 Well, it looks like Windows might not be the only new territory for ARM in 2011 -- ARMdevices is reporting that it has it on "very high authority from someone at Google" that an ARM-powered Google TV platform is "confirmed" and "coming soon." That authority is unsurprisingly remaining anonymous, however, and apparently hasn't provided much else in the way of details. This is far from the first time we've heard talk of ARM for Google TV, though -- as ARMdevices points out, even ARM President Tudor Brown weighed in on the matter back in November, saying that "if Google TV is to be mainstream, it must be built on a lower power system... on lower cost technology," with ARM presumably fitting the bill on both counts.
