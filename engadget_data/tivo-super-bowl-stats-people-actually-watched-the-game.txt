According to TiVo, the Steelers' "gadget play" touchdownbeat out all of the commercials for viewership. Meanwhile, despite tons of pre-game hype, Jessica Simpson's steamyPizza Hut commercial didn't even rank in the Top 10, which was led by Ameriquest's two spots, and also included LeonardNimoy's Aleve ad and four spots from Anheuser-Busch.
