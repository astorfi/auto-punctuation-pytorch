Being the number two TV manufacturer, Toshiba has to make a big move in televisions, and their push this year will
be into SED (surface-conduction electron-emitter display)
TVs, something that number one Sony doesn't have. The lineup will start with 50-inch screen sizes, featuring 1080
progressive support, 8600:1 contrast ratio, 1ms response speed, and one-third the power consumption of plasmas. It
sounds sweet, but it'll be exclusive - 'Ferrari-priced' (we hope that doesn't mean 150 large for one) with limited
distribution in 2005, then production ramping up next year. There will be a private showing at CES along with their
partner Canon, which we look forward to peeping.
