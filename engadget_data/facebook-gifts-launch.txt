 Previously a limited run by invite-only, Facebook's decided to open its Gifts feature to all of itsUS users. As it stands, present choices are focused around food and soft toys, but today's launch also added a core new option -- wine. According to AllThingsD, there will be different offerings from 16 different winemakers and all with the necessary age-verification checks you'd expect from a responsible social network, naturally. While options are still a little narrow, we'd expect Facebook to seriously ramp up its retail partners and gift choice through 2013 -- and hopefully no more virtual presents.
