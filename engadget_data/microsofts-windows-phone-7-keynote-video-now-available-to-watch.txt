It's kicked off by the big dog himself, Steve Ballmer, followed by Ralph de la Vega and Joe Belfiore giving us the lowdown on carrier pricing and new features. It's good, we promise. Though we can't guarantee it's quite as awesome as the UK presentation, which included a Stephen Fry soliloquy on the subject of smartphones, diversity, and Microsoft's redemption. That one we've got stored in our hearts, which, regrettably, don't yet come with a HDMI output. Video after the break.
