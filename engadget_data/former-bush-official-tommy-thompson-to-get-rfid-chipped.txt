Okay, we know the whole RFID implant
thang is old news now, with folks opting to implant the little buggers for
medical reasons, for
identification purposes, or
just because — but this is the first time we've heard of
someone doing it out of sheer desire to promote the wonders of RFID. It's also the first quasi-celebrity we know of
opting to get chipped (yeah, we're sure
Paris is right behind). Tommy
Thompson, the former Governor of Wisconsin and Health and Human Services Secretary during Bush's first term, is now on
the board of directors of Applied Digital, the company that owns
VeriChip — makers of subcutaneous RFID tags for
fun and profit humans and pets. Merely by way of promoting the concepts behind RFID, Thompson himself
is gonna go and get chipped. So how long before someone hacks up a way to track him via Google maps?
