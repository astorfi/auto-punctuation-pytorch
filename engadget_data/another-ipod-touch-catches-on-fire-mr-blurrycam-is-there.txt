Still, our second set of blurry "my iPod touch caught on fire" pictures certainly has us reaching for our Flaming Goblet of Skepticism (+3 WIS). Similar to Max's experience a couple days ago, tipster Ryan F. says his iPod caught on fire from the inside. Ryan says he plugged it in to charge and it showed a dead battery, then the screen went white and the device started to get super hot, so he unplugged it but it continued to burn. The fire ended up leaving a blackish orangish circle in the screen, along with a brown dent in the metal on the back (pictured after the break). Ryan's going to try and track down a better camera to take some better pictures of the damage.
