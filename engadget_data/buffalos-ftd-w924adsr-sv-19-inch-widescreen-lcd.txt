The 19-inch 16:10 widescreen display runs at a 1,440 x 900 resolution, with a 5ms response time and 800:1 contrast ratio. For inputs the LCD can take VGA and DVI-D, along with audio input to power the back-mounted stereo speakers. According to recent sales numbers, 19-inch LCDs seem to be the new black, so we're guessing this display should do pretty well for itself when Buffalo drops it in a week or so for some as-of-yet undisclosed price.[Via Impress]
