All that's required here is your phone's IMEI number, which in return gives you the unlocking key to go with the Android SDK's fastboot program -- all will be clear once you've read the instructions at the source link. But remember: SE does warn that this service may void your warranty if all goes pear-shaped, so just be careful, won't ya?
