Of course, Sony has flip-flopped so much on this issue that it's hard to take this sort of "news" with anything other than a massive grain of salt. Regardless, according to Mr. Pachter, "the Sony entry level price of USD 499 is here to stay." So frugal PS3 fans, take heart... or don't take heart. Honestly, it's just really tough to say right now.
