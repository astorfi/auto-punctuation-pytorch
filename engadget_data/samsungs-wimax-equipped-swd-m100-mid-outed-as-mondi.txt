The device will utilize Clearwire's Mobile WiMAX network simply dubbed "Clear." Last we heard it was running Windows Mobile 6.1, but seeing as its sporting that dedicated Windows button required for WinMo 6.5, that all could change before it's release. Speaking of which, mum's the word on pricing or availability, we're afraid.[Via Phonescoop]
