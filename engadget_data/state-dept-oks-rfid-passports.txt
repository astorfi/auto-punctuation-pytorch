Passport-embedded RFID tags are back with a vengeance, as the State Department has given the go-ahead for December
testing of a new system with enhanced security features, following
intense public pressure that forced them to
scuttle their original design this past June. The new
arrangement contains two key security upgrades: embedded anti-skimming material to prevent non-authorized personnel
from stealing personal data and Basic Access Control, which requires user-certification before the RFID chip will
broadcast its signal. State Department officials promise that the tech jibes with guidelines set by the U.N.-affiliated
International Civilian Aviation Organization, the body tasked with setting international machine-readable passport
standards. Assuming the tests go as planned, and the ACLU remains placated, expect Uncle Sam to start issuing these
high tech ID's early next year.
