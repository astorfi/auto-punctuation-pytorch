AppleInsider is reporting that Apple has instructed its authorized service providers to replace any
5G iPods that exhibit "any type
of hardware failure [including] those that would normally be classified as abuse," in a message to its channel
partners. This limited-time policy is being seen as a preemptive customer relations booster, and not (yet) as a sign
that the new 'Pods with video have some unannounced inherent defect. The announcement comes at a time when Apple is
under fire for the scratchability of the
nano, having recently been hit with a class action
lawsuit.Â
