Bits from Bytes has recently announced the BFB 3000, available with up to three print heads, an SD card reader, a printing area of 320mm x 300mm x 200mm, and a max print speed of 15mm3 per second. Available soon for about Â£2,000. We suppose you'll be ordering a couple, right? Either way, get a closer look in the gallery below.
