With each successive round of gaming consoles, developers get a little more inventive with the available technology -- the same goes for how they tease their audience ahead of a game's launch, too. Turtle Rock Studios (the team behind Left 4 Dead) recently released an interactive trailer for its upcoming co-op shooter, Evolve. The clip follows a session of four players as they stalk and then battle the gigantic, player-controlled creature that's out to end them. The rub of it is that with a single mouse-click you can swap between the perspectives of each combatant on-the-fly, and watch how the game unfolds from their respective points of view. Want jump from bipedal-monstrosity to soldier and back again just before the former attacks the latter? Go for it.



This flies in the face of how hype trailers are typically assembled, and almost makes a game out of watching the video itself. The trade-off, though, is that the footage is horribly compressed and falls victim to YouTube's frame-rate limit. If you want a better idea of how the game will look when it releases this fall, Gamersyde is hosting a 1080p at 60fps version of the video for download. The downside of that is you lose the interactivity: it's a meticulously edited super-cut with play-by-play and color commentary from the dev team and E-sports announcer Aaron Chambers. For now, however, it's the best way to experience the game -- short of actually playing it yourself, of course.
