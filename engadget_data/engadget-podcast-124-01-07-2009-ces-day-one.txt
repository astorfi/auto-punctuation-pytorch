 


It's Wednesday in Las Vegas: a little chilly, a lot CES-y. Join your fearlessly caffeinated Engadget Podcast team as it pauses to reflect on the tranquility (and hardware) that came with the final Macworld keynote from Apple, and the technological wizardry that may, may not, or might have already come from the 2009 Consumer Electronics Show. Stay tuned -- we'll be rolling out a new podcast for each magical day of the show!

Hosts: Joshua Topolsky, Paul Miller, Nilay Patel
Producer: Trent Wolbe
Song: Another One Bites the Dust
