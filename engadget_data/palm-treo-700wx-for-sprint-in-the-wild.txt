Still no solid word on an official availability date, but stores who've received them have apparently been instructed to keep them under lock and key until Sprint proper starts offering them, meaning the previously-reported August 27 date for business customers still seems perfectly plausible. Now if you'll excuse us, we have a Treo 750 rumor mill to attend to.
