Half the size of its last iteration, AOpen's XC Cube Mini MZ855-II is a
small form factor desktop weighing in
at 4 pounds, measuring 7.75 x 4.25 x 12.75 inches. They scored desktop power in a small case by endowing it with the
Pentium M processor normally found in notebooks (less power consumption, less fans, less bulk). AOpen will be putting
out fully-configured consumer models, but will also offer a bare bones version for the user who wants to build their
own â€” that'll come in at $449. There's also the option to add an "expander" module that stacks on top of the Cube
Mini's case, and can be configured in a number of ways to include hard drives, CD/DVD drives, power supply, cooling
equipment, or audio amplifier and/or speakers.
