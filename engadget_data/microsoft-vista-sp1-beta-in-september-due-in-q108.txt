 Looks like Microsoft is finally ready to tell people what the hell is going on with the first Vista service pack: chock full o' bug fixes, performance optimizations, and improved reliability, Microsoft is shooting the beta to between 10,000 - 15,000 people in September (which means it'll be about 10 minutes after release before you can get it on BitTorrent -- not that it isn't already) and is intending to launch it officially in Q1 of 2008. We're reserving judgment on just how badly it's needed or just how many people are itching for it, we just want the thing out, and ASAP.
