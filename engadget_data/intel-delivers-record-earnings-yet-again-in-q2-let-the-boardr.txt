 We know, you've heard it all before, but the chip maker's once again reporting record revenues, reaching a whopping $13.1 billion in Q2 2011. If you're keeping track, that's up $2.3 billion, or 22 percent, from Q2 2010, and bests last quarter's earnings of $12.9 billion by 2 percent. Net income was up 10 percent year-over-year, but down three percent from last quarter, ringing in at $3.2 billion. As Intel humbly points out, this is the outfit's fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue. So, perhaps a little bit of gloating is in order.
