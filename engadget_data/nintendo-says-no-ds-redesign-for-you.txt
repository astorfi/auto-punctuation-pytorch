According to GamesIndustry.biz, Nintendo Europe calls the reports to the contrary to be"pure rumour and speculation," which really cuts us to the core, while at the same time being a completelyaccurate assessment of the situation. Oh well, we've still got around 49 weeks or so left in '06 for our dreams to cometrue.[Via Eurogamer]
