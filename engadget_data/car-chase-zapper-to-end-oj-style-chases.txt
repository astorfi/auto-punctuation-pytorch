Carbon paper, fax machines…the PDA and now the car chase— say goodbye to TV news interruptions bringing you live
coverage of the car chase, thanks to the new zapper.




A new device could effectively end car chases by zapping car microprocessors with a quick jolt of energy. The
 prototype has been commissioned by law enforcement agencies such as the Los Angeles Police Department, and could be
 ready as soon as next summer.






  When the radio waves hit the targeted car, they induce surges of electricity in its electronics, upsetting the fuel
 injection and engine firing signals. "It works on most cars built in the past 10 years, because their engines are
 controlled by computer chips," said Dr Giri. "If we can disrupt the computer, we can stop the car." A prototype is
 due to be ready by next summer.



Hear NPR's Robert Siegel and David Giri, president of ProTech, the product's maker.
