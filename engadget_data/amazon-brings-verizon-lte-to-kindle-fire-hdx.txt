Okay, okay, one more bit of info to share from Amazon tonight. Those snazzy new Fire HDX tablets are, as expected, getting cellular options. This time out, however, the company is adding an additional carrier. In addition to AT&T, Fire buyers will be able to go with a Verizon version. That upgrade will cost you an extra $100 on top of the base price, bringing the 7-inch version to $329 and the 8.9-inch one to $479. According to Amazon, "standard plans" will be supported for the two carriers. A breakdown of that pricing can be found after the break.



AT&T:
路 Mobile Share is $10/month to add your Kindle Fire HD to an existing AT&T voice and data plan.
路 Individual data plan options currently are:
o $14.99/mo for 250MB
