CEO Reed Hastings recently took to Facebook to announce that subscribers have watched over one billion hours of content in a single month, for the "first time ever." As Tech Crunch points out, that's about one hour of video-viewing per day against the five hours that the regular ole tube garners. Hastings also mentioned he's excited about the service's exclusive rights to House of Cards and Arrested Development, declaring that they'll help to "blow these records away." If you'll recall, back in January the company claimed 26 million streaming subscribers worldwide, compared to just over 10 million who opted for discs -- it'll be very interesting to see how these fluctuate given its newer takes on content.
