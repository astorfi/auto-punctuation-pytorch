Which makes the company's latest attempt at viral marketing come off as more of an exercise in unnecessary bragging, than a straight, feature-touting webmercial. The video, made for the hardware maker's college-focused Campus Life website, walks viewers through a brief description of the Gorilla Glass coating that gives the Honeycomb-based tab its damage-resistant properties, before putting the slate through a series of stress tests. While we've always been told sticks and stones would break our bones, apparently keys, Canadian change and screws won't harm the Transformer. The sole chink in this popular pad's ion exchanging armor? Archery, of course.
