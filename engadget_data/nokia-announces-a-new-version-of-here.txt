At its Nokia Lumia 1020 launch event, Nokia's just announced a new version of its Here Maps app that's bringing more features to Livesight location-based augmented reality. On top of letting you pan around on the view finder and see info for shops and other landmarks as before, you'll also be able to tap the "virtual signs" in the view and see more details and similar location categories. As before, the app will work without a data connection, "much to the regret of our AT&T partners," as CEO Stephen Elop put it. There's no firm date for the update as of yet, But Nokia said it'll hit all its Lumia devices when it does, as with all the recently announced Here updates.
