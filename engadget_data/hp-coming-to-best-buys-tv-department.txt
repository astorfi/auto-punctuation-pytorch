 Best Buy is going to start carrying HP's LCDs and plasmas. These HDTVs are going to start arriving in late April so get your pocketbooks credit cards ready. Then again in August get that plastic out as they will be receiving their MediaSmart TVs in select markets. Maybe they will start carrying their DLPs too. That sure would be swell!I wonder when other retailers will be getting "new" brands like HP and Oppo? The home electronic market is getting stale and needs some shaking up.
