Such is the world that Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D enters, and instead of focusing on the strong story and character development featured in previous films, its trailer (embedded after the break) goes out of its way to namedrop Avatar and mention this flick was filmed using the camera techniques pioneered on our friend Jimmy C's blockbuster smash. All you have to do is say zombies and we're halfway there but even without the blue aliens, are you going to be quicker to shell out for a natively-filmed-in-3D flick in the theaters?
