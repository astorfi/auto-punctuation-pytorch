Their invention is a "light bandage" whose LEDs shine onto the affected area while the wearer is out and about, and draws power from an iPod-sized battery pack. The device is based on the principles of photodynamic therapy treatment (PDT), which is traditionally used to treat skin cancer; however, in current applications of PDT, patients must sit or lie still while sitting under huge light sources. Of course, this means that now you can go lay on the beach to get your tan on, absorbing ultraviolet rays while wearing a light bandage to treat your skin cancer. Perfect.[Via medGadget]
