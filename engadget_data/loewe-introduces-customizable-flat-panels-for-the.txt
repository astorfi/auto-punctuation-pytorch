Used to be when you went to the "TV store" you had two choices: buy the RCA or don't buy the RCA. Nowadays, not only
do we have approximately one million brands to choose from, some manufacturers are actually letting us tweak individual
models to suit our personal tastes and decor. Taking a cue from the
Hannspree line of artsy flat-panels, Loewe began showing
off their customizable displays at Berlin's IFA.
Loewe lets you mix-and-match different-colored front panels and side insets to create over 400 combinations of designer
goodness. What's more, the super-wealthy can order one-off models specially manufactured with leather trim or Swarovski
crystals. Finally, we know what to get Paris and Paris for their big day.
