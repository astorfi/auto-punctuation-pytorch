The Moxi is currently only available to certain cable subscribers throughout the country, until now, err next year anyways. A couple execs from Digeo; Mike Fidler and Greg Gudorf, said they will show the retail STB at CES in January to be priced at around $1,000 and they hope to get the box to market by Fall 2007. They go on to talk about all the great features and compare the box to the recently released Series3, but the details get a little muddy from there. One thing they mention is Multi-stream CableCARDs and support for VOD, hmmm, plus they say that the latest Series3 isn't Multi-stream CableCARD compliant, which it is. I think the execs got confused and mixed up Multi-Stream with CableCARD 2.0, an innocent mistake that many made last year at CES when visiting the TiVo both. We wonder when this device will make it to market, when some don't even think CC 2.0 will be finalized by then never the less deployed. Where not sure what else could make this thing worth twice as much as a Series3, assuming the Series3 is down to $500 in a year. [ Via Zatznotfunny.com]
