The boys at CheapAssGamer (who snagged the original ad) have gotten their hands on more evidence that the $50 Xbox 360 price cut is indeed coming. Of course, this could be Photoshopped too, but who's really going to all the trouble of doctoring two separate ads to depict this price drop? [Via Joystiq]
