So when exactly will the Moto X make its formal debut? August 1st is the date, according to a Motorola teaser announcing the launch. There's been no shortage of leaks for the new flagship smartphone, which we know will be assembled in the US and will ship to customers in a variety of colors. So far, our best look at the device has come courtesy of Eric Schmidt himself, who was showing off his own sample at the Allen and Company Conference earlier this month in Sun Valley. He declined to provide any specification details, but some attendees did sneak a peek at the handset's carbon fiber-like back and sleek curves. We'll surely be back with more, live from the August 1st launch event in New York City.
