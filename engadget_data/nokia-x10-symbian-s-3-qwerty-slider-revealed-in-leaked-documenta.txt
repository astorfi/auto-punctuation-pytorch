Of course, this would be pretty trivial to fake, so do please put on your skepticism pants before reading further. The docs detail a QWERTY sliders handset dubbed the X10, a seeming followup to Nokia's capacitive-equipped X6, but which runs Symbian S^3. In fact, it claims to be the first phone to do so, with a ARM Cortex A8 600MHz processor to help it out in such a mission, along with 256MB of RAM, 32GB or 16GB of internal storage and a 3.2-inch AMOLED capacitive touchscreen. The 5 megapixel camera listed is a far cry from the 12 megapixel N87 flagship that Nokia's said to be prepping for this new OS, but we're happy to see a front-facing camera for 15 fps video calls. Don't believe a word of it? We hardly blame you, and you can check out the video for yourself after the break to confirm or allay your suspicions.
