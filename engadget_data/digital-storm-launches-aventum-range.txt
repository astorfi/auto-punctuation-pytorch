  The last thing you want when things are getting hot in the battlefield, is for things to start heating-up under your desk too. Digital Storm's been back in the lab, looking for ways to prevent just that, and thinks it's cracked it with the new Aventum system. It's the first to be kitted out with the PC-maker's Cryo-TEC liquid cooling mechanism, and boasts a thermal exhaust, five software-regulated "zones" and no less than 13 configurable fans. The range starts with an Intel i7 2700K core, 16GB RAM, 120GB SSD (1TB HDD) and a GeForce GTX680 for $3,859. If your pockets are even deeper, then you might fancy the 2x dual Xeon E5-2630 hexacore-totin' system with 32GB DDR RAM, and three-way SLI (with the same GeForce GTX680) for a jaw dropping $7,856. With a price like that, however, it's probably your credit card that'll need cooling down. Digital Storm is taking orders as of today, and full details of the range in the PR after the break.
      

 

  Show full PR text  Digital Storm Redefines the "Custom" High-Performance PC with Aventum  Digital Storm custom designed chassis, liquid cooling system and software enables unparalleled system performance and diagnostic control, creating the world's most advanced PC  Fremont, Calif. - (March 26, 2012) – Digital Storm, the predominant name in computer system integration and engineering, unveils Aventum, the first system to feature its patent pending chassis and CES Innovations Award-winning Cryo-TEC cooling system. Designed by Digital Storm engineers from the inside out, Aventum's chassis boasts a proprietary thermal exhaust chamber, intelligent 5 thermal zone regulation and exclusive Aventum software that controls 13 customizable fans to effectively dissipate performance inhibiting heat. Together with the Cryo-TEC liquid cooling system that chills liquid below 0ºC, Digital Storm has designed the industry's first truly custom high-performance PC.  The Aventum Advantage Every aspect of Aventum's chassis has been scrutinized during months of R&D by Digital Storm engineers who utilized thermal imaging cameras to perfect the Aventum's air flow design. Starting with the patent pending thermal exhaust chamber, Digital Storm has ensured that performance diminishing heat is contained and dispersed so it doesn't recirculate through the system. The Cryo-TEC liquid cooling system utilizes direct contact heat dissipation to remove heat from the CPU and then processes that liquid through 3 massive 420mm heat exchange radiators.  System Monitoring & Control Enthusiasts and creative professionals will delight in the extraordinary level of automated and self-initiated system control. Digital Storm has integrated automated regulation of five thermal zones and their corresponding fans, all of which are monitored by individual temperature probes. With Digital Storm's exclusive Aventum software, users can fine-tune 13 chassis fans, monitor and regulate thermal zones, and personalize chassis LED colors all within Microsoft Windows via exclusive Digital Storm software. Aventum's critical system performance information and personalized systems specs can be displayed on an LCD screen located on the side panel.  "Unlike any other chassis, Aventum's intelligent design enables it to exceed the demands of the most power hungry enthusiasts, gamers and creative professionals," remarked Rajeev Kuruppu, Digital Storm's Director of Product Development. "We've spent months analyzing every conceivable way to effectively eliminate heat from Aventum and as a result, our engineers devised new systems that have never been attempted. Every integral component and every zone is constantly being monitored so our customers can ensure their dream machine is always delivering optimal performance."
