The model is designed to do such mundanetasks as answering the door and playing media files. And, yes, it can connect to the net and download orders from themothership. So don't let that smiling face fool you. As the bard said, one can "smile and smileand be a villain." Or in this case, a networked robot under the control of an AI managed by the government or alarge corporation. As if there's a difference.
