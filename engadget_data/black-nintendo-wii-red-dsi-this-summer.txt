The black Wii (or "KURO Wii" to be precise) is particularly interesting as it's been rumored for over two years now. Ok, it's not that interesting but it sure is edgy... right? Oh nevermind. Expect the ¥25,000 black Wii with like-colored Wiimote, nunchuck, and classic controller to hit Japan on August 1st and the ¥18,900 red DSi on July 11th. Red DSi after the break.[Via Joystiq]
