One of Google Now's biggest quirks has been its inability to cope with going offline -- go through a subway tunnel and you risk losing those important directions or your parking place. You won't be left hanging after today, though, as Google has brought offline support to Now on Android phones. So long as you're using the latest version of the Search app, all your information cards should hang around whenever you're cut off from the rest of the world. It's a small change, but it could make a big difference if it keeps you informed while you're off the grid.
