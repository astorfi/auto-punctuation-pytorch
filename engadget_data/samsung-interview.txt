 We enjoyed Ryan Bidan's appearance on our stage last year so much that we're bringing Samsung's director of marketing back for another round. We've got a lot to talk about after what's been a banner year for the company in the mobile space, and the exec has agreed to bring some goodies along to show off. Join us after the break, won't you?
