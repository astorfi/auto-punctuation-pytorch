By now you probably know how these things work, this one let's you stream internet radio and supports playback of h.264 and VC-1 video files (and we presume several other major video and audio formats as well, though the release doesn't get too specific). Also has Ethernet, HDMI, component video, digital audio, and composite A/V connectors, and a USB 2.0 port for connecting up an USB mass storage drive.
