 
Never mind that November 11 rumor, the Droid 2 Global is available to buy from Verizon right now. The dual-mode CDMA/GSM handset from Moto -- equipped with a 1.2GHz processor, don't forget -- is ready to be yours today for $199.99 after a $100 mail-in rebate and subject to the usual two-year contractual commitment. If you still need convincing, this new SKU also comes in a sparkling white option... can you really resist a white globetrotting Droid? See more of it after the break.

[Thanks, Anthony]
