OUYA owners who've been eager for the console's big interface upgrade can relax, as it's reaching systems today. Now known as "Abominable Snowman," the update gives the Android device a much more visual control scheme that simplifies finding new games. The beauty is more than just skin-deep, though: there's also beta support for USB storage, the ability to queue downloads from the web and quicker access to the system menu. Gamers just have to check for an update to give their OUYA its much-appreciated makeover.
