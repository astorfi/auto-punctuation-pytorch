 
Well, damn -- Verizon told us earlier that it wouldn't be carrying Windows Phone 7 devices until 2011, and now Microsoft's twisting the knife by confirming that its new platform will be GSM-only until the first half of 2011. So much for our dreams of a 4G Windows Phone 7 device on Sprint, we suppose. Product manager Greg Sullivan told CNET that trade-offs had to be made in order to meet the schedule and GSM was prioritized since it's used worldwide, but that CDMA devices would be available early next year. Of course, we've also heard that the failed Kin project soured the Verizon / Microsoft relationship and that's why AT&T is the "premier carrier" for WP7, but either way, it's down to Ma Bell and T-Mobile to get this thing off the ground now -- and we'll say right now that launching CDMA devices with the current Windows Phone 7 spec list later into 2011 isn't going to do anyone any favors.
