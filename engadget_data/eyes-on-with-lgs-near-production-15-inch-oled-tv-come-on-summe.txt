On display here at CES and planned for a production run sometime this summer, the image is absolutely stunning -- every bit as impressive as the Sony's XEL-1. Nothing else compares to the incredible contrast achieved by these OLED displays. Have a look in the gallery -- we've got the prototype pictured with and without its chubby TV bezel. It's credit-card thin (0.8-mm) and only on Engadget.
