   Huawei was cycling past the FCC's ominous Washington bunker and dropped off a basket of muffins and its latest phone. The Ascend G 300 U8815 is the latest handset to undergo the Area-51 style autopsy by our boys in blue. Sadly they weren't feeling generous enough to take the usual array of pictures, so we've had to do with pouring through the test reports. We've gleaned that it's running GSM 850/1900 and 900/2100 3G bands as well as the usual WiFi 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth gear. Those who know your bands will have noticed that the phone isn't compatible with the 3G in the us, so it probably won't arrive on sale on these shores -- except in the shirt pocket of the odd trans-continental traveler.
