Apparently Wal-Mart did manage to sell out its entire stock of gPCs in the 600 stores that got them before pulling the plug, but the $199 computer just "wasn't what our customers were looking for," said Wal-Mart spokeswoman Melissa O'Brien. Everex spokesman Paul Kim says that online gPC sales were "significantly more effective," so apparently there aren't any hard feelings here.
