       We knew that Time Warner Cable was allowing customers in various regions around the country to pre-order their tuning adapter, and tonight we've received the first report of delivery. For those out of the loop, these free adapters enable CableCARD users to tune into any channel that's delivered via switched digital video (SDV); without one, your current TiVo (for example) won't ever be able to see any channel beamed out with the new technology. The lucky locale is Austin, Texas, but we get the idea that other places should be seeing them soon. Give your local TWC office a call, and do report back (bonus points for images) if you've found that your city now has 'em as well.
