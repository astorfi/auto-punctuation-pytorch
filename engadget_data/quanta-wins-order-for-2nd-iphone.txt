        Ready for some good ol' rumor and speculation related to the iPhone? Sure, after all, we're still a few weeks away from the most optimistic of launch dates. Well, try this one on. A second iPhone manufacturer has been added to the mix. Namely, Apple fave Quanta Computer are rumored to be joining Foxconn (Hon Hai) in the development of the uber phone after winning the contract to deliver 5 million units starting in September. Digitimes, citing a report in the Chinese-language Commercial Times, says that "The iPhone produced by Foxconn is designated for the US market, and those manufactured by Quanta will be similar in function to those from Foxconn but with a different outer design to fit different markets, the paper quoted sources at Taiwan-based component makers as saying." The story was also carried by Taiwan's other leading financial paper, the Economic Daily News for what it's worth. Quanta has issued a response to the rumor on their English language site stating, "Quanta and Apple are building a tighter than ever relationships. Quanta not only manufactures NB and iPod for Apple, but also may have receive the order to make the second generation of the Apple iPhone. iPhone is a smartphone based mobile, and the second generation model shipment is expected in September 2007 with forecast of 5 million units in 2008." What to make of this? Well, the believers amongst you will of course interpret this to mean a 3G iPhone is on the way -- after all, Apple would be testing European patience by delivering a 3G-less phone to the continent in Q4 as originally announced. But that's just speculation on top of rumor which makes an ass out of you and me. Er, or something like that. Read -- DigiTimes Read -- Quanta response
