Sprint has thrown up a support page detailing the build EB13 upgrade that will kick off on February 21st, saying that all customers "should" have it by the 25th through a phased over-the-air rollout. Besides the usual Android 2.2 goodies, the update promises "GPS enhancements," which is something that pretty much every Galaxy S owner around the world is always on the lookout for with every new firmware version. Of course, we'll believe this all when it actually starts happening -- but it's a good sign.
