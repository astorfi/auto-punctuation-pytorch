 If you're thinking about buying a
Nintendo DS, move fast—the company says they sold 500,000
units of the new double-screen game console during the first
week and the supply could be "depleted within days."  Given that Nintendo really did tell analysts they
expected to sell 1 million units before 2004 ended that leaves just another week or so to grab one. Game Boy Advance
SP, anyone?
