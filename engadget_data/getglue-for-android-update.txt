GetGlue's recently expanded social efforts on mobile platforms have been available solely to iOS users so far; today, it's their Android friends' turn. A fresh update to the check-in app brings Android users the personalized guide for movies, sports and TV shows. The second screen presentation receives a similar overhaul: it's easier to tag friends or chat with them, and individual shows now have a slew of news and media on offer. While the new version unfortunately drops books and other content, those who regularly watch TV with smartphone in hand will want to grab the new GetGlue build at the source link.
