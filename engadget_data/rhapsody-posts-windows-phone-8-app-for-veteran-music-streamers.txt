 Just because Rhapsody is an old hand at online music doesn't mean it has to lag behind: the company just posted a new version of its app tailored to Windows Phone 8 listeners. Besides the native OS tie-ins, it adds offline downloads and access to the personalized My Music section. Windows Phone-focused listeners who've stuck to Rhapsody's $10-plus service through thick and thin -- or just aren't wedded to options from Microsoft, Nokia and Spotify -- can hit the source for the new jukebox.
