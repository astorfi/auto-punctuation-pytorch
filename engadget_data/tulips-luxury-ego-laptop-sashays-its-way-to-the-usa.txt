 If you've had your eye on Tulip's line of luxury laptops but don't way to pay the extra bucks to import one (or take time away from your next European vacation to pick one up), you can now get one a little closer to home, with none other than Barneys signed up to deliver the goods in the US. While it's not clear if the six figure diamond-encrusted model will be available for your perusal, you can now snag the "entry level" model both in store (in New York, Beverly Hills, Chicago and Dallas) and on Barney's website for a mere $5,000. The big selling point on this one is the interchangeable skins, although while there's apparently more than a dozen available, you'll only get two with your purchase. The system's specs, not surprisingly, are pretty far off the mark from the price, with the Ego packing a 12-inch WXGA display, AMD Turion 64 processor, ATI Radeon XPRESS 200 M graphics, 1GB of RAM, an 80GB hard drive, and integrated WiFi and Bluetooth. But what are specs compared to the bragging rights that come with a zebra-skinned laptop? [Via Gizmag]
