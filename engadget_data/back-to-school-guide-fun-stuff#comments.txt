Welcome to Engadget's back to school guide! Today, we're talking fun stuff. Head to the back to school hub to see the rest of the product guides as we add them throughout the month. Be sure to keep checking back; in early September, we'll be giving away a ton of gear, including some of the picks in our guides. 

If we may paraphrase a tried-and-true saying, all work and no play makes one a very dull boy or girl. While laptops, tablets and smartphones are all essential pieces of study-time equipment, it's important to remember to cut loose and have a little fun every once in a while. To beat the midterm blues, check out top gadget picks below the break.

Money is no objectFactor Bikes Vis Vires Dura Ace
The new Vis Vires Dura Ace is one of the sexiest high-end road bikes we've seen lately, and it doesn't hurt that it packs plenty of tech, either.

You can also connect the Edge 810 to your smartphone via Bluetooth to access additional features on the Garmin mobile app. If that's not enough to make you start saving your pennies, then the power cranks, integrated wheel-speed sensor and 45mm clincher aero wheels should do the trick.

Killer whale submarineFor the Free Willy fan who has everything, may we suggest this modestly priced (for billionaires, that is) killer whale submarine? Hammacher Schlemmer has outdone itself with this $100,000 watercraft. Frankly, we can't imagine a better way to ride the waves than in this aquatic two-seater, equipped with a 255-hp supercharged Rotax axial flow engine that lets you hop out of the sea like a real dolphin.
