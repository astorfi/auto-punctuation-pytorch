The details haven't been made public just yet but Sony Pictures has confirmed a November 14 release date that is going to be shared with another action thriller: Layer Cake. This crime drama stars that new chap playing James Bond in the up-coming Casino Royale and but what we really care about is that the release date for Black Hawk Down doesn't get delayed yet again - it's a great flick and all but frankly, we are getting tired of reporting about it.
