Hence Satoru Iwata's mention at a financial Q&A of plans to allow in-game premium DLC on 3DS titles by the end of this year. He said he was wary that the Nintendo brand could be damaged by low-quality DLC, but was nevertheless keen to offer 3DS customers a way to purchase extra levels or features that extend the life of a game. It's about time Nintendo spruced up its online offerings, but we'd rather spend our arcade money on this.
