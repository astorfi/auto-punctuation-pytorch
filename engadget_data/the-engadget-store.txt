That, and apparently it's located in the MidvalleyMegamall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. So, next time someone's in Malaysia, would you do us a favor and check up on 'em,make sure they're doing the Engadget name good? And since we can only assume the Engadget store's proprietors arereading this, we'd like to shout 'em out and say hey, what's up, were you planning on telling us about this at somepoint? Yeah, we can understand why not.Update: Uh, yeah, we can with some amount ofcertainty confirm that this isn't a photoshop job (see pics here, here, here, here, here, here, and here). Thanks to David, Sunil, and SCH! So, anyone talkto these guys yet?
