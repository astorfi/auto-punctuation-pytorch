At a svelte 0.57-inches, the UMTS 2100 and GPRS 900/1800/1900 phone really packs in the goods with Bluetooth 2.0 connectivity, FM radio support, a 2 megapixel camera, web browsing, RSS feeds, and a 512 MB Memory Stick Micro (upgradeable). It has a 2-inch color TFT display and totes random extras like TrackID, a music identification service, and a Picture Blogging function that allows you to send snapshots directly to your personal blog. To top off the lifestyle angle on this phone, Sony Ericsson has embellished the pants offa this one, with the aforementioned gold trim on both glossy color options, Record Black and Rose Red. The Rose Red (geez, what's up with the cranberry hype?) model jazzes it up a bit more with its floral-themed relief pattern on the backside. For those of you who are more concerned with performance, you'll get up to 6 hours of talk time on GSM, up to 2.5 hours with 3G, or a max of 25 hours of music listening. Expect to peep these newbies in select markets by Q2 of this year. [Via PhoneArena]
