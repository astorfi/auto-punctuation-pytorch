No sooner than we whip up a questionnaire to find out if you're going to splurge on a new HDTV for the forthcoming tilt between the New York Giants and the New England Patriots, along comes a study suggesting that quite a few of your neighbors will be. According to new results from the third annual Sports and Technology survey conducted by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) and Sports Video Group (SVG), the Big Game is expected to drive the purchase of 2.4 million high-definition sets, which should generate some $2.2 billion this year alone. Interestingly, this year's study also found that emerging outlets such as mobile handsets and the internet would be sought to provide statistics and secondary information while the Super Bowl is in progress. And hey, if you're questioning your sanity over buying a new TV for one game, just think, March Madness is only weeks away.[Image courtesy of AP / Rick Hossman]
