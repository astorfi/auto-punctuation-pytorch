As we'd heard, you'll be asked to rent 25 On Demand movies for $99, after which you'll get the MediaPoint player for free. Not quite sure if that's really pulling the wool over anyone's eyes, but color us completely unsurprised that a company in such dire straights would risk embarrassment to give it a shot. So, is anyone going to buy in here, or is that "Order Now!" button going to sit unclicked forever?[Thanks, Robert]
