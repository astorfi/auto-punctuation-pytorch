The nine-inch device appears to be in stock on Best Buy's online store, offering 16GB of storage, an NVIDA Tegra 3 processor and a standard serving of Ice Cream Sandwich for $299. The slate isn't just available for order, either -- according to Best Buy's stock locator, it can be found in brick and mortar stores too. The A2107, on the other hand, isn't so readily available, but we'll let you know when Lenovo lets it come out to play.  [Thanks, Justin]
