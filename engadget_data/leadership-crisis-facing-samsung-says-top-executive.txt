Although we haven't heard of any more breakouts of late, things are apparently still rocky on the inside. Lee Soo-Bin, chairman of Samsung Life Insurance and current representative for the Samsung Group, admitted that "without a captain or rudder, Samsung now faces a complex crisis, with each unit meeting cut-throat competition independently." He continued to say that the group "was able to ride out a previous crisis together thanks to former chairman Lee Kun-Hee's strong leadership and the guidance of the Strategic Planning Office, [but] now it could not do so." From the outside looking in, it's a bit tough to really understand what he's getting at, but whatever the case, those are most definitely not the words you want coming from the mouth a head exec.
