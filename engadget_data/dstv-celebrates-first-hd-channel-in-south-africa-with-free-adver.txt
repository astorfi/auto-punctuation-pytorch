 Nearly two years ago, we heard that HDTV was coming to South Africa. Fast forward to now, and that prophecy has finally come true. DStv is launching in SA this August in order to bring the 2008 Olympic Games to residents in high-definition. Aside from prepping HD DVRs for the occasion, it's also looking to celebrate by offering up free advertising on the channel until March of 2009. Apparently Oracle Airtime Sales (OATS) is hoping that marketers will seize the opportunity to advertise their wares in high-def, and we have all ideas said company will receive more than a few calls from outfits looking to take it up on the offer.
