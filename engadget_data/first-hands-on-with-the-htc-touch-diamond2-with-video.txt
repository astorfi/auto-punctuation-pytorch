First off, this set is a stunner, build quality and feel in your hand is really a quality affair. The material choices in both metal and plastics used here are really first rate -- we gush because we're rather impressed. The screen is bright, easy to read and the UI overhaul -- and new features underneath -- are much appreciated. One standout in the new improved UI has to be the start menu which, when clicked, pops you into a full screen shortcut list which is miles better to surf through with a finger. All in all? We're impressed with the Touch Diamond2 and though it's not a wildly new device, it is worth peeking at if you're lost in the decision making process for a new Windows Mobile phone. Follow on for some video action.
