  There's been a lot of speculation about how Nintendo will price the Wii, with most of it centered around some very low figures (do we hear $200; $150 -- sold, for $99!). Now, Nintendo has finally revealed the official pricing of its next-gen gaming console: under $250 in the US, and ¥25,000 in Japan. We assume that means the US price will be $249.99, and that there could be some interesting arbitrage opportunities based on exchange rates and release dates (at current rates, ¥25,000 is about $220). Nintendo also said it plans to ship over 6 million consoles by March of next year. And at a price that's now officially about half that of the cheapest PS3, they may just be able to pull it off.
