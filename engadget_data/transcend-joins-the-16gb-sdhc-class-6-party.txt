The card guarantees a minimum write speed of 6MB/second, includes ECC to automatically detect and fix errors and sports a lifetime warranty, too. Not a lot to say beyond that -- especially considering the glaring lack of a price or ship date -- but we doubt you'll be waiting too much longer before seeing this on store shelves.[Via AVing]
