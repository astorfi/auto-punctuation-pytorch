The budget-conscious handset (C is rumored to stand for "cheap") comes with 4GB storage, microSD slot and a 5-megapixel camera. You'll be pawing at Ice Cream Sandwich via a 480 x 320 display which is driven by a surprisingly decent 600MHz processor. You can snatch one on contract for as little as £13 a month, or buy the thing outright for £150 from today.
