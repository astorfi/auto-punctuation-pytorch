Well, it looks like Wal-Mart's master plan to bankrupt
Netflix didn't quite turn out — the world's largest retailer is now essentially surrenduring to the much smaller
internet startup and turning over their DVD rental business. The agreement specifies that Wal-Mart will offer its
existing online rental customers the chance to continue their subscriptions under Netflix at their current price for
the next year, and begin promoting the Netflix service in its website. In turn, Netflix will remind its customers that
they can purchase DVDs from Walmart.com — awww, isn't that nice? Of course, Netflix
still has Blockbuster to contend with, but it's a major
victory to have at least knocked Wal-Mart out of the running.
