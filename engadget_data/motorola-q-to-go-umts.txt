 GSM-lovers, we're happy to report that you won't remain Q-less after all. Although CDMAcarriers will be the first to offer Motorola's Windows Mobile 5.0-powered candybar smartphone, Moto announced today at3GSM that they are indeed working on a UMTS version of the Q. This GSM Q will supposedly be available for"operator trials" in late Q4 of this year, which means all you T-Mobbers and Cingularities will probably haveto wait until 2007 to get your hands on one. Still, if you can hold out for just twelve months or so (ages in the worldof consumer electronics, we know), a shiny new Q will be your reward.
