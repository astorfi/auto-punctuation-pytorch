 Intel continues to rake in the dough, posting a quarterly profit of $2.5 billion on a total revenue of $13.5 billion during the final three month period of 2012. While those numbers are down slightly both sequentially and year-over-year, they're hardly disappointing. In a statement released alongside the financial figures, CFO Stacy Smith said the results were inline with expectations -- and they actually exceeded Wall Street Forecasts. To accompany its quarterly fillings, Intel also released its annual results, which do have some cause for concern. While revenues were only down 1.2 percent from 2011's $54 billion dollar haul to $53.3 billion, net income was down 15 percent, from $12.9 billion to $11 billion. The decline of PC sales has certainly effected the company's bottom line, as the PC Client group has seen revenue drop 6 percent to $8.5 billion year-over-year and its "Other Intel Architecture" division pulled in only $1 billion, a 14-percent falloff from Q3. One of the bright spots for the chip giant was its Data Center Group, which continues to grow at a steady pace, with revenues up 7 percent sequentially and 4 percent year over year. For more detailed financial fun hit up the PR after the break.

   Risk Factors

   The above statements and any others in this document that refer to plans and expectations for the first quarter, the year and the future are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "may," "will," "should" and their variations identify forward-looking statements. Statements that refer to or are based on projections, uncertain events or assumptions also identify forward-looking statements. Many factors could affect Intel's actual results, and variances from Intel's current expectations regarding such factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Intel presently considers the following to be the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's expectations.

   -- Demand could be different from Intel's expectations due to factors including changes in business and economic conditions; customer acceptance of Intel's and competitors' products; supply constraints and other disruptions affecting customers; changes in customer order patterns including order cancellations; and changes in the level of inventory at customers. Uncertainty in global economic and financial conditions poses a risk that consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to negative financial events, which could negatively affect product demand and other related matters.

   -- Intel operates in intensely competitive industries that are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term and product demand that is highly variable and difficult to forecast. Revenue and the gross margin percentage are affected by the timing of Intel product introductions and the demand for and market acceptance of Intel's products; actions taken by Intel's competitors, including product offerings and introductions, marketing programs and pricing pressures and Intel's response to such actions; and Intel's ability to respond quickly to technological developments and to incorporate new features into its products.

   -- The gross margin percentage could vary significantly from expectations based on capacity utilization; variations in inventory valuation, including variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale; changes in revenue levels; segment product mix; the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs; start-up costs; excess or obsolete inventory; changes in unit costs; defects or disruptions in the supply of materials or resources; product manufacturing quality/yields; and impairments of long-lived assets, including manufacturing, assembly/test and intangible assets.

   -- The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and current expected income. The tax rate may be affected by the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimates of credits, benefits and deductions; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities, including payment of interest and penalties; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets.

   -- Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses on the sale, exchange, change in the fair value or impairments of debt and equity investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. The majority of our marketable equity security portfolio balance is concentrated in ASML Holding, N.V., and declines in value could result in impairment charges, impacting gains or losses on equity securities.

   -- Intel's results could be affected by adverse economic, social, political and physical/infrastructure conditions in countries where Intel, its customers or its suppliers operate, including military conflict and other security risks, natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, health concerns and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

   -- Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses, as well as restructuring and asset impairment charges, vary depending on the level of demand for Intel's products and the level of revenue and profits.

   -- Intel's results could be affected by the timing of closing of acquisitions and divestitures.

   -- Intel's current chief executive officer plans to retire in May 2013 and the Board of Directors is working to choose a successor. The succession and transition process may have a direct and/or indirect effect on the business and operations of the company. In connection with the appointment of the new CEO, the company will seek to retain our executive management team (some of whom are being considered for the CEO position), and keep employees focused on achieving the company's strategic goals and objectives.

   -- Intel's results could be affected by adverse effects associated with product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications), and by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property, stockholder, consumer, antitrust, disclosure and other issues, such as the litigation and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC reports. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting Intel from manufacturing or selling one or more products, precluding particular business practices, impacting Intel's ability to design its products, or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of intellectual property.

   A detailed discussion of these and other factors that could affect Intel's results is included in Intel's SEC filings, including the company's most recent Form 10-Q and report on Form 10-K.

   INTEL CORPORATION  SUPPLEMENTAL RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP RESULTS  In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with  United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP), this document contains non-GAAP financial measures that we  believe are helpful in understanding and comparing our past  financial performance and our expectations for future results. The  non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company exclude the  amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, as well as  the related income tax effect. Amortization of acquisition-related  intangible assets consists of the amortization of developed  technology, trade names, and customer relationships acquired in  connection with business combinations. We record charges relating to  the amortization of these intangibles in our GAAP financial  statements. Amortization charges for our acquisition-related  intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly  impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions.  Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustment excludes these charges to  facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and  comparisons to our past operating performance.  Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial  measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company have  limitations and should not be considered a substitute for, or  superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP,  and the financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP and  reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.  Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures are appropriate  for period to period comparisons in our budget, planning and  evaluation processes, and to show the reader how our performance  compares to other periods.
