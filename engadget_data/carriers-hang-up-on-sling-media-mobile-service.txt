But Sling has come up against a powerful foe in its quest tobring place-shifting to the small screen: cellular carriers, who are busily cutting deals with networks and othercontent providers, and don't want to see Sling threaten that income. "We have no immediate plans to run thatservice," Jeffrey Nelson of Verizon Wireless told Forbes. "What runs on our network are our services."Of course, as more carriers move to 3G platforms like EV-DO and HSDPA, which makes accessing video directly from theinternet much more practical, the carriers' official offerings will be less relevant,and Sling Â  -- which hasdeveloped a Windows Mobile version of its service -- may well become must-see TV for cellphone users.
