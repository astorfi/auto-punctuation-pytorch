 Put down that import order form Tarantino & Samuel L. Jackson fans, Disney/Miramax has apparently set a date for Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, with both coming to Blu-ray August 4. High-Def Digest notes they're tagged special editions, so in lieu of any official information about specs, extra features or price, we still expect only the best fo these long awaited flicks.
