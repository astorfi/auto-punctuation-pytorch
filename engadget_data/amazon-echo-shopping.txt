You'd think that an internet shopping giant like Amazon would have baked purchasing into its voice-controlled Echo speaker at the very start, but nope -- the best you could do until now was add items to a shopping list. At long last, though, that hands-free shopping feature is here. So long as you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can tell the Echo to re-order items you've purchased in the past. You can't buy whatever you like as a result, but the speaker will offer an alternative (or at worst, put something on your shopping list) if it doesn't find what you were looking for. Suffice it to say that this could save you a lot of clicks if Amazon is your one-stop supply shop.
