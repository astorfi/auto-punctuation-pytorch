There's a fairly good chance that Mark Zuckerberg's heading Home today without a massive bonus check. Zuck's social network, Facebook, hasn't quite reached the level of profitability that some investors once expected -- its first year of public trading brought highs and lows (though, mostly lows). But, revenues steadily grew, and, in the final quarter of 2012, the company finally turned a profit. And now, for the most recent quarter, Facebook is reporting revenue of $1.46 billion, a 38-percent boost over the same period in 2012, with a net income of $312 million and earnings of 12 cents per share.


Daily active users jumped to 665 million worldwide, compared with 526 million in Q1 2012. As we learned last month, Instagram also saw a significant boost, with more than 100 million people actively using the service each month. Mobile is clearly in focus this year, and 751 million users are already accessing the site each month through smartphones and tablets, though the company's efforts in that arena may be better reflected in the future -- the site's legacy products are responsible for Q1 2013's figures. We hope to get some more insight during the earnings call this afternoon, and we'll be sure to share any notable tidbits as they're made public.
