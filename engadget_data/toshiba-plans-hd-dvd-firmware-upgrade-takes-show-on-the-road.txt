The media juggernaut will include a road show with in-storedemos and new web-based marketing. However, the most intriguing thing about the new effort is buried in Toshiba's pressrelease: in order to allow your HD DVD player to have "full interactivity," you'll need a firmware upgrade.While Toshiba isn't supplying any details about the required upgrade, it looks like the company is more concerned aboutmeeting its ship date (and getting an edge on Blu Ray) than it is about getting all of HD DVD's features in place fromthe start. Toshiba had better hope the list of missing features isn't too long, or they may regret being first tomarket.
