 We already knew that between MPEG-LA, ViaLicensing and others, MPEG-4 and the H.264 codec were already awash with patent holders and complicated royalty systems, but itlooks like there's a new kid on the block that wants its share of Apple, CyberLink, DivX, InterVideo and SonicSolutions pie. Fresh from its SBC merger, AT&T is going afterthe big iPod bucks claiming that the device infringes on their patents which they claim are "a core component ofMPEG-4." AT&T claims that they're not just after the money and that they're looking to "make sure othersare able to take advantage of this technology," but they also state: "what we're doing is pretty common amongintellectual property holders," which isn't exactly comforting given the tech industry's history with such things.[Via iLounge]
