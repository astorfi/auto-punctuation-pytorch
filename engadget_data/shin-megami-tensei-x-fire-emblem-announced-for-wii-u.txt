   In a left-field announcement, Nintendo has revealed a new collaboration with Atlus called Shin Megami Tensei X Fire Emblem. A brief trailer shown during a Nintendo Direct presentation didn't offer many details, showing only characters from both games as well as the self-explanatory title.Presumably, the characters from each series will fight it out for ultimate supremacy. In other words, your Trapper Keeper doodles are about to come to life. Further details, it seems, will have to wait.
