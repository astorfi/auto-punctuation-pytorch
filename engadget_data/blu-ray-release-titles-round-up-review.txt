 Blu-ray is pretty much here. The initial titles have been release and if you really wanted one of the players, you probably have one by now. If not they are officially going to be in the stores in four days. But why did you buy one of these players? The picture quality of course. But what if the picture quality wasn't all it was supposed to be? Plus, the discs didn't have anything HD exclusive on them yet. Don't think of us as hating on Bu-ray as the picture quality is certainly better then a normal DVD but...well you might want to check out these reviews.The Fifth Element - "And it does look good, no doubt -- it just is not the best HD I've seen."50 First Dates - "Certainly, in terms of a Blu-ray release, this is comparable to most of what has come out on HD DVD so far."xXx - 'First, make no mistake, this can be an eye-popping transfer at a glance (just don't look too close)."Underworld: Evolution -  "Presented in 2.40:1 and encoded at 1080p, 'Underworld: Evolution' overall looks quite striking."Crash -  "However, this initial Blu-ray release from Lionsgate is a disappointment."
