Geeksphone's Firefox OS-based Keon and Peak phones have mostly catered to developers; the company is now widening that audience with an upgraded phone for the public, the Peak+. While Geeksphone isn't saying exactly what's been tuned, it promises "new hardware upgrades" in response to community feedback. The firm is also offering 25GB in cloud storage to first-timers for all their web syncing needs. Reservations for the Peak+ will start in the days ahead, and would-be customers will likely want to sign up quickly -- Geeksphone is teasing a discount for the first wave of buyers.
