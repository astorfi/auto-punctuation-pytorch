Decked out in the Black Diamond design we've become accustomed to, it combines 2.4GHz and 5GHz bandwidth to sling data at up to 1.75Gbps. We've got a few more pics of it in the gallery below and specific details on ASUS' wireless technology from the press release after the break, although there's no price or release date mentioned.
