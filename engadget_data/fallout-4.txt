Fallout 4 is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC on November 10th. Bethesda revealed Fallout 4 earlier this month with a teaser site and a trailer full of brighter colors and a friendly dog companion. Plus: The robot butler of your dreams. The Fallout team has been working on 4 since the launch of Fallout 3 in 2009, Bethesda announced on-stage today. Fallout 4 includes the series' most in-depth character-customization process and it showcases a dynamic dialogue system that lets you "walk away at any point." Also new in Fallout 4, there's a crafting system. Players can create their own settlements -- build power stations to run turrets and other fancy, electrical fortress elements. In addition, the weapon-modding system is robust, with 50 base weapons and more than 700 modifications, plus a separate UI for the power armor.
