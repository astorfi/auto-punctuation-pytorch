 Seems like we've been calling this thing theRevolution for, well, forever. Well, we just got word over the wires that -- well ahead of any expected E3 announcements -- Nintendo announced the officially truly true name for theRevolution: the Nintendo Wii (like "we"). Nope, stop calling it the Revolution, it's not the Go, either. They're going for that wholegaming plurality thing that they've been talking about, bringing together communities who love to play, old schoolgamers, casual gamers, today's more evolved gamers: "It's about Wii, and together Wii will changeeverything." Ooook, guys, whatever you say. And yeah, we'll spare you all the puerile jokes.
