Once you pick it up, though... well, it's a different story. For anyone familiar with the Nokia E71's wiles, the 8900 strikes a similar tone with a svelte, sexy body that betrays BlackBerry's down-to-business aspirations (no complaints there). Don't get us wrong, the Bold looks great, but seriously -- if you can put HSDPA aside and work off EDGE and WiFi alone, the Curve's your hookup. Check out a few shots (including a touching Storm side-by-side) in the gallery!
