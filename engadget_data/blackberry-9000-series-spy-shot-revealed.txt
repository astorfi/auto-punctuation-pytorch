 
An image surfaced on the BlackBerryForums this morning that purports to be of the upcoming BlackBerry 9000 series. The forum member with the scoop claims that the device has no touchscreen, and that rumors are raging even within RIM as to whether touchscreen devices are in the works. What can supposedly be confirmed is that the device in the picture is part of the 9000 series, 3G is being tested on multiple devices, and that HTML email is in the works for the BlackBerry service, possibly in conjunction with the launch of the 9xxx devices. Update: Turns out this picture was swiped from an eBay auction, and while that doesn't necessarily mean it's not an upcoming BlackBerry device, it does call into question the accompanying commentary from the forum user who posted the image, so take it all with a grain of salt.Update 2: Those auctioneers added a new pic with some spicy innards and a view of the back. Check it out after the break.[Via Pocket-lint; thanks Cellenin]
