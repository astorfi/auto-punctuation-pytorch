 
Well, here's an interesting turn of events. Apple has apparently sent out emails notifying at least some of those who ordered iPhone 4 that it'll be arriving June 23rd. (Well over three dozen people have tipped us to this in the last 30 minutes -- thanks, by the way.) Hard to say if the delivery man will keep to this early gifting notification, but keep hoping, true believer. Full text of email after the break.

Update: We just received our email as well.

[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
      

 

Dear Apple Store Customer,You recently received a Shipment Notification email from Apple advising you that your iPhone has shipped.This email is to confirm that your delivery will occur on June 23rd. Although Apple and FedEx tracking information may currently indicate a later date, you can check the FedEx website the morning of the June 23rd to track your package to your doorstep.In the event that you will not be available to accept delivery on June 23rd, it may be more convenient to use our pre-sign delivery option by visiting our Order Status website at http://www.apple.com/orderstatusSincerely,The Apple Store Team
