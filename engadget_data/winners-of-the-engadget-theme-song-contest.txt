Thanks to everyone who sent in your entries, we got some really great jingles and tunes inspired by your unhealthy, money-sapping obsession with electronics. We'll play these and even more entries in our next podcast, but for now check out the top entrants.P.S. -Be sure to check out our own Paul Miller's Engadget song. He obviously wasn't allowed to enter it, but the ditty he wrote for Peter's birthday this year was a little too good not to include.First placeAleksandr Karpets' Engadget Jingle (MP3)Second placeRKNY's Theme to Engadget (MP3)Third placeRobert Lenz's Engadget ThemeRunners upKevin Fleming (MP3)Justin Reznick (M4A)Mark Rosengarten (MP3)Engadget creepoPaul Miller (MP3)
