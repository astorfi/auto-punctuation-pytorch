Well, those reports from yesterday about a
next-generation Slingbox were a little bit, um, wrong. Obviously concerned about the Osborne Effect of announcing a
next-gen product while you still have your current gen on store shelves, Jeremy Toeman from Sling Media posted a note
in our comments yesterday clarifying the situation. Turns out that Philips' announcement on Monday of a "new family of
audio/video decoders" that will be used by "consumer electronics customers, such as Sling Media, [who] will introduce
technologies with this solution at CES 2006," doesn't mean that they're introducing a whole new
Slingbox. What's actually going on is that these
chips are going to be used in a new PAL-compatible version of the Slingbox.Â
