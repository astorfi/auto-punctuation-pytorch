New 6-cell battery offers up to 7.5-hours of battery for Eee PC 1000, 7.8-hours for 901, 7 hours for Eee PC 1000H
The "H" in the Eee PC 1000(H) model means hard drive, yes, hard drive up to 80GB. A first for an Eee.
The Eee PC 1000 will max-out with a 40GB SSD
Fully equipped with 802.11n and Bluetooth -- hoozah!
Intel's Atom across the board
