While speaking to a packed house here at CES, Intel PC client chief Mooly Eden just dropped a telling stat: so far, 75-plus Ultrabooks are set to launch in 2012. Of those, 50 percent will have 14- and 15-inch displays - a clear bid to win over mainstream consumers who feel they need a more screen real estate for watching movies or aren't ready to part with optical drives, discrete graphics and other specs befitting mainstream laptops. Don't say we didn't warn you.
