A recent court victory was handed to Lexmark, which reportedly gives them the power under contract and patent law to
enforce the "single use only" policy written on the side of Lexmark printer cartridge boxes. This means you could
technically face legal charges for refilling a Lexmark printer cartridge with third-party ink. Apparently, not all
Lexmark ink cartridges are sold under the "single use policy" â€” but units sold without the policy come at a higher
price. Lexmark calls this their "Prebate" program, in which they offer consumers a 20% (about $30) markdown on ink
cartridges if they agree to send them back to Lexmark after a single use. The recent court ruling upheld that such a
policy was enforceable by Lexmark, such that if you buy a cheaper cartridge under the Prebate program, you are breaking
the law and could face legal action if you refill the cartridge, send it to another cartridge remanufacturer, or if you
simply don't return it. So, y'know, if you're in the habit of buying cheap Lexmark ink cartridges, you might want to
keep an eye out for the Lexmark militia come to commandeer those suckers.
