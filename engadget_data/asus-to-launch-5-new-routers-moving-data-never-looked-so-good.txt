Asus is one step ahead of us with this one by extending its Black Diamond design to a new range of five more room enhancing products. The baby of the bunch, the RT-N10 LX, stylishly serves up bog standard 802.11n, while the undoubted prom queen is the RT-N66U which brings simultaneous dual band and gigabit speed L/WAN speeds to the packet shifting party. Two more equally svelte models -- the RT-N10 LX and RT-N15 -- cater for those networking inbetweeners, and finally, for those that accessorize, a dual band USB dongle squeezes in 2x2 MIMO as well as matching perfectly with those new shoes you bought.
