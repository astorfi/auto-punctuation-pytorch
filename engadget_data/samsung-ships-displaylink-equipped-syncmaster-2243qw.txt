The 22-inch 2243QW comes with a 1,680 x 1,050 native resolution, 1,000:1 contrast ratio, 5-millisecond response time, a built-in USB hub and VGA / DVI inputs. 'Course, the signal gets sent over USB, but it's your best guess as to what it'll run. Er, is running, considering that it's shipping now to the US and Europe.
