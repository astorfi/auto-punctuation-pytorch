According to Pierre Hoffman, whose Auto Indulgence shop built the new scanner, the units consists of 240 LEDs per side in three rows of 80. The goal was to make the scanner look like a heartbeat, so early prototypes were actually triggered from a music interface connected to samples of different heart rhythms. Sadly, the final design isn't nearly as slick, using a complex timing-based circuit board instead -- but that doesn't mean we aren't filled with a rush of conflicted emotions every time we see that red glow.
