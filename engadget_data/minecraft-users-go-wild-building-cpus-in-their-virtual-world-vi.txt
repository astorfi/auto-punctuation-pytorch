It seems that there are a whole bunch of folks who are taking the game, with its avatars, pitchforks, and immense landscape, and building computers and the like. Indeed, there is also a complete 8-bit CPU out there, which takes binary machine code and sends output to a line of torches. While we'd rather spend our time teaching our avatars to breakdance in Second Life, we do admire the hard work that clearly went into these projects. For a tutorial on the 8-bit CPU, hit up the source link. For more info on either of these projects, check out the folks' YouTube pages -- we've thoughtfully included the videos after the break.
