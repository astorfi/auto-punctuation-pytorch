The latest and greatest Communicator has caught up with its European twin and is shipping unlocked and contract-free from Amazon right now. It can be yours for $649, which is somewhat cheaper than the $679 pre-order price we mentioned last month. This buys you a 4-inch 640x360 ClearBlack AMOLED capacitive touchscreen, an 8 megapixel EDoF camera with dual-LED flash, a pentaband 3G radio, and the coolest hinge mechanism on the block. So visit the source link, and get your Symbian on.
