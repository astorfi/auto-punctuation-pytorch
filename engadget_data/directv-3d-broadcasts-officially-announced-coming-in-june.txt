The three dedicated channels (PPV, DirecTV On Demand and a free 3D sample demo) offered at launch will be "presented by Panasonic" for the first year they're on-air and available to all DirecTV HD customers via a software upgrade. Additional content partners include AEG/AEG Digital Media, CBS, Fox Sports/FSN, Golden Boy Promotions, HDNet, MTV, NBC Universal and Turner Broadcasting System -- are we the only ones hoping the Mayweather/Pacquiao bout gets pushed back and broadcast in 3D?
