Originally teased five years ago, Toyota's Segway-killing Winglet is finally taking to the streets of Japan for public testing. While the original device was designed to be steered by users' knees, the revamped edition now contains a familiar steering pillar-and-wheels combination. The trials are due to run through March 2016 with the aim of proving that the Winglet is safe, functional and will save shoe leather on your commute to work. Those curious to see what the Japanese version of infamous Segway fan George Oscar Bluth Jr. (or, you know, Justin Bieber) looks like, head past the break for the video.
