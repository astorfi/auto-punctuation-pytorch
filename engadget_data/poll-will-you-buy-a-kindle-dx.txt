With the Kindle 2 still in its infancy, and the newborn Kindle DX ready to hit the scene (not to mention the host of other e-reader options), how are you likely to spend all that cash you normally shell out on paper and ink Neal Stephenson novels? Will you make the leap to e-ink, or are you still bound and determined to cart The Baroque Cycle around in a Radio Flyer? We've already shared some of our thoughts -- tell us how you feel in the poll below -- and feel free to quote The Diamond Age in the comments.
