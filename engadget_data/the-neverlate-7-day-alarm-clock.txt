This is one of those ideas that make you think it can't possibly be the first time someone has thought of this. The
Neverlate 7-Day alarm clock lets you set separate alarms for each day of the week for the low, low price of $34.99.
Besides the multiple-alarm goodness it's got an AM/FM tuner, customizable snooze length (dangerous!), and a "nap"
button for those of us on the polyphasic sleep cycle.
