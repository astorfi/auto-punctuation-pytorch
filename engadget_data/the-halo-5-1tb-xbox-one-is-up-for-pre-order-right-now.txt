Among the bullet storms and massive explosions of today's Xbox conference, Microsoft unveiled a limited edition, Halo 5-branded 1TB Xbox One bundle, and it's so, so shiny. The bundle is available for pre-order today (priced at $500) and it drops on October 20th. Microsoft launched the standard 1TB console for $400 back in June, complete with a new controller. That console isn't so shiny -- because it's matte.
