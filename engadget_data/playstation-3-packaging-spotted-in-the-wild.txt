 Oh deary us, pictures of the PlayStation 3 before it's launched? Looks a lot like some Sony dudes setting up at TGS when these were snapped, we can't imagine anywhere else in the world right now that would require such a setup. So what if we want our cake (Wii), and to eat it too (PS3) -- we could live with all three next-gen consoles.[Thanks, Iboro Ekpo]
