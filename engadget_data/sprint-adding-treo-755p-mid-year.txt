 Remember that Palm "Sherlock" Sprint talked up in its 1H '07 roadmap? Looks like we might be finally developing some concept of what it is -- and if the rumors are right, Palm OS fans have cause to celebrate. We've now received several independent tips (in addition to the Brighthand article here) suggesting that Sprint and Palm are prepping a so-called "755p" to re-up the 700p that's been kicking around for a while. Details are thin, but the model should lack an aerial (a la the pictured 680) and rock EV-DO data -- and as the "p" in the model number suggests, Garnet OS is in the cards. Brighthand is liking May 14 for a release date, which is a little earlier than our roadmap was showing for the Sherlock. But hey, if it wants to pop in a month early, we're totally cool with that.
