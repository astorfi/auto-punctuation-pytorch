Another day, another selection of pocket change-priced apps. Highlights from today's offering include the return of Endomondo Sports Tracker to the sale shelves, swashbuckling adventure BackStab HD and SimCity Deluxe. It's a game-centric selection for this lazy Sunday, rounded out by Backbreaker Football, Captain America and Jenga. You can fill up your pretend basket at the Android Market link below. Four more days to go.
