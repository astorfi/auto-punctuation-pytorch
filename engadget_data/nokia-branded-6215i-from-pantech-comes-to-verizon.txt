You may recall that in a previous life this basic clamshell was known as the PN-315; Nokia must've seen something in it that we haven't, because there's not much to get excited about. For your 50 contract dollars, you get a VGA cam with flash and a speakerphone (but not so much of that EV-DO data Nokia had contracted with Pantech to launch). Not a bad cheap Pantech in its own right, but without those chiseled, Finnish good looks, you're not really fooling anyone, fellas.[Via MobileTracker]
