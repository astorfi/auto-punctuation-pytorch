Well, it's finally official. Mark your calendars for November 22 here in the U.S., December 2 in Europe, and
December 10 in Japan for the hat trick release of the
Xbox 360. The console's price in Japan
will be ¥37,900, which is the equivalent of about $342 USD, and will net gamers the core system as well as a detachable
20GB hard drive and these bundled extras: Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, an Xbox 360 Media Remote control, an Xbox 360
Headset, a Component HD-AV Cable for connecting to component and composite television inputs, an Ethernet cable, and
batteries. Let the speculation… end.
