The DL33 sports similar specs to the DL28, including a 3.5-inch touchscreen on the back, but bests its successor with a 36 x 44-millimeter, 33 megapixel sensor. That means 16-bit capture, 12-stop dynamic range, and ISO settings from 50 to 800. Other tweaks include a faster autofocus motor and an improved UI, but with image files clocking in at 67 - 190MB you'll probably need some improved storage, too. The camera will be available starting next month for $19,999 including a 55mm f2.8 or 150mm f3.5 lens -- but only if you act now.[Via Topix]
