The Netflix ChromeOS plugin jumping to 1.0.2 a few days ago was a good indication it was on the way, but now you can take your CR-48s, Series 5s and the like straight to the Chrome Web Store and get outfitted for some Watch Instantly streaming. Unfortunately, despite rumors that it's on the way in the next year or so, there's no change for other environments outside of Silverlight-compatible OS X and Windows, but Linux users can always dream, right?
