 Trying to avoid the chill that sweeps through the office during the winter months, we have been forced to either remain stationary, or do a bunny hop to get around in our USB heating slippers. Now, Thanko -- the company keeping us comfortable by our computers -- is allowing us to do the two-step with their new product. The aptly named "USB heating slippers dual" has two heating settings -- reaching a maximum temperature of 50 degrees F -- and individually powered slippers, assuring that each foot is cozy. Coupled with all their other products, we have never been happier bloggers.[Via Brando]
