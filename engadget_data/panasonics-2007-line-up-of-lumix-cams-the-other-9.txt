All the new digicams deliver Panasonic's Mega OIS optical image stabilization, Venus Engine III image processing capable of recording shots at ISO 1250 sensitivity, and the ability to record 848 x 480 videos to SDHC or SD cards at 30fps. The DMC-TZ2 and DMC-TZ3 are all purpose, wide-angle shooters which carry some bulk unlike the new DMC-FX30 we checked earlier. Both the TZ2 and $349 TZ3 ship in May and pack a 28mm wide-angle, 10x optical zoom LEICA DC VARIO-ELMAR lens in a less appealing (and less expensive) chubtastic slab. The TZ3 sports a 8.5 megapixel CCD and 3-inch 230k color LCD while the TZ2 brings both a smaller 7.39 megapixel CCD and 2.5-inches LCD capable of 207k colors. The $229 DMC-FX12 and $199 DMC-FX10 should hit in March with a regular 3x LEICA DC VARIO-ELMARIT optical zoom lens and 7.2 and 6.0 megapixel CCDs, respectively. The $199 DMC-LZ7 and $179 DMC-LZ6 each boast a 7.2 megapixel CCD, 6x LUMIX DC VARIO optical zoom lens and convenient AA battery operation. The LZ7 offers a 2.5-inch LCD versus the LZ6's 2.0-inch display. Bringing up the rear is the LS-series of Lumix cams. AA-batteries and a 3x LUMIX DC VARIO optical zoom lens can be found in each of these entry level models with the LS75 sporting a 2.5-inch LCD and 7.2 megapixel CCD. The LS70 shares the CCD but steps the LCD to 2-inches like the LS60 which further cuts the CCD down to 6.0 megapixels. We'll punch in the holes on price and availability when the details roll in.
