  Valve's Steam platform has initiated a new "Early Access" program, which allows players to purchase and immediately begin playing select games that are still in development. The full list of titles currently available under the initiative include Arma 3 and StarForge, among others, though the selection will be increasing "over time," according to the new service's FAQ.Mechanically, purchases through Early Access will function the same as buying a full, completed game, with the only difference being that, you know, the game isn't finished yet. Theoretically, free-to-play games could also become part of Early Access, in which case there would be no purchase price for participation in the pre-launch play time.
