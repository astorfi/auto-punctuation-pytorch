Hot on the heels of this week's Juice Pack Powerstation unveil, the company stopped by to give us a glimpse of their revised lineup. In addition to all the aforementioned, we also got to check out the Reserve and Boost that formally debuted back in June. We didn't get enough time to really put 'em through their battery charging paces, but we did get pictures -- hey, you're welcome.
