But that's likely to change soon, with a pair of new mirrorless model numbers appearing in Indonesian POSTEL listings. They've since been nixed, but not before the eagle eyes at Sony Alpha Rumors plucked this screen grab of the NEX-5R and NEX-6. It's the Wireless LAN part (which resulted in this listing) that's piqued our interested, suggesting that Sony's next generation of ILCs will also board the wireless connectivity train. There's no more detail to glean from the listing, although rumors (and hopeful prayers) point to an announcement ahead of premier camera show, Photokina, which kicks off next month.
