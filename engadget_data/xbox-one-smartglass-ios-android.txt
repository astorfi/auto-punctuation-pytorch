An early taste of Microsoft's next-gen gaming experience arrived today for Windows Phone and Windows 8.1 users in the form of the Xbox One SmartGlass app, and now Android and iOS faithful can get their fill as well.

If you have a device running Android 4.0+ or iOS 6.0 and above, you can sample Redmond's forthcoming entertainment ecosystem ahead of time at the bordering source links.
