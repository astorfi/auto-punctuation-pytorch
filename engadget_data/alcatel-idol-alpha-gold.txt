You may recall that back at IFA, Alcatel surprised us with a prototype of its shiny OneTouch Idol Alpha. This time at CES, the company brought along a champagne gold version to tease its European launch this quarter. Like before, both the top and bottom transparent parts are lined up with LEDs, with the top ones acting as notification, and the bottom ones shining a light on the three Android soft keys. It's rather pretty when you see it up close. Spec-wise, the 3D aluminum frame envelopes a 4.7-inch 720p IPS display with Dragontrail Glass, a 1.2GHz quad-core SoC with 1GB RAM, 16GB of built-in storage and a 2,000mAh battery. There's no info on pricing just yet, but given Alcatel's target market, we have a good feeling about this one, and we'll let you know once we hear more.
