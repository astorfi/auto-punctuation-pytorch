With Hong Kong boasting pretty much the fastest average internet speed on this planet, it's no surprise that the city is also one of the first to launch commercial 150 Mbps LTE Cat 4 service -- just right after SingTel's launch in Singapore earlier this month. Announced yesterday by CSL (who operates both one2free and the more premium 1010), its FD-LTE network takes advantage of the recently acquired 5MHz extended spectrum, in order to increase the capacity of 2600MHz from 2 x 15MHz to 2 x 20MHz. This upgrade is what enables Cat 4 download speed of up to 150Mbps on compatible devices, and it went live yesterday.


The company's 1800MHz spectrum will also get an upgrade from 2 x 10MHz to 2 x 15MHz in June, followed by another jump to 2 x 20MHz towards the end of the year. You'll find a live demo video (courtesy of RingHK) showing the performance difference between Cat 3 and Cat 4 after the break, with CTO Christian Daigneault claiming he's seen a speed increase of up to twice as fast in the lab.




While CSL didn't announce any new phones at the event, it did show off its upcoming LTE Cat 4 mobile hotspot -- no name mentioned but it appears to be Huawei's E5776. In addition to its 150Mbps capability, the device is also compatible with five LTE bands (800/900/1800/2100/2600) as well as quad-band DC-HSPA+ (850/900/1900/2100). As for the WiFi part, its 802.11/b/g/n radio can support up to 10 devices simultaneously. One bonus feature is that this gadget can double up as an external USB battery with its generous 3,000mAh cell, which can otherwise keep the hotspot running for up to 10 hours.

CSL is now accepting pre-orders for this HK$2,280 (about US$300) kit ahead of its June 17th launch, but you can also get it for free on a 24-month contract: for about HK$300 or US$40 per month, you get either 7GB monthly allowance with 1010 or a 10GB cap with one2free. Of course, you can also just wait for the LTE Cat 4-enabled Huawei Ascend P2, but there was no mention of it at the event, sadly.
