Google apparently doesn't -- it's only extending the $179 subsidized price for the Nexus One to new T-Mobile customers, meaning existing customers are being told they have to pay the full sticker of $529 for the Snapdragon device. As you can imagine, that's got quite a few T-Mobile customers pretty angry -- especially since Google's systems aren't even allowing upgrade-eligible T-Mo subscribers to purchase at a discount, and there's no customer service line to call and complain. We're hoping this is just a glitch while Google takes its first steps into direct phone sales, but we'll keep an eye on the situation.
