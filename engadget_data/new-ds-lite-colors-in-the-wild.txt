In addition to its regular warnings about getting outside and not hitting people in the face, Nintendo might want to inform consumers on the danger of eating their handheld consoles -- we'd hate to see unsuspecting Advance Wars fans succumbing to the incredible temptation these new colors present. Now, how about a little bit of confirmation and release dates for these, Nintendo?Update: Turns out Nintendo indeed confirmed the new colors -- a solid week ago. They're hitting Europe on June 13th. Still no word on the US, though, unless we missed another memo. [Thanks, Daniel]
