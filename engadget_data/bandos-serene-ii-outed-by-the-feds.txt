Otherwise known as the Samsung developed SGH-F310, the latest Bang & Olufsen Ã¼ber design packs GSM with EDGE data, 3G WCDMA, and Bluetooth 2.0. It's just a guess, but from the looks of the backside pic above, we're expecting the Serene II to continue with the original Serene's clamshell design only sporting a curvy fade sure to make Trekkies swoon.
