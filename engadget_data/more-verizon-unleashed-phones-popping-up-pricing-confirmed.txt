These new shots show off the same price structure we saw leaked earlier this month, as well as two more handsets: an LG Accolade, and a Pantech Caper -- both priced at $79.99. This seems a bit steep for the Accolade, a run of the mill flip phone, as this morning's tip priced the more capable LG Cosmos featurephone at a mere $39.99. Take your grain of salt, and check out the gallery below.
