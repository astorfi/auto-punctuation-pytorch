Unfortunately, sometimes we get burned in the process. But the community is nothing if not tenacious. Now we've got an apparent "fix" for anyone who updated their EVO 4G to the Android 2.2 Froyo build discovered on HTC's servers, only to find out that they were running a non-final build. User Pojoman over at XDADevelopers just upped the .3 to final .6 RUU from Sprint that should correct any woes. Based on the enthusiastic feedback we're reading we'd say that this is good news. Nevertheless, the usual disclaimers apply before hitting the source link below, especially with HTC already acknowledging that a fix is on the way via official channels. Yeah, we know, blah blah blah.
