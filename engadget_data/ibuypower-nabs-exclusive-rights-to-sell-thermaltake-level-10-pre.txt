 
So, there are two nagging issues surrounding Thermaltake's awe-inspiring Level 10 enclosure. First, it's $850 and nearly impossible to find in stock; second, you best know how to piece together a full-blown rig yourself, 'cause you won't find this beast hanging around at infrequently visited corners of Dell or HP. Somehow or another, however, iBuyPower has managed to swoop in and remedy quandary number two. As of today, it's the exclusive provider of pre-built systems using this case, with base configurations boasting Intel's Core i7-920, a 2GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 285, 6GB of DDR3 RAM, a 128GB SSD boot drive, 1TB of storage space and a Blu-ray drive. Feel free to spec this one out 'til your heart's content, but be mindful of that already-lofty $2,499 starting tag.
