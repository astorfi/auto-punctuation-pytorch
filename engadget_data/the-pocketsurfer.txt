Brighthand spent some time with the PocketSurfer, a little handheld with a 5.3-inch, 640x240 pixel LCD screen
and a small QWERTY keyboard that you can use to surf the Web (and that's all you can do with it, there's no organizer
or email applications). You can't actually use the PocketSurfer just on its own, you have to connect it up to
a cellphone using Bluetooth so it can piggyback on your phone's Internet connection.
