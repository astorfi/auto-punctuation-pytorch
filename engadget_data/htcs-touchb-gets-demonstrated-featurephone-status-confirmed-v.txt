As it turns out it isn't even a smartphone, relegated to the realm of the featurephone by running Qualcomm's BrewMP OS. Full Flash support is nice, and we must say the UI has a charming, simple look to it, but it all looks a little... limited, and that screen seems awfully small given the size of the phone now that it's been turned on. See for yourself: there's a quick video demo after the break to get you primed for this one to ship sometime next year.
