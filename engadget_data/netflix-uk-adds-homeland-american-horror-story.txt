UK Netflix subscribers looking to get their fix of US TV will soon have two new popular series available to add to their binge-watching schedule. Expanding its partnership with Twentieth Century Fox, the streaming giant announced today it will exclusively add the first two seasons of Golden Globe winning drama Homeland and paranormal series American Horror Story from March 13th. It's another big coup for Netflix as it attempts to supplement its ever-increasing line-up of originals, which includes House of Cards, with earlier seasons of shows still pulling in strong TV audiences. Sure, it'd be ideal if the episodes appeared as they aired, but we're secretly hoping for a spin-off starring Saul from Breaking Bad and Saul from Homeland... maybe they could call it "Better Call Sauls."
