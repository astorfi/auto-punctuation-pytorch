We have to say we're really confused why Sony -- or anyone really -- would release a higher end Blu-ray player at this point in the game and not be profile 1.1 compliant. While most think Sony should be releasing less expensive players, not more, many videophiles will appreciate the upgrades -- DTS HD, better build quality. Regardless of the feature set, why would anyone pick this up rather than wait a little while longer for a player that isn't already "obsolete".
