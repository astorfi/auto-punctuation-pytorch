We've just come across two case-related designs supposedly destined for Apple's next PMP, but both raise as many questions as they answer. Chinese accessory-maker Beelan apparently has a silicon sleeve ready to drop ship to a location of your choice via Alibaba, and iDealsChina is showing off renders of the 4th gen nano and another case from "some unknown Canadian company." Unfortunately, neither design can really be verified, and as they've just appeared on the heels of last night's Rose rumor, the timing seems a touch suspect. We're wondering what the Engadget hive-mind thinks -- any meat on these bones?Update: As many commenters have pointed out, that's a mini-USB port on that render. It's essentially inconceivable that Apple would use anything other than its dock connector here, which makes this rumor seem even more dubious than before, if you can believe such a thing.[Via PMPToday; Thanks Joel]Read - for iPod nano 4G Silicon Skin CaseRead - New! iPod Nano 4TH Gen Touch Screen
