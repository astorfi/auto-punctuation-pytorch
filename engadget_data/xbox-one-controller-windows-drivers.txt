The Xbox One controller is a wonderful piece of gear, so it's natural that people would want to use it with PC games, too. Right on schedule, but perhaps a year too late, Microsoft is now offering the drivers that'll let the hardware work on desktops, laptops and suitably-equipped tablets. Such compatibility will be baked into a forthcoming Windows update, but if you can't wait that long, you can pull down the software from Major Nelson's website right now. The Xbone controllers will work with any game that supports the Xbox 360's handset, but if you'd prefer to test it for yourself, you can always call your boss and tell them that you're ill... or something.
