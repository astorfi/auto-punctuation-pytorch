Why, having that bass emanate from perfect replicas of the "question mark" and brick blocks from Super Mario Brothers, (thus making it the perfect thing to play back your recordings of the SMB Tesla coil), of course. According to the owner, the subs sound great, but the low-end gets a little muddy whenever the question mark gets turned into a metal plate.[Thanks, Michael]
