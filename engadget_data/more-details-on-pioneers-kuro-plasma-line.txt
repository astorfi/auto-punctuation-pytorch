 Pioneer has finally launched their KURO plasma line this week, with sets beginning to show up in retailers for prices ranging from $2,700 for the KURO -- Japanese for "black" -- PDP-4280HD 42-inch model to $6,500 for the 60-inch PDP-6010FD 1080p bigg'un. Three of the sets in the line are 720p-ish, with the two top 50- and 60-inchers sporting 1080p resolution. All models feature standards like CableCARD support, quad HDMI 1.3 inputs, and Home Gallery for displaying photos and the like via USB, with contrast ratios and color reproduction that's all the rave with reviewers.[Thanks, Joe]
