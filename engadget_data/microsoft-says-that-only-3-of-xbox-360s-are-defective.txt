Joystiq is reporting that despite the buzz surrounding defective
Xbox 360s, Microsoft claims that only 3% of the
units sold have been faulty, which is below the industry average. Assuming that Microsoft's numbers are accurate, it
would seem that all the online drama about melting 'boxs
and deadly error messages can likely be attributed to the
fact that early adopters tend to be outspoken in forums and don't represent the general public. In other 360 news,
analyst P.J. McNealy speculates that between 300,000 and 400,000 of the consoles have been sold so far, and MS would
have "sold another million if they could have. They just don't have them." So to wrap things up, the 360 probably works
right, but it's a moot point 'cause the only way you'll get to play one is at Wal-Mart.
