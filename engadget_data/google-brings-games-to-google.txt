Unlike a certain other social network, Google says games in Google+ are "there when you want them and gone when you don't," meaning that they won't flood your main stream if you never play them -- you have to click the games icon at the top of the page to play and see updates from your circles. According to Google, the service is rolling out "gradually" starting today, but should be available to all Google+ users "soon."
