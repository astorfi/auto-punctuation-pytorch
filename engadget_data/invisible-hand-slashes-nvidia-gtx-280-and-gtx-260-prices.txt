 As expected, NVIDIA just slashed the price of its top-end GTX 280 and GTX 260 graphics processors in recognition of AMD's new RV770 GPU. The GeForce GTX 280 is now $499 ($649 at launch) and the GTX 260 is priced at $299 (down from $399). Once again demonstrating that it's not from the benevolence of the hooker, the thug or the police, that we expect more realistic havoc in Liberty City, but from GPU manufacturers' regard to their own self interest.
