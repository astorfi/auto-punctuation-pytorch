Just five months after grandly returning to the United States with the Lumia 900, Nokia's switching it out for an even better Windows Phone 8 offering. The 920's coming with a beefier display, better internals and has wholly embraced wireless charging -- but that's not the feature everyone's gonna be talking about. No, that's reserved for the 8-megapixel PureView hardware and the new imaging tech behind it. Still, that shouldn't distract from the real business at hand: identifying the tiny hardware differences that separate the current and future iterations of the flagship, which we've broken down for you after the break.
