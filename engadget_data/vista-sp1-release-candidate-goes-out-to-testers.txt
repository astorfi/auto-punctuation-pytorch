Although there don't appear to be many new features on top of what we've already seen, SP1 appears to be well-received, with testers reporting better laptop battery life, faster networking, and improved wake-from-sleep speeds. There's still no word on when the final release of SP1 will hit, but if you're in Microsoft's tester program, SP1 RC1 is available online now.
