With favorable exchange rates and an early US launch really, who could blame you? But after notifying your local customs office and paying your government tithe, the very next thing you probably did was notice that you couldn't buy iPad apps from your local iTunes app store. Now you can, at least if the sudden deluge of tweets and tips from Dutch, UK, German and Swiss iPad owners now hitting our inbox is any indication. Go ahead, give it a go and let us know the results in comments.

Update: Australia confirmed too -- it's not just Europe. Things seem a bit unstable as Apple lights up the service a week ahead of the official international iPad launch.
