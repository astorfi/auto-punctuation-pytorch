 
Samsung has dropped its "Holidays in July" bomb on the good people of Earth, and within that treasure trove are a few little gems, like the company's new Blu-ray duo, the BD-P2400, and kid sister BD-P1400. Both players feature Blu-ray playback at native HD resolution (1080p / 1080i / 720p), handle HD video at 1920 x 1080, and up-convert standard DVDs to 1080p via HDMI. The BD-P2400 also utilizes Samsung's "Hollywood Quality Video", which rocks some proprietary de-interlacing that makes Pirates of the Caribbean look really, really real. The player's audio does the regular rounds with stereo and 5.1, coaxial and optical digital outs, and Dolby Digital Plus with DTS HD and MP3 playback.; for video you get HDMI, component, S-Video and composite outs. The BD-P2400 will be available in October for $649, and the BD-P1400 in September for $549.
