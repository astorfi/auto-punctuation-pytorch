Breaking into Sling's stomping ground, Honestech's MY-IPTV kit consists of a USB 2.0 TV tuner and a piece of software that enables your 3G smartphone or WiFi-connected handset / PDA to watch live television and change the channels remotely. Additionally, users can access their television streams on any internet-connected lappie whilst pretending to pay attention in quarterly meetings, and for devices with enough computing power (and storage space), PVR capabilities are available. As expected, the kit will play nice with Windows XP and Windows Mobile operating systems, and it should be available real soon for $99.99 to $149.99 depending on extras.
