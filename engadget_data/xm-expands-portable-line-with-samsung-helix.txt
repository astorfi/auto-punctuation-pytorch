XM has also recruitedSamsung to produce the Helix (successor to the Nexus, we presume), which includeslive XM radio, 50 hours of storage for saved radio, and XM Napster for music downloads. In other words, it's almost thesame as the Inno, but made by Samsung. Oh, and Snoop Dog rocks it, so we're down, yo.
