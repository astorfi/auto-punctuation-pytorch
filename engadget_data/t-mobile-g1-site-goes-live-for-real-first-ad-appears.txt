The first G1 ad has also surfaced -- if you were tearing your hair out over Apple's grammatically-questionable "funnest iPod ever" pitch, wait'll you get a load of how "smarterer," "connecteder," and yes, "funnerer" the "most exciting phone in the history of phones" will make you. Video after the break.  [Via Pocket-lint]
