Turns out some major onlinesellers haven't gotten their initial shipments yet, with Best Buy predicting April 17th to April 24th playeravailability, and Amazon mentioning that "Million Dollar Baby" won't be ready for April 18th. There aren'tany official delays mentioned by Toshiba and friends -- who seem wellpracticed in the art by now -- so this could all be some miscommunication, but things don't look especially goodfor the earliest adopters out there. Luckily, all of this hullabaloo hasn't stopped a random Best Buy in Surf City, CAfrom accidentally selling a couple of players early, one of which was purchased Friday and is pictured above.Read:HD DVD delays; via SlashdotRead: HD DVD player released early; via HD Beat
