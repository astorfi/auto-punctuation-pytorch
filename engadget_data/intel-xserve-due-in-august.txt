But if there was ever one Apple product line in severe need of an Intel overhaul, it's their performance-sensitive server series, the Xserve. When would be the perfect time to introduce these machines? WWDC in August of course; and according to ThinkSecret, you corporate Mac nerds might be able to expect just that come fall. No Core Duos (or is it Cores Duo?) inside these boxes though, supposedly the new Xserves will be using Woodcrest chips, Intel's successor to the Xeon line.
