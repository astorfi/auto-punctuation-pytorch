It's coming to Cricket and will join the Suede (a feature phone) as the network's only smartphone with Muve Music. Like the Admire, it features an 800MHz CPU, 3.5-inch HVGA touchscreen, a 3.2MP camera and runs stock Gingerbread. While its price and release date remain elusive, we're told the requisite plan will ring in at $65 per month -- a spendy leap for the network that goes chirp in the night. Perhaps that's the rub when you combine an Android plan with unlimited song downloads, ringtones and ringback tones. Hey, nobody ever said it'd be cheap to be law-abiding.
