The carrier wasted no time getting its latest slate out in the public, showing it off at an event in NYC this afternoon. There aren't any cosmetic changes to speak of, but that faster connectivity and notable processor boost are certainly nothing to shrug at. We had a chance to see the tablet in action, and it performed fairly well, especially considering the poor connectivity environment AT&T selected to host its event. Jump past the break to see it in action in our hands-on video, or check out our full review of HP's slower, WiFi-only TouchPad.
