It'll run $149.99 on contract after rebate -- the same that Sprint is charging for the Pre, and $100 more than Verizon is charging for its own Pre Plus -- but buyers will be getting a free Touchstone charging dock along with their purchase "for a limited time" when the phone is picked up in a corporate-owned store. There's no word on the Pixi Plus yet, but hey, at least this gets Palm back on the network after an extended vacation. No word on a free mobile hotspot add-on, but hope springs eternal, we suppose.
