Expect it to come bedecked with a 2-megapixelcamera, 262k color QVGA display, "semi-auto" bi-directional swinging hinge, MicroSD, 70MB of flash memory,stereo speakers, and, of course, EV-DO. We'd let you know how much it costs and when it launches, but well, we don'treally know yet ourselves. [Warning: PDF link]
