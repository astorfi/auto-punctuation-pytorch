You know it's the modern age when you can tote around both your
fitness coach and your dietitian in your pocket. One of
many new offerings cropping up in the fitness/diet technology realm is the MyFoodPhone service from Quebec City-based
NATS, Inc. Customers use cameraphones to snap photos of their meals, send them to a web site and get back advice from a
registered dietitian on how to modify the portions or selections to reach health or weight goals. NATS says their
service helps "keep dieters honest," because with traditional food journals dieters have a tendency to underestimate
portion sizes. All of this instant advice doesn't come cheap â€” you'll be shelling out $149 per month for all those
dinners out with your portable dietitian, and you'll still be picking up the meal tab.
