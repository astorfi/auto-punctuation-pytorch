We already knew it was sporting Sprint EV-DO when we saw the cute little slider at CES, and it's not like there's much of a swap involved, but we're sure plenty of VZW users will be pleased to learn that they don't need to jump ship to get wireless data on this thing. However, as nice as the addition of Verizon might be, along with that announcement last week of a Vista edition of 02, what we really want OQO to start working on is shipping these things out the door -- 6-8 weeks seems like such an eternity.[Thanks, Alan S]
