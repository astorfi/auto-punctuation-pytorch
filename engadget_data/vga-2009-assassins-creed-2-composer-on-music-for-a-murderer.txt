We squeezed them for information as fast as we could while simultaneously wishing them holiday cheer and good tidings. Yes, it was as awkward as it sounds. Here's what we learned from Jesper Kyd, music composer for Assassin's Creed 2.

How do you begin composing music for a 15th century assassin?

That was very hard to figure out. First, you have to stop thinking and start researching, because it can be overwhelming. The finished game had over three hours of music in it, so it's really about slowing down, experimenting, researching and seeing what sticks.

Did you compose the music for the minstrels and everything?

Every single note in there is my music! That was a lot of fun, some of those small bits.
