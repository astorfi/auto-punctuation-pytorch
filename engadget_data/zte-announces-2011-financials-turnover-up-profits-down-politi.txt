  ZTE's annual earnings report is out and it's a mixed bag for the Chinese company with aspirations to go west. Revenues grew 23 percent to 86.25 billion RMB ($13.7 billion) but net profit fell a hefty 36.6 percent to 2.06 billion RMB ($327 million). More than half of ZTE's operating revenue came from overseas as the company moves into the global space and, while some of that cash came from its smartphone business, much more poured in from the infrastructure arm that supplies LTE equipment to networks. At the same time, ZTE is having to deal with accusations that it sold $131 million worth of snooping gear to Iran to monitor its own citizens, forcing the company to limit its operations there -- although it insists this won't have any impact on its future income.

ZTE also was the fourth-largest mobile manufacturer in the world in terms of shipments during the year. Growth from both mainland China as well as high-end markets like the United States, France and the U.K. were the main sources of the company's handset sales growth in 2011.  In addition to the company's growth in global market shares, ZTE sustained its strength in patent applications. Based on an announcement by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), ZTE filed for the most PCT patents of any company worldwide in 2011 with 2,826 filings.

"During the year, ZTE adjusted its product lines to continue to provide comprehensive integrated solutions to carriers. A range of measures designed to improve efficiency and optimize production processes also were introduced."  Mr. Hou added: "In 2012, ZTE will continue its commitment to technological innovation. The company will proactively shift from being product-oriented to a solutions-oriented business. We intend to further consolidate our market position by expanding into the government enterprise and service sectors. We also seek to increase sales to mainstream carriers.
