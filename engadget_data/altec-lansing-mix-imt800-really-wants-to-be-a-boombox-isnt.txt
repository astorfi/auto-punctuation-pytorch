The Mix iMT800 might not quite have the necessary panache to compete with the Lasonic i931, but it still talks a good fight. With a 5.25-inch side-firing subwoofer, it should live up to its boast of "towering volume," while a pair of useful 3.5mm line inputs will allow you to jack in non-Apple players too. We've got a couple more images after the break, including the totally rad remote and mean-looking woofer, and if you like what you see, they're available now for $299.
