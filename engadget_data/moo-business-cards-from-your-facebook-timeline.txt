Moo has announced a clever new design, which allows you to "take your Facebook Timeline offline, and hand it out to new friends, contacts and potential clients." Wildly enough, creating 'em is as easy as tweaking your Timeline. Once you're ready to roll, just sign in and allow Moo to access your data (cue privacy advocate yelling), check that you spelled your name right and hand over $15 for a stack of 50 cards.

Update: Looks like there is a Like button after you've ordered. Nice!
