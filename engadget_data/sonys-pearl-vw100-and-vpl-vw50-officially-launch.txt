Granted, ¥1,365,000 and ¥735,000 (about $11,660 and $6300 US) for their new Pearl VW100 and VPL-VW50 projectors isn't exactly mass market, but you don't have to put on your Sunday best and go to one of the now-defunct Qualia boutiques to get one, either. Expect a 15,000:1 contrast ratio, 1080p high def picture, 200 or 400W bulb, and some combination of HDMI, DVD, VGA, component, composite, and S-Video inputs.
