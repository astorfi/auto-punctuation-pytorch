iPod-looking things are pretty much pouring from the sky these days, whether they're
ripoffs or
accessories, but we're fairly sure Sega Toys' idog is the
first canine robot to join the party. Looks aside, it does the usual stuff we've come to expect from robot pets, like
responding "emotionally" to touches to its various sensors. Its main claim to fame is its musical ability, though:
it'll improvise tunes based on 720 internal musical phrases, changing the mood of the music as you wave your hand
over the phototransistor on its head (could…get…old…real…fast…). They've even included an external audio jack on its
hindquarters for you to connect an external player; no prizes for guessing the device of choice for the MP3 enema at
their press event. And yes, it does waggle its ears and paws in time to the music.
