 Sure, you can head over to Nike's online shoe repository and haphazardly toggle through color options for a custom pair of kicks. Or, you could let your Instagram library do the heavy lifting. With the new PHOTOiD HTML5 web app, the shoe maker combines those filtered smartphone snapshots with its custom ordering process. Once a photo has been selected, the software applies the color palette to a pair of Air Max 1, 90 or 95 sneakers -- based on the available color library for each footwear option, of course. From there, sharing is enabled through the usual social networks and creations can be purchased to hit your doorstep in about a month. Consult the source link below to color your pair of Air Max 90s based on yesterday's sandwich or iced coffee.
