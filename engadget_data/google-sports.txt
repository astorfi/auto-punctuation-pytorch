 Google's big push toward richer search just got a bit more sporty. The site announced that it's adding sports schedules, stats and other contextual information to its results. Interested parties can now find game scores, full league standings, schedules grouped by day and week and can drill down for more info on players in individual games. For the sake of timeliness, March Madness answer cards now feature a bracket view, which can be viewed on desktop or mobile, if you're the betting type.
