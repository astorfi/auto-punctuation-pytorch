That's really the only difference we see between the $239 XL 335S announced today and the $249 XL340S announced back in April -- both have 4.3-inch touchscreens and the usual Map Share, IQ Routes, and Advanced Lane Guidance features, but the new kid won't go south of the border. We'd spring for the extra peace of mind, honestly -- but if you're willing to live dangerously, the 335S is on sale now.
