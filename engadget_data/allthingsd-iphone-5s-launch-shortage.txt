If last week's announcement got you all worked up about a new Apple handset, you may have to wait a little while longer. AllThingsD reports that sources from multiple US carriers are showing "grotesquely" low inventory leading up to Friday's iPhone 5s launch. It's worth noting that stock numbers typically fall short of the demand (especially at the start), but it seems that this release may be even worse than years past. Of course, with a rainbow of other options hitting shelves on the same day, perhaps the high-end model isn't demanding the same amount of attention this time around.
