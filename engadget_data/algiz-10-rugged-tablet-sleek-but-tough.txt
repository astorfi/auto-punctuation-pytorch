The 10.4-inch tablet manages to meet the tough MIL-STD-810F military standards for shock, vibration, and moisture and can operate in temps from -4 to 140 Fahrenheit in a housing that's not entirely ugly, and still pack in a ULV 1.2GHz Core Duo, 80GB drive, 2GB of RAM, WiFi, Bluetooth, an EDGE / GPRS radio and a beefy nine-cell 7800mAh Li-on battery that can run Windows XP for seven hours. No word on pricing, but if you're the type who actually needs one of these, we're guessing it's worth it.[Via PDA Today, thanks Bill]
