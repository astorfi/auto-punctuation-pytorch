The first TV series Netflix and Marvel are working on isn't even done, but the two are already looking forward to the next one: AKA Jessica Jones. Confirming the rumors, the two announced Krysten Ritter (Don't Trust the B in Apt. 23, Breaking Bad) will play the super hero-turned-detective Jessica Jones. She will be joined by Mike Colter (Halo: Nightfall, The Good Wife, American Horror Story) playing Luke Cage, a character that will get his own series on Netflix after a short detour with Iron Fist. Once you've processed those bits of information -- plus how everything lines up with the next few years of Marvel Cinematic Universe films, and that The Defenders miniseries -- then it's probably time to check out an early peek at Daredevil before it gets the whole thing kicked off. Ready for 2015 yet?
