 You may no longer be able to get your NBC fix on iTunes, but you may soon be able to soothe that downloader's angst with the fine motion pictures of the Fox Corporation. AppleInsider claims Apple and Rupie M. are close to a deal that would put Fox's full catalog on iTunes, which would basically end a year of standoff negotiations between the two. AI says that it was actually Apple that backed down at the table, and that Fox will be allowed some pricing flexibility for new movies. That's pretty interesting, considering how resolute Apple's been on the pricing issue as it applies to music -- looks like movies get a little more love from Mr. Pixar. Either way, we won't find out what's what for a while -- AI also says that the deal won't be announced until after the holidays so as not to interfere with DVD sales.
