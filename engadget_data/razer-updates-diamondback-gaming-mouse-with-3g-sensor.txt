As with that mouse, the Diamondback will give you an impressive 1800 dpi resolution, along with on-the-fly sensitivity adjustment, seven independently programmable buttons, and a rubberized non-slip finish, not to mention a choice of colors to light up your desk. Look for it to be available at the beginning of next month for $60.
