The tablet will offer HD video streaming, real-time video, multi-party conferencing, plus all the regular tablet functions like messaging, email, and browsing. We're not sure about the size of the device yet, or any of it technical specs, but we do know that it's going to weigh in at 1.15lbs, so it can't be terrifically large. There's also no word yet on pricing yet, but expect to see the device the first quarter of 2011; we'll let you know about the former as soon as we do, okay, businessmen? Full press release is below.

Update: And now we've got video showing off the Cius under the drone of a limp corporate voiceover and synthesized soundtrack. How can you resist clicking through to the embed?
