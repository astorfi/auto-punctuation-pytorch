The 7-inch Galaxy Tab (previously referred to as the S-Pad), runs Android with Samsung's TouchWiz UI on top (similar to the Galaxy S sitting next to it). According to the Tweets by Samsung Blog South Africa -- an odd place indeed to make this sort of unveiling -- it has a "high resolution" screen, and it's supposed to be AMOLED if an earlier leak on the "S-Pad" is to be believed. That S-Pad info also mentioned a Samsung Apps store, which would make sense because as far as we know Google isn't letting "official" Android Market-equipped, Google-blessed tablets out of the gate just yet.
