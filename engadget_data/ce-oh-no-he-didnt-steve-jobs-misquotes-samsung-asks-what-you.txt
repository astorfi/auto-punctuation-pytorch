Before unveiling the iPad 2 today the man in black and denim listed that early misquote -- which was widely and officially corrected -- as evidence to prove that the iPad's competition was floundering. Admittedly that isn't far from the truth, but there's no need to go putting words in other executives' mouths to make a point.
