The new AON MDH-501H/D headphones from Wav-on can take a juicy S/PDIF plug straight from a HD source, which is then decoded for the six internal speakers inside the gargantuan headphones. Of course, with the power requirements of the decoder, along with the extreme bulk of all included components, it's going to be a bit difficult to take this surround sound gig on the road, but we're sure plenty of gamers and movie nuts can find refuge in its sound-containing capabilities for late night media consumption sessions. The unit should be available late November in Korea for 149,000 KRW, about $159 US.
