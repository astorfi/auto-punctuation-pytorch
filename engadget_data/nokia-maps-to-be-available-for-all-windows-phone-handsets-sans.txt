According to ZDNet, Windows Phone users should expect to see Nokia Maps pop up as a free app on the Windows Phone Marketplace "within the next couple of weeks," though offline voice navigation feature will remain restricted to the Lumia 710 and 800, in the form of Nokia Drive. No word yet on when the app will officially hit the market, but we'll definitely keep a close eye on it.
