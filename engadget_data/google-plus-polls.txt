Last month, Google nabbed a polling startup in order to boost the tools of its social network. Well, the folks in Mountain View didn't waste any time, as polls are already set to make their debut on Google+. The new feature is rolling out now, in case you need to crowdsource info for your next excursion or are curious to see which team the masses think will win the World Series. Polls can include up to five options with photos for each, and one click displays the ongoing results. Android and web users can expect to see the option "over the next few days," while it's said to be "coming soon" to iOS.
