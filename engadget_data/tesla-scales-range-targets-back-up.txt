As you might recall, this follows a scaling back of range targets to just 200 miles per charge back in April, when the company's original estimates fell by the wayside when the car hit the dynamometer. One thing that's apparently not being pushed up, however, is the car's release date, with The New York Times also reporting that the initial run of 600 cars will now only "begin production late this year," making that promised roll out by the end of the year a bit of a tight proposition.[Via AutoblogGreen]
