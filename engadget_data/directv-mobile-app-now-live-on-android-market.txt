No official requirements published yet, but an educated guess would suggest they'd be the same as the iPhone counterpart. The lucky folks over at DBSTalk have once again had a chance to preview this DirecTV app before it went live on Android Market last night, so either get to downloading or head over now for their dandy walkthrough.
