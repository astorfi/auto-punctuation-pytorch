'Course, we aren't going to assume the worse just yet, but it's not like we haven't heard the dreaded d-word (that's "delay" if you're wondering) flung around in regard to this unit before. Nevertheless, Amazon has just recently pushed the estimated release out from mid-January to February of next year, meaning that the eBay value of your recently acquired BD-UP5000 just creeped up a little. So, dear readers, are any of you having any luck locating this thing elsewhere? Or should we be that much more envious of those who managed to grab one already?[Thanks, Kevin B.]
