  Another day of waiting never killed everyone and a good thing too as we had a few technical difficulties that prevented us from delivering the show on time. Never the less, the big news this week was from Netflix and the fact that evidently Blu-ray has finally grown popular enough that the cost of renting them is impacting the bottom line and thus it gets passed on to the consumer -- surprised, we're not. Of course this spun off a much larger debate of the event's impact on the internet TV ecosystem and where are we headed? Eventually we move on from talking up downloads and talk a little Blu-ray. Like the new Samsung player, another interesting poll and Microsoft's tight ties with HD DVD. Speaking of Microsoft, we talk a little codec mess, but eventually move on to some miscellaneous stories like TBS-HD stretching, DirecTV's iPhone app and a HDTV's energy consumption.
