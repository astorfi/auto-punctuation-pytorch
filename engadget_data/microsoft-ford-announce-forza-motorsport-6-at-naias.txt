In a joint statement, auto manufacturer Ford and console manufacturer Microsoft have officially confirmed the next entry in the Xbox's hit racing franchise, Forza Motorsport 6, is currently in development for the Xbox One.

This announcement comes from the ongoing North American International Auto Show in Detroit, where Ford has just unveiled its new Ford GT supercar - the same supercar seen above, which will grace the cover of Forza Motorsport 6. Additionally, the two companies also announced the game will feature the newly revealed F-150 Raptor and Shelby GT350 Mustang models before they are available to the public.
