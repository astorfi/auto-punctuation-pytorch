 We heard that Legend Silicon and Intel were teaming up to push HDTV dongles in China, and push they have. aigo has just announced that it has used technology from the former to build USB TV tuners for catching OTA HD signals on laptops, PCs or any other manner of devices capable of watching video. In China, it's estimated that many of the devices will be used to watch the upcoming Olympics in Beijing in glorious high-definition, while DVB-T users in Europe will have yet another choice for snagging HD on-the-run. Reportedly, the tuners will demand around $100 a pop, but there's no word on where or when they'll show up.
