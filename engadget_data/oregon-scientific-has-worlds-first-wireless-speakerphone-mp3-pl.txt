In a nutshell it's a wireless speakerphone with a SD card mp3 player and an alarm clockwith FM radio, of which Oregon claims is the world's first. Yay for the world. So the next time you're yapping on thattotally played cordless of yours, remember how you could be lounging in style, speakerphoning on the porch and readinga manual to figure out how you use the other 95 functions offered by this little guy.
