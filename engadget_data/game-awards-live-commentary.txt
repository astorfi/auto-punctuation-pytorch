The Game Awards kick off at 9PM ET (6PM PT) and we're hosting the entire show live on Twitch, complete with ridiculous commentary from your trusted Playdate team, Timothy Seppala, Sean Buckley and myself, Jessica Conditt. This is The Game Awards' second year running and it's poised to be a big, fancy affair filled with new trailers, game announcements, famous guests (including Kiefer Sutherland and Shaq) and musical interludes. And, of course, awards.

There are 22 categories, but titles up for "Game of the Year" are Bloodborne, Fallout 4, Metal Gear Solid V, Super Mario Maker and The Witcher 3. Watch along with us in this post, on Twitch.tv/Joystiq or on the Engadget Gaming homepage.
