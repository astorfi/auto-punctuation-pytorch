 Want to know just when T-Mobile's LTE network goes live? Not long, if you ask CTO Neville Ray. On stage at CES, he declared that the faster access should go live in Las Vegas within "weeks." That includes a full-on LTE-Advanced network, and the deployment should be fast with 100 million customers reached in the first half of 2013. Devices? Nothing was immediately confirmed on stage, but Ray and other executives told us and others that the Galaxy Note II's known latent LTE could be switched on through a firmware update -- although we weren't told when. Magenta customers still have good reason to be happy, however, knowing that their days of being HSPA-only pariahs should soon be over.
