The Hello Kitty fembot, as this uncanny specimen shall be henceforth named, also includes a wider repertoire of expressions, which are supposedly smoother, making it more likely that innocent bystanders will be fooled, and hardcore robot/Hello Kitty enthusiasts like us will have haunted dreams. If you're man enough to navigate the uncanny valley, you can rent the HKfb for events for a mere 400,000 Yen ($3,389 US), which gets you 5 days with the fembot, though we suppose delivery costs to the US won't be cheap, and "choreography" charges do apply as well.
