Though it originally seemed like you'd need to drop an additional $50 annually to get your on-demand TV fix via PlayStation 3, it turns out that the PlayStation Plus is not technically needed for Hulu Plus functionality. Concerned console owners emailing support@hulu.com are being told Sony's premium service is "only a requirement during the preview period," after which point "you should be able to download the Hulu Plus app," which will still require Hulu's own $10 monthly subscription, of course. We reached out to a Hulu representative and confirmed the above for ourselves -- so the only question is how long you'll have to wait without shelling out.
