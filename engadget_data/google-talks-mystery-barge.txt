It's stayed mum as speculation has run rampant about just what the "mystery barges" under construction in San Francisco and Portland, Maine will actually be used for, but Google has now finally offered its first official comment on the matter. In a statement provided to TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson says that while "it's still early days and things may change," the company is "exploring using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology."


That mostly lines up with a report from San Francisco TV station KPIX 5 last week that the barges would serve as a "high-end showroom," although Google seems to be downplaying the existence of a "party deck." Unfortunately, the company still isn't offering much more than that brief comment, so it remains to be seen just what those interactive spaces will look like.
