 A Dusseldorf, Germany regional court has partly lifted a preliminary injunction issued last week banning Samsung from selling the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Europe, the day after Webwereld noticed inconsistencies in Apple's injunction filing. Now Europeans (save those living in Germany) won't need to trek to the Netherlands to get their Tab fix -- at least until a verdict is issued after Samsung's August 25th appeal hearing. Sales of the device were originally banned following an Apple lawsuit alleging patent infringement, but were permitted to resume after a realization that a German court may not have the authority to halt sales of a South Korean company's device outside of Germany. Since the judgement didn't affect devices that had already been distributed to retailers, it's unknown whether or not the week-long ban has had any effect on sales.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
