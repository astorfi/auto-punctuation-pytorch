 This is all pretty standard procedure, and totally expected after the company's rebuttal this summer, but Intel is responding to EU's antitrust charges against them and will seek a hearing. The specific charges and Intel's response are still confidential, which means there aren't a lot of specifics about the mud slinging between these two, but the general thrust is that the EU thinks Intel is hurting competition and therefore consumers by offering chips below cost, and semi-bribing manufacturers to sell Intel exclusively. Obviously, Intel's saying it stuck to the law in this situation. Stakes are high, since the EU can fine companies up to 10% of global revenues, and it certainly looks like we're in for a protracted fight on this one.
