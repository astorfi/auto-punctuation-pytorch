Philips isn't showing off anything too groundbreaking at CES in the audio department, but it looks to be a solid offering all-around nonetheless. Whether you're eyeing the likes of a new soundbar for your home theater system or portable wireless speakers, the company should have you covered with latest Fidelio offerings -- and, of course, that's not all. We've got a quick breakdown of all the goods being shown off after the break, along with eyes-on galleries so you can get up-close looks for yourself.

 Not to be outdone by Soul Electronics' Party In A Box (yes, it's an actual thing), Phillips is introducing its Party Machine FWP3200D (again, we're not making this stuff up). This massive 300-watt boomybox (pictured above) features faux-DJ turntables, and two 30-pin docks for fading between between your playlists on your iPods and iPhones -- you you can even install an app on your devices for a more realistic DJing experience. The system's speakers light up for ambient effects, and you can either hit a MAX boost button or add external units to the system for even more volume. It'll be available this month for $350.
