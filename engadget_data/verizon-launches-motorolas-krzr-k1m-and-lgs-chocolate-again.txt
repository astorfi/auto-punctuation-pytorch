Well kinda, since their new White Chocolate only appears on what looks to be a Verizon staging site at the mo' with actual launch still expected tomorrow for $130 and a 2 year commitment. Just don't forget to treat yourself to a speakerphone with the ol' firmware trick hear, 'cause it looks from the site to ship without. Also up is the return on the K1m KRZR only now in a ghostly white with gray exterior -- yours to ship home for $200 after on-line discount and two-year contractual obligation akin to a feast of apples and rzrbldz.[Thanks, John and Bob the Builder]Read -- LG Chocolate (white) Read -- Motorola MOTOKRZR K1m
