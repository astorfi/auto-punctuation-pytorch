The radio's got everything that you'd expect from a Marshall amp, with the black wood durability, dark vinyl, but best of all -- this time it really does go up to 11. Further, there's apparently a "bass reflex port for enhanced bass performance" along with "active-filters to provide a natural 'direct-from-the-studio' sound," whatever all that means. Digital-Lifestyles tells us that this radio will sell in the UK for 100 quid ($190), hand delivered by Alice Cooper himself. We're not worthy.
