If you'll recall, the behemoth is the first Dell monitor to sport the emerging DisplayPort technology, and it also offers a fairly impressive set of other connectivity options, including dual DVI ports, HDMI, VGA, S-Video, component, and composite. The folks at Hot Hardware weren't totally stoked on the setup process, but loved the screen's performance and flexibility. The cats at Computer Shopper seemed pleased as well, though not head-over-heels in love, particularly with the high price tag and color / grayscale "weakness." CNET Australia had similarly high marks, praising the number of inputs, super-high resolution, and sheer size, though they took issue with the screen's reflectiveness, the need for a high-end graphics card, and gradient handling. Still, none of the minuses stopped them (and Hot Hardware) from bestowing their "Editor's Choice" award on the monitor. Don't take our word for it, though -- hit the links and see for yourself.Read - Hot Hardware (Editor's Choice)Read - Computer Shopper (8.0 out of 10)Read - CNET Australia (8.9 out of 10)
