If you had any doubt this will be a world phone, tests confirming quadband 2G and pentaband 3G (2100/1900/1700/900/850 MHz) should put those to rest, while 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi spread over 2.4 and 5GHz means it'll be quick to download the goods around the house. Models with 16 and 64GB are shown, though squint all we could we couldn't count the difference on the teardown pics, which you can enjoy for yourself in the gallery below.

Look closely on the internal photos and you'll note the petite SIM tray and a 1,450mAh battery that relies on a wired connector. It is, quite clearly, not meant for easy user accessibility. Appetite still not sated? The full user manual is also there, ready for your download. And just think, a few minutes ago you didn't have any good reading material for this weekend.
