HTC promised that One owners would get Android 4.4 KitKat within 90 days of the OS' announcement, and it's now detailing when specific countries will get their turn. The company's North American and UK branches both say that they will start upgrading Ones to KitKat by late January, or right at the tail end of the 90-day window. There isn't any word regarding the upgrade schedules in other large countries. However, Droid DNA fans won't be left out -- HTC says they should get KitKat by the end of first quarter, or no later than March.
