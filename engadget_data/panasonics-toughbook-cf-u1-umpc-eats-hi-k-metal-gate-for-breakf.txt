So rugged in fact, that only a case of glass and gravel can withhold it from Intel's new Atom branding. We can't tell you much without an official announcement or any PR types around to drone on (and on) about its Mil-Spec or Ingress ratings. Regardless, it'll still look great strapped to the dash of your Hummer as you pull into the strip mall for a milkshake. And that's all that really matters right, Mr. Milquetoast?
