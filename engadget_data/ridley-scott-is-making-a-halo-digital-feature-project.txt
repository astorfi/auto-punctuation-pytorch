Remember that Halo film that wasn't happening? Microsoft representatives have confirmed that the old rumors are true: a Halo feature is in the works, and it's being produced by Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien, Prometheus, Call of Duty Elite: Friday Night Fights). Unfortunately, the confirmation is intentionally vague, offering no other information save for the project's director (Battlestar Galactica's Sergio Mimica-Gezzan) and a promise that it won't overlap with Spielberg's TV series. It's described as a "digital feature project," which implies that the production will end up skipping the box office entirely. Well, either that, or Microsoft is just really excited about the kind of cameras it's using. According to Variety, it could be something similar to the Halo: Forward Unto Dawn short-form episodes. We'll find out pretty soon, regardless -- the project is set for release sometime later this year.
