 It's gotten a bit drowned out in all the Note 8.0 fanfare, but there's another notable member of Samsung's Galaxy being shown off here at MWC 2013: the Xcover 2. Announced late this past January, the Android Jelly Bean (4.1.2) handset is a 4-inch ruggedized device made for active lifestyles. To that end, it bears IP certification for dust- and water-proofing (up to 30 minutes at a depth of one meter). Understandably, its spec load is modest, with a dual-core 1GHz processor (unspecified), 1GB RAM, 800 x 480 display, 4GB storage (expandable via microSD) and 1,700mAh battery.

 Since the Xcover 2's meant to be taken outdoors, its body is rife with notches and grips -- so it won't slip out of your hand. The dimpled plastic back, similar to that on the Galaxy Nexus -- has a wrap-around illusion and can only be pried off by turning the lock at its base. Ports for microSD, SIM and 3.5mm headphone jack are all covered by protective flaps, as you'd imagine.

 We couldn't get confirmation on the exact CPU inside the Xcover 2, but take our word for it: performance is sluggish. Effect any of the hard Android navigation keys on the bottom and you'll notice a bit of lag before the OS kicks into action. It's to be expected for a device of this nature -- most users eyeing the Xcover 2 likley aren't keen on top-end specs and high-performance. Samsung still hasn't clarified just where or when we'll be seeing the handset crop up, so stay tuned. In the meanwhile, check out our gallery below and brief video demo after the break.
