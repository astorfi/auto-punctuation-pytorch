 Rdio knows you work hard for your money. That's why the social networky music service announced its intentions to offer users free access to its massive music library without dropping dollar one, turning over a credit card number or getting served up ads, Spotify-style. The company isn't revealing much in the way of details beyond that, only promising that the offer will be made available to all consumers "in the very near future." The deal certainly sounds like too good to be true territory, but Rdio adds that it's "confident" users of the free version will be enamored with the service enough to pony up and subscribe.
