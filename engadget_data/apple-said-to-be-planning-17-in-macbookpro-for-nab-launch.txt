According to AppleInsider, the company is due to roll out a 17-inch version of the Core Duo-powered MacBook Pro at the National Association of Broadcastersconference next week. According to the report, the 17-inch MBP would include a faster processor than the 2.16GHzversion currently available in the 15-incher's top configuration. That could put pricing for the model well above$3,000, given the $2,800 price for the 2.16GHz version -- which may explain why Apple's choosing to show it off for TVpros, who may be willing to splurge for a high-end box, especially if they can run an Intel-native version of Apple'sFinal Cut Studio on it for a mere $1,300 more. Hmm, maybe that G4 isn't such a bad deal after all.[Thanks,Adam]
