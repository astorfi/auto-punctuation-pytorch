 Whew. That's a relief. We were afraidfor a while there that we'd have to go a whole week without any rumors about Apple's alleged plans for a "true video iPod." ButThinkSecret has come through as usual. According to the site, Apple had been on track to release the widescreen videoiPod in time for the company's 30th birthdaythis month, but had to delay the project due to display problems and negotiations with movie studios. ThinkSecretclaims that Apple is committed to a touchscreen controller including a "virtual track wheel," but actuallyachieving this has proven to be a challenge for Apple's display manufacturer. Meanwhile Apple is reportedly having ahard time negotiating content deals with movie studios. According to ThinkSecret, the company wants to stick with theiTunes model of selling individual flicks, while the studios are looking for a MusicNet-style subscription service.We've got an idea: as long as Apple is chatting it up with the otherApple, why not see if the rights to "Help" and "A Hard Days Night" are available? Eitherthat or they can see if Disney's working on a sequel to "High SchoolMusical."
