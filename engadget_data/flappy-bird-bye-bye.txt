Oh no! We sure hope you were able to download Flappy Bird before its imminent extinction. Because, as promised, developer Dong Nguyen has officially removed the insanely popular game from both the App Store and Google Play. There's no need to shed tears if you've already installed it, since you can still play it and continue to frustrate over how terribly low your scores are. Even so, it's a little sad to see Flappy Bird go -- especially given that there are probably some people (like this editor's mom) who never got to experience it. Who knows, maybe it'll make a triumphant comeback one day.
