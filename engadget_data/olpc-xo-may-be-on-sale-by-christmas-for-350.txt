Or $525. Or maybe not at all. The foundation is looking for ways to subsidize manufacturing so it can ship more of the green-eared machines to developing countries, and it's hoping that consumer sales will help foot the bill -- although NickNeg and Co. haven't decided at what price the plan is feasible and won't announce a decision for another month. One thing is certain, however: releasing these things to consumers will definitely not solve that itty-bitty porn problem.[Via OLPC News][Thanks, Wayan]
