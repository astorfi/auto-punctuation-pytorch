The company isn't providing any more information until the official debut at January's North American International Auto Show in Detroit, but we're hoping we'll get some more details about those plug-in fleet tests, as well as those solar plans. Check a few more shots at links below.[Thanks, Miko34]Read - 2010 Prius photos on Prius ChatRead - Toyota corporate blog
