The first juicy tidbit concerns the graphics chipset, which now looks like it will be two NVIDIA GeForce GO 8700M GTs coupled using SLI, which should make the performance somewhat blazing (and the temperature downright fiery), additionally, the system can / will utilize high capacity SSDs (a feature which we've seen in other gamer-targeted laptops lately). If you really wanna get to know the guts of this monstrosity, however, you should hit the photo gallery.
