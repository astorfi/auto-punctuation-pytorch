All those rumors about how Apple was going to intro a new iPod with a built-in mic to make it easier to record
podcasts seemed pretty half-hearted at best, so for the time being you'll have to satisfy yourself with one of those
third-party add-ons. Belkin has a new one out called the TuneTalk, and while we're sure it's fine, the real issue when
it comes to making recordings with an iPod isn't the quality of the mic, it's the ridiculously low bitrate at which
Apple caps iPod recordings.
