The FCC's controversial plans for a new version of net neutrality are still open for public comment for a few more days, and Chairman Tom Wheeler -- continuing to fight charges that he may be a dingo -- says it's already received over 647,000 comments so far. The 60 day period for public comment runs out on the 15th though, so if you want your voice to be heard then about fast lanes, Title II or anything else, then now is the time. The internet may not have crashed the FCC's website -- hackers did that -- but it can still have an effect on the way we connect in the future. Read the FCC's proposal here, and send your comments in via openinternet@fcc.gov.
