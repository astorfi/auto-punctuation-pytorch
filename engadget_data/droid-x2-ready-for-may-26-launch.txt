Droid-Life uncovered possible promo materials discussing the entrance strategy for the X2, in conjunction with several of the phone's specs. These docs strongly indicate May 26 is the magic day for a full-scale assault, with early orders allowed as soon as May 19. We don't see any major surprises in specs -- there's a dual-core Tegra 2 1GHz processor, 4.3-inch qHD screen, 8MP rear camera, and 1080p HDMI-out video, to list off the highlights -- although we are excited to see Gingerbread may be in the mix here, indicated by the ever-so-subtle blue bar seen on the phone's screen. We hope you can understand our hesitation, though, since an unproven spec sheet from Pocketnow suggests we should only expect Froyo. No way of knowing who will win this little argument, but you know which one we're rooting for. Check out another leaked image after the break.
