According to the UK's Official Nintendo Magazine, the refreshed console will sport a streamlined look and adjusted configuration, designed for horizontal orientation, rather than vertical. It will also be included in a "Family Edition" bundle scheduled for a holiday release, alongside a Wii Remote Plus, Nunchuk controller, and editions of Wii Party and Wii Sports. The downside, however, is that the slimmed-down Wii won't be compatible with GameCube games or controllers, though it will reportedly be sold at a reduced, unspecified price. No word yet on whether Nintendo has a similar update in store for markets outside of the UK, but we'll let you know as soon as we find out.
