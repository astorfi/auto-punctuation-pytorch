Like the PS3, a special Netflix "instant-streaming" disc will be required for the Wii, and it goes without saying that HD's out of the question since the Wii itself can't push above 480p. There'll be no additional fees beyond Netflix's usual monthly subscription. Time for a game of Mario Kart to celebrate, no?

Update: the Netflix sign-up page is now live! [Via Joystiq]
