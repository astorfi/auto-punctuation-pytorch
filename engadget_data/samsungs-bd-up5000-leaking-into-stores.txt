Currently, the unit is out of stock online at both Circuit City and Best Buy, but a quick zip code check revealed that it was actually in stock and begging for an owner in select New York, Texas and New Mexico locations (just to name a few). Of course, it looks as though CC is charging a whopping two bills less than its scorned rival, so we'd probably head that way if at all possible. We're calling on you, dear readers -- let us know where the BD-UP5000 is (and isn't). After you snag your own, of course.[Thanks, Bill M.]Read - BD-UP5000 at Best BuyRead - BD-UP5000 at Circuit City
