High five, assholes. Unfortunately, we're not seeing a huge performance improvement: it's a tiny bit snappier, but we're still seeing unresponsive buttons, laggy scrolling, and random WiFi disconnects. On to version 1.2!

P.S.- Screenshot of the new non-censoring app in action after the break. Be careful, it could damage more delicate constitutions.
