They've already got 45 titles lined up for the service, including popular titles like like National Treasure, Spider-Man 2 and Scarface. The new Sprint Movies service is in addition to Sprint's current mSpot movie service, which offers an all-you-can-eat selection of video content for 7 bucks a month. Sprint Movies can be controlled much like a DVD, with the ability to skip between chapters and resume the flick where it gets left off. Movies cost between $4 and $6 each, with rental periods ranging from 24 hours and one week, and 24 hour extensions are available for a buck. Check the read link for the full movie selection -- we're totally all over that Kindergarten Cop action.
