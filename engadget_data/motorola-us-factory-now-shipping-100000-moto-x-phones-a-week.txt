If you're anything like us, you're wondering just how well Motorola's Fort Worth factory is coping with demand for Moto X smartphones. The answer? Well enough, thank you: CEO Dennis Woodside just told Reuters in an interview that the US-based plant is shipping about 100,000 Moto X units each week. While that's nowhere near the millions of units that Apple or Samsung would ship in a similar space of time, Woodside notes that the factory is still ramping up. Current numbers also don't reflect sales, since only some devices already have buyers. We'd add that Motorola is targeting just a handful of countries versus the global scale of its rivals. It's doubtful that the company's Fort Worth production will ever come close to that of manufacturing hubs like Shenzhen, but there's early signs that the American factory is here to stay.
