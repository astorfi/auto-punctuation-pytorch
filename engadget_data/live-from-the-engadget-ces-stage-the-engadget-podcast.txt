 Let's get this party started right. Today may have the first official day of CES 2013, but it feels like we've been working at this forever. There's a ton of news to discuss already, and we've got an hour to do it in. Join Tim, Brian and some special guests like Make Magazine's Matt Richardson to catch up on all the news you've missed and to play around with some of the show's cooler toys.
