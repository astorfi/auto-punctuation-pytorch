Boasting four hot-swappable bays and a ravishing design, this here NAS device is suitable for avid home users and the everyday small business owner. 'Round back, we found four USB 2.0 sockets, an Ethernet jack and an eSATA port, but why not head to the gallery and see all of it with your own two eyes?
