 Neuroshad great timing when it released its second generation standaloneMPEG-4 recorder last year. Not only is the Neuros 2 able to record video directly to Memory Sticks -- making PSPowners less dependent on costly UMD discs -- but it can also save files at a size that makes them easily usable on theiPod with video (though getting them on the iPod still requires a round trip through a computer). Reg Hardware gottheir hands on one of the recorders, and found it to be well worth its $150 price, pointing out that the cost is aboutthe same as eight UMDs (or a few hours of TV from the iTunes Music Store). Reg Hardware also liked the device's ease ofuse and video quality, including its "near DVD" Super Fine setting which allows decent playback on a TV. Theone downside: cropping and stretching quirks for videos saved at certain aspect ratios -- though Reg Hardware pointsout some good workarounds.
