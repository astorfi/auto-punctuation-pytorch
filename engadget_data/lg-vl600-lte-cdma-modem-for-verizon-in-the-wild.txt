As is usually the case with these early devices on next-gen networks, this USB stick doesn't look quite as svelte as we'd probably like it to be, but we have little doubt that they'll get progressively thinner and sexier over the course of a year or three. And hey, in the meantime, far be it from us to steer clear of faster download speeds just because the modem's a little chubby, you know?
