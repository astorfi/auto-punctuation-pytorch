In2Games, the outfit that already sought to bring motion sensing to the PS2, has just unveiled the first image of its motion controller for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The Wii Nunchuck-esque Gametrak Freedom is explained as being a "remarkable ultrasonic 3D motion sensing technology which delivers performance, control and flexibility far in excess of that offered by existing technologies." Supposedly, the device tracks the true 3D position and "precise movements of up to four players anywhere within a given environment," though it remains to be seen how much support it'll get from software developers. Initially, the controller will launch alongside undisclosed titles that can utilize the tech, but as for now, all you have to look forward to is Squeeballs. Yes, Squeeballs.
