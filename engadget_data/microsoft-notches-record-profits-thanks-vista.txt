Sure, the newfangled system has suffered (and still is) its share of troubles in the early goings, but with those kind of profits coming in, we're sure all of Redmond will be treated to a 12-pack of their favorite soft drink in celebration. Looking forward, Microsoft also noted that next quarter's performance should be just as impressive, and since it's pulling in all this dough of late, why not extend that $3 software bundle to us low-on-cash Americans, alright?
