       We've seen a number of locales pipe in quite a bit of energy from eco-friendly sources, but the community of Rock Port, Missouri is claiming to be 100-percent wind-powered. The gloating is due to four wind turbines erected on agricultural lands within the Rock Port city limits, and while the town is expected to consume around 13 million kilowatt hours of electricity this year, the aforesaid turbines will produce 16 million kilowatt hours. Excess energy generated will be pridefully sent out for purchase by the Missouri Joint Municipal Utilities, where it will eventually be consumed in less thoughtful areas. Of course, the town has been operating in such a manner for a small tick now, but it just recently found the energy to throw a party for itself to commemorate the accomplishment. Can we get an invite next year or something?[Thanks, Yossi]Read - Rock Port releaseRead - Rock Port video
