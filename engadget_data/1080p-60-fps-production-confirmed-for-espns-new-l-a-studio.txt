Live based studios (home of the new West Coast SportsCenter edition) would be the first capable of "full HD" 1080p production, but with no details we could only speculate on what that meant -- check that week's podcast for our take. We got in contact with Colleen Lynch of ESPN and confirmed the new equipment is designed for 1080p at 60 frames per second, with additional production equipment coming in over the next few months. There's no way to get that bandwidth home yet and won't be for at least several years but it's good to know the network is ready for whatever comes next. Check out the full response and a video clip of the studio -- for those who hit the sack before its 1 a.m. EST timeslot -- after the break.
      

 

 "The entire LAPC has been designed to support a full 1080 60P production workflow. Our existing 1080P infrastructure is complete and ready to accept these signals as soon as more production equipment is available from the vendors. Our present timeline for delivery of 1080P equipment will be over the next few months. At that time we plan on completing 1 production control room, supporting facilities (edit, server playout, converters, etc.) and studio cameras. All remaining signals that are not capable for a 1080P output will be upconverted to integrate into the production."
