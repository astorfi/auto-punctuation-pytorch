 Netflix is quickly establishing a reputation as a technology vanguard beyond just its streaming-first initiative. We only just saw Super HD streaming in January, and it's already discussing the leap to Ultra HD: Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt tells The Verge that Netflix wants 4K streaming inside of "a year or two" for at least some of its catalog. It doesn't take a genius to deduce that the internally-produced House of Cards could play an important role in that upgrade. Hunt confirms that David Fincher shot the political drama in 4K, and it should be encoded for the higher resolution later in the year. While it's doubtful that most of us will have the bandwidth to handle any near-term 4K launches short of moving to Kansas City, it's good to know that the content should be ready well before we are.
