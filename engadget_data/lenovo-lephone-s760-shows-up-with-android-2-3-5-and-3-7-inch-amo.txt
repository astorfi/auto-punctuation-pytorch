Packed within is a 1GHz processor, 512MB RAM, a vibrant AMOLED display, five megapixel camera and Lenovo's usual customised UI. Externally the phone looks very much like the S2, though the former's shiny plastic backside gives out more of a toy-like feel. No prices just yet but expect this to hit the Chinese market at the end of December.
