Ok everyone, you can stop tritely idly asking, "Where's my flying car?" Because NASA's hooking you up with the
Personal Air Vehicle Challenge; intended to further advancements relating to airborne vehicular development, the
competition's grand prize winner will take home $250,000. But don't worry if you don't think you're qualified to gun
for the big money, there are also prizes ranging between $150k and 25gsâ€”still plenty enough to start bankrolling that
tricked Hummer Skycar you've had your eye on.
