 
Well, it looks like the seemingly unending saga of the HTC Thunderbolt launch could really, finally be drawing to a close. Following up a fairly solid hint earlier today, we now have some actual tangible evidence that the 4G-equipped smartphone will indeed be launching on Thursday, March 17th courtesy of some helpful tipsters. Of course, that's still not completely official, but HTC has promised that an announcement is coming "soon," so we should be hearing more from both it and Verizon any day (or moment) now if it the 17th really is the launch date. One more shot after the break.
