 We've theoretically had nearly all of these numbers confirmed piece by piece, but there's something eerily comforting about HTC tossing it all together on a single page for our perusal. As anticipated, the HTC-built T-Mobile G2 will be powered by an 800MHz Qualcomm MSM7230 processor, and it'll boast Android 2.2, 4GB of ROM, 512B of RAM, a 3.7-inch WVGA capacitive touchscreen as well as a five megapixel camera with auto focus and flash. There's also aGPS, WiFi, Bluetooth and a 1300mAh battery, all of which may or may not cause you to drool. Hit the source link if you need to see for yourself.
