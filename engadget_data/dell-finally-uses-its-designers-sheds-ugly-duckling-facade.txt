 In between all the announcements, Dell was kind enough to bring some humor to CES with its irony -- after finally making something that doesn't look like it was designed in Soviet Russia, the company reveals that it's only a concept product. The "ultra-flat" LCD (with a resolution estimated as high as 1920 x 1200-pixels) is encased in glass and features four built-in speakers. Dell manages to keep it svelte by taking a design cue from Microsoft and outsourcing the power supply to your floor rather than keeping it inside the actual device. There is also a microphone / webcam on the top, not unlike the supposed Apple display rumors; overall a very well thought out and nicely designed device -- we're hoping to find it leaked somewhere on Dell's site soon.
