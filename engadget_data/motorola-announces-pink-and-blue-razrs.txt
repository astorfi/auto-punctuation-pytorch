something?). We're kind of wavering on the assertion that it's the "first choice for a select group of fashion elite
and Hollywood 'it' girls," as they so claim (last we heard,
Paris rocked a BlackBerry, Treo, and/or Sidekick
upon various sightings), but it should be available to us lowly proletariats before 2006 rolls around.
