 Not even 24 hours since announcing its new CEO, Yahoo's announced its financial results for the second quarter, with only a few financial figures of note. Revenue was reported at $1.2 billion, barely changing since the same period last year.  Net income totaled $228.5 million, down from $238.5 million from Q2 2011. With its new leader in tow, the company still aims to sell half of its stake in Alibaba, which totals around 20 percent of its shares. Taking a closer look, most of its revenue came from Yahoo's own products; about $535 million came from display ads, while $461 million from search. It reiterated the deal it struck with Facebook when it came to patent issues between the pair and future advertising tie-ups that are still in the pipeline. Hit up the press release for all the details.
