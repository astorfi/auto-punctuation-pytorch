As detailed by Nate of The Digital Reader blog, the procedure for installing a new home screen and additional apps is fairly straight forward, and doesn't involve actually rooting the device (although others are working on doing that as well). Of course, it's not quite a seamless experience as an Android tablet (there's apparently some stability issues), but it doesn't look too shabby for a $179 device. Head on past the break for a video of the hack, and hit up the link below for the necessary details to do it yourself.
