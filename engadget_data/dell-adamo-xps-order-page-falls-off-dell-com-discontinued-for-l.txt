Though it only went on sale back in late November, Dell.com no longer has the crazily designed, $1,799 laptop up for purchase. We're currently trying to get official word from Dell, but all is not lost for those that feel they've made the biggest mistake in the world by not ordering the ULV laptop that only lasts less than two hours on a charge -- it's still available from Best Buy and Amazon.com. Stay tuned for more news as we do a bit of digging on this one.

Update: Dell confirmed that the Adamo XPS will not be making a reapperence on its site. "While the Adamo XPS was certainly and engineering marvel, it also was a limited edition product with a finite number of systems available," said a Dell spokesperson. Adamo XPS 2 anyone?
