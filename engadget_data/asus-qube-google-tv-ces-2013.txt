ASUS' first Google TV device is coming and will arrive with 50GB of WebStorage cloud space and access to over 100,000 movies and TV shows through Netflix and Amazon Instant Video. It'll arrive with its own "Qube interface," unsurprisingly featuring a three-dimensional tetrahedron that rotates for access to your content. There's also motion-sensing remote control support for gaming and other apps, while anyone with an Android phone will be able to download ASUS' Mobile Remote app and steer from there. No word yet on pricing or a launch date -- ASUS won't be hosting a press event this week, but we'll be pounding the CES floors for more details.
