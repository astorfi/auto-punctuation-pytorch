BT Openzone
Fon
M3 Connect
Row 44
Skyrove
Spectrum Interactive
Tomizone
Vex

Fon will probably be the most familiar if you're in America, but combined the program covers 500,000 hotspots, including 500 hotels. Users will be able to pay for WiFi by the minute using Skype Credit, with prices ranging from a nickel to $.19 per currently. No word on whether that will be changing with this new announcement.
