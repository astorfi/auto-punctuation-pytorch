Given the service's wide reach we figure you're probably a subscriber or at least gave it a shot whether by word of mouth or through one of those annoying pop under ads (why do they still run those?) and have seen some room for improvement. We've put a few of our ideas as options in the poll below, let us know what you'd like to see most in the comments below.
