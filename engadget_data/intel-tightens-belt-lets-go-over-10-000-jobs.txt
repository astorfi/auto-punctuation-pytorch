So yes, those rumors are in fact true. We're not sure how this will affect their bottom line and future product offerings (or if that's even an appropriate thing to discuss after the loss of so many jobs), but it's a hard fact about the industry; sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, well, he eats you.
