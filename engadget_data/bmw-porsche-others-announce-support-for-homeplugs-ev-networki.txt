At Computex today, the company announced that Audi, BMW, Daimler, Porsche and Volkswagen have all agreed to support its HomePlug Green PHY (GP) technology as their EV charging interface of choice. The networking specification would allow electric car owners to link their plug-ins to the Smart Grid via the same ports used to charge their batteries, opening up new, Powerline-based possibilities. Once your EV hooks up to the network, it may be able to conduct system checks in real-time, for instance, or provide instant feedback on performance or the condition of your battery. The low power GP spec will also be interoperable with HomePlug's forthcoming AV2 spec, though it's still not clear when we can expect to see Germany's automakers incorporate it into production. Zip past the break for the full PR.

After intense case studies and tests, the five German car manufacturers - working together as the Coordination Office Charging Interface - chose to support HomePlug's IEEE 1901 Profile Green PHY (GP) as the technology for the charging interface of electric vehicles. Additionally, HomePlug has invited the participation of these auto manufacturers in developing the HomePlug Green PHY certification program. The HomePlug Powerline Alliance serves as a compliance and certification body for IEEE 1901 and manages the largest compliance and interoperability certification program for powerline networking products. 		"For electric vehicles to be widely accepted, they must integrate into existing and emerging charging infrastructures, connected to the smart grid," noted Dr. Heiko Doerr, Manager of Coordination Office Charging Interface. "For charging electric vehicles, the communication interface is established via the charging connector, and the HomePlug Green PHY provides a common communications standard to support all modes of AC and DC charging." 		The HomePlug GP specification, finalized in June 2010, is a low power, highly reliable and cost-optimized powerline networking specification which targets "Smart Grid" applications such as appliances, smart meters, climate control, and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles. Utility companies and manufacturers are looking to adopt communications and networking technologies, such as HomePlug GP, to help consumers and businesses monitor and reduce their energy consumption. More details about HomePlug GP can be found at http://www.homeplug.org/tech/homeplug_gp.		HomePlug GP is a key component of the HomePlug technology portfolio, along with HomePlug AV broadband powerline technology and the upcoming HomePlug AV2 specification. HomePlug AV is the baseline technology for the IEEE 1901 powerline standard. All three specifications are fully interoperable with each other and with IEEE's 1901 powerline standard, and they are designed to make it easier for multiple chip suppliers and manufacturers to deliver products to support IP networking. 		"The endorsement and support of these world class manufacturers is a significant step in establishing robust technology standards to deliver on the smart grid promise," commented Rob Ranck, president of the HomePlug Powerline Alliance. "We are delighted with their decision and look forward to working with them to develop the product certification process." 		The announcement comes on the heels of recent research reports from In-Stat, Infonetics and Pike Research pointing to the continued leadership of the HomePlug technology standard around the world. Pike Research analyst Bob Gohn commented, "The adoption of standards is a key driver to widespread smart appliance adoption, and our research indicates that HomePlug Green PHY is likely to be the power line standard that gives manufacturers the confidence to rollout products in increasingly greater numbers."
