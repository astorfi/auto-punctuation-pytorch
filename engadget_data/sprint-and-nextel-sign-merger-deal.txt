There's still a lot of things that could snooker this deal (like, uh, Verizon), but this morning Sprint and Nextel
publicly announced the details of their "merger of equals" and that each company's board of directors had approved the
deal. Shareholders from each company will own about 50% of the new mega-carrier, which as we well know, is going to be
called "Sprint Nextel", at least until they pay some naming consultants millions of dollars to come up with a crappy
new name.
