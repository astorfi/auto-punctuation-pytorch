Just months after AMD hacked its workforce by 10% and let its CTO walk away without being replaced, the company's second CEO after Jerry Sanders has spent his last day in AMD's biggest corner office. Hector Ruiz has decided to walk away from his role in the flagging outfit, leaving his right hand man (that would be Dirk Meyer) to take over whatever there is to take over. Of note, Mr. Ruiz will still have ties with the company as he remains on its board of directors as "executive chairman," though it's hard to say how much influence he'll have from there. Really though, what's next?[Thanks, nehemoth]
