Despite a March 22nd press release (embedded after the break for convenience) from Research in Motion suggesting that VZW would indeed be a "retail channel" for the QNX-based slate, the carrier's Brenda Raney is singing a different tune. According to her: 

"We're still evaluating the BlackBerry Playbook and have not made a determination as to whether we're going to distribute it." 
'Course, we wouldn't cry too hard if Big Red ends up passing -- Sprint's 4G version ought to satisfy anyone pining to pick one up with an integrated cell radio. Too bad Mike Lazaridis isn't around to opine on just how "unfair" such a statement is.
