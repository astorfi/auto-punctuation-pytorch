The craft blasted off from Cape Canaveral atop a Falcon 9 rocket earlier today, entered a "100 percent successful" low-earth orbit, and returned to Earth to make an on-target soft landing in the Pacific Ocean just a short while ago. Head on past the break for the launch video, and look for NASA to hold a complete post-flight press conference at 3:30pm EST at the link below (and on NASA TV).
