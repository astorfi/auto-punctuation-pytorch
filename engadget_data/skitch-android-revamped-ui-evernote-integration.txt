 Users haven't exactly been content with Evernote since it took over the Skitch reigns, but that's not stopping the Smart Notebook creator from pushing out constant updates to its Android offering. To go along with the handy tweaks from earlier this month, Evernote's now updated Skitch with a completely redesigned user interface, the addition of a couple of fresh tools (Pixelate and Highlighter), as well as, naturally, a much-improved integration with its own cloud-based service -- not to mention the ability to sync with Evernote, though said application would have to also be installed on your device. This new version of Skitch is available to download now via Google Play, and be sure to share your first impressions with us in the comments below.
