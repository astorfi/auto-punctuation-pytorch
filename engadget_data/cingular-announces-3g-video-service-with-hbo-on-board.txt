All the
cool kids are
doing it, and now Cingular is finally joining the mobile
video party with their new Cingular Video service. So if you've been looking for a better excuse to go for a $59.99
unlimited data plan on their new BroadbandConnect 3G
network, take solace in the fact that not only will you be scoring some mobile video, but you'll be helping Cingular
pay off all those hefty 3G rollout bills. You also might of heard of the mobile content partner that they announced
with the service: a little outfit called HBO. Get ready for some good times plopped in front of your new 2-inch
entertainment center starting next month when it gets officially rolled out.
