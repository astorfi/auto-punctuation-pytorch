Yeah, Acer, you know everyone's been champing at the bit to get yet another revision to your long (so, so long) and
illustrious Ferrari-themed laptop line. The goods on the
Acer 4000 include a supposed "inside and out" complete upgrade to the 3xxx series — we've got 0.4 more inches on the
TFT display, for instance — now up to 15.4-inches, woo! AMD is under the hood (pun finally appropriate) on this with
their Turion 64 Mobile chip, graphics brought to us by ATI mobility Radeon X700 with 128MB DDR memory, plus 1GB RAM,
100GB hard drive, DVD "super multi double layer drive" (marketing hyperbole included free of charge), 5-in-1 card
reader, WiFi, Bluetooth, 4 USB 2.0 ports, S-video and DVI-D out, FireWire, and S/PDIF out. No word on price, but expect
it to carry a similar level of sticker shock as its automotive namesake. Bonus pic after the jump of racer clearly
enthralled by this laptop (caption contest?).



 We?ll start it off: ?Mmmmm? laptop.?
