       The rumors have been flying this week that Apple is working on with Motorola on a cellphone, and yeah, there sort of are always rumors about stuff like this, but this week the volume has definitely increased significantly. We were pretty skeptical about this, so we started asking around about this, trying to figure out if this was anything more than the usual gossip, and we just got word from a highly reliable source that-jibing with the rumors from earlier this week-Apple has indeed been showing off a prototype for an iPhone (or whatever you want to call it), and that Motorola is one of the potential manufacturing partners. Doesn't mean that anything will ever come of this-even if they've built a prototype they could easily decide that getting into the cellphone business isn't worth the trouble.
