What are the clouds of Mars made of? That's the question that'll be answered when NASA's MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) probe reaches our neighbor. Before that can happen, however, it needs to leave home on its long journey, which is scheduled to commence around 1:30pm ET today. The stream kicks off from 11:00, showing the preparations live from Cape Canaveral, so if you're interested in watching what goes down, or, more appropriately, what goes up, head past the break and grab some popcorn.
