Polaroid's second chance has a price, and it's $299. At that amount though, it's hard to tell how much the novelty of instant-printing is worth in comparison to less kitschy and more capable options. What's more, Socialmatic is confirmed to ship with Android. Just imagine what a sepia-tinged faded print will look like six months on.
