Press renders? Pah. Now we've seen snaps of the forthcoming blue HTC One in some of its metallic glory. The shell, which was reportedly snapped by a worker who works for a factory contracted to make parts for HTC's smartphones, seems to confirm that the company is cooking up an azure edition of its flagship handset. While we're not sure if this will single-handedly restore HTC's fortunes, at least there's a built-in market for fans of Eiffel 65, ELO and the bad guys from Firefly.


Update: Yet another HTC One in blue has been spotted out in the wild and the folks over at Mobile01 have got the pictures. We've tucked one after the break for you to take a look at, too.
