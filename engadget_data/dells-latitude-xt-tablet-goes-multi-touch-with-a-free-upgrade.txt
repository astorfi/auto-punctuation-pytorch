 
As promised, Dell is offering a free software upgrade for its Latitude XT tablet, unleashing the multi-touch capabilities of its capacitive touch screen at last. The free download allows you to do two finger scrolling, zooming and use programmable double tap functions directly on the screen. Dell's also adding a new 128GB SSD option for $649 to its Precision and Latitude systems, with the XPS and Alienware laptops to follow next week. The Latitude XT software and new SSD drives will be available tomorrow, and Dell promises a brand new Latitude laptop line "in the coming weeks," which we're sure will be taking advantage of Intel's new Centrino 2 chips. Video of multi-touch in action is after the break.
