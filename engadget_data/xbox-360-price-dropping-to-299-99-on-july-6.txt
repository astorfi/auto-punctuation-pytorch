The little image circulating shows the "Xbox 360 20GB console" with a $299.99 price, but no word on pricing on the Arcade and Elite versions of the console. We had a feeling price cuts would be coming at E3, but it's entirely possible Microsoft waned to get pricing out of the way before the gaming conference to concentrate on other goodness.
