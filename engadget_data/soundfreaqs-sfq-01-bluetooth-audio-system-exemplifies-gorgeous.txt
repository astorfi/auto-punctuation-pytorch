The newly introduced SFQ-01 Bluetooth audio system is easily one of the most stunning we've seen, and since it accepts BT commands, it'll play nice with just about any mobile phone and / or PMP in the modern era. As for aural qualifications, you're looking at Kevlar-reinforced balanced drivers (2.75-inch), an acoustically tuned dual-port chamber and a UQ3 spatial enhancement processor, all of which presumably combine to deliver pure nirvana straight to your ear canal. Doubly so if listening to Cobain. You'll also find an inbuilt FM radio tuner as well as a 3.5 millimeter auxiliary input, but you won't spot the unit itself anywhere other than Target; it'll ship there later this month for $199.
