 
The other night I connectedmy MacBook Pro to my HDTV and decided to watch a DVD. I went in to explore the preferences and I noticed somethingthat I don't ever remember seeing before: HD settings. I went back to my older Mac and sure enough, the setting,weren't there. We haven't been given reason to believe that the new Mac's are HDCP ready or if they will supportBlu-Ray anytime soon, but it appears that the software is ready when they are.Is this thefirst computer software to show any signs of Blu-Ray support, other than a press release?Â
