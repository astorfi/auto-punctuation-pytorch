We did hear from Samsung that the company might change the back, but what we said about hardware and experience before remains true here. The Media Hub, which is new, is sleek and convenient, and the Iron Man preview we watched looked great on the screen. If you're in need of more Tab pictures, we got you covered just below.

Update: We've got video, just after the break!
