Q: How do you close applications when multitasking? 
A: (Scott Forstall) You don't have to. The user just uses things and doesn't ever have to worry about it. 
A: (Steve Jobs) It's like we said on the iPad, if you see a stylus, they blew it. In multitasking, if you see a task manager... they blew it. Users shouldn't ever have to think about it.
Yeah, that pretty much sums up the Apple Way, but hey -- tell us how you really feel, Steve.
