The next time you're searching for that perfect recipe to please your finicky friends' ever-evolving dietary needs (you know, the vegan today/paleo tomorrow types), you won't have to go further than Pinterest. The service is folding in a new search feature that can filter pins down to recipes-only, based on ingredients or even dietary choices. So, say you need to find a gluten-free way to make chocolate chip cookies; you'll be able to do exactly that and even save that recipe -- complete with cooking time, ingredients and servings size data -- to your own dedicated board. There's even an included Indulge Me filter option for those of you that just don't care how much lard you consume in one sitting. Recipe search is only rolling out to the desktop version for now, but it should be making an appearance on mobile sometime soon.
