The iPodlounge takes a gander at the new AirPort Express which
finally started shipping this week (to recap, it's
Apple's new WiFi adapter that lets you wirelessly stream your iTunes collection to other parts of your house). Worked
fine for them when they tested it out with a Mac, but they encountered heaps of trouble when they tried setting it up
on a PC, but eventually they did get it to work.
