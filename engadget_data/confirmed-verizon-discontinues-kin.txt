It's probably pretty difficult to justify continuing to offer and support a product when its maker has already thrown in the towel -- never mind the fact that Big Red's heart never seemed to be in it from the start -- so this is more of a formality than anything else. We're being told that existing owners won't be impacted, meaning Microsoft will continue to operate the back-end services needed to keep retail Kins alive -- but considering how few Kins seem to have been sold, we can't imagine that's a money-making proposition for anyone involved, so who knows how long that'll go on?
