 Liked what you saw? Even happier then, as a Brit, that you'll likely be getting your hands on it months before your US cousins? UK networks have started to announce availability for the handset, with EE, O2, Three and Vodafone already confirmed to be stocking the Z10. Retailers that will also be selling the new BB10 hardware in the British Isles include Carphone Warehouse and Phones 4U.

 Retailer Phones 4U will launch both color options (exclusively, at least initially), free on contracts starting from £36 per month although it hasn't ventured a contract-free price just yet. However, it is offering a free 64GB PlayBook to the first 250 orders. The Carphone Warehouse, meanwhile will be offering the Z10 free on contracts of £36 per month on the major networks.

 Vodafone will offer the Z10 for £29 on the £42 a month Red Data plan, including unlimited calls and texts as well as 2GB of internet. It'll be free on the £47-a-month variant plan, or cost a £69 one-off payment on the £37-per-month plan. Three UK hasn't revealed any details beyond that it'll be stocking the handset, while O2 has it free on £36 per month contracts, or on pay-as-you-go for £480 if you're feeling flush.

 While all Z10 devices sold will be ready for 4G, according the Waterloo crew, the BlackBerry Z10 will be available to utilize EE's existing 4G service immediately. The price? It'll be £50 on a £41 per-month 24 month package, with 1GB of mobile data, as well as unlimited UK calls and texts. No word just yet on whether Orange and T-Mobile will be offering cheaper bundles later. We'll update here when we hear more pricing details from the other players.
