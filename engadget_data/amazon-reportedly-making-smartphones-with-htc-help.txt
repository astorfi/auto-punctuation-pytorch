Amazon may not be developing its first smartphones by its lonesome. The Financial Times claims that the online retail pioneer is teaming up with HTC on three handsets, one of which is at an "advanced stage of development." It's not clear if or when these devices would ship, according to tipsters. None of the involved companies are commenting on the rumored smartphones, but they would continue a familiar strategy for HTC. The company has a history of partnering with web giants like Facebook and Google as they experiment with official devices; when Amazon is already comfortable with offering its own hardware, it's a natural fit for an HTC deal.
