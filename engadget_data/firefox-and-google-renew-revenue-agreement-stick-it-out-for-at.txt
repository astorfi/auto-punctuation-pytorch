 There was a moment there, where things were starting to look a bit shaky for Mozilla. With the Firefox creators facing increasing competition from Google, in the form of Chrome, rumor had it that the organization's revenue sharing deal with the search giant had expired and may not be renewed. Well, those rumblings can finally be cast aside as Mozilla announced today that it had signed an agreement with the Mountain View crew that is "significant and mutually beneficial." The three-year revenue sharing deal should help keep Mozilla a float just long enough to permanently put IE under water -- at least we assume that's what the two are hoping for.
