Koreans have one-upped them by unraveling the great mysteries of your dog's emotions — and sending them to you in SMS

happy, sad, cheerful, needy, threatened and assertive. We're pretty sure they were using a prototype of this system
back when they were filming Lassie, which finally answers your deep-seated childhood question: "How did Timmy
know?"
