Yep, the 32-inch VP322 and 42-inch VP422 -- which were announced at CES at $689 and $999, respectively -- are now available in Wal-Mart locations across America, and they're selling for even less than that. Right now, those longing to hop in the HDTV game without breaking the bank can secure the VP322 for just $599, while the VP422 will set you back just $799. Both sets possess a 30,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio, 720p panel, 3 HDMI sockets (along with component / VGA) and a built-in ATSC digital tuner with ClearQAM support. Not too shabby for the price, wouldn't you agree? [Warning: PDF read link]
