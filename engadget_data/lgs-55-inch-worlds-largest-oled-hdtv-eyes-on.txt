   LG's press conference at CES this morning was a surprisingly light-hearted and breezy affair, clocking it at around 45 minutes and bringing with it more than its share of bad jokes. There was, however, one dramatic moment -- you could actually hear the audience audibly gasp when the company unveiled its 55-inch OLED HDTV.  When the curtain came off, it revealed a thing of beauty, clear from even a ways back in the room. The model is still in the fairly early stages, but the whole "ultra definition" thing that the company promised is quite clear, even more so when you step closer to the thing -- looking into it really feels like looking out a window. This thing is crazy sharp. Even more impressive is the size of the thing -- it's 55-inches, and only a mere 5mm thin -- so thin it was tough to properly photograph, and the bezel was fairly hard to spot as well. The company has promised to show of the display in the days to come at CES -- pricing and availability, not so much.
