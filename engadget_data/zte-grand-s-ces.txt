 Earlier today a kind anonymous tipster shared the above product shot of a ZTE Z753, which is allegedly the Chinese manufacturer's contribution to the ever-growing list of five-inch 1080p devices -- including those from HTC, Sharp, Oppo and eventually Nubia, Huawei, Lenovo plus Sony. Conveniently, ZTE's also been teasing its upcoming Grand S flagship on Sina Weibo ahead of its CES debut, and we've been able to confirm that this is indeed the aforementioned Z753 -- not that we don't already know the Grand S' main selling points thanks to a brief description on CES' website: "the world's thinnest for 5 inch FHD smartphones." There isn't much information about the guts at this point, but we do know that the phone will feature a unibody design, along with a slight bump around the off-center camera on the back. Until we make it to CES next month, you can see more in the official sketches after the break, courtesy of ZTE's Sina Weibo account.
