 That DOCSIS 3.0 technology isn't going to waste, as Numericable is apparently going to be one of the first providers to broadcast 1080p content. The 11.25Mbps MPEG-4 streams will include videos from CinéPlay, TF1 Vision and I-Concerts, so you can check out Amy Winehouse's tattoos, pockmarks and teeth in glorious full HD, before quickly switching to National Treasure for some eyebleach. Those with the Cablebox HD can get the titles for €4.99/€3.99/€2.99 depending on the type. All we can say for U.S. operators is where's ours?
