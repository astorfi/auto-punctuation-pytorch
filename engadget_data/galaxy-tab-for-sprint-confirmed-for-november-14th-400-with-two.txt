After hearing this morning that Samsung's Galaxy Tab might possibly be hitting Sprint on November 14th, the carrier has come out and confirmed the date, along with some pricing details. Whereas the Verizon deal is a penny under $600 with no commitment required, Sprint's offering the 7-inch slate for $399.99 along with a necessary two-year 3G Tablet Mobile Broadband plan (according to Phone Scoop who contacted the company, there'll also be a $599.99 offer with no contract). That'll run you $29.99 for 2GB and $59.99 for 5GB. Can't wait to see what price the GSMers might offer? Pre-orders start today.
