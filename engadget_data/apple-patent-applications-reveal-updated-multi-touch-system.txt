Among other things, that'll apparently allow for simultaneous tracking of "multiple   finger and palm contacts" which, according to the patent, should allow for "unprecedented   integration of typing, resting, pointing, scrolling, 3D manipulation, and   handwriting." That last bit is apparently accomplished using a "pen grip detector," which can apparently detect if you're mimicking the position of holding a pen and adjust accordingly.
