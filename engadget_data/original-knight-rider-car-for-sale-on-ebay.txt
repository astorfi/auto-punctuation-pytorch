Giving you something even radder to roll up in style to that electroclash concert (we heard somewhere that the
Eighties have come back â€” crazy!) with than that Back to
the Future DeLorean replica, someone is auctioning off on eBay one of the actual freaking K.I.T.T. cars used
in the Knight Rider TV show (which were actually converted Pontiac Trans Ams). The car's even been fully
restored to its original grandeur.
