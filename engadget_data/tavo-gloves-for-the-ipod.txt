Why is that important? Just try to use that iPodclick-wheel with any other pair of gloves and you'll get the picture (but no sound).The gloves are constructed withthermal fabric and have silicone grips so you don't drop that precious portable audio player. These could also come inhandy if you're a big notebook trackpad user in a very cool climate, but you knew we were going to say that, didn'tyou?
