Apparently they're now selling digital cameras and iPods via the vending machines at San Francisco International
Airport (isn't this more of a Japanese thing?), right alongside typical airport vending machine fare like KitKat Bites
and Jelly Belly jellybeans (which means that all those hours we spent in college trying to figure out to use a coat
hanger to, um, extract a bag of Chex Mix from the vending machine in our dorm will be put to good use on our
trip to SF next month). Best part, at least if you're planning on doing things the legal way, is that you don't
actually need a stack of 200 perfectly crisp dollar bills to buy an iPod mini, the machine does takes credit
cards.
