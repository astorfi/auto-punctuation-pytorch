Starting next year, Verizon customers will have a live video feed
option in addition to the current selection of prerecorded V-CAST content, due to a partnership with QUALCOMM subsidy
MediaFLO. With nationwide licenses for the 700 MHz
spectrum, MediaFLO's video service was built to complement existing cell networks, meaning carriers need only include
proprietary chips in their handsets. The initial MediaFLO rollout will take place in half of the markets where EV-DO is
live, and continue to expand into other areas with BroadbandAccess. So far there is no word on the type or quantity of
programming that will be offered, nor is there any indication of what pricing will look like.
