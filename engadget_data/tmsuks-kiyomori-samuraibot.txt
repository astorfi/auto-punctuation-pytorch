Tmsuk, makers of robots that range from the useful (the
Roborior sercurity bot, the
prime minister-gassing
Artemis) to the goofy (the
Banrya chatting guard dragon, the
servicebot shopping companion, the
RIDC-01 projectorbot), are back on the scene with a bot
that definitely fits into the latter category, the Kiyomori samuraibot. No plans on mass production of this strange
humanoid, which is just as well, as we really prefer not having autonomous sword-wielding robots roam around our pad.
Extra consideration in today's holiday giveaway for those
readers who can pick out the fake samurai in the pic.
