We spotted an in-your-face red N95 at the Nokia booth of Digital Experience this evening, and guess what? It's not custom painted, it's not some sort of funky special edition -- it's real, it's coming, and more importantly, it's coming here. Word on the street we'll see it before the first quarter's out for $599, implying that there's a little price drop for N95s of all colors in the cards for the near future.
