As before, you'll get fanless and near-silent operation, but with a larger casing that allows for more storage and expansion options. That includes two 3.5-inch hard drives for up to 2TB of storage (500MB by default), and six USB 2.0 ports to accommodate some additional devices. You'll also get fairly low power consumption (24 watts), and a pair of PCI slots that you can load up with four-port eSATA cards for even further expansion. Look for this one to start shipping next week, with it running Â£399 (or $830) for the base configuration.
