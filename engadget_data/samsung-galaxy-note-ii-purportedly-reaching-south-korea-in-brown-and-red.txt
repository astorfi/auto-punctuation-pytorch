 Yes, the black Galaxy Note II may have been more wishful thinking than reality, but that doesn't mean Samsung is sticking to a narrow palette for its extra-large flagship. A supposed magazine page in South Korea shows both a brown Note II (already available in Japan) and a previously unseen red model headed to the country at an unspecified point in the future. The claim sounds promising for those who've wanted more options than gray and white. All the same, we'll remain skeptical unless the new colors are made official -- Samsung hasn't commented on the authenticity of the page, and the original Korean forum post has disappeared without a trace. We can't help but hope it's real, though, if just for the chance of another smartphone designed for vampires.
