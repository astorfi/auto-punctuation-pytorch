Dentsu London has paired accelerometer-based software with long exposure/stop-motion photographs to take 3D renderings into real space, with a result that reminds us of the Graffiti Research Lab. Sure, you could do this on an iPod touch, but it's that real-world iPad bigness that makes it awesome -- one of those moments that makes you sit back and say dang, future, you're here! We can't wait for this to make its way into the App Store -- and our nieces' Facebook albums -- ASAP. Crazy light painting video after the jump.
