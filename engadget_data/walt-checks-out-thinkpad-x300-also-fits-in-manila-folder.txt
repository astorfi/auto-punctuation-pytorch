The image we're certain your eyes are fixated on above is indeed the first look at Lenovo's forthcoming X300 ultraportable, and it's being provided courtesy of Walt Mossberg. 'Course, if we were betting souls, we'd guess that nifty office envelope won't be bundled in, but hey, crazier things have happened. As if a photo wasn't enough, Walt also clued us in on a few more specs, namely the inclusion of a removable battery, three USB ports, WiFi, an integrated Ethernet jack and optional GPS / WWAN to boot. Heck, users will even be able to order this 3.12-pound critter with Windows XP if they so choose. You getting all this, Apple?
