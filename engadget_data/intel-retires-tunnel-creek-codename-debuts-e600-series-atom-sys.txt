As expected, this is an Atom-based system on a chip designed for embedded devices, offering up to 2GB of DDR2 RAM, integrated USB and gigabit Ethernet support, plus an Ion-enabling PCIe bus. The processor itself is a 45nm chip available in speeds ranging from .6 to 1.6GHz, too slow to really rock anyone's proverbial socks, but these could make for a some mean little MIDs or perhaps a hot infotainment system for your next-gen Camry.
