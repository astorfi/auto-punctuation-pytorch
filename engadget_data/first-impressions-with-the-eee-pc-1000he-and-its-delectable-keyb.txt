With the new model about to ship, Laptop Magazine has been able to stack one up against an older 1000 model and play a little game of "One of These Things" to spot the differences between the two. There weren't many, just that chiclet-style keyboard, which was rated as "just better," and the new 1.66GHz Atom N280 CPU, replacing the elder's 1.6GHz N270. Unfortunately the slight bump in clock and bus speed (from 133MHz to 167MHz) didn't make any noticeable change in performance, but if this thing can deliver on its promise of 9+ hours on a charge we don't think anybody will mind.
