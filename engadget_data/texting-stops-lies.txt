The University of Michigan and The New School for Social Research has found that if you want someone to tell you the truth, you should text them.

The team believes it's due to the lack of time pressure and not having to produce a pleasing answer for your interrogator. If the findings continue to provide similar results, it looks like Steve Wilkos could be replaced with a smartphone.
