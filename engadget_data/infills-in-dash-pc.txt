You're not gonna break RSA crypto on its 1.0 or 1.6GHz Eden CPU, but Infill's beast of an in-dash computer, the T3,

RaySat), GPS, voice control, USB, remote, and even an
empty mPCI slot. Apparently you can even install Windows Media Center on the thing, but we're still a little hesitant
about tempting fate.
