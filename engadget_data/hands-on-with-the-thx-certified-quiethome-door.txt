We're not even close to kidding folks -- the Quiet Solutions (formerly known as Serious Materials, evidently) reps were totally gung ho about this $1,495 to $2,495 door, and we just couldn't walk by without giving you a look at what a THX-certified door, um, looks like. Notice the gorgeous brass handles, sturdy (and we mean sturdy) construction and the word "sucker" lightly printed on the rear. Just kidding, we know there's a time and place for this and all, but we couldn't help but chuckle. Oh, and don't run into this thing while perusing the gallery below --face-first into a 220-pound object is no fun.
