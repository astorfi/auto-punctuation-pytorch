Effective immediately, viewers can surf over and enjoy original, on-demand programming around the clock, and while we're not sure just how much high-definition content is available right now, the site already includes support for full screen HD viewing. Furthermore, the firm also announced that it would be doling out three Advanced Media Players (AMPs) for use by content partners and other audiences that will embed them. Enough chatter -- why not give the site a look and see if there's anything there for you to love?
