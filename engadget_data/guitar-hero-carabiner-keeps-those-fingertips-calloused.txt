Debuting at Toy Fair 2008 in New York, the Guitar Hero Carabiner takes thrashing to an entirely different level, albeit a much tinier one. Yep, this 7.75- x 3-inch device features a minuscule LCD screen, integrated speaker, five gloriously colorful buttons and a loop for clipping onto your knapsack (or similar). Additionally, the neck itself collapses down to make the entire thing just 4- x 3-inches for easy portability, and best of all, it can be yours for the low, low price of $14.99.[Via CNET]
