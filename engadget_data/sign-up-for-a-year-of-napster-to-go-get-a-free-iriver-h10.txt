Napster has a new offer to promote the official launch of
Napster To Go: be one of the first 1,000 people to sign
up for a year of their new all-you-can-download service for $179.00 and they'll toss in
iRiver's new H10 5GB MP3 player for
free. Seeing as how the H10 will
normally set you back about $280, you could just flip the H10 on eBay and still come out a few bucks ahead.

UPDATE: Damn, that was fast. Offer expired.
