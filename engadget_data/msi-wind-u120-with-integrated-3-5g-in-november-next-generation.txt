 We already knew that MSI's Wind U120 was coming this quarter. Now DigiTimes has pegged the launch to November. Available in white or black, DigiTimes' sources claim that the U120 should launch for roughly $552 with a built-in 3.5G data module, Atom N270 proc, 1GB memory, and a 120GB hard disk loaded with Windows XP. For its part, MSI did say that it will not be introducing a netbook with touchscreen due to the high cost (eh hem, hear that ASUS?). MSI does, however, plan to launch its second generation Wind netbook with "new innovations" at the beginning of March at CeBIT 2009. We're hoping for thought-control enabled by a quantum processor but expecting something more akin to a race to the bottom.
