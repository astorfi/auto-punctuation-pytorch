Back in December, we caughtsight of a 650 that could boot Linux, but running actual apps appeared to be a distant dream. Well, it looks like thedream has come true. The pics above are part of a series that purportedly shows a Treo 650 running GPE Linux -- andrunning it well, from the looks of things. Of course, we'd still like to see it running Doom, but we suspect that can'tbe too far off.[Thanks, Sammy]
