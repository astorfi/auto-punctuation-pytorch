Facebook's current News Feed ranking isn't all that clever -- it's good at surfacing popular updates, but it can miss lower-profile updates that are personally relevant. The company may soon raise the News Feed's IQ, however, as it recently launched an artificial intelligence research group. The new team hopes to use deep learning AI, which simulates a neural network, to determine which posts are genuinely important. The technology could also sort a user's photos, and it might even select the best shots. While the AI work has only just begun, the company tells MIT Technology Review that it should release some findings to the public; those breakthroughs in social networking could help society as a whole.
