 The perpetual gotcha for T-Mobile's Monthly4G prepaid service has been the absence of truly unlimited data -- you could have one advantage or the other, but not both. TmoNews understands that this either/or choice is fading away after spotting what looks to be leaked promo material. Come January 9th, the carrier is reportedly replacing its 5GB Monthly4G tier with an unlimited alternative. The same $70 should net the previous unlimited talk and text, but skip the pesky throttling for very frequent users. As long as customers have good coverage, it's hard to see a downside for them if this proves real; next week can't come soon enough.
