According to a new placard hitting certain Orlando-area subscribers, five new HD options will be available on Friday, and they are: Discovery Channel HD, Animal Planet HD, TLC HD, Science Channel HD and National Geographic HD. Granted, there's not much there for the sports / drama fans to get excited about, but the carrier has promised some 50 more high-definition offerings over the next year and change. Bring 'em on, we say.[Thanks, Steven]
