According to Reuters, Judge Koh has rejected the firm's request to allow sales to continue pending a decision, keeping store shelves empty for the time being. The story isn't over, of course -- if Samsung wins the appeal (or the greater dispute) tablets will return to stores in droves. Either way, we all look forward to a time when this whole mess is behind us.
