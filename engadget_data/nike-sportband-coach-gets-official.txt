The band, which opens up features at the NikePlus website along with enabling runners to check out distance, pace, time and calories burned, is indeed marketed as a standalone device for those who'd prefer not to have a DAP flanking their arm when exercising. Moreover, the outfit's online Nike+ Coach system will allow runners to have the information they need to appropriately train for long distance events or achieve customized goals. Get those kicks cleaned up prior to April 10th -- after all, that's the day you'll be sprinting out to pick this thing up, right?
