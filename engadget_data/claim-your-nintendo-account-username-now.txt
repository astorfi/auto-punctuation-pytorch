       Nintendo's new cross-console (and phone) account system is live. You can register with your existing Nintendo Network ID, or with Facebook, Twitter and Google login details. While this is where Nintendo's debut smartphone game, Miitomo, will debut, there's not much else to do until it launches sometime next month. (Well, you can assign your Mii as your profile pic, but that's no great shakes.) The most important part: land grab that username, before it's too late. (Update: and pick up a Platinum coin bonus in the process, by signing for Miitomo updates!) The service is now live, globally.
