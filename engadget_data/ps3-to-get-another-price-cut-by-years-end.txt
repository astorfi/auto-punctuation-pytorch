 It looks like we could soon be in for a good old fashioned price war, with talk of yet another PS3 price cut already spreading just days after the last one became official. What's more, this latest rumor appears to be based on more than just idle speculation, coming instead from Capcom's Capcom Chief Financial Officer Kazuhiko Abe, who told Reuters that the price "is likely to be cut again towards the end of the year," adding that he expects the PS3's installed base to "grow gradually." While there's no indication of just how big a price cut it'd be, any further drop would certainly put a crimp in Microsoft's rumored plans for a significant price cut of its own, though we doubt too many other people will be complaining.
