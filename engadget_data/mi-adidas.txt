Adidas is in the process of revamping mi Adidas, its feature that lets people customize shoes with various elements -- you can mix and match colors and even have your name embroidered on them. To make things better (or worse, depending on who you ask), Adidas will soon also allow you to create sneakers using any image you want as your print -- because why not, right? Unfortunately, you won't be able to do this with all Adidas Originals, as the sporting gear company is limiting the customization feature to the ZX Flux model. Adidas says the ZX Flux is the perfect shoe for this, citing the recent success of the Photo Print Prism model as evidence and as a driving force behind the idea. You can customize your own pair starting in August, which is when the iOS and Android apps are due to launch.



          
 
 
 It's worth noting that the concept of customizing shoes, or other gear, isn't particularly novel for manufacturers; Nike, as an example, has its NikeiD program and, of course, there's the one we've been talking about: mi Adidas. Still, there's something more exciting about the idea of letting buyers upload a picture of their choosing -- we can only imagine what folks will be sporting on their feet soon enough.
