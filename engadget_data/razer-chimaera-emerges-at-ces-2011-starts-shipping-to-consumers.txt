That's according to staff at the company's booth today at CES, who seemed quite pleased that they could change their answer when asked about it from eager (read: impatient) customers. The website still hasn't been updated, but the 5.1 channel surround sound headset ($199.99) should be more widely available to purchase soon. Also, a 2.1 version will be on sale for $129.99, rocking a fairly similar design and charging station. For those needing a refresher, this is a wireless Xbox 360 headset, complete with an equalizer, audio out jacks (on the station) and a flip-down microphone. Have a peek at the gallery below, and feel free to start checking your doorstep at an unhealthy clip.
