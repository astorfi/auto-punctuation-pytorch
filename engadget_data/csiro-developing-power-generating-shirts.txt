 We've seen a plethora of shirts made for more than just satisfying a core necessity in life, but a team of scientists over at the CSIRO's Energy Technology Division are hoping to have "power shirts" at your local flea market (or other fine establishments) within five years. By using piezo electrical materials, the garb could reportedly "produce electricity as you move," enabling users to juice up their DAPs, mobiles and air conditioned pants just by staying active. Other potential applications include powering battlefield-related equipment on soldiers and monitoring systems on the elderly, but making sure it can handle the oh-so-intimidating wash cycle remains a challenge.
