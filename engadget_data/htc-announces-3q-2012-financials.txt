 HTC has released its third quarter financials, with the same trend continuing from the last quarter: lower net revenue. The company said it gained NT$70.2 billion total ($2.4 billion), with pre-tax net income at NT$4 billion ($137 million), a nearly 50 percent drop from the $250 million it earned last quarter. All that is a far cry from its salad days last year, and the company will have to hope that its new Windows Phone 8X launch along with a new flagship One X+ will reverse its fortunes.
