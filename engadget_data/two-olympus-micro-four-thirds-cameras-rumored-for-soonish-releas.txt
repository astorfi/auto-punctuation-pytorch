Given that Olympus pledged its allegiance to Micro Four Thirds early on -- not to mention that we've already seen proof of prototypes -- we're really, really tempted to believe the latest rumors from Russia. As the story goes, Olympus is gearing up to launch a pair of MFT cameras, likely named the M-1 and M-100. Both units are apt to be about the size of a bulky point-and-shoot, with the former boasting a 3.2-inch LCD monitor and HD video capture. Oh, and did we mention that PMA is just over a month away? Sounds like a perfect spot to launch this duo into the mainstream.[Via Engadget Spanish]
