The studios have faced that fact that $1 kiosk rentals are here to stay and figure they might as well get something out of the deal. Unlike the deals with the likes of Blockbuster that share rental revenues with the studios, Redbox seems to be simply agreeing to lesser terms like not selling used DVDs at discounted prices. No word on when or if the rest of the studios will get with the program and accept that rental kiosks are here to stay. But it is obvious that $1 seem to be just the right price for most consumers.
