 It may not come as a shock to most of us, but the Wall Street Journal is reporting that recent MVNO start-ups Mobile ESPN and Amp'd are learning a hard lesson in market over-saturation, falling well short of the high expectations set for them by their parent companies and investors. Despite the hundreds of millions of dollars pumped into both operations -- well over $300 million between them -- neither had managed to muster even 10,000 subscribers through May. While Mobile ESPN is doubling back to retool its game plan (pun intended), Amp'd presses on, claiming they need more time to influence their young target demographic through advertising. Sports scores on hideous phones apparently don't get you as far as they used to, it seems.[Via MocoNews]
