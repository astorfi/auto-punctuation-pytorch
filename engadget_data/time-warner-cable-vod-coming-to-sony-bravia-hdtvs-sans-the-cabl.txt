The details are very lacking at the moment but we can't think of another example of when a cable company has allowed its on demand content to be delivered on a 3rd party device. Of course this doesn't solve all our problems as the TVs don't have built in DVRs so that wonderful Time Warner set-top-box will still be tethered to your stunning HDTV, but it is a step in the right direction. Now we just wait to see how well it actually works when it finally actually gets rolled out.
