As its name suggests, the glove will let you pass messages secretly to another gloved individual with just a quick handshake, although we think they'll have to tone down the Michael Jackson-style design for more covert use. The glove was made as part of a workshop on smart textiles and physical computing but, sadly, plans for a DIY version don't seem to be available. [Via MAKE: Blog]
