After four years away CTU agent Jack Bauer is coming back to TV on May 5th in 24: Live Another Day, and he's already being used as a pawn in a new battle: Amazon vs. Netflix. Until today, US fans of the show could catch up with all 192 episodes (plus 24: Redemption) on Netflix's streaming service, but now Amazon Prime is the exclusive subscription streaming home of 24. Amazon's deal with 20th Century Fox is timed to take advantage of the show's upcoming return, similar to exclusive agreements it's made for other shows like Orphan Black, Suits, Falling Skies, Downton Abbey, Justified, Workaholics, Veronica Mars,Under the Dome, and Extant.


Amazon's "pilot season" to crowdsource opinions on potential shows hasn't produced hits on par with Netflix Originals like House of Cards or Orange is the New Black, but we suppose this is another way of filling the library. For Netflix's part, it sent out a PR blast yesterday focusing on what it's adding to streaming this month, including an exclusive deal for the complete series of House M.D. plus Rocky I - V, Coneheads, Amistad and Braveheart. Of course, today only (check your calendar), there is also a very special Netflix Original for you to check out.
