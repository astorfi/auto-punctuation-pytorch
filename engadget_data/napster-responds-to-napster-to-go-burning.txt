We'll be the first to admit that yesterday's news about a
plug-in for WinAmp that let's you make CDs out of files downloaded from Napster's new all-you-can-download Napster To
Go service was blown way out of proportion. Yeah, the plug-in makes it simple, but at the end of the day there's
nothing special about exporting audio from protected files and capturing it with your sound card, and Napster's
officially responded with a statement emphasizing that no encryption has been broken, nothing has been hacked, and that
Napster is still secure. Alright?
