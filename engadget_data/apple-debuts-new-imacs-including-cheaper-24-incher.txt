At the base level Apple offers a 20-incher with 2.66Ghz Core 2 Duo processor, 2GB of RAM, a 320GB HDD and GeForce 9400M graphics, the rest of the iMacs are 24-inch numbers with 4GB of RAM standard. In the high end Apple has 2.93GHz and 3.06GHz processor for $1,799 and $2,199, respectively, with GeForce GT 120 256MB and GeForce GT 130 512MB graphics. In between there's a 24-incher for $1,199 with 9400M graphics, a 2.66GHz processor and a 640GB HDD. On the outside it's that same iMac candy shell you know and love, though Apple has oddly replaced the standard wired keyboard with a new numeric keypad-free model -- those pesky numbers are available as an option. All models are available now, full configurations are after the break.Update: Early information across the wires listed the new iMacs with Core i7 processors. Sadly, this is not the case, and we've updated the post to reflect the boring reality of the situation.
