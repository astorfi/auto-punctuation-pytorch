If convertible Lenovo PCs like the Yoga 2 Pro are well beyond your price range, we have good news. The company has prematurely uploaded PDF manuals that reveal the IdeaPad A10, a 10.1-inch Android 4.2 laptop with a fold-back display. The device is clearly focused on entry-level users between its quad-core Rockchip processor, 16GB to 32GB of expandable storage and front-facing VGA camera. We don't know the IdeaPad A10's launch details when the company has yet to make an announcement. However, multiple German retail listings suggest that the system could ship within weeks for â‚¬250 ($338) -- well below the cost of the cheapest Yoga models. Check out a second image of the A10 after the break.
