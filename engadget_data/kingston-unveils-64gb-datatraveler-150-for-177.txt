Arriving in 32GB and 64GB flavors, the DT150 becomes the largest in the outfit's entire DataTraveler line, and it even works with Windows, OS X, Palm OS and Linux! Both sticks come with a five-year warranty (as if you won't lose it before then) and will sell for $132 and $177, respectively.[Via Electronista]
