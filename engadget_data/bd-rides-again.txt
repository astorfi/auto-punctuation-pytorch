As you'd expect if you've been following this up until now, it is Fox that is once again doing whatever it can to prevent you from having your way with its content. The latest BD+ application has already successfully locked down 16 new Fox releases (not all in the US) and according to a SlySoft developer, it'll probably be February before the latest version is defeated. Of course by then Fox will probably have a new version and it will all just start over again. Really sheds some light on why SlySoft's new subscription model was a necessity. [Via Slashdot]
