From the five minutes we spent with itwe can tell you, well, it’s an XP Tablet PC with a 7-inch display. Sorry, that’s about it, nothingearth-shattering here folks. In fact, for all the hype, it’s hard to find anything revolutionary or evenevolutionary in the hardware specs or loaded software (perhaps that will come when the price is announced). Sure,Samsung did call it a prototype unit, but as the final prototype prior to manufacture we're told not much will changebesides a "brighter TFT LCD."Now, beyond what we saw earlier today,Samsung will release their UMPC / Origami device with optional GPSand DMB (and presumably DVB too, eventually) mobile digital TV expansion modules, as well as WiBRO support for when thatgoes live in Korea around June. The version we grabbed, the Q1, also supports Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP and sports a 30GBhard disk. Unfortunately the whole thing just felt wrong in the hands – very plasticy and without substance. Takea look for yourselves after the break, we've got tons more shots.
