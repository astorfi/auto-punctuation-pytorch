The gentle giant from Game of Thrones can express seemingly anything using only his name, and now you can be just as concise with the Hodor Keyboard. The Android keyboard replacement swaps the usual line-up of cumbersome characters out for a simple Hodor button, all for a mere $0.99 (or Â£0.59) -- practically a gift from the gods. In other GoT-related news, the show's officially overtaken The Sopranos as HBO's most successful, with an average of 18.4 million viewers this season. And, they're just the ones that watch it legally.
