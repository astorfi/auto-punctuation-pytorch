Much to our surprise, we were able to hack our

Kryptonite Evolution 2000 U- Lock with a ballpoint pen. This $50 lock is supposed to be one of the best for
"toughest bicycle security in moderate to high crime areas"â€”unless the thief happens to have a Bic pen. We
used to use these to lock up our bicycles, but we're switching to something else ASAP. (Oh, and just to be
trite, the pen is mightier than the lock.)
