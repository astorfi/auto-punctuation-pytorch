Samsung has come under fire this week for allegedly inflating the benchmark scores for the Galaxy Note 3 among other Android devices, but -- shocker -- the company is not alone in enhancing scores. AnandTech just published a report that shows ASUS, HTC and other companies using the same "benchmark detect" function to artificially bump up the numbers. According to the site, virtually all OEMs run a CPU optimization on at least one of their devices, save for Apple, Google's Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 and Motorola's latest crop of phones. Dishonesty aside, though, what's the big to-do about these inflated scores? AnandTech found that companies notched less than a 10-percent performance boost in AnTuTu and Vellamo. And when's the last time you based your smartphone purchase on benchmark scores alone, anyway?
