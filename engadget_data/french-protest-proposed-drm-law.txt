So, it should come as no surprise that hundreds of activists took to the streets this weekend to protest the country's proposed DRM law. The new law would levy fines for file sharing, and make it easier for companies to impose DRM on copyrighted files. The latest draft of the law also favors large corporations and drops key provisions from an earlier version that could have required companies like Apple Computer to open up their DRM to competitors. The French Senate is debating the draft law this week.
