Remember that crappy, top-down Halo game that came out a few years ago, Spartan Assault? Well, it got a sequel that's available on Steam, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, and as weird as it sounds, even iOS. Anyhow, Halo: Spartan Strike will run you $5.99 or, if you're using one of Apple's mobile gizmos or a PC, you can grab the first game and the new one in a bundle for $9.99. Spartan Strike's story is a simulation (much like the last one was) set during the events of Halo 2 -- but there's a twist. Remember the cool new enemies from Halo 4, the Prometheans? They're in this game too, which raises more than a few questions regarding its fiction and timeline.



And in case you haven't given up hope on The Master Chief Collection, playing the game on Windows 8 devices can unlock an exclusive emblem, nameplate and avatar for last year's notoriously broken game too. Hopefully Strike's delayed appearance -- it was supposed to launch last December -- helps it sidestep MCC's legacy.
