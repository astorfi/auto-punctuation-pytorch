Few party-goers look forward to the math involved with paying for a shared cab ride home. Now that Uber supports fare splitting, they won't have to: the company's updated Android and iOS apps let passengers divide the cost equally. While friends must be Uber members to chip in, they only have to give their permission if someone has already hailed a car. The new apps won't necessarily get cheapskate friends to pay up, but they could avoid a few headaches at the end of a long night.
