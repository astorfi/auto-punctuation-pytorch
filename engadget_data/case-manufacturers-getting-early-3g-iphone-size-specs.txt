There's not much to go on, but we're curious as to what that additional front-mounted sensor is, and we know a few people that would kill for a red iPhone. iLounge says that developers and case manufacturers believe the specs to be correct and have already started work on accessories, but only Steve (and a couple hundred Apple employees) know for sure -- the rest of us will just have to wait.
