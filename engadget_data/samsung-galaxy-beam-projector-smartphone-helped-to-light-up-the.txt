But, seriously folks, living in a cave for a couple of months is no fun, and thankfully those guys had a crew of support people sending down all sorts of toys. One of those toys, we're now learning, was a Samsung Galaxy Beam Android projector phone, loaded with a "message of encouragement" from Chile's Mining Minister along with a recording of an exhibition soccer match between Chile and Ukraine (which we were previously told was beamed down via fiber optics ). We have to admit feeling the smallest pang of jealousy, as down there is one of the few places where a six lumen pico projector is more than bright enough.
