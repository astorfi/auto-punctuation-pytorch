 A fortnight after rumors surfaced hinting that Ericsson was lobbying to buy Microsoft's Mediaroom IPTV unit, both companies have announced that a deal has been signed. Microsoft VP Yusuf Medhi blogged that as the Xbox has become the heart of Redmond's home entertainment strategy, Mediaroom has become a resource-hogging distraction. The Mountain View-based IPTV outfit powers AT&T's U-Verse as well as similar VOD services from companies like Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica, and will be folded into Ericsson's Business Support Solutions outfit. The deal's expected to close in the second half of the year, with neither company talking about how much the sale cost.
