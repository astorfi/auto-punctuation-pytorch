   Friendly reminder here, folks. As expected, AT&T has opened the pre-order floodgates for the Nokia Lumia 900 today ahead of its April 8th release in the US. Interested parties can secure their reservation for the Window Phone 7.5-loaded device at AT&T's retail or online stores. While you'll be able to snag one in either matter black or cyan blue, we'd be remiss not to point out that the white version (slated for an April 22nd release) isn't yet on offer. If you'll recall, parting with $100 and agreeing to a two-year contract is all it'll cost ya' to get in on the action. Be sure to let us know if you plan on reaching for the "light" in the comments.  Update: Wowza, if $100 wasn't already easy on the wallet, Walmart is offering the device up for only $50 with a two-year agreement -- online only, though. You'll find more info at the source link below.  Update 2: Ready for more good news? According to AT&T's website, Lumia 900 pre-orders are currently slated to "arrive on or before April 6th" -- a full two days before its official launch.  Update 3: This bad boy's free after a $100 online rebate for new AT&T customers. That's a serious play for signups.  [Thanks to everyone who sent this in.]
