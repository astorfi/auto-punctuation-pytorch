Either Samsung weren't very good at sweeping their dirt under the rug or they didn't want to get in any further
trouble once the looking glass focused in on 'em, but apparently Samsung's fessing up to a worldwide practice of price
fixing DRAM memory between April of 1999 to June 2002. And they'll be paying out the nose for what's supposed to be the
second-largest criminal antitrust fine in US history, too â€” something to the sum of, oh, say, three hundred mil? Being
DRAM it doesn't seem to directly relate to the
South Korean FTC's investigation of Samsung's
pricing practices for NAND flash memory, but
Assistant US Attorney Niall Lynch did cite Apple, Compaq, Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM as beneficiaries of
the Samsung's, um, generosity.
