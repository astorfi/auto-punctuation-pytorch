And that process may well havereached its apotheosis with the bot recently unveiled by Klaus-Peter Zauner of the University of Southampton, which iscontrolled by a bright yellow slime mold. The single-celled organism naturally moves away from light and toward moistplaces, and was able to control a six-legged robot when light was focused on a sensor. Since the slime mold is able togrow to several feet in size, we assume Zauner is working on applications that go far beyond the lab, which willinevitably result in a light-controlled slime-bot army slowly slithering its way to world domination.
