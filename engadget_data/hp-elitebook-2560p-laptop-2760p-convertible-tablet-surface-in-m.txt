Perhaps most notably, we now for sure that the latter is indeed a convertible tablet as we had suspected, including a swiveling 12.1-inch matte display, along with your choice of Sandy Bridge Core i5 or i7 processors, up to a 320GB hard drive or 160GB SSD, a maximum 16GB of RAM, and the usual integrated Intel HD3000 graphics (no other option, unfortunately). The EliteBook 2560p, on the other hand, packs an ever so slightly larger 12.5-inch display, and some mostly similar specs across the board -- the biggest exception being up to a 750GB hard drive thanks to its 2.5-inch storage bay (versus 1.8-inch on the 2760p. Still no prices for either of them, although we've got to assume that HP will be making these completely official fairly soon.
