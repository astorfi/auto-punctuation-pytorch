If you've been wondering how long it was going to take Nintendo to cash in and introduce some new colors for the
Nintendo DS (at least here in
the States, that is â€” they already graced Japanese gamers with
two new DS colors last month, with two more due out on
Thursday), well, we have an answer for you: it's going to be two more months. The news just crossed the wires that
they'll be releasing an "Electric Blue" version of the DS sometime in June.
