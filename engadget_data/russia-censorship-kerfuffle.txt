As the Moscow Times reports, Maxim Ksensov was given a 24-hour time out after posting an ethnic slur for Ukranians on his personal page. The paper believes that the word has now been blacklisted by the service and will be instantly deleted if it's found. In response, Putin aide Igor Shchegolev has instructed locals to abandon Facebook in favor of Vkontakte, its homegrown alternative.

Oh, and if that wasn't bad enough, the founder of Vkontakte himself fled Russia after pressure to hand over data on the website's users. So, all in all, it's probably fair to say that if you can't take it, folks, you shouldn't be dishing it out.
