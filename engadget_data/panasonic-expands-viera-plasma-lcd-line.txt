All displays support 1080p and HDMI, and run in size from 32 inches for the LCD to a top plasma model at 58inches. Panasonic claims that new technology has improved brightness of the plasma models by 20%, and that the 4000:1real contrast ratio is comparable to a 10,000:1 visible ratio. Most models will be available in Japan next month, withthe 58-incher available in May. Pricing is set at ¥300,000 (about $2,500) on the low end, up to ¥780,000 (about$6,600) for the top model. The full model list includes the 32-inch TH-32LX600 LCD, 37-inch TH-37PX600 plasma, 42-inchTH-42PX600 plasma, 50-inch TH-50PX600 plasma, and 58-inch TH-58PX600 plasma.
