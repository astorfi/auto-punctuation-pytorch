Weighing in at 4.1 pounds, the 12.1-inch U205 (which is pretty similar to the U200) comes in either S5002 (Core Duo T2300E, 100GB hard drive) or S5022 (T2400, 120GB HDD) configurations, with both versions sporting 1GB of 533MHz DDR2 RAM, WXGA TruBrite TFTs, integrated graphics, dual-layer DVD burners, and Toshiba's LifeSmart Technology -- which includes a fingerprint reader, shock-absorbing components, and spill-resistant keyboard. Meanwhile, the 5.95-pound R25-S3503 also sports a Core Duo processor -- though only the 1.66GHz T2050 -- along with a 14.1-inch WXGA+ display, 100GB hard drive, and the same burner, graphics, memory configuration and LifeSmart swag as the U205. Both models are available immediately, with the S5022 and the tablet each going for $1,349, and the S5002 priced at $1,199.Read- U205Read- R25
