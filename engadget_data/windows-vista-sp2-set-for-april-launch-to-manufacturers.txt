 In case you missed it, last week TechARP said that Vista SP2 is scheduled for an April 2009 release to manufacturing -- that means not you... not yet anyway. We're guessing that it will hit a month later for general release if the Vista SP1 rollout was any indication. So who's TechARP? Oh just the same group of Malaysian kids that like to boast about how they broke the Vista SP1 and XP SP3 release schedules to the world. That makes their "confidential source" worth listening to. The source adds that Microsoft will deliver a SP2 release candidate as early as February so we'll know soon enough how accurate this rumor is. [Via PC Advisor]
