  NVIDIA's feud with Intel may be at an all-time high these days, but it looks like the company isn't about to go as far as to produce its own Intel-compatible x86 chip, despite persistent rumors to the contrary. That word comes straight from NVIDIA's always talkative CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, who flatly said "no" when asked if there was any truth to the rumors. He further went on to add NVIDIA's focus is on visual and parallel computing, and on "getting our GPUs into the lowest power platforms we can imagine and driving mobile computing with it" -- as it's now attempting to do with Tegra. In a separate discussion after a talk in Dubai, Huang also interestingly revealed that the computers in his household are "all Apple," but he naturally didn't just leave it there -- head on past the break for the complete, must-read quote (as reported by Shufflegazine).
      

 

Apple uses the best technology for their [computers]. Apple says to their customers: if you buy a computer from us you can be sure we have selected the best technology inside for you. That is their promise to consumers. Their promise to consumers isn't we've selected the best technology for you with the exception of what Intel allows us to use. That's not their promise. And that's why Apple uses the best technology where they want whenever they want. And that's why I'm all Apple! At home it's just Macs everywhere. It's NVIDIA's technology in all of them but I use Macs. My son has two Macs, my daughter has a Mac, there's an extra Mac just in case and my wife has a Mac. It's just Mac, Mac, Mac! Because I know it's got the best stuff inside.
