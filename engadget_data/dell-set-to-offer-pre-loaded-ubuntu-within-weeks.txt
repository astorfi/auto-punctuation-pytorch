 Given Michael Dell's admitted fondness for Ubuntu (Feisty Fawn, specifically) and Dell's previous announcement that it was heeding the call of geeks everywhere to offer Linux pre-loaded on its consumer systems, it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that Ubuntu would be the company's distro of choice, but it's still nice to hear the word coming straight from the source. The company's also getting a bit more specific on when we'll finally start to see Ubuntu-based systems rolling out the door, saying that it'll  begin to offer Ubuntu 7.04 as an option on "select Dell consumer models" (both desktops and laptops) in the coming weeks. Now, if only they'd be as receptive to public feedback on their choices of hardware.[Via CRN]
