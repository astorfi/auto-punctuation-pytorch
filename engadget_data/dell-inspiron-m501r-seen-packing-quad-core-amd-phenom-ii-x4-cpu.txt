Abrams?), but now things are starting to come together somewhat. We're guessing some of the mystique surrounding the M501R has to do with the power plant within, because so far as we can tell, AMD has never shipped a Phenom II X4 within a laptop. Sure enough, this here machine can be ordered up with a quad-core X4, and while prices and the like aren't yet available (the order process seems to be borked for now), we do know that this particular model will ship with a 720p 15.6-inch display, Windows 7, an optional 1GB ATI Mobility Radeon HD 550v (another new one to us), WiFi, up to 8GB of DDR3 RAM, four color options and a total weight of 5.83 pounds. C'mon Dell / AMD -- why not just spill the beans already? Our trigger finger can only itch for so long.
