We had a run in with Sony's new LF-PK1
LocationFree TV device, the one that allows
you to place-shift your media via their LocationFree TV software, or, optionally, their LocationFree TV displays (like
the new 12-inch LF-X11). Unfortunately the LF-X11 is as expensive as ever at $1,500, but at least they've added MPEG-4
support (among other things), and boosted the in-home signal range to about 100 feet. The base unit's a much more
affordable $350, but when you can just as easily rock a much more flexible solution like Orb, real free seems a bit
more compelling than LocationFree.
