 The CES game of HDTV one-upsmanship is officially on, as Matsushita (Panasonic) is apparently planning to bring a 150-inch plasma to that epic Las Vegas tradeshow in January. According to The Yomiuri Shimbun's sources, the prototype PDP is expected to launch in 2009 with a price that "greatly exceeds" the largest model currently available, measuring a mere 103-inches. Anyone want to guess when we'll hear about a 151-inch screen from Sharp or Samsung?
