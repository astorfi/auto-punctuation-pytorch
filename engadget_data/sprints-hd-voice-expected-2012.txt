We may not have to wait much longer, though, because according to Phone Scoop, Sprint is aiming to roll out the service by the end of 2012. The carrier's Network Vision architecture upgrade is progressing nicely, a necessity for implementing clearer conversations, although coverage is still patchy. We might see an official launch this year, but HD Voice is unlikely to be widely available on the network or on other devices until well into 2013 and 2014. However, if you happen to be a Sprint customer, HTC EVO 4G LTE owner, connected to the right tower and calling someone that's ticking exactly the same boxes, listen out for that bump in quality as the New Year approaches.
