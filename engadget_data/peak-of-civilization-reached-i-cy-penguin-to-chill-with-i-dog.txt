A species of the I-Dog / I-Cat / I-Dog Pup / I-Fish family, the I-CY Penguin gets down with your music, and can communicate its moods through arbitrary musical riffs, flashing lights, movements and squawks. We know you want one, don't even try and deny it, and at $19.99 when this thing launches in March '07, you shouldn't have much trouble appeasing your I-CY lust.[Via Chip Chick]
