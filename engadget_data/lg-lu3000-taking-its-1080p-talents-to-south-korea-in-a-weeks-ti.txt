It boasts a 1GHz TI OMAP3630 chip, allowing it to jot down 1080p video playback on its spec sheet, which in turn goes very nicely with the built-in HDMI port and DLNA wireless capabilities. A 3.8-inch screen offers an 800 x 480 resolution, there's a 5 megapixel camera around the back, and a mildly skinned Android 2.2 performs the OS duties. Curiously enough, the LU3000's home screen looks identical to the one on the leaked LG Star, suggesting that the stuff they're running will represent LG's default Android treatment for the near future. 800,000KRW ($705) buys you the 3000 when it ships in its native land a week from now, though there are apparently no plans to spread the wealth to other nations. Why so selfish, LG?
