We get our fix via the official Handmark Scrabble game for
   our PDAs, but the hardcore Scrabble players (you know who you are) will mos def want to hook up a dedicated
   Scrabble e-dictionary. This $50 Franklin model validates some 100,000 Scrabble words and even provides brief
   definitions. So next time you pull out ZAX, QAT, or QUA for the elusive triple-word score, just hand your opponent
   this dictionary and call 'em out on their biz.
