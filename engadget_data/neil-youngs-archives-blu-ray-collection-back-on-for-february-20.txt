The on-again / off-again nature of this release is becoming somewhat of a joke, but after hearing that the Blu-ray version of Archives Volume 1 (1963 - 1972) would likely be axed, HighDefDigest has it that the BD audio collection is back on track. Reportedly, it now touts a tentative street date of February 24 through Warner Music Group. If the set ever launches, it will undoubtedly be a beast: ten discs, over 128 tracks and the full-length documentary "Journey Through the Past." You could always spin the delay into a positive -- you know, considering that you'll probably need everyday between now and then to scrounge up the $431.99 (MSRP) it'll take to make it yours.[Image courtesy of SMH]
