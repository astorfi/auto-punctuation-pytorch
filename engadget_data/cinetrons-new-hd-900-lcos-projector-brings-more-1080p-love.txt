The LCoS projector pumps out 1000 lumens and a 6000:1 contrast ration with its trio of 1080p chips. Sadly, there's no HDMI to be had here, but other connection options, including DVI, are well represented. Under the hood the HD-900 is running a Realta HQV processor, for 10-bit processing of SD and HD signals. The best news, however, is the $6,000 pricetag, which ain't bad at all for what you get. We should be seeing this one in the US this October.[Via AboutProjectors]
