 ioSafe makes hard-drives so sturdy that it can reduce fire, electricity and Terrence O'Brien to tears at the mere thought of them. Now, it's producing a new disaster-proof NAS, but as a small business, needs a cash injection from consumers to make it happen. As such, it's taking to Indiegogo to raise funds for the ioSafe N2, a private cloud Synology-powered NAS that'll keep up to 8TB of data protected from the elements. On the outside, a steel body that'll take a building collapsing onto it protects a chemically bound fireproof insulation and water / heat barrier will stop your discs flooding or melting, depending on the catastrophe. The company's planning to have the units shipping by January next year, when the 23lb box will set you back $600 without discs -- and if you're hard enough, you can find PR after the break.

   AUBURN, Calif., September 18, 2012 -- ioSafe® aims to tackle data vulnerability and security in the private cloud market with the ioSafe N2, a disaster proof network attached storage (NAS) appliance powered by Synology® DiskStation Manager (DSM) aimed at the SOHO, SMB and Remote Office Branch Office (ROBO) markets.

    The ioSafe N2 will provide end users with a disaster plan straight out of the box while enabling them to maintain complete ownership of their data and total control over how it is secured, accessed and backed up. The N2 is designed to provide all the benefits of the private cloud with fast local transfer speeds and none of the security risks and privacy issues associated the public cloud.

    The high performance 2-bay N2 will provide up to 8TB of storage capacity and be equipped with a 2GHz Marvel CPU and 512MB memory. The N2 will use redundant hard drives as well as ioSafe's patented DataCast, HydroSafe and FloSafe technologies to protect data from loss in fire up to 1550°F and submersion in fresh or salt water up to a 10 foot depth for 3 days.  "We're excited about the partnership with ioSafe. The collaboration will set new standards for reliability in NAS servers. Protected by ioSafe's technology, the award-winning Synology DiskStation Manager builds secure private clouds for users, allowing them to share and synchronize data around the world" says Vic Hsu, CEO of Synology Inc.

    "The 2-bay personal storage NAS market has experienced significant growth from 2009 to 2011, with shipment CAGR just over 128%, almost 8x that of the total Personal & Entry Level Storage Market" says Liz Conner, Senior Research Analyst of IDC. "To take advantage of the growing NAS market, ioSafe has introduced the N2, which offers security and disaster recovery to vulnerable private clouds without the WAN bandwidth limitations or costs associated with the public cloud. The N2 expands ioSafe's portfolio, giving ioSafe a solid foothold into the personal storage NAS market."

    "As a privately held small business, Indiegogo allows us to jump past typical startup funding models and rapidly accelerate this ambitious product to market," says Robb Moore, ioSafe CEO. "The N2 is a game-changer for anyone who demands absolute control, security and speed to manage terabytes of critical business data or precious digital pictures and videos. At the end of the day, you are the only one that truly hurts if your data is lost or compromised – nobody else cares as much about your data as you."

    The ioSafe N2 will begin shipping during January 2013 and will be available in capacities up to 8TB. Introductory pricing for the ioSafe N2 diskless version will start at $599.99. Like ioSafe's other products, the N2 will be backed the ioSafe Data Recovery Service and No Hassle Warranty.
