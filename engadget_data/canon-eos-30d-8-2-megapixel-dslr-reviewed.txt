DPreview comes to these conclusions prior to bestowing their"Highly Recommended" rating on the 30D -- which obviously fared well in their rigorous testing -- finding itto be a strong competitor in its category for both image quality and value. Most welcomed by the reviewers was theaddition of spot metering, variable continuous shooting rates, and the jump to a 2.5-inch LCD, although problems thatplagued the 20D such as AI Servo banding with certain lenses and poor incandescent lighting results were not improvedto their satisfaction. Still, besides these relatively isolated issues, most of the gripes with this model are minorquibbles, and it seems safe to say that anyone in the market for a mid-range DSLR would be more than satisfied withCanon's offering.
