But we haven't yet seen a Blu-ray demo running off a PC, and wedidn't expect Sony's Blu-rayVaios for a little a little while longer yet, though they've been showing 'em off to the otaku at TokyoAnime Fair this year. Good for them -- too bad we're getting a little restless about seeing this stuff demoed already.Care to start getting these things on the market? HD DVD content is sputtering rightnow, remember?
