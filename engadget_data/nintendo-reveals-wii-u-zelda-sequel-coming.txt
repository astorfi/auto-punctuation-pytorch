 
During Nintendo's E3 press conference, Eiji Aonuma revealed a new entry in the fan-favorite Legend of Zelda series.

Scant information was offered, but we were shown an attractive vignette, featuring Link riding his trusty steed Epona away from what appears to be a particularly angry, laser-equipped Octorok. Aonuma claims the game will be far less linear than past Zelda entries, a change he says "will create new opportunites for gameplay not seen in earlier Zelda games."

No solid release date was offered for this as-yet-unnamed Wii U Zelda sequel, but it should arrive at some point during 2015 in both North America and Europe.
