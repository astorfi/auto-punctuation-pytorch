Good news: Google has added a number of parks to Street View, including New York City's High Line, elevated train tracks that have been converted into a 1.5 mile plant-filled walkway. Also on the list are the statue-filled Kensington Gardens in London and Tokyo's cherry blossom-lined Koganei Park. The parks and their blurry-faced visitors can be easily accessed in the source link below. There's also a video of the High Line project after the break.
