 Thanking Steve Jobs for his Thoughts on Music isn't exactly how we'd expected a letter to start by Fred Amoroso, CEO of Macrovision, the original DRM company whose fair use crippling technology dates back all the way to 1984 (no joke). The latest in a litany of responses to Jobs's recent open letter, with pleasantries dispensed Amoroso cuts to the chase in a pro-DRM rant at times rank enough to turn a few Engadget editors' stomachs, with crowd pleasing points such as DRM is an "enabler" (certainly not for customer satisfaction), that it "increases not decreases consumer value" (huh?), and that by having no DRM on our digital media, we "will unnecessarily doom all consumers to a 'one size fits all' situation". (Are you laughing yet?) Despite a very pointed and well written argument in favor of "transparent, interoperable and reasonable DRM", Amoroso's restrictions-laden vision cites no facts or figures to support his conclusions -- not even shaky and questionable numbers like Steve cited in his Thoughts. Luckily for Jobs, Amoroso is even magnanimous enough to take the burden of FairPlay off his hands: "We offer to assist Apple in the issues and problems with DRM that you state in your letter. Should you desire [Steve], we would also assume responsibility for FairPlay as a part of our evolving DRM offering and enable it to interoperate across other DRMs, thus increasing consumer choice and driving commonality across devices." Sorry, we were too busy laughing at your pomposity, what was that you said, Fred?
