While we've got very little to go on here, the doc does list a few specs such as 320 x 240 screen, QWERTY keyboard (no word if this is virtual or real), GSM / GPRS / WCDMA, and OMA or Direct Push messaging support. This is the first we have heard of the P700i but we hope to get more soon; feel free to drop us a line if you have more -- and yes, blurry pics are acceptable.[Via Just Another Mobile Phone Blog]
