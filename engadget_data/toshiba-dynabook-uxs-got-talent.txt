While ditching the wooly-eyebrowed chub infecting most 1.6GHz N280 netbooks, the UX remains saddled with 945GSE graphics (not GN40), a 10.1-inch, LED backlit 1024 x 600 pixel resolution and 160GB disk. A bit steep considering CULV thin-and-lights are about to flood the market. Get up tight with the Tosh chicklets after the break.
