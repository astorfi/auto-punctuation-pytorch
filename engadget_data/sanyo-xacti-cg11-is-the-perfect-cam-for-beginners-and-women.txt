The CG11 is a case in point, coming with a 10 megapixel CMOS sensor capable of 720p recording, integrated EyeFi and mini-HDMI connectivity options, and the usual gunslinger aesthetic. Storage of the H.264-encoded MPEG-4 output is handled by SDHC media, and there's also 5x optical zoom, anti-shake and a stereo mic for getting things just right. Folks in Japan, whether they be beginners, pros, women or men (no matter what the mangled machine translation tells us), will be able to buy one from September 11 for Â¥30,000 ($318).
