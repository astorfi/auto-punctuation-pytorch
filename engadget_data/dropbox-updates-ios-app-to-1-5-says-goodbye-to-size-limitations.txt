The latest update brings the app in line with its Android cousin, adding automatic uploads for photos and video over WiFi and cellular connections, the ability to upload files of any size and a new Gallery view. Cloud storage aficionados who take advantage of the new automatic upload feature will score up to 3GB of additional storage space, doled out in 500MB increments as needed. Sound good? Of course it does, check it out for yourself at the iTunes link below.
