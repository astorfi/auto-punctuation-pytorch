That certainly lends weight to a launch happening sooner rather than later, counter to rumors earlier in the month that we might not see them on shelves until the peak of Summer. Of course, we don't know how long the training sessions are going to run -- our leak here gives no indication of that, nor of a retail release date -- but considering that we first saw this form factor back in January of '09, it's seriously in everyone's best interest to fast-track these. Our fingers are crossed.
