Enter a surprise early challenger from Hisense: its upcoming XT880 line's 50-, 58- and 65-inch sizes deliver that 3,840 x 2,160 picture at dimensions built for mere mortal living rooms. We're also promised a full-fledged, 3D-capable smart TV based around Android 4.0 with WiFi internet access, a remote with voice commands and a removable camera for gesture control or Skype chats. Hisense yet hasn't committed to launch details for the XT880 line besides a presence on the CES show floor; however, it's safe to say that the smaller sizes will bring the price of Ultra HD down from the stratosphere.
