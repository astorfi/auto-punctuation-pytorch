Interestingly enough, it seems that Sony has indeed launched the device and didn't even bother to tell anyone, but that doesn't mean you can't be brought up to speed. Be warned, however, that Living Room PC does not equate to high-end AV center, as this modestly-spec'd machine lacks an HD optical drive and CableCARD option. Internally, you'll find a 1.83GHz Intel Core 2 Duo chip, 2GB of DDR2 RAM, a 300GB 7,200RPM SATA hard drive, dual-layer DVD writer, ATSC / NTSC TV tuner, GMA 950 integrated graphics set, and HDMI / DVI / VGA outputs. Moreover, Sony included a 4-pin FireWire connector, audio in / out, four USB 2.0 ports, Memory Stick / SD slots, 802.11b/g, and Vista Home Premium to run the show. So if you're still intrigued by this ho hum (albeit Viiv-certified!) PC, you can snag it right now starting at $1,599.99.[Via CNET]
