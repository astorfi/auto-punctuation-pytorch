 It
is official now. Toshiba is for sure going to delay the launch of HD
DVD to early 2006, sometime around February or March. This is only for
the US market though, as they stated that the Japan market would be
able to gaze into glorious HD DVD by years end. This still leaves a few
questions though.    * Are the retail demos going to be delayed?    * Is Toshiba updating the US model for 30GB HD DVDs?These questions will soon work their way out. Speaking of the retail demos, has anyone that works in retail received any information about them?
