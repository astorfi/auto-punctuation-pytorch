Thankfully that doesn't seem to be the case, with the company indicating the dual-screen uberbook will be shipping toward the end of next month; February 22 to be precise. That's the good news. The bad? A price of $399, putting it nearly $150 higher than its closest competition at this point, the Nook, and while our brief hands-on time with the device left us with a much better impression than Barnes & Noble's device did when we got to play with it, we're not sure just how many people are going to be willing to pay that much of a premium for it. What say you?
