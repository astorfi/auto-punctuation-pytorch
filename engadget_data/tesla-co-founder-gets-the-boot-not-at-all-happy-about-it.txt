 Former Tesla CEO and co-founder Martin Eberhard got a vague demotion to "President of Technology" in August, so perhaps we should've seen it coming, but it looks like he's now been phased out entirely -- which doesn't really point to happy fun times in Tesla land. We're not sure if it has something to do with production delays, personality differences, or maybe that scruffy beard he's been working on, but whatever the reason, Eberhard (or at least his message boarding impostor) isn't too pleased: "I am not at all happy with the way I was treated, and I do not think this was the very best way to handle a transition -- not the best for Tesla Motors, not the best for Tesla's customers (to whom I still feel a strong sense of responsibility), and not for Tesla's investors." He did mention that he'll be available to the new CEO, Ze'ev Drori "should he wish to avail himself of my experience," but he won't be taking on advisory board responsibilities as the company's official statement suggests.[Via All Things Digital]
