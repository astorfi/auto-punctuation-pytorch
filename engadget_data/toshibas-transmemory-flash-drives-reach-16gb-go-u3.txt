 We're not so massively fond of the whole U3 machine-independent application and computing package thing, but if there's one thing we can get behind, it's a big ol' damned flash memory drive. Toshiba's new TransMemory line, which they're launching in November in sizes from 512MB to 4GB, are all well and good, but only the 16GB Limited Edition due in December would have gotten get us through the year (what with the occasional Vista build and Leopard beta and all). Of course, as with the other 8GB+ flash memory drives, we leave it to Toshiba to ensure we aren't extorted for five or more figures in order to get our unworthy hands on one.[Via FarEastGizmos]
