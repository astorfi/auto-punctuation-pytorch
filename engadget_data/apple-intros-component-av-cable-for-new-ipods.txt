 Sure, you could always wait around for Meridian's wicked cool iRIS dock to output videos on your iPod in 1080p, but for those not looking to spend upwards of $370, Apple's got a new peripheral just for you. The Component AV Cables -- which are said to only play nice with the 3G nano, iPod classic, and iPod touch -- enables you to pipe those movie clips onto a television set via component outs. Additionally, the accessory touts stereo audio inputs, a USB adapter for charging your iPod while it's playing, and even an AC adapter in case your laptop (or any powered USB port) isn't nearby. Reportedly, the 3G nano and iPod classic can output imagery at 480p or 576p resolutions, while the iPod touch supports 480i / 576i. Shipping in two to three weeks for $49.[Thanks, Mauricio T. and Nick D.]
