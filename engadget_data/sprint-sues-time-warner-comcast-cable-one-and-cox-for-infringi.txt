 Sprint's lawyers have been hanging out with nothing to do for a few days, so it's time for them to get back to work. The Now Network is now focusing its sights on Time Warner, Comcast, Cable One and Cox, slapping each one with a separate lawsuit claiming they have been infringing on up to twelve of their patents. The technology the companies have been using, Sprint states, relates to the transmission of voice data packets and was patented in the 1990s. Interestingly enough, several of these patents were the subject of its 2007 infringement case against Vonage, in which the VoIP company was ordered to fork over $80 million. In the filings, Sprint mentioned that the four entities "have realized the great value in this technology and have misappropriated it without Sprint's permission." Our world may be frightening and confusing, but it sure can be lucrative at times. And let's face it -- Sprint has quite a few bills to pay over the next couple years.
