The so-called W760r appears to live up to the V365's faux rugged tradition, but adds a couple key goodies: WCDMA of some sort (HSDPA, we'd hope) and a 2 megapixel cam, up from the W365's milquetoast VGA sensor. What hasn't changed is the presence of a prominent aerial antenna, a feature all but the most diehard signal addicts could probably do without. No word on a release, but considering the famous example of the still-unreleased SMT5700 that hit the FCC, like, eons ago, there's really no telling when we'll see it.[Via Phone Scoop]
