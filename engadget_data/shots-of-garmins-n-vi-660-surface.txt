Unfortunately for us, it looks remarkably like like the Nüvi 300 and 360, but that doesn't mean we're not gonna write about it. As you may know, according to best buy this device should have a 4.3-inch 480 x 272 display, 700MB of internal storage, SD slot (duh), and all the rest of the GPS power that makes a Garmin a Garmin. Sorry though, still no price or release.[Thanks, the Aviator]
