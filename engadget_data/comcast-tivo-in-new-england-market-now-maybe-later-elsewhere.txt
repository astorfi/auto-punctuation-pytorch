 
Speaking at an investor's conference, TiVo CEO Tom Rogers stated that the service is available to New England area Comcast customers. Unfortunately, he gave no timeline when or where it would spread from there. Apparently, the system is undergoing some "fine tuning" of its initial deployment. Some good news for Comcast customers eagerly awaiting the service is that the delay isn't due to unhappiness between Comcast and TiVo; the Comcast CFO said "We think the product is very good." Hang in there, guys, you just might get this service in your area yet.
