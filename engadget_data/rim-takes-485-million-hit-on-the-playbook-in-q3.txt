   Just how much is the PlayBook costing RIM? The BlackBerry-maker revealed that it will be taking a $485 million hit in the third fiscal quarter, thanks to the QNX-packing tablet. The charge reflects flagging sales on the PlayBook, which moved some 500,000 units in its first quarter, followed by 250,000 and 150,000 in the following two. In spite of such numbers, the Canadian smartphone manufacturer remains committed to the tablet, which has seen some healthy price drops in recent weeks, in hopes of staying competitive amongst new crop of budget tablets.
