An upcoming ultraportable from HP has apparently made its way into the hands of an Australian blogger, courtesy of the company's wing in that country. The 13.3-inch Folio crams in a 1.4GHz Core i3 or 1.6GHz Core i5 processor, 128GB of solid-state storage and 4GB of RAM (expandable to 8GB), according to the site. HP's also tossing in a backlit keyboard and some ruggedized construction. Those in-the-wild shots also show a 1366 x 768 display, USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports, HDMI and Gigabit Ethernet. All in all, this thing is looking mighty solid -- after all, the ASUS Zenbook UX31 and Lenovo IdeaPad U300s don't have backlit keyboards, nor that robust a selection of ports. Look for it before the end of the year -- in Australia, at least. More information and some glamor shots in the source below.
