Available in either a floral-inspired or airplane-dominated theme, the predominantly Pearl White machine touts rather exceptionally modest specs (shocked?) including a 15.4-inch WXGA display, 1.86GHz Intel Celeron processor, 1GB of DDR2 RAM, an 80GB hard drive, 3-in-1 multicard reader, gigabit Ethernet / WiFi and Windows Vista Home. You'll also find a FireWire socket, four USB 2.0 ports, a PC Card slot and around one measly hour of battery life from the standard cell. Totally not worth the Â¥147,000 ($1,409) asking price, but then again, cuteness demands a serious, serious premium these days.[Via Slippery Brick, thanks David]
