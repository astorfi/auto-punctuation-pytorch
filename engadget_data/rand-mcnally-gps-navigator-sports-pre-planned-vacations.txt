 Sure, your navigation unit might sport a 7-inch LCD, support Bluetooth calling, or track your roaming pet around the neighborhood, but can it make vacation planning decisions for you? Rand McNally's latest GPS handheld boasts "door-to-door" routing in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but the 26 preloaded "best of the road" trip itineraries steal the show. These top-notch American road trips were selected by the company's own award-winning editorial staff, and include tourist-friendly attractions, eateries, and fuel stations to stop at along the way. Aside from prepackaged journeys, the nav sports a 3.5-inch QVGA color touchscreen, 20-channel SiRF Star III receiver, MP3 player, obligatory robotic voice prompts, multistop route planning / mileage calculator, and a (self-explanatory) "Go Home" button. If you've got a full tank of gas and nowhere to be -- or you'd rather not spend half your vacation figuring out where to go -- the $499.99 GPS Navigator can queue up your next fun-filled excursion with the simple press of a button.[Via GPSLodge]
