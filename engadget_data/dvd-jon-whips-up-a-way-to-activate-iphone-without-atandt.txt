That's right, Jon, knock that toxic AT&T-tied iPod-coffee out of Steve's hand.  Ok, so apparently the phone still doesn't work (we wonder if there isn't some kind of mechanism that binds the iPhone to select AT&T SIMs), so it's not like it's an unlocked device, but at least you can now use it as "the best iPod [Apple's] ever made." We've yet to confirm the method though -- anyone want to give it a shot? Let us know in comments.  [Thanks, Justin and Gordon]
