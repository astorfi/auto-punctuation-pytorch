What's more, according to MSNBC, the vehicles still had 30 percent of their fuel remaining, giving them a total potential range of 480 miles. That's apparently more than double the range of Toyota's earlier fuel cell vehicles, a feat due in no small part to this model's ability to hold twice as much hydrogen as its predecessor (it's also 25% more efficient). While there's no word as to when any of this might actually make it into a commercially available vehicle, Toyota is apparently (slowly) headed in that direction, with it now working to boost the range even further, improve durability and, most importantly, get the cost down.[Via Straightline, photo courtesy of Robert Gilhooly / EPA]
