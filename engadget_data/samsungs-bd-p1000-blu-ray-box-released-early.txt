Dude cruised over to Best Buy and was able to pick up one of two Samsung BD-P1000s just sitting on the shelf. Nope, it's not the first time -- nor will it be the last -- that a retail release date was "inadvertently" broken by a store, but it's not really gonna do dude a whole lot of good since the movies aren't out yet. Seriously though, do Blu-ray and HD DVD really have to go tit-for-tat on everything -- including unintentional early release? Get a room, you two.[Thanks, shinz]
