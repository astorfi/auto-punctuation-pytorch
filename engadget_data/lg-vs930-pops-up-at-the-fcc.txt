If the FCC is anything to go by, the Optimus LTE II could be next to get the Big Red treatment: a filing has just emerged for the VS930, a likely successor to the VS910 (Revolution) and VS920 (Spectrum). While it's been showing up only in bits and pieces through certifications and tests, the more complete picture we're getting now shows a world-ready roaming device. It has the requisite CDMA and Verizon-specific LTE frequencies, but also GSM and HSPA as bonuses -- on AT&T-friendly bands, no less. LG is understandably shy about showing photos or other clues, but anything resembling the Optimus LTE II would flaunt a 4.7-inch 720p screen, a dual-core 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 and that all-important 2GB of RAM. To us, the real question is one of timing. Verizon has been making a habit of offering one 4G-equipped LG flagship every year, but early 2013 would be a long time to wait for what's more of an iteration than a... wait for it... revolution.
