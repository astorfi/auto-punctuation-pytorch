Of course, you'll have to meet a few requirements first, including having an "extra" NUS card and, naturally, a Spotify account. Once you've got those credentials in place, Spotify's Premium service will only set you back Â£4.99 per month, which gets you an all-you-can-stream buffet on both desktop and mobile -- yes, that includes the shiny new iPad app. The deal's said to be good for 12 months from the moment you sign up, and you can get started now at the NUS link below.
