The SSG-R2200 models appear to be very similar to the company's other active shutter 3D glasses in various shapes and sizes, but they're made to order from an optometrist. We know this is something several companies have been working on and expect to see these available in the US eventually as well, but we'll have to see a pricetag of some type before we decide if rocking the dual specs or just sticking with 2D is the best option.
