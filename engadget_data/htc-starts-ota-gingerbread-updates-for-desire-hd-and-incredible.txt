We've seen the notice of the new firmware update on the company's European support site, though our UK-based Incredible S has yet to be pinged with a refreshing dose of Gingerbread. Shouldn't be long now, though! That just leaves the Desire Z and original Desire, both of which should be joining the party by the end of June.
