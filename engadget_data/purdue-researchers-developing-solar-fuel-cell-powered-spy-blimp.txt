Researchers at Purdue University are working on a solar and fuel-cell powered blimp that could stay in a
geostationary orbit at 65,000 feet, and remain in position for up to a year. The project, funded by the U.S. Air Force,
is intended to create a network of airships that could be used for surveillance, missile defense, and other expensive
and dubious military applications. The technology is similar to that being developed for the
"Stratellite," a civilian
airship project that is being built to provide WiFi, cellphone service and HDTV services.
