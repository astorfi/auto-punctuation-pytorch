 Cupertino's newest hardware may have us purring, but Apple hasn't left those of us with existing hardware out in the cold. iOS 6 should be appearing as an available update right now, or at least very shortly -- depending on how taxed those servers get. It'll be compatible with every iPhone since the 3GS, iPod touch 4G / 5G and this-and-last-year's vintage of the iPad. Given the inexorable march of technology, some of the newer features won't work on the older devices, but you can use our compatibility checker to determine what new things you'll be able to do in the next few hours.

 We've had notes from our tipsters that the update is arriving a few minutes early (with photographic proof above), but so far we've had nothing here.
