 Just as our own Ben was lauding the release of top tier titles likeBest Picture winner Crash on Blu-ray, Lionsgate turns around and delays all of it's Blu-rayreleases. The movies were scheduled to be released on May 23 along with the offerings from Sony Pictures, but insteadwill be on hold until June when Samsung is releasing their first Blu-ray player.Confirmed LionsgateBlu-ray titles: Lord of War, The Punisher, Devil's Rejects, Saw,T2: Judgment Day, Reservoir Dogs, Total Recall, Dune, Rambo: First Blood, See No EvilThe second waveof titles they had previouslyannounced for June are now on hold indefinitely. This is probably to be expected after the Samsung delay became official, but itdoesn't make it any easier to swallow.
