Staccato Communications and Fujitsu have announced that they've jointly developed a
wireless USB demonstration
system made up of Staccato's new Ripcord UWB
Development Kit and Fujitsu's digital still camera development platform.Â  It's apparently the first demonstration
to show wireless USB connectivity with digital cameras which is, well, a pretty big deal when you think about it (no
more cables!). The system will be demonstrated in the Wireless USB Community at the Intel Developer Forums, which are
being held in Tokyo, Taipei and Beijing this month.
