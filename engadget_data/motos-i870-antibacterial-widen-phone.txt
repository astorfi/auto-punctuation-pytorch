We know iDEN's squarely on its way out (for the consumer,
anyway), but so long as Moto's gonna sell 'em for the next couple of years, they're sure to crank out ever more
phones. The i870, which we caught before on the FCC, is
apparently going to come with an AgION antimicrobial silver-ion coating, which'll keep it free of those nasty bugs on
the surface; as before it also features a 1.3 megapixel camera, MicroSD, Bluetooth, WiDEN high(er) speed data (expect
up to 100kbps, where applicable), and, of course, your precious push-to-talk. Expect it to retail for $300 with a two
year contract.
