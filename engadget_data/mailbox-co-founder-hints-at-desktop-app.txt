Although Mailbox can play nicely with Gmail on iOS, one of the bigger gaps in its resume is the lack of desktop availability. During a keynote at the DEMO Europe conference, CEO Gentry Underwood hinted that might change soon, saying that a desktop app "is something we have to do in order to stay competitive," and that "it's on our roadmap." The Mailbox app -- which promises "inbox zero" -- is currently limited to iOS devices and Gmail, whereas Dropbox, which recently purchased it for a rumored $100 million, is available on virtually all platforms. With the need to add Android and desktop clients, not to mention support for other email services like Outlook, Mailbox's roadmap is now bumper-to-bumper -- we'll just have to wait and see which drops first.
