 Missed out on claiming digital copies of video included with your discs because the expiration dates have passed? Well, Warner Bros. wants to make such frustrations a mere memory, as Tech of the Hub has found it's silently updated the use-by dates of a significant portion of its catalogue. By browsing the WB digital copy support page, it's evident most titles are now available until May 17th 2017, although we did find several exceptions. Some may discover that despite the extension their original codes won't work, but Gabe at Tech of the Hub was swiftly provided with fresh and functional ones when he notified WB, so we assume you'll get the same treatment. With streaming support now available for many of these digital copies through iCloud and expiration dates a thing of the far future, there's never been a better time to pack those shelves with limited editions and classic re-releases.
