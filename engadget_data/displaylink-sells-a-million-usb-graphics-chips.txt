Those have found their way into more than thirty different products from a number of manufacturers, including both wired and wireless USB adapters, projectors, USB docking stations, and a whole range of USB-connected monitors. Of course, DisplayLink isn't about to rest on its laurels now, and it says it expects to see an even greater range of products using its chips as wireless USB and USB 3.0 become the norm.[Via I4U News]
