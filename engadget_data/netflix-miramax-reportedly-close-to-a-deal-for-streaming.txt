 We know a common criticism of Netflix streaming is that many of the movies are older (protip: of all the movies ever produced ever, the vast majority were released prior to the last six months) but we doubt anyone will complain about awesome older movies like some of those in the Miramax catalog. According to the Wall Street Journal, the two are hammering out a five-year deal worth more than $100 million for access to its catalog of more than 700 titles which could include Pulp Fiction, Good Will Hunting, Kill Bill, and more. That could be a good take for Miramax which just recently found a new owner, and a quick boost for Netflix, which most recently had to deal with announcements that it would lose access to some popular Showtime content and experience delays on new TV shows from Starz. Still, we'll wait until after the deal is official to schedule a theme party at a throwback burger joint.

Update: According to the LA Times' Company Town blog, other companies including Amazon, Google and Hulu are also negotiating for the rights. This just got very interesting.
