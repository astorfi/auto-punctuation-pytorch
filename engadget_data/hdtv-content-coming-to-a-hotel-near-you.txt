 Tell us how much you hate it when you are staying at a high-end hotel that features HDTVs and they don't have high-def content on them. It sure annoys us. LodgeNet is working on changing that though. They are indicating that 2006 will be the year that HDTV content finally makes inroads towards the 160,000 guest rooms that LodgeNet services. Don't think that these hotels are installing HD just for you though as this is something to set them apart from the competitors. Truthfully though, we don't care who they do it for as long has they have HDTV content on their high definition sets.
