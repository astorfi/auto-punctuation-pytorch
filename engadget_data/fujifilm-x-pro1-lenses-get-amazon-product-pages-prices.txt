  Well, that didn't take long. Just yesterday, Wells Fargo Advisors reportedly outed the Fujifilm X-Pro1, a possible successor to the X100 -- today, Amazon's thrown up a trio of product pages for the shooter's leaked lenses. The product descriptions match the previous rumors to a tee, pricing the 18mm (27mm equivalent) f/2.0 and 35mm (53mm equivalent) f/1.4 lens at $500, and the larger 60mm (90mm equivalent) f/2.4 lens priced at $600. Confirmation? Not exactly, but we'll find out soon enough -- Fuijifilm takes the stage on January 9th.
