We wouldn't really know where to begin running through these parts and figuring out what's new, but Impress Watch says it's pretty much the LCD getting all the love here, and that otherwise they're seeing way fewer internal changes than they saw when Sony released the PSP-2000. Sounds about right to us, but we're really just in it for the senseless violence of it all.[Via PSP Fanboy]
