Yes, the 11-inch gaming midget won't be getting the same attention and will be "phased out", according to Alienware at a recent press event. While the device was critically well-received when it launched, gamers were now apparently looking for greater keyboard space and a larger screen in their mobile gaming purchases -- and this went for battery-life too. Those looking for a small form-factor in their mobile gaming rig will have to step up to the hulking 14-inch M14x. Hey, don't get too upset -- at least there's now an optical drive option.
