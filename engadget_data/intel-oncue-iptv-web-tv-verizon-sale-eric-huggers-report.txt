Looks as if Intel is calling time on its much-hyped, forever forthcoming web TV project. AllThingsD is reporting that the chip maker is in talks with Verizon over a deal to hand OnCue over to the big red network. Originally tipped as a cord-cutter's dream, Intel's lack of industry clout and a lack of CEO support seems to have doomed the system before it began. There's no word on how the proposed deal will look, but hopefully Verizon can at least make use of the last few years worth of R&D.
