Fortunately, Anthony Fiti of Spectrum Omega has put together a Rosetta Stone Google Map indicating how much spectrum each carrier owns in the lower 48 states, the frequencies they own and where it's all located. While it's by no means 100 percent accurate due to various complexities in how some spectrum is shared between carriers, and there's no promise of it being continually updated yet, it's still the most comprehensive visual guide we've seen outside of the FCC site. If you're curious as to who's got the spectrum in your neck of the woods, take a peek at the source link below and have a look around.
