       Although Sling Media's first CES announcements aren't until Sunday night, thanks to GigaOm we have a few details of Sling's latest product: the SlingCatcher. This is another device designed to bring more media to your TV; not only will it allow you to view content from your Slingbox like you can with your PC, but it also will allow you to view whatever is on your PCs screen, on your boob tube. The box is about half the size of a Slingbox Tuner and includes S-Video, Component, HDMI and a couple USB ports. It also includes a hard drive -- a first for Sling -- this will allow you to eventually buy content from Sling, although they haven't announced any deals with content providers just yet. Also, the device doesn't include WiFi, but it is capable, making it the first Sling product with wireless connectivity. We'll keep you updated as we learn more and of course a few pics when we get 'em.Update: According to Dave Zatz the SlingCatcher will be released mid-2007 with a MSRP of less than $200. Contrary to our earlier reports the device will include Integrated WiFi and an optional Hard Drive.Read Sling to Debut PC-to-TV Box at CES [GigaOM]Read SlingCatcher Is Real!
