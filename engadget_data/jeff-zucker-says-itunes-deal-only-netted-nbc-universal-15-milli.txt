According to Variety, Zucker lamented the lack of flexibility on pricing, and the fact that NBC U wasn't able to get a cut of Apple's hardware sales, saying that "Apple sold millions of dollars worth of hardware off the back of our content." He also dropped the bomb that the iTunes deal netted NBC U "just" $15 million in revenue, despite the fact that NBC's programming accounted for 40% of video sales on iTunes. Not coincidentally, all of this comes on the same day that NBC Universal (and its partners) launched the beta version of Hulu.com, which it hopes will provide some competition to iTunes, not to mention be better for its bottom line.
