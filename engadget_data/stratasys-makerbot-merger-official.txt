Just a couple of months after Stratasys announced it would be acquiring 3D printing firm MakerBot, their marriage is now officially complete. Following the terms of the merger, the Israeli 3D printer and manufacturer will exchange up to 4.7 million of its shares for 100 percent of MakerBot's outstanding capital stock. Stratasys is widely known for factory-level printing and prototyping for designers and engineers, while MakerBot signifies its entry into the consumer space. Indeed, MakerBot is almost synonymous with the desktop 3D printing movement, having sold more than 22,000 3D printers since 2009. MakerBot founder and CEO Bre Pettis said in a statement that they're "excited for the future" and ended with a declaration of "full speed ahead!" Let's hope this "speed" refers to future iterations that will print out that miniature dalek in minutes rather than hours.
