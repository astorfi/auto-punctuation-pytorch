What with MicroSD cards, it's not like a device of this size should blow any minds â€” in fact, to our jaded selves,
even a USB port-sized USB flash drive is still
starting to seem a little big. Ok, we give the peeps at Solid Alliance / Pretec credit for their iDisk Diamond, but
c'mon, internal USB circuitry or no, if MicroSD
can do 512, this thing should be able to do more than 128MB.
