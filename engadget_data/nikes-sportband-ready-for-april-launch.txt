Reportedly, the unit isn't meant to replace the Nike+iPod system; rather, it's an alternative for runners who'd prefer not to have earbuds in and a DAP on their person when logging their treks. As expected, time, speed, distance and calories will all be tracked, and each run can be captured and stored on the outfit's website after you thumb a ride back home. We're told to expect said device in April for â‚¬59.95 ($93), but only time will tell if that's an accurate assertion (and true worldwide).[Thanks, Susanne]
