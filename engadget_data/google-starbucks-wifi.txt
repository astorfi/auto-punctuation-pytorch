The move, which should be complete within 18 months, is a major loss for AT&T, the chain's contracted ISP to date. Google claims that you'll experience WiFi speeds up to 10x faster than what's currently available, with a 100x boost in Google Fiber cities like Austin, Provo and KC. The rollout will begin in August -- if you see "Google Starbucks" as an available SSID, you'll know your store has been tapped with boosted access.
