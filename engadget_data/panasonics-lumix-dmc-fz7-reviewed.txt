The reviewer fawned over the “excellent image” produced by this “veryinexpensive” cam's “outstanding” VARIO-ELMARIT 12x optical zoom lens steadied by Panny’s MEGAOptical image stabilizer. The ability to shoot 640 x 480, 30fps video in both bright and low light with "littlenoise" was found to be “above average” -- especially in this price range. Yeah, there was somenoticeable shutter lag and the non-articulating 2.5-inch LCD solarised when viewed from a sharp angle. Still, thatdidn’t stop PC Mag from slapping an Editor’s Choice, 4/5 rating on this $400ish $300ishcam when all was said and done.
