Still several years away from a commercial release, the company's flexible, wireless electrocardiogram patch -- also capable of serving as a dedicated heart rate monitor -- sends ECG or EMG (muscular) data in a continuous stream to either a PC or data logger for later downloading. The 175mAh battery is said to last an entire day in regular mode or several days when collecting only heartbeat data, a boon to the active lifestyle crowd for which this product is intended.[Via Medgadget]
