 Just a month after we heard that the BBC was mulling the decision to add a dedicated HD channel comes word that the BBC Trust has given the all-important thumbs-up to the idea. Reportedly, the "mixed genre" channel will show programs from across all of the BBC's stations and will air on cable / satellite "as soon as possible." Additionally, the channel should launch on Freesat just as soon as that goes live, but proposals for viewing it via Freeview were put on hold "because viewers might have been required to buy two new set-top boxes to receive the channel." So, for all you Brits out there, let us know how splendid the channel is when it becomes available -- hopefully your patience will pay off.[Via Guardian]
