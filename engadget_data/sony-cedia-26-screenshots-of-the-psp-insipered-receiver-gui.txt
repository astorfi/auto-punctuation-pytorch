Even though receivers have been equipped with on-screen menus for a couple of years now, we have never seen one that the less-then-technically-inclined can use efficiently. But Sony has taken the cross-bar interface from the PSP along with the upcoming PS3 and worked it into the STR-DA5200ES. They demo'd the interface for us but it just wasn't good 'nough for our readers; we wanted more. Thus we present to you an internal Sony Powerpoint slideshow showing everything the STR-DA5200ES GUI has to offer. NOTE: We stripped out the extra stuff around the images so you can get a better look at the GUI.26 screenshots follow after the link.
