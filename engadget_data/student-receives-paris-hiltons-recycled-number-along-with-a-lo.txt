 Getting calls at 3AM almost every night thanks to bad luck and a recycled number may be most people's idea of hell, but when the inherited number is Paris Hilton's there's a certain element of hilarity added to the mix-up. Due to standard 6 month cellphone number recycling, college student Shira Barlow started receiving calls meant for the former jailbird: primarily from callers that are clueless to being dumped by the socialite, along with the usual rabble of adoring fans and bitter haters. The reason anyone knows about this is because the LA Times happened to call the number, getting through to Shira who explained the story of how she got Paris' number. Poor Paris, she seems to have nothing but trouble with phones.
