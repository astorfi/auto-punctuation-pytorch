 We had a chance to get on the show floor at CES and chat with Jimmy Fallon (the new face of late night television as he's taking over for Conan O'Brien in March) on his gadget tastes, stock purchases, and jacket size. We hope you enjoy as much as we did.Special thanks to Trent Wolbe for shooting the video
