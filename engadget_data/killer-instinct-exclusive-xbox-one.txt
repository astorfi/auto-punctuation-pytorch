That's right, folks. Killer Instinct is making a return to consoles. When it arrives, the title will be exclusive to the Xbox One. "We listened, and Killer Instinct is back, only on Xbox One" said Microsoft Game Studios VP Phil Spencer. No word on an exact release date, though, so we'll bee keeping an eye out for those details.


Update: IGN has learned that the Killer Instinct reboot will be free to play, and will be a download-only launch title. But what does free to play actually mean? You get one character, and have to pay an as-yet unspecified amount for any additional fighters. Bummer.
