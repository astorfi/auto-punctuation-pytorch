 If you think you are a cellphone junkie, meet Zhang Yi from Beijing. Apparently, Zhang is either treating his chosen handsets astonishingly harsh or he has a potential addictive personality; we're not sure which. Zhang claims to have changed his cellphone a total of around 500 times in the past 9 years, backing up that action with a phrase like "I just can't find one that fits all my needs". Hey Zhang, we hear ya. It's rare for us to have one handset that does everything exceedingly well. It's not too hard to have one device that has qualities of perfection in many areas -- just not all.
