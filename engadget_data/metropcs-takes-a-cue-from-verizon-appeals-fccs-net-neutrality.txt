 It's not just Big Red taking issue with the FCC's final stance on net neutrality, which shouldn't come as much of a surprise -- landline and wireless operators tend to do a pretty good job harmonizing their opinions on regulatory issues, and net neutrality is about as big of a regulatory issue as you're going to get. Next up to drop the legal hammer is MetroPCS, filing this week with the Washington, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and saying that it wants to make sure "the concerns of competitive wireless carriers, like MetroPCS, are addressed." Interestingly, the company specifically calls out net neutrality complaints against its new 4G plans -- which stratify non-browser data usage as a separate category with its own bucket -- as one of the reasons it's filing the appeal; separately, the carrier says that it's going to formally respond to those complaints next month, so it's clearly not ready to back down and rethink its LTE strategy. It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out.
