As the BBC reports, they've effectively turned the device into a musical instrument, with the wearer only required to think about a note as they flash on a screen in order to play it. It's apparently not quite a foolproof solution just yet, with it currently only able to play the correct note about six out of eight times, but the researchers see plenty of potential applications for the system, including helping composers struck down with multiple sclerosis or other physical disabilities. Hit up the read link below to check out a video demonstration.
