Microsoft Office 2010 is available right now for Windows 7 / Vista / XP users. Right this instant. As you read this. It has entered "the realm of the real," as it were. Depending on your needs and your budget, you can pick up one of various flavors: Home and Student (including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote for $150), Office Home and Business (all of the above, plus Outlook for $280), or Office Professional (adds Access and Publisher for a cool $500). If that weren't enough for you, it also looks like Hotmail (remember that?) got some massive improvements with Office Web App integration, new attachment limits up to 10 GB using SkyDrive, and more. What are you waiting for? Check out the source links to get started.
