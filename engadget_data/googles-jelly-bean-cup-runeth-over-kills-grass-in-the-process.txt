The search giant clearly has some big, colorful plans for later this week, including, perhaps, another entry in its delicious parade of lawn-cluttering mobile operating system dessert foods. The above statue was spotted and posted to the Google Developers page on Google+, and it surely amounts to more than just a belated Easter celebration. We'll no doubt be hearing a lot more on the subject from Google -- and the American Dental Association -- in the days to come.

 Update: No, Google wasn't planning on leaving a mess on the Googleplex grass. That jar is part of a more elaborate statue that more clearly reminds us Jelly Bean is, in fact, part of the Android ecosystem. You can catch a video of the assembly and the final product after the break.
