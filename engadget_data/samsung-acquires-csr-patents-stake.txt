 The S-Wallet has opened and absorbed $310 million-worth of connectivity and location patents from British chip company CSR, which already supplies SiRF GPS chips to Galaxy devices. In addition to boosting its patent portfolio, Samsung also invested $34 million to buy a five percent stake in the firm itself, giving it access to a large development team working on audio, automotive, indoor location and other functions. The deal won't let Samsung use CSR's camera technology, but it will -- the Korean manufacturer says -- "solidify its position as a leading semiconductor solutions provider." Given how Sammy is already intent going it alone with its Exynos processors, we have no reason to doubt it.
