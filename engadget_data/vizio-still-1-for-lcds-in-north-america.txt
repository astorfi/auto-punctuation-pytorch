 Just when we were ready to give the North American LCD throne back to Samsung and Sharp, iSuppli has released its numbers, claiming Vizio is still on top. In contrast with the previous rankings from DisplaySearch, iSuppli saw Samsung improve its marketshare in the third quarter to 12.8 percent, but still unable to match Vizio's mark of 13 percent. Along with the new numbers is information that the other manufacturers have taken note of Vizio's success and increased their promotions, the tight competition should promise many choices and better prices as we get into the all-important holiday season.[Via TG Daily]
