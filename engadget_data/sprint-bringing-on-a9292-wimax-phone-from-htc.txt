PhoneArena appears to have secured some sort of inventory sheet showing the phone without any additional detail; for what it's worth, Sprint has been basically mum recently on its plans for taking its WiMAX network from data cards to handsets, but this seems to jibe with a recent rumor that the carrier's first 4G phone would be packing Android -- something HTC's pretty well acquainted with. Other than that, your guess is as good as ours on when this'll happen and exactly what form it'll take, but we can already say with a high degree confidence that we want one.
