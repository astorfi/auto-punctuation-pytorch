Good news: Verizon's latest rebate form reveals that a black version is in the works, arguably more appropriate for the phone's largely business-oriented demographic. Other goodies on the form are few and far between, though our tipster does point out that the Motorola W385 makes an appearance, offering KRZR-like styling in a lower-end package. No word on release for either, though the rebates expire on May 13 -- take that for what you will.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
