They sure aren't wasting any time, either. The newly joined pair is taking this special moment to announce their upcoming -- and totally expected -- integrated platforms, which should debut in 2007 and will present a rough equivalent to Intel's integrated offerings. However, the new AMD also has a new "Fusion" technology in the works which goes quite a bit beyond regular old integrated graphics. The "new class of x86 processor" integrates the CPU and GPU at the silicon level, supposedly allowing for better performance-per-watts and all other kinds of good times. This sort of "modular" processing has a lot of potential, and we should be seeing Fusion-based products in late 2008 or early 2009. The chips are supposed to make it into everything from laptops to desktops to servers, and could provide a delightful twist to the AMD vs. Intel wars everybody is gearing up for.[Via Randomly Accessed]
