The image was apparently "leaked" on Chinese social network Weibo by an enthusiastic PR manager at the firm. Things are still pretty sparse on the specification front, but -- all things going according to plan -- that 5-inch screen and italian design will be hiding quad-core internals and at least 13 megapixels of camera power. With the official reveal tipped for next week, though, it shouldn't be too long until we're seeing a whole lot more of it. Leaked or otherwise.
