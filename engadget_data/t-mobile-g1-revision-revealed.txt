It'd make sense -- by October, when this is allegedly hitting retail for $150-ish, the G1 will be getting long in the tooth. What's more, this sucker's clearly running Android, and it's a whole hell of a lot better-looking. More on this as it develops, of course, but in the meantime, that myTouch is looking just a bit less appealing, isn't it?
