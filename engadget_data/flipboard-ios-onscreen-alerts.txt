Flipboard got an iOS 7 makeover from the get-go, but now its developers have polished its interface even further, made it faster and sprinkled in new features. While its changelog doesn't include anything huge, the updated aggregator now shows onscreen alerts for incoming feeds so you don't miss any breaking news. Version 2.1 also takes advantage of the relatively big iPhone 5 and 5s screens by adding more section tiles on the front page. As a nice extra, the devs threw in a setting that lets you adjust text size within the app. Get these changes (along with a bucket full of bug fixes) via the iTunes source link below.
