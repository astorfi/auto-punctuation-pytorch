We were just getting used to a world with the Canon EOS-20D in it when along comes some rumors/predictions of Nikon
striking back with a whole bunch of new digital cameras. The lineup of new cameras due out this fall is supposed to
include:





The D3, a new 15 megapixel digital SLR.




The D200, an 8.25 megapixel upgrade to the D100.




The D2HS, a new version of their D2H digital SLR (which is pictured at right) with an improved 4.1 megapixel
  sensor.




The DSX, an 8.2 megapixel version of the D2HS that doubles the number of horizontal pixels.
