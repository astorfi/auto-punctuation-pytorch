The Chinese manufacturer posted a "demo-build" of the update to its support page today, offering Android 4.0 in both simplified Chinese, as well as the standard suite of languages included in the Android pack. The update comes less than a month after the release of Ice Cream Sandwich's source code, and well in advance of some other manufacturers. You can take it for a spin now, at the source link below.
