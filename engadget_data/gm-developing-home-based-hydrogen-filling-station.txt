 If you're tired of waiting for your neighborhood gas station to bust out a hydrogen pump for filling up your fuel cell vehicle that you bought on the black market, have no fear. GM is prepping a hydrogen refueling station that can be set up in your home, and is powered off of electricity or sunlight. The expectation is that early adopters will be able to fill up their own vehicles at home while they wait for the hydrogen infrastructure to be built out. Honda has had already built a similar system, and it looks like it'll be a long while until we can find that sweet, sweet hydrogen nectar at our corner pump, so this might be the best we're going to get for a while. GM also recently announced that they're prepping 100 fuel cell-based Chevrolet Equinox SUVs to be put in the hands of "consumers" (i.e. 100 highly visible, photogenic and PR-friendly people) across the US. As for a publicly available fuel cell vehicle, it looks like you'll have to wait until 2011 to have a legitimate excuse to pick up one of these refueling stations.[Via AutoblogGreen]
