 Apparently feeling we were running low on Galaxy smartphones after the current lineup of Galaxy S III, Galaxy S III mini and Galaxy Note II, Samsung's SHV-E270L just made the FCC rounds and is rumored to be next in line. Flashing its codename "Baffin" in the documents, this device does not seem destined for an appearance beyond Korean borders, but a unique blend of specs and rumors that it will arrive as the "Galaxy Grand" continue to intrigue. Listed as an LTE phone in the Bluetooth database, and appearing in GLBenchmark reporting a 1.4GHz (possibly quad-core) CPU like the Galaxy S III, but with a much lower 800x480 WVGA display. According to a report from Korea's Money Today, the idea is to create a device for older customers that's easier to read with bigger icons and letters on its large 5-inch low res screen (as opposed to the 5-inch 1080p pixel density monsters we're now accustomed to), with a quad-core CPU pushing Android 4.1 and its Smart Stay features plus a 2,100mAh battery. We're not sure if it will increase your parent's scores in Fruit Ninja, but vision-challenged KT, LG U+ and SK Telecom customers may have an interesting decision to make very soon.
