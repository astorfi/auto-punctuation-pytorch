       More news from the Blu-ray studios about the release dates and titles for more movies on that "other" high-definition format, with Sony announcing details about the Blu-ray edition of Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, and Paramount revealing the dates for The Manchurian Candidate (2004) and We Were Soldiers. Not much detail about the latter two except for their street date of January 23, 2007, although we expect them to have similar extras to the other Paramount releases, which has only these two titles unreleased in their catalog of movies released for both Blu-ray and HD DVD.Talladega Nights, on the other hand, will be a day-and-date release with the standard-def DVD and UMD formats, and will be in 2.40:1 widescreen and with a PCM 5.1 soundtrack. There will be an extra 13 minutes in the unrated edition for DVD and Blu-ray, with some additional commercials, commentary, and interviews with the cast. Those fans of Borat Ali G Sacha Cohen will be pleased to note he also has some special features devoted to his character in the movie.All in all, good news for next-gen fans, as the studios continue to release titles for both formats, and the spread between title counts continues to... erm, stay about the same.
