Lenovo subsidiary Medion already produces smartphones, but normally these units are the ones you'll find clogging up the very bottom of the bargain basement. With the X-Series, however, the company is raising its ambitions to the middle, more legitimate tiers of the market. The first model is tentatively titled the "X4701," but we've been reassured that a catchier name is currently being cooked up by Medion's corporate minds. Still, for now, that's the name we'll stick with.


The 4.7-inch smartphone is packing a 1,280 x 720 display alongside a 1.2GHz Tegra 3 chipset with 1GB RAM, which should be enough to run the stock build of Android 4.2 that it'll ship with. On the storage front, while there's only 8GB on board, the company has thoughtfully thrown in an 8GB microSD card to double your storage before you begin. Speaking of things included in the box, the device ships with a black matte plastic rear cover, but users will also find a white version tucked somewhere beneath the manual and charger. Connectivity-wise, there's 802.11 b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 3.0 and HSDPA+ modems -- decent enough for those who aren't too fussed about buying a plan with LTE. There's no word on when the retitled device will arrive, or which nations it'll be pitched to, but the company has pledged that it'll cost no more than â‚¬199 -- a promise it should think very hard about breaking.
