Posted on its Facebook page today, Round Rock's latest laptop -- which likely claims XPS lineage -- is looking lean and clean, with a couple of USB 3.0 ports and lattice-work speaker grilles. There's not much more to say, so we'll let the vid speak for itself. Enjoy.

Update: Michael Dell did it again! We just caught the CEO tweeting "Dell XPS 15z Coming soon!" and linking to the same video after the break. Looks like someone doesn't get the idea behind teasers. To be fair, though, you can actually see the moniker at about 8 seconds into the clip.
