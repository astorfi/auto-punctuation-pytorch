The 1080p LCD HDTV supposedly targets DSLR users by encompassing 100 percent of HDTV broadcasting's (sRGB.904) color space and a coverage rate of 96 percent for Adobe RGB -- much like those "pro LCD monitors" we see so often. You'll also find 52 picture quality adjustments properties, the company's own GENESSA Picture Engine, 120Hz Clear Motion Drive III, 4,000:1 contrast ratio, HDMI CEC support and a low-profile tuner (TU-CX100) that can be "separated from the monitor and placed horizontally or stood vertically on a tabletop, or hung on the wall." Mum's the word on pricing, but you can certainly say we're overly anxious to see how this puppy looks.
