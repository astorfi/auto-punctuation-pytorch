Oh, and his adoring fans can snap one up too if they're quick. Details about the unit itself are scant, but it will obviously be Tony Hawk-branded and able to do a 900 on command. We are hearing, however, that it's slated to land on July 16th -- just in time for the T-Mobile sponsored Boom Boom HuckJam, too.[Via Hiptop3, image courtesy of AOL]
