Hipstamatic's Oggl app and sharing service is coming to Windows Phone 8, we learned at Nokia's Lumia 925 launch event. We didn't get to play around in the app -- the WP8 UI we saw on stage was but a preview, as the native app (read: not a port) is still in development. We're assured Oggl will be ready by the time the new Lumia launches, but it won't be a Nokia exclusive, so anyone with a WP8 handset will be able to use the food filter and (over)share their lunch choice on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or Instagram. We don't know whether the regular dollar-per-month (or $10 per year) service fee will apply, but we're told you'll be able to swap cash for more filters and effects on top of the base selection.
