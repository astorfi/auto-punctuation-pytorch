It's the 8.9-inch model, meaning you're paying a $200 premium for that LTE antenna. But, Amazon has paired that with an absolutely killer data deal. For $50 a year you'll get 250MB monthly. AT&T's current data plans would have you paying $14.99 monthly for that much data. If we were a mathematician we'd say that's a savings of 129.88 a year. But, since we're not, we'll just say that sounds like good value to us. The Kindle Fire HD with 4G LTE will be available for pre-order today, shipping on November 20th.
