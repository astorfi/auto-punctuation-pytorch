"We The People" will work like this: anyone 13 or older can set up a petition -- but before it's visible on the site they need to get 150 grass-roots signatures. If an entreaty receives 5,000 or more signatures within 30 days, it is guaranteed to receive an official response from a White House staffer. Does the thought of direct access to the executive excite you like a West Wing marathon? You'll probably enjoy the introductory video we've included behind the break.
