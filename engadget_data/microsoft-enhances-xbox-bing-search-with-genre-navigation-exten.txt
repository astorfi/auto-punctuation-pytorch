Announced today at its E3 keynote, the company's expanding Bing Voice search functionality with the ability to navigate by genre. Simply saying, "Bing comedy," will bring up a host of titles allocated to that category. And non-English speakers will get to enjoy this new perk as well, as the service will now extend to 12 additional countries. Stay tuned for more live coverage of E3 2012 as the show unfolds.
