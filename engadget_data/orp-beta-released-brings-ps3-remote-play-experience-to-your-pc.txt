Modder Dashhacker (with special thanks to noted PSP hacker Dark_AleX, among others) has released Open Remote Play v1.1 beta, which lets you take that same Remote Play experience onto your Windows PC or Intel-based Mac. The caveat here is that you'll still need a PSP handy to set up the application, so don't go thinking you can bypass the portable altogether. The OS X version apparently works well, but Windows users may ample bugs -- it is beta, after all. We haven't had a chance to try it ourselves yet, but don't let that stop you from beating us to the punch -- just let us know what you think. Alternatively, you can peruse video of it in action after the break.
