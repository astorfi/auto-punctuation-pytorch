       Funny how all the marketing meetings, TBWA \ Chiat \ Day-bought inspiration, planning, and advertising budget in the world still can't weed out the x-factor. Case in point: people seem pretty amused by the fact that the first (real) iPhone ad, all cheery and chipper, complete with launch date, probably couldn't pick up the spirits of those watching tonight's edition 60 Minutes, the show during which it ran. The guests on tonight's episode included: Daytona beach partyman Jack Kevorkian, Marxist anti-semite Vanessa Redgrave (spotted this weekend dancing with Lindsay Lohan), and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whom some of you may know for his stint in the original cast of Cirque du Soleil (or, alternately, his tenure as Iran's current President).The most amusing bit, however, came from Engadget pal Andy Pargh, who gave a call to the real restaurant featured in tonight's iPhone ad, Pacific Catch. They answered: "Pacific Catch, may I help you?" "Hi, I just wanted to know if you were getting a lot of calls tonight?" The hostess answered, "Yes." "Do you know why?" "Yes." Say, didn't Steve pull this same kind of move in January (on a much smaller scale) when he called the Starbucks next to Macworld and used his iPhone order 4,000 lattes? iPhone: the ultimate device for mobile audio, video, and making prank calls; all this and Andy Rooney tonight on 60 Minutes.[Thanks, Andy]Read - 60 Minutes takes on KevorkianRead - ... and RedgraveRead - ... and AhmadinejadRead - Oh, and here's the iPhone ad featuring seafoodRead - And to cap it off, Pacific Catch's web site.
