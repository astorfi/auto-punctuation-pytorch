 Welcome to Engadget's Back to School guide!

  Most of us are still walking around hunchbacked from years of carrying heavy textbooks in our overstuffed backpacks. Thankfully, an e-reader can significantly lighten the loads for students everywhere. Sure, we've still got a ways to go before electronic devices can replace textbooks altogether, but in the long run, it's a purpose that could significantly impact the postures of backpack wearers all over. Jump past the break for our recommendations, and another opportunity to enter our back to school giveaway. Simply leave a comment below to be entered to win, and head over to our giveaway page for more details.

 

 Touchscreen Barnes & Noble Nook WiFi 
 Barnes & Noble managed to one-up Amazon with its latest reader, offering up a device with a faster processor, quicker refresh rate, and smaller footprint than the latest Kindle. The latter is due, in part, to the company's adoption of infrared touchscreen technology, which lets you flip through pages with a swipe of a finger. Add in social network sharing functionality and expandable memory, and you've got a killer devoted e-reader.

 Key specs: Six-inch Pearl E Ink display, 2GB / expandable memory, 800MHz processor.

 Price: $139 on Barnes & Noble

     Sony Reader Pocket Edition    Sony got the portability thing down to a science with this lightweight reader. Affordability? Not so much.

  QWERTY Keyboard Amazon Kindle 
 The Kindle name is still synonymous with e-readers, and while the latest version is nearly a year old, it's still the top choice for those seeking a reader with a full keyboard. The WiFi version will run you the same price as the Nook WiFi -- or you can save some cash by picking up the ad-supported version.

 Key specs: Six-inch display, 800 x 600 display, 4GB storage, 532MHz processor.

 Price: $139 on Amazon

  Price: $139 from iRiver
  The Tablet / Reader Nook Color 
 Is it a color screen reader or a low-end tablet? Only Barnes & Noble knows for sure. Whatever you call it, this Android-powered device does a heck of a lot more than just reading. Angry Birds, anyone?

 Key specs: Seven-inch color touchscreen, 8GB / expandable memory, 800 MHz processor.
 Price: $249 on Barnes & Noble

The authorized account holder is defined as the natural person who is assigned to an e-mail address by an Internet access provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the submitted e-mail address.
