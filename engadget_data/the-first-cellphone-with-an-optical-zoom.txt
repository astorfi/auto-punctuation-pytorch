Vodafone Japan, obviously smarting after we referred to some of their concept phones as looking
like vapourware, is busily turning them into reality. Sidestepping the karaoke phone we reported on earlier and
the graunching design horror that is Mitsubishi's
V401D, there are some cool handsets in
here. Leading the pack is Sharp's V602SH, which has a 2-megapixel autofocus camera with a 2X optical zoom (a world
first), and a decently sized 2.4-inch display. It also comes with the Bowlingual dog-bark translator as standard,
but we'll overlook that one.
