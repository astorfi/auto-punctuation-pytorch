 Could it be that all of RIM's future devices (or at least its consumer-oriented ones) will bear short, easy to remember names? Seemingly following in the footsteps of the Pearl, RIM has set up blackberry8300.com to forward to -- you guessed it -- blackberrycurve.com. The move means virtually nothing to business users who have their BlackBerrys doled out to them in a very unemotional, automatic way, but to the end user standing in line at their carrier's store, "Curve" sounds a lot, shall we say, cooler than "8300." Guess we'll find out soon enough.
