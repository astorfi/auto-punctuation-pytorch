 The writing has certainly been on the wall, particularly of late, but the long-awaited dedicated BBC HD has finally launched on cable and satellite. This means that viewers will be able to see programs such as Strictly Come Dancing and Cranford in high-definition, and moreover, the Queen's Christmas message will also be broadcast in HD for the first time this year. As we'd heard, Freeview audiences will still have to wait, but those tuning in via cable / satellite can catch HD programming for nine hours per day that will showcase content from all of the BBC's stations. Notably, Kill Bill and Sin City are also on the list to be shown in HD later this month, which should certainly inject a healthy dose of holiday cheer (or violent tendencies) into your soul. So, for those of you in Britain, how's the new station?[Via HDTV Reviews]
