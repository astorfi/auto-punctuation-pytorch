The Google chairman also found some time to learn the legendary "invisible horse" dance with PSY, the charismatic oppa in the Korean chart-topper Gangnam Style. While Google Korea was happy to supply a few photos, the only video we could dig up was a surprisingly short one hosted by Daum -- it's embedded right after the break.

 Brian: "Man, not being the CEO of a multinational corporation sure is hard work."

 Terrence: "I see you are a fellow disciple of the Carlton Banks school of dance."

 Don: "Gangnam Style, 2012-2012."

 Billy: "This song is really about the time I set my socks on fire. I see you still have yours. One moment."

 Edgar: "Hm... I think we forgot the horse."

 Richard Lai: "OK Eric, now let's do the elevator scene."

 Dan: "Doenjang Girls, would you like to buy a Nexus 7? It's wayyy more expensive than a latt√©."

 Darren: "Soooo glad this guy put this video on YouTube and not Vimeo. $$$$$$$$"

 Jon Fingas: "Oppan Google sty-- no, even I can't go that far."
