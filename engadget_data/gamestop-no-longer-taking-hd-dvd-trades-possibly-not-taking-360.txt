We're also hearing that the 360 HD DVD drive will no longer be accepted at any GameStop as of tomorrow, and that there's a major price cut in the works -- which makes sense, but we'll see what happens. For now, though, it looks like HD DVD fans jumping ship may have to resort to eBay -- or start peddling discs out the back of their cars.[Thanks, Mark]
