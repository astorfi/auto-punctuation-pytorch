A USB 2.0 hub that doubled as a portable speaker system would have been sweet enough, but Thanko takes things even further, with the NB-mate also able act as a power source for any USB-powered device by popping in couple of rechargeable Ni-MH batteries, which themselves can be recharged by plugging the NB-mate into an AC outlet. It's the circle of life, man -- and it'll only cost you fifty bucks.[Via Engadget Japanese]
