Ready to rock texters' worlds on AT&T, the Duo does indeed boast Windows Mobile 6, a QWERTY keypad and a numeric 'board for your convenience, UMTS / HSDPA compatibility and a 320 x 240 resolution display. The unit measures in at 4.02- x 1.97- x .83-inches, and if you dig what you're seeing, it can be yours today for $199.99 if you're cool with signing a two-year agreement.[Via Reuters / Yahoo]
