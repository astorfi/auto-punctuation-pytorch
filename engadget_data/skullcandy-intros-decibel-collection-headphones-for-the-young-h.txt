The company's just launched its vast Decibel (dB) Collection, a wide range of wildly styled, Limited Edition "high performance" cans that take design up to eleven, to say the very least. With customizable lines including Big Slick, Vibe, Dream Team, Lurker, Catfight, Audiophile, and Illustrative, it's safe to say that Skullcandy will probably have whatever it is you're looking for in headphones... as long as what you're looking for is truly insane.
