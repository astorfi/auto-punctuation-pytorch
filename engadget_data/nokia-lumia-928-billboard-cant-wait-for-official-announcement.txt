It's not uncommon for an as yet announced phone to pop up on Twitter, or via an insider leak. But a physical billboard? That takes some doing. If this image -- spotted out in the wild -- is to be believed, Nokia's Lumia 928 is as real as the day is long. The Verizon handset shown certainly fits the images we've already seen, and the low-light boast will stoke the coals of any Xenon or PureView rumors for sure. However, this spot is hardly Times Square, so until we see something a little more concrete, Lumia fans on Big Red will have to keep the faith with that 822.
