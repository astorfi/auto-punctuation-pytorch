 Add Comcast to the list of providers getting very serious about dumping all those bandwidth hogging analog channels and plans to go all digital in 20% of its markets by year's end, and all by 2010. Of course it will have to provide free digital adapters for analog customers per the FCC, but by dropping ~70 analog channels, it'll free up enough space for about 150 HD channels (220 if you don't mind shaving a few bits). We really wonder how well this is going to go over, as we can't expect our mom to give up her simple setup, with super fast changing channels, without a fight. We figure a good percentage of customers will either give up on cable TV completely, while others may finally be enticed to switch to satellite. But honestly, we're not really that concerned, just so long as providers keep all those new HD channels coming.
