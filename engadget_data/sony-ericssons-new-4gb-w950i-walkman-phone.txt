The Symbian OS phone also has Opera 8, Macromedia Flash Lite, video playback support, and abuilt-in FM radio to augment the standard Walkman MP3/AAC capability. We'll have to try the smooth keypad before wepass final judgement, but while sexy looking, it doesn't seem like it'll make one-handed texting any easier.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
