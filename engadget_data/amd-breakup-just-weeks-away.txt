 Those AMD breakup rumors are back with a bullet this morning thanks to some chatty sources speaking to TG Daily. Though this one can hardly be called rumor since it was AMD's own freshman CEO, Dirk Meyer (pictured), who said that AMD was "just months away" from spinning off its manufacturing and fabrication business into a separate entity. TGD's sources claim that an announcement is indeed planned for next month in fruition of its Asset Light and Asset Smart strategies. With it, we'll see Meyer take over the development of chip technologies while someone else (possibly Hector Ruiz, who recently shed his CEO role but stayed on as the board's chair) taking responsibilities of manufacturing. Let's just hope that they can get past this distraction in short order -- a strong, focused AMD is good for the industry and that's good for us consumers.
