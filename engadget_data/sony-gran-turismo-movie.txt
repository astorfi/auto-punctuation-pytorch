Remember those rumors about Sony making a movie based upon the famed Gran Turismo racing games? Well, today at Gamescom 2013, Sony has officially announced that said film project is in the works. Unfortunately, Sony's not telling us anything about the story itself (other than fast cars being featured), but we do know it'll be a "full length feature film." Kazunori Yamauchi, Polyphony Digital head is helping make it along with filmmakers Mike de Luca and Dana Brunetti. When will their masterpiece be ready for theaters? We don't know. What we do know, however, is that the latest iteration of the Gran Turismo gaming series, GT 6 will be making its debut on December 6th of this year.
