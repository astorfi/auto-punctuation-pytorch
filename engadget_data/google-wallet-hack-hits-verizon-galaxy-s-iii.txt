Mike Beauchamp and Dustin Evans took some time away from their recent Kansas City trip (to check out Google Fiber, of course) to get the Mountain View mobile payment solution up and running on a Galaxy S III. Is it more difficult than rooting your device and installing the app? Just a bit. Beauchamp's video doesn't offer much in the way of instruction, but it does show it being used to buy breakfast at Mickey D's. Thankfully, it looks like some folks over at the XDA forums have documented the solution, just check out the more coverage link.
