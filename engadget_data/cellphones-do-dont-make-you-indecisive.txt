 Withmost people unconvinced or just plain agnostic about conflicting reports regarding cellphone radiation leading tocancer, researchers have decided to turn their gaze to the important topic of... indecisiveness? Turns out an Australianstudy points to electromagnetic radiation from your mobile phone as an impairment to your ability to make snap decision,such as when driving a car. It seems quite obvious that talking on a phone can and does make people worse drivers, butthese findings seem to come from study participants who were given straight up radiation, so they shouldn't have beendistracted by a conversation during tests. Another interesting finding of the study was that the participants showed aslight improvement in working memory, such as remembering a phone number long enough to dial it. Other than a fewscientific high fives, we can't imagine these findings making much of a societal impact, but it's always good to know.
