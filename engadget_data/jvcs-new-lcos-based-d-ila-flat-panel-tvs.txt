Still waiting to see whether they'll roll these out over here, but JVC is making for their new line of
LCoS-based (Liquid Crystal on Silicon) D-ILA
TVs (which also happen to be
HDMI-capable). Neither LCoS nor HDMI
are huge yet here in North America, but in Japan it sounds like HDMI is really taking off, and despite
numerous problems with LCOS technology, JVC seems to be
forging ahead with it and, from all we can tell, have been pretty successful with it.Â
