For $179.99, you'll get a limited-edition silver and black Nintendo DS, the Guitar Hero: On Tour game, and the Guitar Grip. The DS in question has a flaming Guitar Hero logo on its silver cover and hits stores on June 29, a week after the game comes out on its own. As far as the $179.99 price goes, don't flip out just yet: this is a fair deal given the DS runs $129.99 and the game will be $49.99 on its own. So, if lime green or cinnamon red isn't your thing and you're the last gamer without a DS, this could be the bundle for you.
