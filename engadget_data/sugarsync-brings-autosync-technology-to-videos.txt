In the latest version, the company has applied its AutoSync technology to videos, which means that all media files can now be synced to the cloud and pushed to linked computers without user intervention. As this could involve a significant amount of data, AutoSync Videos works only over WiFi, and users may select from three compression qualities based on their desire for picture quality or upload speed. The latest SugarSync apps also feature a redesigned photos tab, which lets users view all their pictures -- not just the recent ones -- and offers quicker navigation along with larger, high-res previews. The company gives all users 5GB of storage absolutely gratis, so if you have a lot of media to unload, it may be worthwhile to hop aboard. You'll find the complete PR announcements just after the break.

In addition to automatically syncing photos, SugarSync's AutoSync technology now also syncs mobile videos as well – making it the easiest way to get your mobile videos from your Android device to your computers, without wires. 		Also announced today was SugarSync's new iOS app, which improves mobile photo and video syncing for iPhone and iPad. Please see the "SugarSync Revamps iOS App To Make Mobile Photo & Video Sync Simpler Than Ever" press release for more information. 		"Our AutoSync technology has been a huge hit with Android users because it eliminates the hassle of having to use physical wires to backup and sync your photos from your Android device to your computers," said Laura Yecies, CEO of SugarSync. "Getting mobile videos off users' devices is an even bigger problem, because these files are larger and take up more space on a user's device. By expanding our AutoSync technology to now automatically backup and sync videos as well, we eliminate a huge headache for Android users – and make it easier for them to share their videos instead of leaving them on their devices." 		Just Shoot Your Videos – AutoSync Does the Rest 		Yes, it really is that easy. After you install the app, just take a video using your device's built-in camera, like you normally would. Behind the scenes, SugarSync will detect the new video and when you have a WiFi connection, will back it up to the Cloud and sync it to your computers in your Mobile Photos folder. It is truly a zero-step process to getting your videos from your Android device to your computers. 		With videos typically being larger files, we purposefully built AutoSync Videos to respect your data plan and battery. AutoSync Videos will only run when you're connected to a WiFi network – even if you've set AutoSync Photos to be allowed to run on 3G. This helps ensure that AutoSync Videos won't burn through your data plan. 		Benefits of AutoSync for Video 		With SugarSync's AutoSync Videos technology, users can: 		· Free your mobile videos – Liberate all those great mobile videos you've taken from your device, without ever having to think about it. AutoSync automatically backs them up and syncs them to your computer.		· Keep your mobile videos safe – Even in the case of a lost device, you can be sure that your videos are safe. AutoSync has been backing them up and syncing them in the background.		· Say goodbye to the hassle of wires and cables – Many users resist syncing and downloading videos from their mobile devices simply because it is too complex and time consuming. Put the wires away, and let AutoSync take care of the rest. 		The new SugarSync for Android app is available today for your Andorid phones and tablets. Download it now in the Android Market or from the SugarSync site.

The new SugarSync for iOS app gives you the ability to sync all of your mobile photos and videos to your computers at once, control over photo and video compression and quality, and an updated photo album gallery for a better viewing and sharing experience. 			Also announced today was SugarSync's new Android app, featuring AutoSync for Mobile Videos. Please see the "SugarSync Introduces AutoSync for Mobile Videos" press release for more information. 			"Our mobile devices have become our primary point-and-shoot cameras, which means we have an increasing amount of photos and videos on our phones and devices that need to be synced with our computers at any given time," said Laura Yecies, CEO of SugarSync. "Our new app not only makes it easier than ever to sync your mobile photos and videos with your computers, but it also gives you more control over the quality and speed of media backups." 			Your Mobile Media Synced, With Fewer Clicks 			SugarSync has always enabled you to automatically sync photos and videos that are taken from within the SugarSync app, so that all your photos and videos are available on your computer as you take them. But for existing photos and videos that are in your camera roll (or photos/videos not taken from within the SugarSync app), you previously had to upload one image at a time to SugarSync to sync them to your computers. 			With the new app, you can easily upload lots of photos and videos at once – whichever ones you select – so that your existing media are synced to any folder on your computer in just a couple of clicks. We also made it so that SugarSync will continue to upload all of your photos in the background, so that you can leave the SugarSync app and keep using your device while everything uploads. 			Quality, Upload Speed, or Both? 			When it comes to photo and video uploads, there are usually two camps. The first wants to optimize their photos and videos for fast upload and use less bandwidth, and the second would rather have their images in full-resolution, even if that means the upload may take longer. With the new SugarSync app, the choice is yours – just choose between Best, Good, or Medium upload quality. Best quality results in the highest image quality, but takes the longest to upload since the files are largest. Medium applies more compression to your media, which results in much faster uploads. 			New Photo Tab for a Better Viewing Experience 			The new app features a completely re-designed photos tab, which gives you a complete view of all of your photo albums, not just your recent albums. All of the sharing options are still there, but we've presented the albums with larger preview images and included additional sorting options to make things easier to find. The result is a lot fewer clicks to get to the images and albums you want to view and share. 			We also optimized the photo viewing experience to make it faster than ever to swipe between photos. And we no longer default the images to low-resolution, so viewing your high-resolution photos has never been easier or faster. 			The new SugarSync for iOS app is available today for your iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Download it now in the iTunes App Store, or from the SugarSync site.
