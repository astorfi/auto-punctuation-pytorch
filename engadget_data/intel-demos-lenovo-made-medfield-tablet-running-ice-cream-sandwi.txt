Wandering around Chipzilla's sprawling demo area, we also spotted an unnamed, 10-inch tablet made by Lenovo. And unlike that handset, this is a product that will ship in more or less the form we're seeing it today. Unfortunately, though, we were strictly forbidden from actually touching the thing. For now, at least, we know what lies beneath that 1366 x 768 display. In addition to a 32nm low-power Atom processor, it has NFC, WiFi (natch) and a battery rated for 10 hours of active use and 30 days of standby.

	As with the smartphone, Intel is really keen on talking up Medfield's graphics muscle, and we were once again treated to a series of gaming and application demonstrations. Watch the video for yourself, but we couldn't for the life of us see any stutter in that app walk-through: both 3D rendering and gestures like pinch to zoom seemed silky smooth from where we were sitting. So, what say you? Impressed?
