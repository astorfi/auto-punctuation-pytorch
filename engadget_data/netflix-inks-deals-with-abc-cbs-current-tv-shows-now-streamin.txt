Announced today, the movie rental service has landed separate agreements with both CBS and ABC that will allow a swath of current TV shows to be streamed at Netflix. Starting next month, subscribers can indulge in current season episodes of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, and beginning this week, current season episodes of CSI: Miami and CSI: NY. Over on the ABC / Disney side, you can expect to find streams of Hannah Montana, The Suite Life on Deck, and Wizards of Waverly Place, two of which can be seen just 24 hours after they air on television. Users will also find heaps of catalog episodes to enjoy at their leisure, and we have all ideas the quantity of available content will grow as time passes. Now, if only we had an ETA on HD streaming...[Thanks, Anthony]
