 Belkin's just introduced its CableFree USB hub, a four-port Ultra-Wideband unit that'll let you plug in any USBdevice and have instant wireless connectivity with no need for drivers or software. Obviously, the big deal here is forlaptops, which'll be able to wirelessly access printers, hard drives, and presumably just about anything else you canthrow at it, although though don't say what the maximum range is. No word on price just yet, but it should be availablesometime this spring.[Via Macworld]
