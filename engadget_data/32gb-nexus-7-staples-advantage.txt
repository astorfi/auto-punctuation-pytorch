 What appears to be a 32GB Nexus 7 has already been spotted in Japan, and now a screenshot reveals that the slate has been listed on Staples' business-centric storefront. Staples Advantage pegs the tablet at $248.37, placing it on par with the current 16GB model. If a Nexus 7 with beefed-up storage and a price tag similar to the one above does materialize, Google could put one of the current models on the chopping block to maintain its two SKU offering. The retailer also lists an October 18th availability date, but we're not holding our breath for such a quick reveal.
