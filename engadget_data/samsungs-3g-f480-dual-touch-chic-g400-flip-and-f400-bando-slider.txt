Rather than overwhelm you with the lot, we've whittled down the selection to a few of our faves. First up, the F480 (pictured left) which casts aside its Armani rags for full-on Samsung branding. The 11.5-mm slim handset with 2.8-inch, 240 x 320 touchscreen features Samsung's latest Croix OS with tactile feedback. It's now sporting 3G connectivity, FM-radio, and the ever so popular 5 megapixel camera (with LED flash). Release is expected in April or May for between €350 and €400. Next up is Sammy's "Dual Touch Chic" G400 flip. Both the internal (2.2-inches, QVGA) and external displays are touch-sensitive surrounded by an all-metal shell. Expect a 5 megapixel camera, FM-radio, and 100MB with microSD expansion when it launches in by May for about €300. Last up is the latest B&O hookup, albeit in a more consumer acceptable slider format. Like the i450 before it, the F400 is a dual-slider: slide the front face up to reveal a keypad, down to slip the phone into music mode with exposed B&O speakers. Otherwise, it's a 3G phone with 2.2-inch QVGA display, RDS-enabled FM radio, and microSD card when it pops in late March with a €370-€390 price tag.
