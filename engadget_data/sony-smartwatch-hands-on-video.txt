The spiritual successor to LiveView, the clippable watch detaches from the flexible watch strap. In fact, we've been told that the device can be transplanted to any watch strap. It's connected to Bluetooth through your phone -- acting as a notifier and music play as well as the capability to answer calls and check-up on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. The capacitive touchscreen ably picked up our prods, although you'll need to tap the side-button to wake the display. Thanks to the lightweight rubbery strap, it's not a chore to wear either, with several strap color options readied for launch. It's not attempting to match the resolution of your smartphone, although it plays nice with any Sony phone running Android 2.1 and above. We go wrists-on after the brea, but you can expect the device to adorn your arm some time this quarter at around $149.
