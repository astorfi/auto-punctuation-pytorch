 Verizon Wireless can be a bit sneaky at times when the word "unlimited" means "limited", so we weren't surprised to see that the CDMA carrier's PDA data and voice bundles saw price increases recently. We guess that if unlimited really means limited, price hikes are soon to follow, yes? For your reading pleasure, Verizon now limits its "unlimited" data services to 1) Internet browsing, 2) email and 3) intranet access (including access to corporate intranets, email, and individual productivity applications like customer relationship management, sales force, and field service automation). On top of that "unlimited" data transfer being capped at 5GB per month, we now have price increases for those Verizon PDA data and voice bundles. Check it: 450 minutes for $79.99 per month, 1,350 minutes for $109.99 and 4,000 minutes for $169.99 (all plans have "unlimited" data and night and weekend minutes). [Thanks, Azam I.]
