Of course, maybe we'd have all been tempted to buy more if the bargains weren't all so totally lame -- there was no way we were going out there to face the crazy murderous rush to get $5 off a 1GB flash drive or whatever. That said, sales of laptops went up 19 percent, and 30-inch and larger LCD TVs went up 18 percent, so things weren't entirely gloomy, but NPD says Black Friday might be turning into more of a showcase event rather than a blitzkrieg holiday shopping kickoff, which would be just fine with us -- don't worry, we'll still give away tons of gear. We love you, after all.
