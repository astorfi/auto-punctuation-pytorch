What immediately stands out when flipping through the user interface is the screen quality -- on par with the k790a, k800i -- and the smooth and slick animations. We had hoped for a few more notable announcements from Sony Ericsson, but will of course take what we can get. We thought it interesting to point out that one of the devices in the shots we posted last week shares some similar key design with the W660i. Follow the links for more pics by our favorite hand model, "random guy at the SE booth."
