Set for a Â¥5,000 (about $46 tax inclusive) release on October 30th in Japan along side SOCOM:CONFRONTATION, the Bluetooth 2.1+EDR headset with noise cancellation will automatically pair with your PS3, making it ready for games supporting on-line chat like SOCOM and Resistance 2 coming November 13th. The bundled USB cradle will charge the headset for up to 8-hours of voice. As a bonus, when used with the PS3 you'll be treated to on-screen indicators showing your connection status, battery charge and speaker levels and microphone mute status all at the push of a button. And for those of you wondering, yes, it should pair just fine with your cellphone since it supports both the HSP and HFP Bluetooth profiles.
