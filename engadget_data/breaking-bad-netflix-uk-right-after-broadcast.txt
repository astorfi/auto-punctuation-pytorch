Breaking Bad fans in the UK looking for instant gratification won't have to resort to the torrents anymore, as new episodes will hit Netflix in Ireland and the UK immediately after airing in the US. British viewers are accustomed to longer waits for such shows, but after broadcaster AMC worked with Netflix UK to make episodes of The Killing available sooner, the pair have now followed suit with Breaking Bad. Creator Vince Gilligan said the show has become a "phenomenon" in the countries, and added that he's "delighted" that fans there will be able to enjoy it earlier. Magnanimity aside, the move will no doubt take some of the sting out of the piracy that's inevitable with a long lag, too. Check the PR after the jump for more.
