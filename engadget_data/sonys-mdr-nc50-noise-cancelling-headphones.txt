So Sony's followed up their
noise-cancelling headphone line with
their latest and greatest, the MDR-NC50; it's supposed to cut white noise by up to 80% (maybe about 10% more than their
last goes at noise-cancelling cans), and is supposed to retail for about $200. All we're going to say is that you've
never really lived until you've used these things on a plane, seriously.
