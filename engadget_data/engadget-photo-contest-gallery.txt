We had a good seven hundred entrants (including all of you who submitted nature photos -- huh?) but we finally have a massive gallery set up with our top 120 picks. You should really check it out, Engadget readers took some really phenomenal photography -- which is exactly why we had such a difficult time deciding who should take home the prize.We did narrow it down to our top 10 favorites, though, and we're expecting you to vote for the one you think is best (we'll leave it open until the end of the day for a couple of days). As you know, the D80 is the grand prize, but because we appreciate your kind patience in getting this contest together (well, that and your fine photography), we're offering up four prizes to the runners up, listed with the voting form after the break. Big thanks to everyone who submitted, even if you weren't in the top 120! Now go get lost in all the pretty pictures.
