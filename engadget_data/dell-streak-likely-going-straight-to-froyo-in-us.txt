While we doubt AT&T's iron grip will release the Streak from the latter servitude, Dell's Lionel Menchaca suggests that the former problem may get solved all at once, because the company is considering skipping Android 2.1 altogether for stateside Streaks and upgrading them directly to the faster, more capable Android 2.2. We don't have a timeframe for a potential release, of course, as the device just went on sale, but it's clear that Dell hears your cries for the functionality Froyo brings.
