 Just two days ago we teased you with pictures, and so to celebrate September we've got the full info on the nouveau nüvi 660. It's got a 4.3-inch screen, an FM transmitter, and Bluetooth support. The 660 also includes an "integrated traffic receiver" to avoid congestion and road construction, give the driver advance voice notification of upcoming hazards, and appropriately route around it. In the US, this Total Traffic Network is included free for three months, and then will cost $60 for 15 months of service. The FM transmitter will play MP3s and phone calls over the car speakers connected via Bluetooth. In Europe, where the FM transmitter is not available, nüviheads can purchase the nüvi 610 (one of nine regional maps), or buy full European mapping with the 660. The North American version of the 660 comes with complete maps of the US, Canada and Puerto Rico, and, as always, one can load up updated maps and other media via the USB port or SD card slot. Expect it to hit U.S. retailers later this month with an MSRP of $1076.91 -- but we have no idea how Garmin came up with such a precise figure.[Via GPSLodge]
