This 15-milimeter-slim, 3G flip-less sibling ofthe P990is a dual-mode communicator bringing UMTS and tri-band GSM/GPRS with a touch-sensitve, 2.6-inch 240x320 262K colordisplay, dual-function QWERTY keyboard, RSS reader, and Bluetooth with A2DP stereo audio support for untetheredplayback of that MP3/AAC audio stored on the 80MB of internal memory or Memory Stick Microexpansion card. And like the P990, the M600 is the second SE phone to feature the Symbian 9.1 OS and UIQ 3.0 interfacewith support for a wide range of push email for business users including BlackBerry Connect, Seven, Vista, and more.Available Q2 for Europe and US in Black or White for a yet to be determined price. More pr0n after the break. [Via InfoSyncWorld, Thanks Oliver and everyone whosent this in]
