The Speedo Aquabeat -- made by Iriver -- contains 1GB of storage, plays for nine hours on one charge, come in three colors, and weighs just 35 grams. So what's so Speedo about them? These players (and earphones) are good for up to 3 meters below the surface and they float -- so you can just leave the things floating about while you go mix another margarita. Retail price is $145, available now from your local Speedo dealer or high school coach -- just listen for the whistle.
