 We hadn't heard much from Zing since Dell acquired the upstart streaming / DAP company back in August, but apparently that's about to change -- Dell has just filed to register the "Zingspot" trademark, and also registered the domain name, which either means it's about to launch a new content portal, or...nothing at all. Seriously, companies register marks and domains all the time, so this could turn out to be nothing more than a training exercise for some new lawyer -- but Dell has said that the Zing acquisition will be used to expand its "capability to provide great product experiences," so maybe this time next year we'll be trying to choose between Zings, Zunes, and iPods. Or, again, maybe not.[Via Trademork]
