 
Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars is Nintendo's first cross-buy game, meaning anyone who buys it on 3DS gets the Wii U version as well, and those who buy it for Wii U get the 3DS version. Tipping Stars is due out on March 5.

The 3DS is consistently Nintendo's best-selling console, while the Wii U is historically slower to sell, though a rush of acclaimed games near the end of 2014 did boost sales.

Nintendo announced Tipping Stars and its cross-buy nature during today's Nintendo Direct, which included the announcement of a new 3DS, a new Fire Emblem game, Wii games on Wii U and much more.
