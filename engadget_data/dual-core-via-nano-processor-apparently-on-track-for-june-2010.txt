Unfortunately, there's not much more to go on than what's in the image, though we're sure plenty of folks will be relieved to learn that the processor will, in fact, boast "new process technology," not to mention "further performance enhancement." What's more, as you can see, it looks like the first samples will be available by December of next year, which mostly lines up with what we had heard previously, while mass production will apparently get underway in June of 2010.
