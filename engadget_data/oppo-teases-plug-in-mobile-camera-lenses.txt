The extent of Oppo's mobile photography efforts is quickly becoming clear: the company just used Sina Weibo to tease a new series of plug-in camera lenses for its smartphones. The initial range will use 16-megapixel Sony CMOS sensors with optical image stabilization, and they will also have a degree of support for NFC, SD cards and WiFi. Buyers will only have to choose between a thin lens with 10X zoom and a thicker, 15X variant. While Oppo isn't yet ready to disclose launch details for the add-ons, we won't be surprised if we hear more about them at the company's N1 smartphone event on September 23rd.
