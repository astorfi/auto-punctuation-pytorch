 According to new reports, Woolworths is following the wave and will be banishing HD DVD players from its stores starting in March. Reportedly, the move was substantiated by the fact that Blu-ray Discs outsold HD DVD titles "ten-to-one" in Woolies stores over the Christmas holidays, and in just a few weeks, consumers scouting a new HD DVD player from this particular retailer will have to place their order online. Interestingly, we're not told whether or not the firm plans on phasing out actual HD DVD movies as well, but we suppose we don't have long before finding out.[Via GamesIndustry, image courtesy of Stives-Town]
