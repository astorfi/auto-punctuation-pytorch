Today, the outfit has formally introduced its first partners in crime: Ingram Digital (e-books), LibreDigital (e-newspapers), Zinio (e-magazines) and a direct relationship with Financial Times and USA Today. We're also told that prospective buyers (you know, ones that skip out on Amazon's hot 'n fresh Kindle 2) can expect an e-content store where readers can download all sorts of engrossing material. Speaking of which, the company has also announced the simply-titled Publishers' Program, which is completely "open" and designed for content creators, publishers and content aggregators to "create, format, sell and distribute content for easy viewing and use on the Plastic Logic Reader." More details are, of course, tucked away in the read links below.Read - Content partnersRead - Publishers' Program
