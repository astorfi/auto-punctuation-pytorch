Apparently the joke is on anyone still waiting for this box; while the $999 price hasn't changed, it is now expected to ship "on or about December 4, 2006". In light of the previous July, August, and October prognostications, the Playstation 3 shortage, battery fiasco, and even a just-announced delay of the LF-Box1 LocationFree TV streamer, Sony's manufacturing prowess seems to be slipping. Some customers who contacted Sony have reported that those who have already ordered the BDP-S1 might receive shipments before December, but these days you can't really take anything for granted.[Via AVS Forum]
