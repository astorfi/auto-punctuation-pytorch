Moving around the clock starting at the lower lower-left in the image above, we've got the $149.99 SSG-2100AB, $199.99 SSG-2200AR, and pink and blue $179.99 SSG-2200KR for kids or hipsters with tiny tiny heads. The latter two models feature rechargeable batteries unlike the battery-powered SSG-2100AB. All are up for pre-order on Amazon, and will have you puttering about the third dimension in no time... just as soon as a release date is announced.
