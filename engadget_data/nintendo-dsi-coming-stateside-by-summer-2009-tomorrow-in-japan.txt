That's a whole lot better than "well into" 2009 if you ask us. Meanwhile, Japan gets theirs starting Saturday for Â¥18,900 or about $192 tax-inclusive -- that's up from $178 earlier this month thanks to a skyrocketing Yen. Nintendo has already shipped 200,000 of the slimmer, dual-cam handheld consoles in preparation for weekend sales with another 100,000 planned for the following week. Clearly there's no such thing as an economic slowdown in the land that Mario built.
