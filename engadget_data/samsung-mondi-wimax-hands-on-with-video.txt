Samsung's SWD-M100 MID runs Windows Mobile -- and we have to say that it looks really polished -- with the transitions between homescreen panels being particularly stunning -- check the vid to see it in action. While thin, the popout lower lip keypad is a tough thing to use, the width of the keypad itself and the positioning of the d-pad make it all seem a bit awkward to use. We do like the 4.3-inch display, though suspect it may prove to be a tad power hungry once this gets a little more real on Clear's WiMAX network. Follow on for a short vid and a handful of pics of us playing with this big glossy thing.
