While the Verizon phone is still a bit iffy, the T-Mobile offering seems to almost certainly be the Motorola Morrision which, as you can see above, is already pretty well acquainted with T-Mo branding. According to one of those people familiar with the matter, Verizon's Moto phone will have "similar hardware to the T-Mobile one," including a touchscreen and a slide-out keyboard, which doesn't exactly rule out Motorola's rumored Calgary slider, even if "similar" isn't the first word that springs to mind when discussing the two.[Via Electronista]
