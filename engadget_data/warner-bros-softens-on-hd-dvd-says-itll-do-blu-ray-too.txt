October is shaping up to be a cruel month for Toshiba and the rest of the HD DVD gang. Last week
Paramount confirmed that they were softening their support
for HD DVD and would be releasing movies in both HD DVD and Blu-ray, now a Japanese newspaper reports that Warner
Bros., which had been firmly pledged to HD DVD, will announce that they're going to offer movies on both formats, as
well (there was a rumor going around last week that this was in the works). That means there's only one major studio
left — Universal — which is still publicly committed to releasing movies only in HD DVD, and even they're starting to
waver. At this point it's Blu-ray's race to lose.
