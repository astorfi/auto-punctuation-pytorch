Oliver Wyman, an international management consulting firm, reportedly surveyed some 2,000 US consumers and found that "a price point between $7 and $9 is optimal for the next generation of video-on-demand VOD and internet movie rentals." In other words, respondents confirmed that they would pay up to $9 per HD VOD film if they could have instant access on the day-and-date of the title's DVD release. Granted, we recognize that consumers will indeed pay more for convenience, but still, $9 just seems extraordinarily steep at the moment. It should be noted, however, that the same study did find that consumers would likely pay a small premium for packaged media that included a Digital Copy (or similar) -- that we actually can wrap our heads around.
