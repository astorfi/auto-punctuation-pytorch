 Brits who ground their fingers to stumps hammering their Lumia's update button will finally be able to rest, as Nokia UK has confirmed that Windows 7.8 is rolling out today. The company has also revealed O2's pricing for the Lumia 620, the handset that'll bring Windows Phone 8 to the cash-strapped masses. It's available from today on the oxygen-themed network, setting you back £149.99 or free on contracts priced over £18.50. Normally, the interchangeable back plates would cost around £20, but O2 is offering buyers a choice of a yellow, orange, green, white or cyan model for free.

 You'll also be able to pick up the quirky handset from ThreeUK and Virgin Media today, although neither has opened up about pricing just yet. Vodafone has announced that it'll launch the phone on February 6th with a choice of white or black covers, while EE has yet to commit to carrying the handset. If you saw removable covers and hoped that the 620 would benefit from the same wireless charging plates we saw in the 820, we've got some bad news -- Nokia has said it's not likely to happen.
