If you've been jonesing to snag the new Kinect sensor for Windows, you can now get one -- well, almost. Microsoft has just made its latest Kinect for Windows available for pre-order for only $199 with the promise of shipment by July 2014 if you do so while supplies last. The idea behind the early release is to give developers a head start on building applications for the latest v2 technology, though there's nothing stopping regular consumers from getting in on the action as well. As a reminder, the new Kinect for Windows promises improved depth sensing, a wider field of view, 1080p resolution and more. So if you're tired of the Xbox One getting all the Kinect love, feel free to see what the Windows version has to offer at the source link below.
