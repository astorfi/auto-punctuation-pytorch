We already got word from Nokia about some new Windows Phone features that'd be trickling out in a forthcoming update, and Microsoft has now filled in some more details on what other phone users can expect. In addition to FM radio support, an update said to be coming to Windows Phone 8 devices "later this summer" will add the previously-promised support for CalDAV and CardDAV to ensure your phone will continue to work with Google's new sync protocols. Otherwise, you can look for the company's Data Sense feature to support more carriers (no word on specific ones yet, though), and also expect some minor tweaks to Xbox Music. We'll keep you posted if we hear more about a specific rollout date.
