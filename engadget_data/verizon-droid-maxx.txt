Fans of Kevlar and long battery life will be happy to hear that Verizon unveiled its latest Maxx, the Droid Maxx, this morning in New York City, and it sports a massive 48-hour battery life. It's apparently 9 percent thinner than last year's counterpart, the RAZR Maxx HD, and it starts at $299 (with the standard two-year contract, naturally) on August 20th. Specifics about which CPU and GPU being used weren't given, though the latest Maxx is reportedly 24 percent faster in the CPU department and 100 percent faster in terms of graphics processing (all on a single SoC, it sounds like). It also features a 10-megapixel camera out back that's capable of shooting 1080p HD video.


The new Maxx was unveiled alongside the Droid Mini and Ultra, effectively replacing the RAZR line that debuted last fall. All three new phones come pre-loaded with Google's VR game Ingress, and seemingly all run on Motorola's newly announced X8 computing system. We're still waiting on more detailed specs, but we'll have a hands-on directly from the NYC event coming up shortly.


Update 1: Reps at the event tell our on-site staff that the Maxx has a 5-inch screen, and a press release from VZW says it has wireless charging and a 3500mAh battery. Additionally, it can apparently be woken on voice command by saying, "Ok Google Now."

Update 2: And now we've got full specs: a 1.7 GHz dual-core CPU with quad-core graphics powers the Maxx, with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory rounding out the list. It's an LTE-enabled phone (naturally) and weighs just under five ounces. Software-wise, it runs Android Jelly Bean 4.2.
