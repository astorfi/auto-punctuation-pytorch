If you're going to hold something in your hand for over 8 hours a day and have it part of your desk landscape, it
should at least be nice too look atâ€”and if you're lucky, functional, too. We're talking about the humble computer
mouse; specifically, the new Microsoft optical mouse designed by Philippe Starck, which we had a chance to take for a
test drive.



As we mentioned back in June, Philippe Starck hasworked up a USB optical mouse for Microsoft that cunningly hides a scroll wheel in the coloured line that bisects itand includes the requisite two buttons. Comes in two colors, Blue and Orange, and when plugged in it lights up.  After 2 days of use, we?re pretty impressed?accurate, fast and looks great. Best part, it matches the silvery finisheson our PowerBook and Sony VAIO.

 
 Nice packaging, a rare treat with Microsoft goods.

 
 Glowing blue with silvery plastic case.

 
 
 Orange model.
