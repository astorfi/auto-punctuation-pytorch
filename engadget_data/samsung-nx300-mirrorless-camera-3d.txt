 TVs and robotic vacuums aren't the only Smart-branded devices Samsung will be showing off at this year's CES. We just met with the company here in NYC to take a look at its newest entrant into the camera game, dubbed the NX300. No, it's not Android-equipped, but this 20.3-megapixel, APS-C shooter stands as its new flagship mirrorless model. It boasts the key gimmick feature of 3D capability for stills and videos (up to 1080p at 60fps), thanks to a new DRIMe IV processor.

 Getting the usual numbers aside, you'll be able to harness an ISO range of 100 to 25600, a maximum shutter speed of 1,6000 and a top speed of 8.6fps for JPG bursts. On back, you'll find a 3.31-inch, 768 dot AMOLED touch-display, and a d-pad-esque section with five buttons for manual control. Lastly, there's a dedicated mode dial on the top, along with a full-size hot shoe mount. This shooter is also WiFi-enabled like previous cameras in the range, allowing you to share content wirelessly, and giving you access to apps like a remote viewfinder that works with iOS and Android devices. Notably, the NX300 packs a hybrid phase / contrast-detection sensor or peppy auto-focusing as well.

 Having a new NX that can handle 3D naturally calls for a lens that can shoot it, and a 2D/3D-capable f/1.8 45mm lens was also shown to us -- a "world-first," according to Sammy. While you won't be able to shoot in 3D with older NX cameras (we're told they don't have the processing power), it'll still work as regular 2D lens if you're interested in its focal perspective. We spent a few fleeting moments with an engineering sample of the camera in-hand, so join us past the break for more. 



 
 The camera as a whole feels solid, yet lightweight -- the grip follows the same form-factor as previous NX imagers, but it's slightly chunkier feeling, and easier to grasp for this editor. The screen itself was quickly responsive to our touches, fairly easy to see under light (there's no option for an add-on viewfinder) and its tilting worked smoothly and stayed in place. All that said, a Samsung representative let us know that the firmware we saw wasn't final and, you guessed it, that we wouldn't be able to grab any photos out of the camera for further inspection. Also worth note, the camera charges via micro-USB like Sony's NEX-6, so an external battery charger won't be included in the package.

 The NX300 is slated to cost $750 with a 20-50mm kits lens and a copy of Adobe Lightroom, while the 2D/3D lens will set you back a spendy $600 $500 -- all of which come in your choice of white or black. Everything is set to ship out this March, so hit up the galleries below and the press release below for more information now.

 Update: Samsung let us know the original $600 price given for the 2D/3D lens was incorrect, and that it'll instead be priced at $500. Furthermore, we've been asked to replace the initial batch of press images we were given with updated versions that more closely reflect the final products.
