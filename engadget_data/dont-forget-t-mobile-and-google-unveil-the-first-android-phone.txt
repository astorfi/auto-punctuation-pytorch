 
Just a reminder, we're going to be at the Android and T-Mobile event tomorrow morning, so be sure and set your alarms. You can (finally) expect the big unveil of the first commercially available Android device (we don't want to ruin it, but it's going to be the G1 -- or Dream as we used to call it). We wanted to give you another heads up so you'll know where and when it's going down.
