A similar discount was apparently going on at Buy.com last week, so we're not sure what it all means, but we suppose it could mean that Microsoft might possibly be moving toward a lower price for the subscription (don't hold your breath). We don't really know "why" or "how" this has happened, but it "rules" and we're looking forward to all the extra cash our avatar's going to have in the coming year for new hats and fingerless gloves.
