It looks like at long last Sling Media's readying their SlingPlayer Mac version (perhaps for WWDC launch next month?), as they've opened it up for private beta over the next two weeks. So if you have a high tolerance for pain and are tired of putting up with running the Windows SlingPlayer client in Parallels, your moment may have arrived. Whereas we can't guarantee anyone will be granted entry to the beta program, you can at least rest assured knowing that we're undoubtedly only weeks away now from the proper Mac client launch -- and with a bit of luck maybe they won't charge us for the player software this time around.[Thanks, Dave & Ron]
