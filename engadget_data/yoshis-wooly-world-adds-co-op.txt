Though the the game is helmed by the team behind the adorable Kirby's Epic Yarn, Yoshi's upcoming Wii U adventure is not a simple follow-up to that game's ideas. Yoshi's Wooly World will emphasize exploration, utilizing the yarn world and Yoshi's abilities to give players an opportunity to investigate every fluffy element of the environment.
