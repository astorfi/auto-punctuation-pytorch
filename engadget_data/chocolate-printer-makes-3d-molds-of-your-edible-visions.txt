Well, it looks like a bunch of folks across the pond caught on and decided to throw a little cocoa powder into the mix. Funded by the Research Councils UK's Digital Economy program with oversight by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, as well as being led by the University of Exeter, the University of Brunel and software developer Delcam -- talk about too many cooks -- the tech that previously brought metal and plastic products to life is getting a chocoholic makeover. Using specially designed temperature and heating controls, the printer takes uploaded 3D CAD designs and turns them into the stuff of your sweet toothed dreams. Although you won't be seeing this printer at a boutique near you, there are plans for a made-to-order retail site that'll let you contribute homemade creations or modify someone else's. We understand if this gets your Valentine's anticipating heart all aflutter, but please don't make any actual chocolate hearts -- that's just gross.
