 NewTechnologyTV.com has an article about plasma's being the reigning king of HDTVs. We tend to agree with that statement, but are curous to know what you think. Plasma do offer a great picture at reasonable sizes and price. Sure, LCDs tend to be more versitale and can be made in different sizes but they do not offer the same type of picture quality that a plasma does. DLP is great technolodgy to make a very large high-def picture but again, does not offer a better picture then a quality plasma does. CRTs, a long time favorite, can produce a better picture then plasmas but top off at 34-inches; cannot be the king and be that small. What do you folks think? Is NewTechnologyTV.com and us off our rockers today?
