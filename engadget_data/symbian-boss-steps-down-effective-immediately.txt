 Citing "personal reasons," the Symbian Foundation has just announced that executive director Lee Williams has left the company -- yes, "left," as in he's not going to stick around for a while to manage a transition. Williams has been steeped in Symbian for some time, having previously led Nokia's S60 business -- but the dude's been floating around the upper ranks of the entire mobile industry for ages, doing time with Motorola (through its Symbol acquisition) and Palm / PalmSource by way of Be. He's been replaced by the organization's reigning CFO, Tim Holbrow, and it appears that the appointment is permanent; what this means for Symbian's roadmap (if anything) is unclear, but we'd love to hear the backstory on what led to this power shift. More on the situation as we get it.
