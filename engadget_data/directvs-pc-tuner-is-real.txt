The HDPC-20 is a dual tuner device that connects via USB to your PC and allows you to record and watch DirecTV programming on your computer -- and curiously includes an Ethernet port. It supports Vista Media center, but also appears to work with the regular flavor of Windows. What might be the best news is that from what we have here, there is no indication that it will have a OEM requirement like its cable equivalent. There isn't any word on price or availability, but after two years of waiting, we'll find a way to hold on for a little while longer till this thing hits the streets.Picture of the rear and more details after the jump.
