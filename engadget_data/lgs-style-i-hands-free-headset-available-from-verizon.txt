 LG's Style-i, theBluetooth cellphone accessory that took the "hands-free" out "of "hands-free headset," is nowavailable exclusively from Verizon, and for a little cheaper than the $150 we originally reported. As you'll no doubtrecall from our original mocking write-up of the Style-i, this Haier P7-lookalike is designed for the same purposeas other Bluetooth headsets -- to let you make calls while your phone is charging or in a bag -- but without theconvenience of, you know, freeing up your hands. Actually, LG almost had us sold on this $130 product until we foundout that you can't daisy-chain two of them together -- how are you supposed to pick up a call if both your phone andfirst Style-i are charging simultaneously?[Thanks, Brett]
