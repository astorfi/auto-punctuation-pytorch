Soon after going into orbit around Saturn, the Cassini space probe returned its best look yet at the heavily
cratered moon Mimas (which has a diameter of 398 kilometers, 247 miles across). The enormous crater at the top of this
image, named Herschel, is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) wide and 10 kilometers (6 miles) deep, and has earned Mimas
the nickname "The Death Star".
