It assuredly caused more than a few raised eyebrows, not the least of which from Fujifilm itself. In an interesting and welcoming move, the company invited the publication to a face-to-face meeting -- not for some physical redemption, mind you, but to address all the points of disappointment. There isn't a lot said to alleviate concerns, and the common thread among all replies is pretty much that this is a new field that currently caters to a very small niche, and there's gonna be speed bumps for time to come -- in other words, better luck next time. Still, it's somewhat refreshing to see a major company tackle the subject head-on and in public view -- now if only we could make this an industry-wide trend.
