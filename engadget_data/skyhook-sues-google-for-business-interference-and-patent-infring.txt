And let's face it, as an Engadget reader, you are. Now the company is suing Google for anti-competitive practices and patent infringement claiming that the ad giant used its control over Android to "force device manufacturers" to not only integrate Google's location technology instead of Skyhook's "superior end user experience," but also terminate contract obligations with Skyhook where they existed. Specifically, Skyhook says that Google wielded its power against handset manufacturers by "threatening directly or indirectly to deny timely and equal access to evolving versions of the Android operating system and other Google mobile applications." Boston-based Skyhook filed two lawsuits after negotiations with Google broke down, a business interference lawsuit filed in the Massachusetts Superior Court and a patent infringement lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts. According to Skyhook CEO Ted Morgan, "The message that Android is open is certainly not entirely true. Devices makers can license technology from other companies and then not be able to deploy it."
