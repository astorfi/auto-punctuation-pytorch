That latter development was apparently the result of a long-standing dispute with farmers, who are demanding the return of some of the land that was seized by the state government, and had previously caused construction of the plant to be postponed for five days. For its part, Tata says it is now apparently considering relocating the construction site, which would likely cause the planned October launch of the Nano to be delayed.Read - Reuters, "India's Tata to launch electric car in Norway in 1 yr"Read - Tech-On, "Tata Suspends Construction of 'nano' Plant"[Thanks, Samit]
