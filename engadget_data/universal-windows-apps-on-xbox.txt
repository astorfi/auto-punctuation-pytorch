Many were expecting to see universal Windows apps in the Build 2014 keynote, and they have. However, Microsoft had a surprise in store -- you'll eventually see those universal apps running on the Xbox One, too. Developers will get to write apps for Windows and Windows Phone that translate to a TV screen with relatively little effort. The company hasn't said exactly when you'll see these multi-platform apps pop up on your game console, but we're hoping they appear sooner rather than later.
