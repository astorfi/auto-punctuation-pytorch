HBO Go is en route to PlayStation. While there isn't a release window for the premium service's streaming app, Sony's VP of business development assures it'll be "soon" for the PS3, with the PS4 version to follow. However, we do know that as with other streaming services on the platforms (including Amazon Instant Video and Netflix), the app's functionality won't be locked behind a paywall, like it is on Sony's biggest console rival.
