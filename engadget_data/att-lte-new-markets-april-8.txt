   Muncie. Bloomington. Bryan-College Station. If you're in one of these three markets, get ready to party hard, because AT&T LTE is officially lighting up in your neck of the woods on April 8th. If you recall, there are nine previously announced markets still on deck waiting for their turn to bathe in the faster network, but AT&T is holding strong to its promise of an arrival "by early summer." For all of you getting it on Sunday, just make sure you party responsibly Saturday night, kay?
