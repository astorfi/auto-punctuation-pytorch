There's really not much else to say about this unit other than our standard dose of fanboyishness. The thing was built out of a standard Super Nintendo, an LED-backlit PSONe display and a whole bunch of love -- that wooden case is all custom. Suffice it to say: we want. Video of it in action after the break.[Via technabob]
