Going by the oh-so-swanky moniker of MPC-505BD, this Intel Viiv enabled monster offers DVI and HDMI (HDCP?) outs, 7.1 channel audio with SPDIF optical out, and a hybrid analog and digital DVB-T TV tuner. And if that 23GB of single-layer BD recording don't cut it son, then how about the 120 hours of high-def recording possible on that full Terabyte of SATA disk? Yeah, we thought you'd like that. The box is powered by a 3GHz Intel Pentium D 930 and features Intel 945P Express graphics, 2GB DDR2 RAM, and 802.11a/b/g WiFi. Sadly, no deets on the expected biggie price tag or date for availability but let's hope an ATSC tuner version is in the works for these here United States. [Via Newlaunches]
