We thought they might be done after the S500 announcement, but it would appear that Sony Ericsson wanted to torment us with a series of new devices -- none with 3G love for over here, naturally. First off we have the P1 (n√©e the P700i) which is a tri-band Euro-UMTS jobby (that's 2100 MHz) with a touchscreen, QWERTY keyboard, and push mail in both Microsoft and BlackBerry flavors. Next up, the T250 which is an intro level candybar style phone with a VGA camera and FM radio that will arrive in two different versions, with a 850 / 1900 likely being aimed at the US market. Also on the roster is the T650, yet another tri-band handset with 2100 MHz UMTS, a 3.2 megapixel camera, stereo Bluetooth. Finally -- something that is useful the world over -- the HBH-DS980 stereo Bluetooth headset. It seems this new set is mostly a cosmetic upgrade from the DS970, with the same reflective treatment as the Z610i, 6 hours talk time or music time, and an OLED display that is hidden by the units reflective finish until it is powered on. Very little else here, folks (aside from some pretty bitter disappointment at getting 3G-snubbed yet again), but as soon as we get some decent pics and specs, you know you will find them right here.[Images of T250 and T650 via SE-NSE]
