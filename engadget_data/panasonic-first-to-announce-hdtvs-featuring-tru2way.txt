We hope this will revitalize CableCARD, which had been dropped from just about every manufacture's lineup. The big difference this time around is that now your CableCARD enabled HDTV can take advantage of VOD and PPV. But before you get any bright ideas that your home media experience will drastically improve, keep in mind that these sets will run about the same software that your cable box does in what is known as the miracle of OCAP.
