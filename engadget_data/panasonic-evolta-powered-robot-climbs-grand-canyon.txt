For your consideration, Panasonic's offered up a small 7-inch robot powered by EVOLTA AA cells, which willingly participated in a nearly seven hour rope climb of more than 1,700 vertical feet of sheer Grand Canyon expanse. Fine, we get it Panasonic, EVOLTA batteries last a while -- now you can stop putting adorable little robots in harm's way to prove it.[Via Pink Tentacle]
