 "Lower-mid end of the lineup... decent specs... aggressively priced." Not exactly the descriptors which dreams are made of, but that's the wording BGR is using to describe its other leaked BlackBerry device today (Dakota being the other). A 480 x 360 resolution screen of unknown size, 800MGhz Tavor MG-1 CPU, 512MB RAM, a 5 megapixel camera with HD video recording, 1050 mAh battery, 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 2.1, NFC, GPS, and BlackBerry OS 6.1 to put everything in check. It all serves quad-band GSM / GPRS / EDGE and tri-band UMTS / HSPA 7.2Mbps. The keyboard, we'd assume, is pretty darn snappy. The price and release date, should this apparent leak come to fruition, is still unknown.
