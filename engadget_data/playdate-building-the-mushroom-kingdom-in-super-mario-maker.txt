A lot of games are about wish fulfilment, but what if your dream is to make Nintendo games? Well, now there's a game for that, too: Super Mario Maker -- a video game creation suite that's exactly what it sounds like.

Join me and Tim Seppala for an ad hoc remodelling of the Mushroom Kingdom, starting at 6PM ET (3PM PT) on Twitch.tv/Joystiq, on the Engadget gaming homepage or right here in this post.
