The kids at Digital Photography Review have got their hands on the thing and have been kind enough to give us an extensive review. Rocking a Four Thirds imaging sensor, HD-video mode (with stereo sound recording), a multi-aspect sensor, and a video-optimized lens, the camera is essentially the G1 with HD-video, according to the review. Not that that's a bad thing, especially when noting that it has "the best implementation of video on a 'non-compact camera' that we've seen so far." Among the camera's strong points are its resolution, size and weight, build quality, image stabilization, and shutter-speed simulation. Still the reviewer didn't look kindly upon the camera's relatively small amount of RAW headroom, fairly low powered flash, poor battery life, and a loud shutter sound for a non-SLR camera. But overall? If you need a camera that performs admirably with video, and are willing to pay the $1500 premium, the GH1 comes highly recommended.
