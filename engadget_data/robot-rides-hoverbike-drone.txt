Oh, that? It's just a robot riding across the English countryside on a 1/3-scale model of a hoverbike. The folks at Malloy Aeronautics are hard at work on a similar full-sized vehicle for humans, but as part of its Kickstarter effort to raise funds for the project, a smaller version is offered to backers. What was originally a proof of concept piece is now a fully-operational aerial drone, and can be yours if you're willing to part with around $1,000 (Â£595) in support of the endeavor. For now, just enjoy watching that tiny robot take flight in your stead, just after the break.
