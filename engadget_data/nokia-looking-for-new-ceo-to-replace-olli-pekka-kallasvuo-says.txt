Investor confidence and falling stock prices are to blame as the company has had -- and we're being nice here -- great difficulty competing in the smartphone market against the likes of Apple and Google. Espoo isn't commenting on the matter (yet), but we'll keep you up to date. Better start updating that resume now, dear reader.
