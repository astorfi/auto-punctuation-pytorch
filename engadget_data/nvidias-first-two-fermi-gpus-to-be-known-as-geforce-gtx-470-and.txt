 Don't get too excited, we don't have specs or release windows yet, but we do have hilariously inflated model names to share with you. NVIDIA's all-new graphics architecture, commonly known as Fermi and recently re-coded as the GF100, has its first two commercial product names -- the GeForce GTX 470 and GTX 480 -- which as you'll have noticed skip right past the 300s and nearly double the model numbers of the company's current gen offerings. Let's just hope the performance lives up to such a blusterous naming scheme.
