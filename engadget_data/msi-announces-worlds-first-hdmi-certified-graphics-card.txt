    To be honest, we weren't really aware of the existence of such certification, or that it was lacking in most graphics cards, but MSI is parading around their new shiny gold star they just received from the HDMI Authorized Testing Center (ATC) in regards to their new NVIDIA-based NX7600GT Diamond Plus. They're claiming to have received the first such certification for an HDMI graphics card, which means their card matches certain standards for compatibility and stability that will allow it to play nice with all the other HDMI kids. Apparently HDCP is in full effect here as well, so there shouldn't be any problems with that end of standard support. MSI's card also offers some D.O.T. II overclocking performance along with all that compatibility, but we're not sure on price or availability of the new card.
