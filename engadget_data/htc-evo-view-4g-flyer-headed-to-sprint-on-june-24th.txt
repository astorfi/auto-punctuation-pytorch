If the grab above, nabbed from Sprint's internal Rewards Me site is to be believed, then we've got 7-inches of WiMax-loving Android tablet headed our way in three weeks time. Smack in the middle of the promised summer ship date. It's also a good bet that we'll be seeing the EVO 3D at about this time too. Anyone taking odds?

[Thanks, tipster]
