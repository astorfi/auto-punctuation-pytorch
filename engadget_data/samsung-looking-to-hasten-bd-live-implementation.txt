 It's no secret that BD Live functionality hasn't been the standout feature that we had all hoped for, as a majority of the current players on shelves now don't even sport all the necessary equipment to fully take advantage, but it sounds like Samsung is hoping to change all that by getting serious with interactive niceties. In an admittedly poor translation of Korean, a recent report outlines Samsung's desire to "commercialize" BD Live "by the end of the year," aiming to get downloadable content and internet-enabled services to the end user before we all forget about this once hyped technology. Apparently, the firm is already in talks with major Blu-ray disc producers such as Sony, Disney, 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., and Paramount, and there was also hints that broadening the appeal of BD Live could indeed help Blu-ray gain an edge over HD DVD. Now we just hope that its second-generation lineup doesn't do something awkward like not offer up full support of BD Live, alright Sammy?
