As you can see in the gallery over at Engadget HD, the larger of the two were actually mounted up on swing-arms in the outfit's CEDIA booth, essentially acting as monitors for watching TV / playing PS3. The small guy didn't do a whole lot for us, but the two hung up on the wall were pretty svelte. See for yourself, won't you?
