That includes the first official pictures of the device with T-Mobile branding, and details on some of the phone's specs, including the somewhat interesting tidbit that while the Vibrant "benefits from enhanced speeds with T-Mobile's HSPA+ network," it is "not an HSPA+ device." Otherwise, T-Mobile has simply confirmed that the phone will indeed come with Android 2.1, and that it of course packs a 1GHz Samsung Hummingbird processor and that standout 4.0-inch Super AMOLED display. Still no official word on a launch date just yet, but T-Mobile is promising to share at least a few more details when its countdown reaches zero late tonight.
