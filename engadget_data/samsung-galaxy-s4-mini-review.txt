Despite how the saying goes, bigger isn't always better -- and that's especially true in the mobile industry, where companies have produced smartphones with larger and larger screens. While that does seem to be the latest trend, a few manufacturers haven't forgotten that there are a ton of smartphone users out there who prefer using something that actually fits in the palm of their hand. Unfortunately, those folks don't have a flagship Android device to call their own, but Samsung is hopeful that its latest 4.3-inch beauty, the Galaxy S4 Mini, will at least suffice as a solid middle-tier option. But will shoppers be bothered by the fact that it lacks many of the top-end components we enjoy on devices like the Samsung GS4? Our friends at Negri Electronics, who are selling the device for $520, were kind enough to let us have some one-on-one time with the petite handset. Read on to get our take.



Hardware
Since the Galaxy S4 Mini bears the same name as the flagship device released earlier this year, it should simply be a miniaturized version, right? Not so fast. While the Mini -- which comes in both black and white color options -- possesses many of the same traits as its elder sibling, they're mostly related to external design and basic firmware. On the outside, the family resemblance is obvious. The front features a camera on the top-right corner, with a hardware home button on the bottom flanked by two capacitive keys (menu and back), while the back houses the 8-megapixel camera and LED flash in the same vertical arrangement as on the GS4. The sides are essentially the same, with the micro-USB port on the bottom, volume rocker on the left, power button on the right and headphone jack / IR blaster up top. It also takes advantage of the same build techniques as the GS4, which means you're once again getting a polycarbonate construction and checkerboard pattern.In terms of hardware, that's ultimately where the commonalities cease. As you'd expect, the 4.3-inch Mini is much easier to handle than anything with a 5-inch screen or larger. After reviewing so many big smartphones, we find it a little weird to switch back to a device that our fingers can actually wrap around. At 124.6 x 61.3 x 8.9 mm, it's shorter, narrower and thicker than the GS4, but all of these measurements lead to more rounded edges and a stronger grip as a result. In humid climates, this actually comes in quite handy, as the slippery contours of the phone would make it much easier to pop right out of our sweaty hands -- an issue we sometimes encountered with the GS4. It's also incredibly light, weighing in at just 3.77 ounces (107g).Underneath the 1,900mAh battery, you'll find a micro-SIM slot and a microSD reader -- the latter on top of the former -- which is a change from the GS4's layout (the two slots were set apart from each other and could be accessed without yanking out the battery). Under the hood is a dual-core 1.7GHz Snapdragon 400, a clear downgrade from any of the original GS4's chipset options. NFC, Bluetooth, IR and WiFi are all included as well, though 802.11ac isn't an option here. The Mini also features a scant 8GB of internal storage, which doesn't leave much room for your own personal enjoyment, especially after you take into account both the OS and Samsung's TouchWiz UI.


The model we reviewed was the I9195, which is the LTE version (it also comes in dual-SIM and 3G-only variants). It sports bands 3, 7 and 20 (800 / 1800 / 2600), which are primarily used in Europe and other countries around the world. You'll also get quad-band HSPA+ (850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100) with speeds up to 42 Mbps. GSM / EDGE (850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900) is also part of the deal, ensuring that North American users / travelers will get somewhat decent data speeds.One of our biggest hardware gripes is the lackluster 4.3-inch Super AMOLED display with qHD (960 x 540) resolution, which translates to a pixel density of 256 pixels per inch. Needless to say, this is a considerable drop in quality from the GS4, whose screen resolution is a full 1080p. The majority of the phone's other specs are at least somewhat enticing for most average users, so we're not sure why Samsung chose to cut corners in this department (just for comparison, the HTC One mini features a 720p S-LCD3 display). Unless the company just had a bunch of stockpiled qHD panels it was trying to get rid of; that would sort of make sense, given that the Galaxy S4 Zoom also uses the same display.Fortunately, there's a silver lining here. Despite the lack of sharpness and resolution, the display at least offers above-average viewing angles and is moderately easy to read at full brightness in direct sunlight (though we can't say the same when you turn the brightness setting down).
