Samsung's refreshed NX300M smart camera has already been on sale for more than a month in Korea, but only now is one of its features coming to light. At a recent developer summit, the company confirmed that the 20.3-megapixel shooter is actually running a camera-focused build of its open-source Tizen software. Samsung has relied on Android for some of its cameras so far, but has also quietly released Tizen-powered developer tablets and ported the OS to the Galaxy S4, showing off what it can do without Google's help. To that same end, Nokia announced today it will power "maps-related functionalities" in future Tizen devices, giving Samsung (and its partners) a chance to further reduce its dependency on Google services.
