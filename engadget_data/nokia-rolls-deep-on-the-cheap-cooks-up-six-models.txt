Nokia has a history of going after emerging economies with the occasional barrage of models, and the latest round ups the game with features we'd be totally cool with seeing on your average "mature market" handset -- goodies like integrated flashlights, sturdy lanyards, and a vaguely-defined "Nokia Life Tools" service that delivers relevant information in a graphical interface to phones via SMS (the logic being that GPRS isn't always available where these phones are going to be used). The most expensive device of the lot will be the 5130 XpressMusic, the first music-centric Nokia destined for low-income areas of the world with an integrated FM radio, 2-megapixel cam, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Next up we've got the fancy 7100 Supernova, joining Nokia's fashion-friendly line in a couple tasty colors with a 1.3-megapixel cam. If we skip all the way to the bottom, we have the lowly 1202, a rugged-looking little monochrome beast with an extended battery, a five-user phonebook to make it easy to pass around the whole family, and extra-loud ringtones -- and at 25 euros, it's Nokia's lowest-cost phone ever. Why do we want one really badly? Are we crazy? Look for all six of these to start filtering around the globe between now and early 2009.
