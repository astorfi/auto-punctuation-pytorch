You heard right -- this handset sports a five-megapixel camera (complete with Carl Zeiss lens and a Xenon flash), WiFi, Bluetooth, integrated GPS, 3G connectivity, Nokia Music Store access and automatic screen rotation. Regrettably, there's still no word on a price / release date, but click on through for a couple more angles, and check out what the built-in camera can do in the read link.[Thanks, pdexter]
