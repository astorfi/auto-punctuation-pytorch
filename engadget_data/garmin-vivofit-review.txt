Keep moving. That's the message you'll get from anyone offering up fitness advice these days. It's snappy, simple and probably quite valid. The problem is that it can be hard to quantify how much activity is merely part of our basic existential requirements before we get to the part that counts as extra, life-enhancing exercise. As always, technology to the rescue. On this occasion, it's an activity tracker from a company with heritage in this space: Garmin. The product? The Vivofit fitness tracker.



There's been a deluge of similar products lately, each bringing their own take. This is clearly a hot market right now, and the race is on to crack it. Can Garmin use its wealth of experience in wrist-worn fitness devices to set the standard? Priced at $130 or $170 with a heart rate monitor, it's up against the likes of Fitbit and Nike's FuelBand. Does it keep up with the competition? Or is it left huffing and puffing a few paces behind? We let it judge monitor our movements and coax us off the sofa to find out. Warning: This review may (definitely does) contain mental images of desk-dancing that some readers may find distressing.
