The screengrab above (which we replicated ourselves) comes courtesy of SonyStyle Canada's registration page. A field populated by a well-meaning, yet misguided soul since Sony has yet to announce DSLRs carrying the A500, A500S, A550, A550S monikers. It's just a guess, but Sony's lineup has a glaring omission when compared to the competition in the consumer DSLR space: HD Video.[Via PhotoRumors and Dyxum]
