 Toshiba has spruced up its Gigabeatline with the model S, a Windows Portable Media Center with a 2.4-inch QVGA LCD display, up to 60GB of storage, and upto five hours of battery life for video playback. The S also includes an FM tuner, and supports MP3, WMA, Windows Media10 DRM and downloads from Tivo Series 2 DVRs. And, yes, this is one of the players that Bill Gates showed offduring his CES keynote, so you know it must rock (or at least must be so well-integrated with Windows Mobilefunctionality that Bill couldn't help but be smitten). Expect the Gigabeat S to be out this quarter, with the 30GBversion going for $299 and the 60GB one for $399.
