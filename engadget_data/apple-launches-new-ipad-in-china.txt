Of course (unless you've been living under a mighty rock), you'd know the launch comes a tad bit later than expected, after months of dealing with Proview's trademark conundrum -- and despite having those imperative certifications since way back in March. All legal kerfuffles aside, Apple's third-generation slate has arrived, opening the glass doors to anyone in China looking for 2048 x 1536 reasons to spend their hard-earned yuans. Notably, word on the internet is there's no fresh eggs being thrown this time around, so you should be a-okay if you do end up in one of those fancy retail shops.
