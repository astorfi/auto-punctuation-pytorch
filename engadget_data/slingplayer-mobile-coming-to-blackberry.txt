Pocket-lint reportedly got the scoop straight from the horse's mouth, with European VP Stuart Collingswood confirming the joint effort but giving no indication of a release timetable. Besides S60, Sling also currently supports Palm and both the Smartphone and Pocket PC versions of Windows Mobile in the handset space.
