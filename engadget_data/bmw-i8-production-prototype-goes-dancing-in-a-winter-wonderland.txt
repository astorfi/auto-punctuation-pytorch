  It's been almost a year since we last wrote about the BMW i8 being winter-tested and here it is again -- this time in production prototype form -- doing donuts (!) in the snow. This plug-in gasoline electric hybrid vehicle started life as the Vision EfficientDynamics, promising sub five-second 0 - 60mph times while still achieving an impressive 87mpg (2.7 liters per 100km). We last saw the i8 concept at the Frankfurt Motor Show but the sporty coup√© with the funky gullwing-like doors isn't expected in BMW showrooms until sometime in 2014. So for now just sit back, relax and check out the video above.
