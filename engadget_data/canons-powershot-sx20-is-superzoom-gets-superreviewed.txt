Replacing the year-old SX10, the SX20 IS adds 720p video recording at 30 fps and takes the pixel count up to 12 million. Strangely, it was features from the older model that earned praise, with the reviewers liking the 2.5-inch vari-angle display and UltraSonic Motor, which provided a smooth and silent zooming action. Their major gripe was image noise at ISO 400 and above, though picture quality was considered above average and macro performance was singled out for commendation.
