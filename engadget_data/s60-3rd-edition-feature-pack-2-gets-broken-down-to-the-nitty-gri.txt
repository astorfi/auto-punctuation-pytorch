Little changes have proliferated throughout the entire user interface, but biggies appear to be the addition of a third soft key, a heavily reworked and more flexible home screen (thank goodness), and improved application management. We strongly recommend having a thorough look at all the screen shots -- those media player visualizers are bangin', are they not?[Via MobileBurn]
