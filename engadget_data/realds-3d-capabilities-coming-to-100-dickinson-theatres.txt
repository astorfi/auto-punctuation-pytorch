While details are scant, the agreement does bring RealD's 3D capabilities to a full 100 of Dickinson's theaters, and it sounds as if the theater company is pretty stoked about it. In fact, it's already talking up how stellar Disney's Bolt will be, as well as the 13 3D films already planned for theatrical release in 2009. Regrettably, there's no mention of what kind of up-charge you'll be looking at when viewing the third-dimension.[Image courtesy of FilmSchoolRejects]
