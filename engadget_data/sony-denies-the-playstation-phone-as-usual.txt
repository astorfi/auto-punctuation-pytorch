 Well, that didn't take long. Just shortly after Sony Computer Entertainment co-chief operating officer Jim Ryan opened his mouth and rekindled rumors of a PlayStation Phone, Sony has now shot back and flatly denied that any such device is in the works. According to ComputerAndVideoGames.com, Sony says, "Jim Ryan was in fact misquoted by the Economic Times of India about this issue," adding that, "We do have talks with other arms of the Sony family about various topics but I can confirm we are not currently working together on the creation of a PlayStation Phone." So, that certainly seems to put a damper on that idea for the time being, although we suspect it won't take all that much longer for the rumor to crop up once again, at least as long as Sony is in the business of making both cellphones and video games.
