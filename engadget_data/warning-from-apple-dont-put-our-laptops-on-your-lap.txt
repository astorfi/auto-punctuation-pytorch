However, the company apparently still doesn't want to take any chances on users getting a little overheated while using the new MacBooks, so they've included a warning in the computer's manual (which also appears in the manual for the MBP), advising customers not to use their laptops on their laps: "Do not leave the bottom of your MacBook Pro in contact with your lap or any surface of your body for extended periods. Prolonged contact with your body could cause discomfort and potentially a burn"Â  Apple's solution to this is to recommend that customers put the computer on a desk or other flat surface. And, not surprisingly, the word "laptop" does not appear once in the MacBook's manual. Now, if you'll excuse us, we're off to chew on an iPod shuffle for a bit.
