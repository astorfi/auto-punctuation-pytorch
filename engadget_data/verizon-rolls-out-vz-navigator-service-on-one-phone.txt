 Verizon has finally joined CDMA rivalSprintNextelin offering a cell-based navigation service, albeit on only one phone. VZ Navigator is a $9.99-per-month/$2.99-a-dayaudible turn-by-turn direction service, map generator, and points-of-interest "database" that was rolled outconcurrently with the new Motorola V325 clamshell, currently the only model that is VZ-enabled. Now it seems thatCingular and our old favorite T-Mobile are the only wireless carriers not even offering a token GPS service- not thatit really matters to us, as we only sport Bluetooth-enabled smartphones that can add BT or SDIO receivers on a whim.[Via Phone Scoop]
