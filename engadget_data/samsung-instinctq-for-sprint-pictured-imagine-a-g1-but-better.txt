We know the Hero's in the pipeline, too, so between these two, Sprint could be poised to catch up to T-Mobile in a big, big way (as far as Android goes, anyhow) this fall. We think we're digging the touch-sensitive Home, Menu, and Back buttons, and the expansive keyboard looks plenty usable. The screen isn't looking quite as vibrant as its autobahn-driving European cousin, the Galaxy -- but we'll wait on passing final judgment until it's in our hands, of course. Any chance that's happening soon?
