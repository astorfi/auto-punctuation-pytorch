The Wahoo Fitness BlueSC sensor we saw back in April is now shipping, giving iPhone 4S and new iPad owners a Bluetooth 4.0 tracker for a bike's pedal cadence, speed and long-term performance through a trio of sensors. As you take that victory ride down the Champs d'Élysées -- or more realistically, take that fixie bike down for a cappuccino -- data feeds either into Wahoo's own app or to alternatives from Cyclemeter and Strava Cycling. If Spandex is considered part of your daily routine, $60 is what it takes to get the BlueSC following your every pedal push.
