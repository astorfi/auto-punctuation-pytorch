Not only is the 4k mode down right breathtaking, but the autostereoscopic 3D technology has come a long, long way since we saw a demo of a prototype last year. Up to nine people can enjoy 3D on the local dimming 55-inch LED 3DTV, but the optimal number is four or less. There is an almost invisible camera in the base of the set that tracks your face and there can be circles and arrows displayed on screen that help you move to the absolute best spot -- wish all TVs made it so easy to find the sweet spot. On display was a production model for outside the US, but our slightly different version is expected in Q1 2012 for more than most have ever paid for a TV (~$10k).
