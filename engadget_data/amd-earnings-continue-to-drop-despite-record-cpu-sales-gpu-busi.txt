Its total revenue of $1.57 billion represents a two-percent drop from the last quarter and five percent from the same time last year. Total profits fell from half a billion in Q1 to just $61 million. News was particularly bad at the graphics division which saw revenues plummet 11 percent from Q1. In total, the former ATI brand lost $7 million. It's not all bad news, though -- the company did ship a record number of mobile CPUs, won some awards, and increased its presence on the top 500 super computer list by 15 percent. That's gotta count for something right?
