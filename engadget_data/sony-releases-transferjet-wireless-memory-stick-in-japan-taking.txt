 Oh Sony, you just like to tease us, don't you? Two weeks after a brief mention at CES, Japan's been given the introductory taste of this tech giant's first ever TransferJet wireless Memory Stick. Meanwhile, Sony Style US has quietly added the same card for pre-order at $99.99 and cites February 8th as the possible launch date -- a slight delay from Sony's promised January launch. If the party's big enough, this TransferJet close-proximity radio technology could signal the death of cables and bulky card readers, but you'll still need compatible devices to work that magic on this memory stick. Sony will sure need more than just a few cameras to get us to make-dot-believe in this new ecosystem.
