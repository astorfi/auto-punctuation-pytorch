Much simpler than the PowerGlove hack (i.e. no circuit diagrams ormultimeters needed), the NES Zapper Mouse merely requires rewiring the gun's trigger to control the left-click of agyro mouse, which is rather inelegantly duct-taped to the barrel (but like Morgado himself claims, he's an engineer andnot an artist). Hey Brandon, since this could theoretically be used to control the aim on any game, what do you thinkabout combining an old PowerPad with a keyboard for the total NES-themed immersive FPS experience?[Via Joystiq]
