 Dell's in your laptop, airbrushing your WoW art -- in honor of the upcoming World of Warcraft Burning Crusade expansion release on January 16, they again commissioned artist Mike Lavalee to airbrush two limited edition XPS M1710 laptops with BC-inspired art; the lappies will be auctioned off to benefit World Harvest, an international humanitarian relief organization. For the non-addicted uninitiated, the artwork depicts the two new Blood Elf and Drainei races to be released in the expansion in the process of totally pwning each other. It'll be interesting to see how much these actually fetch on auction, as ironically the people who'd want them most may be unemployed and living in Mom's basement financially challenged.
