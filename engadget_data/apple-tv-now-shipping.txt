As of today, Apple is now shipping AppleTV. Check your email for shipment confirmation. Apple is charging credit cards and providing (in my case FedEx) tracking numbers. In addition, units should be available for sale at local Apple Stores for purchase in short order. If you spent the extra money for priority delivery, you should be seeing your unit very soon.


Thanks to everyone who sent this in.
