The new Samsung Juke, BlackBerry Pearl, LG Venus and LG Voyager are due for simultaneous arrival on the market, and are sure to turn heads. On the far left is the "Juke," Verizon's name for that U470 we spotted a couple weeks ago, which is supposed to arrive with 2GB of storage, A2DP Bluetooth and a 1.3 megapixel camera. Next up is the "new variety" Pearl rumored since August, with a 2 megapixel camera, A2DP and a 3.5mm audio jack. One to the right is the dual screen "Venus" slider, also known as the LG VX8800. The phone rocks miniSD expansion, A2DP, a 2 megapixel camera and some interesting touchscreen capabilities, including vibration feedback. Finally we have the beast of the bunch on the far right, the LG Voyager, also known as the VX10000. The phone sports a large external touchscreen, along with a lateral-clamshell form factor that opens up into a QWERTY keyboard and another well-sized screen, both screens are QVGA. Verizon is bragging of a full HTML browser, along with the expected microSD expansion, 2 megapixel camera, A2DP and some built-in stereo speakers.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
