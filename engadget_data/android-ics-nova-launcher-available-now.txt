   We know how much you love tweaking that Android handset, so we figured we'd let you know about a fresh 4.0-friendly UI customizer. The Nova Launcher, which has dubbed itself "everyone's favorite Ice Cream Sandwich launcher," just hit the Android Market in free and paid flavors. Those looking to take the freeloadin' road will get tidbits like a customizable homescreen grid, scrolling effects (pictured above), as well as custom folders and icons. If you do, however, decide to unleash the four bucks for premium status, you'll get extra features, including personalized gestures and dock "swipe-actions." Tickle your fancy enough to take it for a spin on that shiny new G-Nex? Both variants are up for grabs from the source links below.
