 Talk of a Galaxy S 4 Mini started while many of us were still processing the impact of its full-size cousin, but there was little to go on at first beyond unverifiable imagery and top-level specs. Thankfully, Samsung itself just removed some of the doubt through a user agent profile on its own website. While the code only references a previously suspected GT-i9190 handle (the Galaxy S III Mini is the GT-i8190), a 960 x 540 screen and an ARM11-compatible processor, those details are enough to suggest the tiny Life Companion is more than just a rumor -- and, not surprisingly, less powerful than the GS 4. Dutch site TechTastic even claims to have spotted the Galaxy S 4 Mini by name when searching for the GT-i9190's profile, although Samsung may have already scrubbed any such evidence. When previous rumors had the Mini surfacing not long after its bigger counterpart, we imagine it won't be long before we know if the handset exists as more than just a string of text.
