The 3D2P dual projection system relies on a pair of the firm's DLP projectors in order to deliver three-dimensional imagery, and it's hoping to attract customers by pitching that theaters can "own the complete 3D system without recurring fees." Reportedly, the setup has already garnered praise in the Krikorian Premiere Theaters, but so far as we can tell, you'll still be forced to slip on a set of gaudy goggles in order to really see what's going on. As predicted, Christie's requiring that you phone it up in order to find out pricing details, but what we really want is a list of cinemas that end up getting some installed.[Via AboutProjectors]
