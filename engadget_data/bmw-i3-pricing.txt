Remember when it was hoped that BMW's first fully-electric production vehicle would set you back around $35,000? Well, tough. The company has announced pricing for the car, with the i3 setting you back $41,350 before federal and state incentives, plus a handling fee of $925 in the US. Meanwhile, Germans itching to get their hands on the plug-in whip will be spending â‚¬34,950 ($45,990) -- but that small additional premium does have one benefit. While the US model won't arrive until the second quarter of 2014, the European i3 will land in Germany in this November.
