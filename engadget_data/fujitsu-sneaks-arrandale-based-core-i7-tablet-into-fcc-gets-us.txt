Expected to be identical in size and external design to the currently available LifeBook T5010, the T900 seems set to juice up the internals and leave the rest well enough alone. That might not be such a terrible idea, mind you, considering the original was a popular convertible tablet that eventually gained multitouch and integrated AT&T 3G skills. If you ask us, January can't come soon enough.
