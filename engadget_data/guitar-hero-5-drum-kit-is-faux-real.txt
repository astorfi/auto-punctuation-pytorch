While no additional details are listed, this rig stands in stark, simplistic contrast to the overbearing GH kit launched by Logitech yesterday and will certainly cost less (much less) than $229. One more shot after the break while we wait for official pricing and specs in the run-up to the September launch.[Thanks, Juan]
