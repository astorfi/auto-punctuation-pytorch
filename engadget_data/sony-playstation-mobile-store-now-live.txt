 After what feels like a mighty long time since it was first announced, Sony's cross-platform PlayStation Mobile store is now up and running with an initial line-up of games (plus one lonely-looking app) for the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Certified Android devices. That hardware category currently includes Sony's latest tablets and Xperias, plus HTC One-branded handsets -- check the source link for a full list and installation instructions. So far, we can access PSM on the Vita via a new tab on the PlayStation Store, and we know that readers are having luck on devices in the US -- including the Xperia Play -- but the One X (both global and AT&T) has only given us error messages. If you succeed or fail, please post your results below and we'll update accordingly.

 Update: Okay, there are definitely teething problems on HTC devices and we're reaching out for an explanation. Meanwhile, owners of the Nexus 7 and the Xperia Ion on AT&T bring happier tidings.

 Update: Depending on which Sony page you visit, you may or may not see the statement below, which HTC has confirmed to us is true:

  ""HTC mobile device owners cannot access PlayStation®Mobile for the moment. However, we are working with HTC to ensure PlayStation®Mobile launches as soon as possible. We will update you soon."
