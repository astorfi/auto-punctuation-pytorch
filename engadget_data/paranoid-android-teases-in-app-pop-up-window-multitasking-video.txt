 As advanced as multitasking gets on smartphones, many times you're still left to completely switch between apps. Paranoid Android is looking to set things into overdrive with in-app, multiple-window multitasking for its skin of Android, going beyond the similar (but limited) functionality seen in the likes of Samsung's basked-in Galaxy apps. PA's Paul Henschel recently posted a demo to YouTube highlighting the feature working with various apps on both an Android tablet and a Nexus smartphone, with a post to Google+ saying it shows less than 10 percent of the planned functionality. If that weren't enough, the post further clarifies PA's drive to build out its version stating: "We think these [Samsung, Cyanogen & Cornerstone] implementations suck and we want to get it right this time."
