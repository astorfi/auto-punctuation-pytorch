Check in begins tomorrow at 4PM, and the event runs from 6 to midnight. If the free snacks aren't enough to get you there, just think of it as a time to set aside your fanboy/girl differences and really get to know the next-gen competition -- at no cost to you.P.S. -Just in case you couldn't see that address, it's 160 Wooster St., in Manhattan.
