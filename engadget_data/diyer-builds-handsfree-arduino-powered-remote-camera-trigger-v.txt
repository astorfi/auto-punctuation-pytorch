He has put together a comprehensive video detailing the setup required to build your own Arduino-powered remote shutter trigger, and while it's certainly one of the more complicated setups out there, properly executing it can land you self-taken photos like the one above. You'll need a laptop, a solid DSLR, an Arduino, a DIYer toolkit (you know, tiny screwdrivers and the like) and a good bit of spare time. If you've already checked all five from your list, head on past the break and mash play -- your weekend project awaits. 

[Thanks, Matt]
