 The TiVo vs. EchoStar case got another little push towards finally ending today, as the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that EchoStar had indeed infringed part of TiVo's "time warp" patent. You might recall that the case had recently been on hold while the USPTO re-affirmed that the patent was valid -- armed with that decision, the appeals court ruled that EchoStar had crossed the line on the software component of the patent, but that more information was needed regarding whether or not EchoStar's hardware also infringed. That means we're in for another round of wrangling down in Marshall -- we'll keep you updated, if we can manage to stay awake.[Via Zatz Not Funny! Warning: PDF read link]
