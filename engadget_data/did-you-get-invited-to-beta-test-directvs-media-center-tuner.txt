Of course Microsoft has yet to even confirm that such a device exists, so there's always the chance that this is a fantastic photoshop job, but we have no reason not to believe it. The one thing we are upset about is the fact that we haven't been invited, it's not like we have a problem keeping a secret, seriously. [Thanks, Aaron]
