 The SSD market is starting to get pleasantly crowded -- Lexar just announced a new line of Crucial-branded SSDs in both 32GB and 64GB capacities. The 2.5-inch SATA drives will offer sub-1ms latency, and Crucial will also be offering an external drive enclosure and 3.5-inch internal bay kit, which will allow you to pull your drive and take it with you on the go. No pricing is available yet, but Crucial says these'll hit sometime in Q1.
