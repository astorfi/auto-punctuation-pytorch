  An HTC Evo 4G LTE with dual cameras could only mean one thing, right? It's unclear whether the 3D rig in the company's intro video is simply a design mock-up, or a functional prototype of a model to come, but there's definitely something of the sort floating around HTC's labs. The device in question looks identical to the Evo we saw at yesterday's Sprint launch event -- kickstand and all -- save for that unique dual-lens design. And if such a smartphone did come to fruition, what could we expect for a name? Sprint HTC EVO 4G 3D LTE? We sure hope not. We've reached out to HTC to get a better idea of what we're looking at, but for now, this clip will have to do. You'll find the video in its entirety just past the break, but you'll want to skip to the 25 second mark for the 3D proto.Update: Well, we just heard back from HTC and the company confirmed that it's not a prototype of any future device. Apparently, it's just an early design when HTC and Sprint were considering carrying over the 3D feature, but it didn't make the cut. Mystery solved!
