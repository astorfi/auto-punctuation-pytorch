Today ASUS introduced the world to the Eee Keyboard, a full-sized keyboard with built-in PC including WiFi (and Ethernet), speaker, mic, and 5-inch interactive display and touchscreen. It weighs less than 2 pounds and connects to existing displays. Well, it would if it was more than a concept, which, knowing ASUS, means someday soon.Update: We spoke with ASUS, the Eee Keyboard is a near final prototype and is definitely going production.
