The BD-P1500 updates the well-received BD-P1400 player with Profile 1.1 / Bonus View goodness, as well as 7.1 PCM, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, and DTS-HD MA audio support for $399. Pick up one of these up next month, or wait for the BD-Live enabled DMP-BD50 or BDP-S550? For those in need of legacy HD DVD support, still word whether the BD-UP5500 combo player's release date has been affected by Samsung's "focus" on Blu-ray. Update 3/11: Samsung PR dropped us a line that the BD-P1500 is still officially expected in the May/June timeframe. We'll keep you posted on any further updates.
