Like most otherSamsung digital cameras to date, it's nothing special: 3x optical zoom, 2.4-inch display, 20MB internal flash, etc. The30fps VGA movie recording mode ain't too shabby though, but unless you're particularly attached to Samsung brandeddevices (and you know how it is we feel about irrational brand loyalty), we've got a feeling you may want move on here.
