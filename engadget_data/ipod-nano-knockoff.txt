Ahhh, yes, Yet Another iPod Knockoff to
help us keep it real fake. Supposedly it does more neato stuff than the nano like digital voice recording and
supporting video natively as well as supporting a bunch of extra file formats (WMA, ASF, etc.), but it only weighs in
at 256 MB capacity. It bears a resemblance to the i-Bob
without the helpful faceplate informing you it's a digital audio player, so may just be a rebadge. Either way, we leave
it up to you to think long and hard, kids, about whether or not you want to shell out your hard-earned 4,200 philippine
pesos ($77) to contribute to the company's inevitable legal
fund.
