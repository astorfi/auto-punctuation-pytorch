 
Panasonic kicked off its 2010 3DTV run with an extremely limited, Best Buy only launch of the 50-inch VT20 package, but for those looking to upgrade -- especially in size -- with a new TV this year finally have some info to work off of. This year's sets have more than just the extra dimension to offer, with improved black levels (especially over time), plus upgraded VIERA Cast networked features with Skype. The general launch kicks off the week of May 3 with the 50-inch TC-P50VT25 for $2,599, and closes with the largest TC-P65VT25 model in June for $4,299. Those MSRPs place them a couple of hundred bucks north of last year's models, but a rep for great 3D and 2D performance should help anyone struggling over the upgrade -- check for the rest of the prices in the press release after the break.
