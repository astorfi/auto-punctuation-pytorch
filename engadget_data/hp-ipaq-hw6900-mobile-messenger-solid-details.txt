 
Well lookey here: a good friend of Engadget's who shall remain unnamed landed an internal specsheet onthe HP iPAQ hw6900Mobile Messenger we got some rough n' early details on yesterday. Want the real skinny (until they change it again,anyway)? Well, here you go: it'll have GPRS / EDGE, 802.11b (as stated yesterday), Bluetooth 1.2, GPS, Windows Mobile5.0 plus AKU2 (for push email, etc.), a 416MHz Intel Xscale, 64k color 3.0-inch transflective touchscreen, 1.3megapixel camera with LED flash, 64MB RAM, IrDA, MiniSD, and USB... 1.1? Seriously, it says USB 1.1. Ok, whatever,we'll find a way to look past that since we can always load up our 2GB MiniSD cards in media readers since they're soeasily removed and not under the battery.
