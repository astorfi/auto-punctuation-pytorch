Said unit also boasts a 250GB hard drive, UniPhier chip and MPEG-4 AVC / H.264 encoders. As for the 500GB DMR-XW320 and 250GB DMR-XW120, each of these stick with DVD / HDD recording, but look to feature all the other aforementioned niceties including support for Dolby True HD, DTS-HD and HDMI 1.3. No official word on price at the moment, but expect to pay a pretty penny when these land late next month (presumably in Japan).[Via AkihabaraNews]
