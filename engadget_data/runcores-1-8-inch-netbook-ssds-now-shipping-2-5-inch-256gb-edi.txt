The unashamedly named 1.8-inch Low Cost Zif PATA SSDs can be sealed in a corrugated box and shipped off to your place of residence for $69.99, $119.99, $199.99 or $389.99 depending on size (16/32/64/128GB, respectively). If you're looking for a bit more room and have the space to install it, the February-bound 256GB Pro III Hyper Speed 2.5-inch SATA SSD is right down your alley. The drive boasts a maximum read rate of 230MB/sec and a top write speed of 150MB/sec; unfortunately, that whole "low cost" mantra fades a bit on this one, with the $699.99 list price causing the eyes to open just a wee bit wider.
