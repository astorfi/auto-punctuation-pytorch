The projector istargeted at eventual use with cellphones and the video iPod, and includes no moving parts, skipping over prisms andglass to use lasers for imaging. The unit also has "infinite focus," which purports to need no adjustment tooptics for the image to be in focus, no matter what the distance. We're glad to hear they don't have a need for most ofthe traditional heat causing and energy wasting components of a projector, but we'd like to know how the device worksbeyond "laz0rs," "computational algorithms," and "novel optical techniques." We guessthey have a while to work all that out, because even though they'll have a color version out this year, we won't beseeing the device for sale for another "two to four years."[Via HD Beat]
