Huawei's mysterious Android device -- first spotted at MWC -- is apparently headed out on T-Mobile in late 2009, as reportedly confirmed by a Huawei spokesperson. The same details we've previously heard, including the 5 megapixel camera, 3.5mm headphone jack and WiFi -- are still on the list, though nothing new is emerging thus far. It also seems to be called the G3, but again, it's hard to say if that name is official or not. We'll let you know when we hear something more concrete, but until then... just keep marvelling at the buttonless wonder you see above.
