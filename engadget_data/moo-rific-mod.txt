A mental image of an udder meshed with mother board is something we would usually avoid, but
we'll make an exception with this guy's hollow plastic cow PC case mod. Since he's got
an uncomfortably intimate knowledge of cow anatomy, he neatly packaged his mini ITX-based computer
into a purchased expansive cow body. Somehow the fact that German Wal-Marts sell large plastic cows doesn't
seem so unusual, but the case's butcher-style precise incisions are a tad off-putting.
