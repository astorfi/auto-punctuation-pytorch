 Shared data's not for everyone, which is why AT&T's continuing to augment its prepaid offerings with additional GoPhone options. Announced today, the carrier's new $65 monthly plan is geared specifically towards smartphone users, combining unlimited talk and text with a 1GB allotment of data. And in tandem with this new package, the operator's also releasing the Fusion 2: a white-labeled Android device that's slated to retail for $99 -- no contract strings attached. Both are set to launch this October 7th, so if you're commitment-averse and in need of a new device, this could be the plan for you. Hit up the break for the full presser.

   DALLAS, Oct. 1, 2012 - Beginning Oct. 7, AT&T* GoPhone® smartphone customers will have a new rate plan option. The new Monthly Unlimited Plan with Data offers unlimited talk and text, with 1 GB of data for $65 per month. Unlimited text messaging to Mexico, Canada and over 100 other countries is also included.

   This new plan is specially designed for smartphone users, and saves them $10 per month compared to previously available options.

   The $50 monthly plan with unlimited talk and text and the $25 monthly plan with 250 minutes and unlimited nationwide text with optional data packages will continue to be available to smartphone customers.

   Launching in conjunction with this new smartphone rate plan is AT&T GoPhone's newest Android device, AT&T Fusion™ 2, which lets customers enjoy the convenience of a smartphone with email, apps and web access for only $99.

   "As more of our prepaid customers choose smartphones, we wanted to offer them a rate plan that meets their needs while still being an excellent value," said Judy Cavalieri, vice president – Voice and Prepaid Products, AT&T. "We're excited to offer this new option to our growing base of smartphone customers to give them a better smartphone experience while keeping their budget in check."

   AT&T operates the nation's largest Wi-Fi network** including more than 30,000 AT&T Wi-Fi Hot Spots at popular restaurants, hotels, bookstores and retailers, and provides access to more than 220,000 hotspots globally through roaming agreements. Most AT&T smartphone customers, including Fusion 2 customers, get access to our entire national Wi-Fi network at no additional cost, and Wi-Fi usage doesn't count against customers' monthly wireless data plans.
