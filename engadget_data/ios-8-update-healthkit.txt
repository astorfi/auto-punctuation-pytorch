When iOS 8 arrived last week, Apple was quick to pull HealthKit-friendly apps from its App Store due to a major bug. An update for the new mobile software has arrived though, and it fixes the issue to make the fitness and wellness selections available once more. The folks in Cupertino promised a solution by the end of the month, and kept that word, delivering a new version in under a week. iOS 8.0.1 also mends third-party keyboard issues, Reachability (one-handed mode) woes, problems with apps accessing the Photo Library and a smattering of other bugs. We've nabbed the update on devices here at Engadget HQ, so if you've yet to be alerted to the download, it should be on its way shortly. However, we're seeing reports that folks (especially iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users) are having new issues with cell service and Touch ID upon installing the latest version. We've reached out to Apple for more info on these problems and we'll be sure to report back as soon as we know more, but for now, you may want to sit tight.




Update: The iOS 8.0.1 download has been pulled.
