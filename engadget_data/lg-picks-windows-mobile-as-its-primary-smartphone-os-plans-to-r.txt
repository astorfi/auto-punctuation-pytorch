        Kind of a big announcement from Microsoft and LG at MWC just now -- LG's going to make Windows Mobile its primary smartphone operating system, and it sounds like there's going to be some serious cash involved from both sides to make it happen. No specific device plans yet, but that's going to change big fast -- LG's going to drop 50 (!) WinMo handsets on us through 2012. Yikes. Hope you're ready for some S-Class WinMo action, guys.
