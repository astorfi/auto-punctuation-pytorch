 As previously mentioned here, here and here, we know iPhone is coming to the UK and if the rumor mill is on target -- and it seldom is with this device -- the newest frontrunner is (and likely was) O2 UK. A source close to Apple revealed to PC Advisor in the UK that iPhone paraphernalia's ready to go and that he "would bet" it will finally land in September. Of course, Would bet is pretty weak business, but after seeing this handset bounce from Vodafone to T-Mobile and then O2, we have now covered the gamut and one of them should just out the thing. Either way, September isn't far off, so lets hope we hear more then.
