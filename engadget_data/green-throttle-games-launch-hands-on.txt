 Thinking of rounding out your entertainment center's arsenal with an Android-based game console? You've certainly got options: Ouya, GameStick and Project Shield are all vying for a spot on your couch. On the other hand, you might already have a perfectly serviceable Android device just waiting to be converted into a makeshift games console -- that's where Green Throttle Games comes in. By pairing a dual-stick gamepad with a console-like game launcher, Green Throttle aims to turn any Android device into a gaming platform. We spent some time with a developer build of the setup late last year, but today the company officially launched the Green Throttle Arena and its companion Atlas controller. We popped in to the firm's Santa Clara office to see what changed.



 
 Green Throttle's consumer debut is much cleaner than the developer software we saw back in November -- the Arena app now features large, attractive menu tiles reminiscent of Windows 8's start screen, dividing its home screen into sections for recently played titles, featured games and advertisements. Headlining the billboard of squares are four self-explanatory menu options: home, my games, recommended and settings. Green Throttle's Matt Crowley told us the app soft launched to Google Play over the weekend, and showed us how it can be used as a simple touchscreen launcher for Green Throttle supported titles. On its own, the Arena app is aesthetically pleasing, but it doesn't really come to life until it's paired with an Atlas controller.
