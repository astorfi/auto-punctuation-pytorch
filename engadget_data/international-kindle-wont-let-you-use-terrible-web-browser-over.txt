Wired has noticed that the fine print explains that accessing blogs and the experimental web browser won't be allowed overseas, though even Americans are cautioned against using the Kindle's browser unless smoke signals and morse code have already failed you. In related news, all International Kindles will ship with US power plugs from a US warehouse, so folks in Europe will need to factor in import fees as well as some sort of power adapter. Ah well, at least you guys get universal healthcare.
