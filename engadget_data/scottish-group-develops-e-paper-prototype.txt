Here's yet another group working on
e-paper, for those of you keeping score at home: a team at
Scotland's Paisley University Thin Film Centre has produced a working prototype of what they say is a working e-paper
prototype, which can download info into a lightweight, high-contrast device that the developers refer to as "cheap and
flexible." The research is being funded by DuPoint-Teijin Films and plastic electronics developer Plastic Logic. As
with other similar projects, we assume this one is a long way from developing anything that can be commercialized. For
the record, though, it's worth noting that the local paper, The Scotsman, has breathlessly declared this to be a
"potentially life-changing creation."
