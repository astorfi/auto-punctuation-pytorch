Amazon's voice-savvy Echo speaker is only handy for a few tasks right now, but it's about to become much more flexible. The online giant is now taking sign-ups for a beta developer kit that will let people create apps for the gadget. There aren't many details as to what coders can do with the Echo, but it won't be surprising if they'll let you ask new questions, play games or take control of apps on your mobile devices. Just be patient if you aren't a programmer -- there's no mention of when a regular developer kit will be available, and it'll likely take a while after that before you're using speaker-friendly software.
