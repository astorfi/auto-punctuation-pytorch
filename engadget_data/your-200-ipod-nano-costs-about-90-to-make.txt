We've run these bits before where analysts step in and check out how much money they believe a device costs in parts
(and manufacturing) to produce; this time it's iSuppli estimating the cost of goods in making a 2GB
nano. And what figure did they happen come up with?
$90.18. Yes, we know the retail on that thing is $200. Granted, they could be way off, but by their calculations you're
paying a huge portion of that ninety bucks on the integrated circuits, screen, wheel, and flash memory. It's important
to point out that iSuppli's figure does not include Apple's cost of business (marketing, operating their dozens of
storefronts, employing tens of thousands globally, etc.), however, which they conservatively estimate as being anywhere
from 15-20% of the unit's cost, a figure that just doesn't seem quite right to these ears. Then again, a 40% ($80)
margin on the nano wouldn't exactly surprise
us, either. Maybe we're in the wrong business after all.
