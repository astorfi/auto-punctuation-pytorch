But when you're up against Apple and have spent almost nothing on marketing, beingnumber two may be worth shouting about, which explains why SanDisk is sounding off about its second-place position inthe US market for digital audio players. Of course, SanDisk is a very distant second place: the company sold a millionaudio players during the holiday period, compared to Apple's 14 million. Still, considering that the company's Sansa players have none of the iPod's cachet, and don't even getmuch respect from the Cowon/Creative/iRiver-loving anything-but-iPod crowd, number two seems like a good place to be.But they'd better not rest on those wilted laurels for long; no. 3 and 4 are just behind them, and this market hasbrought down bigger players than SanDisk -- including Rio, which was once ranked number one.
