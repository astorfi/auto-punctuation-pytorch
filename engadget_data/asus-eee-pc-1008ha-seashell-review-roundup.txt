It doesn't look like an Eee, it doesn't feel like an Eee and it doesn't boast a replaceable battery like an Eee; needless to say, only two of those three facts were lauded by reviewers across the web. Much like Apple's MacBook Air, the battery in this here machine is not user-serviceable, and while tests proved that it could last well over three hours with "normal" use, ASUS has yet to make clear what plans it has for offering replacements. In any case, most everything else about the machine was found to be on par or above, with performance being satisfactory for basic tasks and the keyboard / trackpad being exceptionally yummy. Still, it feels as if ASUS is charging a bit much for a familiar lineup of internals, but those willing to pay for style should definitely take a closer look.Read - Trusted Reviews ("a very refined and classy netbook")Read - T3 ("a good all-round package")Read - CNET UK ("great styling and a relatively light chassis")Read - Bit-Tech ("definitely worth considering, but looks come at a cost")Read - WhatLaptop ("a compelling proposition")Read - PCPro ("If you don't mind paying a premium for fine design, then the Seashell is a tantalizing prospect")
