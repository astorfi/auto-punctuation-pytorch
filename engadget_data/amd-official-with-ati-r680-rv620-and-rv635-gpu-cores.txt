The new R680 consists of two 55-nm processor cores with CrossFireX support sharing the same specifications of the RV670 processor at the heart of their Radeon HD 3870 -- thought to be AMD's best product of the year. The RV620 and RV635 GPU cores are nearly identical to their RV610 and RV630 processors only in a new 55-nm form. Now, imagine if you will a pair of ATI Radeon HD 3870 X2 (R680) cards running in CrossFire. Or say four with CrossFireX. Feels good, right? You won't have to wait much longer as the R680 hits in January. Read -- AMD announced R680, Rv620, and RV635 Read -- ATI Radeon HD 3870 X2 in CrossFire
