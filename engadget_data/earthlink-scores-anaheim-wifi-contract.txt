EarthLink's quest to rule the metropolitan airwaves is pushing ahead unabated, as they were just chosen to blanket
Anaheim, CA with cozy WiFi, closely following their deal with
Philly, and on the same day that their proposal to
compete with Google for the San Francisco contract was unveiled. According to EarthLink, Tropos Networks' MetroMesh
wireless routers, situated on lampposts throughout the city, will provide the backbone of Anaheim's 50-square-mile
network. Once their two-square-mile proof of concept network is approved, EarthLink expects to have the entire project
complete by the end of next year.
