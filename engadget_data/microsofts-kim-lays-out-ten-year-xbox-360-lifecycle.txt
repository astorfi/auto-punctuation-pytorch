 It's no secret that Sony's has a ten-year lifecycle (or longer) in mind for all of its consoles, but Microsoft has so far been a bit less clear cut when it comes to talking about its long-term plans. That now looks to be changing, however, as Microsoft Shane Kim has told VentureBeat that the company "firmly" believes that the Xbox 360 "has a life cycle through 2015," or exactly ten years since it launched. That minor revelation came in the same interview where Kim also discussed Project Natal at length, which, he notes, would fit "mid-cycle" into the Xbox 360's lifetime, so who knows what Microsoft has in store for the 360's twilight years.[Via gamesindustry.biz]
