Nothing like humanoid robot news to brighten up the day (or is that just us?). The designer Japanese robot
nuvo is finally going to market, at the stiff price of
$5,450 (and that's just the entry-level version — add another $3K for the deluxe). The nuvo serves a dual role in the
realms of home security and entertainment — two domestic spheres that go hand in hand like fishes and bicycles. The
15-inch, 5.5 pound nuvo from ZMP, Inc. walks and responds to voice commands, as well as linking to your mobile phone
both to receive commands and to send you images of your home taken with the camera inside its head. That would cover
the "home security" aspect, with the entertainment role being fulfilled by its ability to dance and play musical
sounds. Consider the nuvo a great alternative to procreation: it's cheaper over the long haul and, considering some of
the unfortunate offspring we've witnessed, potentially cuter.
