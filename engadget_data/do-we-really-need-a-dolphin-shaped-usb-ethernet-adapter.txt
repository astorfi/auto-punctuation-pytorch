Somewhere out there, somebody's starting up a 12-step program for USB-device addicts. And we promise to sign up,
really, as soon as we find out where it is. Until then, we're just going to have to keep feeding our addiction to
bizarre, unusual or just plain dumb
things you can hook up to a USB port. The latest is a dolphin-shaped Ethernet adapter. As far as we can tell, this is
just a garden-variety USB-to-Ethernet adapter, the kind of thing you'd walk past a hundred times in CompUSA and never
even notice. Except that this one is shaped like a frickin' dolphin. And it's only $8. Somebody stop us; we're about to
order a gross.
