As you can see after the break, the channel looks to be about as straightforward as can be, and it apparently includes built-in support for loading ELF and DOL homebrew executables via USBGecko and TCP/IP, in addition to support for loading 'em off SD cards. Sadly, there's no word on a release just yet, but we can't imagine it being kept under wraps for too much longer.[Via DCEmu, thanks Craig]
