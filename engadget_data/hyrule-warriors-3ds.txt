Hyrule Warriors, the Zelda-themed hack-and-slash game that hit Wii U in 2014, is on its way to 3DS, according to a new Japanese trailer. The 3DS version comes from Wii U developers Omega Force and Team Ninja, and of course Japanese publisher Koei Tecmo. It looks like the pirate Tetra and the King of Hyrule are playable characters in the 3DS edition, and the final frames of the new trailer suggest compatibility with the Wii U version. The video's title says, "Announced at E3," and you better believe we'll break out all of the Hylian information directly from the show, which runs from June 16th to 18th. In the meantime, we've reached out to Nintendo for more information about Hyrule Warriors on 3DS.
