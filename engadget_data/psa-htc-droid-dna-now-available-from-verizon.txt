 What are we thankful for on the day before Thanksgiving? How about the glut of great smartphones? Phones like HTC's Droid DNA, on sale today over at Verizon. $200 (with the obligatory two-year contract) will get you a gorgeous five-inch 1080p display, a quad-core processor, NFC and some Android Jelly Bean action. The battery life leaves a bit to be desired, however, though it'll get you through the amount of time required to cook a 20 pound turkey, at least.
