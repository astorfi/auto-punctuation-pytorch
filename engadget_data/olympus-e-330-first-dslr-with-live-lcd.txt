With the new E-330, the company has added something you won't find on any other DSLR:continuous live color previews via the LCD, enabling SLR shooters to skip the viewfinder, just as point-and-shootershave done for years. According to Olympus, the continuous live preview via the camera's tilt-and-swivel 2.5-inch LCDprovides 92% coverage for autofocus shooting; a separate preview mode provides 100% coverage for manual focusing. Thecamera's other specs look decent as well: 7.1 megapixel resolution, 3 fps shooting and a new low-power CMOS thatOlympus claims reduces noise at high ISO settings. But it's the live preview that will set this one apart (at leastuntil Canon, Nikon or Sony catch up) -- and either make you rush out to buy it, or make you turn up your nose indisdain. The E-330 is expected to be available in March for about $1,100.[Thanks to everyone who sent thisin.]
