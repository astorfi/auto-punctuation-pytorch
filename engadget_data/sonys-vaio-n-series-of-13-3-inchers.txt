As such, the press release is more focused on the colors on offer -- seashell white, blush pink, spring green, espresso black and urban gray -- than the product itself. In fact, in Europe the names change to karma white, free spirit pink, natural green, timeless black, and nomad grey. Uh, Sony, less time in market research and more time on battery fabrication please. Thanks. Nevertheless, don't be fooled by those girlie looks 'cause these Core 2 Duo offerings bring plenty of power in that Vista Premium ready chassis. Starting with a 13.3-inch XBRITE-ECO wide screen display, Sony delivers 256MB nVidia GeForce Go 7400 graphics, 120GB SATA disk, up to 2GB memory, a dual-layer DVD burner, 802.11a/b/g WiFi, Bluetooth, ExpressCard and multi-format memory card slot, and the usual array of Firewire and USB 2.0 ports all in a 5-pound slab. Expect 'em to start posing hard in your favorite coffee shop come October when they drop for $1,350 (starting price) or a bit later depending upon your color persuasion. More shots in blush pink and spring green after the break -- come on sissy, you know you want to look.[Via Laptoping]
