November is still several months away, of course, but that doesn't mean you have to start camping out at your nearest electronics outlet just to get your hands on an Xbox One before the holiday season. Fortunately, a large number of online retailers are already offering the ability to pre-order the $499 console -- a Day One Edition, no less. We received an email from Microsoft pointing us to the page on its own online Store, but companies like Amazon, ShopTo, GameStop, GAME and Best Buy are following suit. So if you know for sure that you're ready to make the commitment, head to one of the above outlets to make your claim.


Update: If you're a Wally World patron, you'll be glad to know that Walmart is now accepting pre-orders as well.
