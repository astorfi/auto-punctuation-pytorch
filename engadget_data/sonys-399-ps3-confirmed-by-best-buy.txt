However, the more important "Street Date" field is unfortunately empty at the moment. While the docs look legit and don't seem to be Photoshopped, they can still be faked easily enough. So we did a quick lookup on the UPC code and sure enough, while the details are masked, the manufacturer is listed as "Sony Computer Entertainment of America." Unfortunately, we don't see the new model CECHG01 listed anywhere in the docs. As such, let's be clear: this ain't official. Still, we'll be paying close attention on October 12th as will you we suspect.
