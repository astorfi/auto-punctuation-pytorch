 Ah, in the grand tradition of taking execs' statements totally out of context, we present to you the latest bit of hubris from PlayStation father Ken Kutaragi. Speaking -- once again -- in defense of the PS3's, um, luxurious price, Kutaragi-san apparently told game magazine Famitsu, "PlayStation and PlayStation 2 were both Â¥10,000 [about $90 US] more than their competitors at launch. Yet they both sold to shortages." Yes, well, it looks like the PS3 is going to be a little more than $90 more expensive than the Wii. But he's not done yet: "If you consider the PlayStation 3 a toy, then yes, it is an expensive toy. However, it is more than a toy. It is a PlayStation 3. And it is the only PlayStation 3. I hope that those who understand this will gladly purchase it." And there you have it; those who understand the PlayStation 3 is the PlayStation 3 -- and the only PlayStation-freaking-3 that there is -- should gladly want to purchase one. We're hoping something got lost in translation there. We really are.
