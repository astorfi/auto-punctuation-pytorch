Despite that somewhat tenuous relationship, this New York Times article is focusing on the part of the service beyond adding more channels and extra features, customer service. From the techs coming to the house or the callcenters, now that many people can get TV from their phone company or phone and internet from their cable company all of them claim to go the extra mile to keep customers happy. Of course there is the occasional disastrous video of a sleepy tech but while most service calls are a bit more low key, a bad experience can definitely lead customers to look elsewhere with more competitors fighting for their attention.[Via digg]
