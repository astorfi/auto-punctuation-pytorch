 We know chances are you've probably got better things to read about than the PS3's next firmware, but this one proves to have some fun goodies sure to catch a few eyes. Namely, you've got that Folding@home client, as expected (did you join Team Engadget? Didya?), background downloads (finally!), Remote Play for wired 20GB PS3s -- all four of them out there -- and an onscreen keyboard รก la the Wii, except, you know, different because it's PS3. Look out for that to drop on March 22nd (in Japan, anyway), suspiciously near the Euro launch date.[Via Joystiq]
