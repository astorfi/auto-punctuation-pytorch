As far as anyone can tell -- ASUS is a little coy on specs so far -- the laptop harbors fairly traditional netbook specs and a netbook pricepoint, but the exterior is all new and rather attractive. The computer is 1-inch thick and weighs 2.4 pounds, with a curved, shiny plastic "shell" (ASUS calls it "pearlescent") to give a bit more luster than the average Eee PC. ASUS is including 802.11n, Bluetooth, 3G and WiMAX options, and packing in it Eee Sharing and Eee Arena software. We'll be looking to dig up more specs and some hands-on time with this unit this week at CeBIT.[Via UMPCPortal]
