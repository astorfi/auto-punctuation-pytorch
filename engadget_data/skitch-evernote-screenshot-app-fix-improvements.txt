 They say Rome wasn't built in a day, but no one ever focuses on how quickly it fell. Skitch can't exactly be compared to an empire, but with some ten million users globally, there were a lot of voices shouting a lot of various things when the upstart jumped in bed with Evernote and upgraded itself to version 2.0. Not surprisingly, members of our own staff as well as vocal readers have been forced to look for alternative options after v2.0 yanked and / or maimed some of our favorite features from the original. Truth be told, there's really no alternative that doesn't also come with a severe compromise, but the Skitch team knows full well that said scenario could change if rivals are given enough time.

 Today, the company's chief designer Keith Lang is clearing the air on what happened, what's happening, and where his program is going in the future. For starters, he mentions that his team was so heads-down on managing the product, that they failed to actually take into account "how deeply ingrained Skitch had become into many people's daily workflows and how disruptive even small changes could be." The good news, however, is that he's vowing to "fix it." He notes that version 1.0 was held together with many years of duct tape, and to ever truly move forward, a new program would have to be built from the ground-up. That new program, of course, was met with near-universal hatred from the prior user base, but it looks as if those in the passionate camp are fixing to be addressed.

 In updates due to hit between now and sometime soon, Skitch will be regaining Menubar Extra support, FTP / sFTP capabilities, short URLs, direct hosting of Skitch images (!), multiple fonts and custom colors, as well as streamlined cropping and resizing. Aside from bringing v2.0 back up to where v1.0 left off, Keith is promising "really amazing stuff" in the future. We'll be anxious to give the new builds a try -- hopefully, they'll bring back some good memories.
