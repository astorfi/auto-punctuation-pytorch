No matter how accurately we can tell the time, it
doesn't solve the underlying problem that whatever it is we're doing right now always ends up taking longer
than we planned. Friends are miffed, jobs are lost, and other disastrous outcomes are the end result of this
phenomenon. Enter The Egg, a project by students at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, which takes a unique
approach to time management. Your egg represents the time left until an impending appointment by glowing with less and
less luminosity as the hour draws near. When you (inevitably) need to give yourself a bit of extra time, you turn our
egg upside down and shake it to add more light and, consequently, more time. Your egg then notifies the eggs of your
friends/contacts that you will be later than expected. Of course, this would be predicated on some ovarian future in
which we all have Eggs on our desktops, but then again, many of us have
even stranger things there already.
