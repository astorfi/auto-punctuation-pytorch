If you're an Xbox 360 owner that hoped to get your hands on a copy of Titanfall before the end of the month, we have some bad news: you're going to need to wait a little longer. EA announced today that for the second time in just over a month, the launch date will be pushed back, this time until April 8th in North America and April 11th in Europe. EA says the delay will help developer Bluepoint Games make things "even better." The game was originally due to hit stores on March 11th, but was delayed by two weeks to "put the finishing touches" on the current-gen title. What those finishing touches were, we don't know, but given reports of graphical imperfections on the Xbox One, Bluepoint's decision to push back the launch to "get the last details right" could be the right one.



This is EA making the right call, not the easy call. We all want the 360 to be good, it needed a bit more time. http://t.co/HB1sVe60sF
