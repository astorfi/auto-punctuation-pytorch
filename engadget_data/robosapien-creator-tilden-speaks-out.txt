Tilden sounds off on the Robosapien mods ("best potential hacks are installing stereocamera transmitters in the head"), life as an expat robot-maker in Hong Kong ("it's just a good thing I likedthe movie Blade Runner so much") and what's next for WowWee ("Actually it's all top secret, but it'll be good. Promise.") A great look at the man who made robots fun again (though he leaves out his plans for inevitable worlddomination).[Via Slashdot]
