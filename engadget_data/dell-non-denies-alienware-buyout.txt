Of course, he didn't actuallyoutright deny this; instead McKeon just listed a variety of reasons why he thought it wouldn't go down like Dell'sstrong brand, etc. Alienware was even less earnest, refusingto comment but stating straight up that "news stories like this are ultimately a strong positive reinforcement ofthe Alienware brand and the company's success." Great, glad this rumor is of service to your marketing department,Alienware. Now, someone want to fess up or deny this please?
