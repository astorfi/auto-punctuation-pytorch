Gaming accessory maker SteelSeries has a tradition of showcasing new products during conventions, and the firm will uphold it by unveiling the H-Series headset line at E3 2013. First in the series is the "tournament-grade" 9H headset with Dolby technology, a USB soundcard, and padded ear cushions that feature sound isolation technology. Next is the 5Hv3 headset that boasts a retractable microphone and the same sound isolation technology the 9H has. Finally, there's the compact and foldable 3Hv2 with its own retractable mic. All three are intended for use on Macs and PCs, but they have swappable ends or adaptors for use with mobile devices. Slated to be available by fall this year, the 9H is the priciest of the trio at $159.99. If you're not quite keen on paying that much for a pair of gaming cans though, you can grab the 5Hv3 and the 3Hv2 this summer for $79.99 and $39.99, respectively.

LOS ANGELES – E3 2013 – June 6, 2013 – Leading up to this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), SteelSeries, the leading global innovator of gaming peripherals and leading sponsor of global eSports, introduced the new H-Series Headset line. Delivering tournament-grade audio, the new headsets all feature custom-engineered soundscapes and the newest generation of SteelSeries audio drivers designed specifically to enhance audio performance and sound details. The flagship SteelSeries 9H with Dolby® Technology features up to 7.1 surround sound and tournament-grade audio performance with new sound isolating double enclosure earcup technology. Building off the legendary tournament and award-winning SteelSeries 5H, the new 5Hv3 and 3Hv2 headsets were designed for tournament grade audio with portability and extended comfort for the gamer that competes everywhere. The H-Series can be recognized by its industrial design, solidly constructed for best-in-class durability.

"The H-Series Headset line was introduced to the competitive gaming world in early 2005 with first-to-market features like the retractable microphone system and a custom engineered soundscape that was so good that the world tagged them as the cheating headsets, " said Bruce Hawver, SteelSeries CEO. "Twelve years ago we believed that eSports would see incredible growth and we designed entire product lines for this emerging market. Today, we introduce this next generation of competitive players to our new H-Series and believe that the audio experience, combined with the comfort and features, will set a new standard for today's competitive gaming headsets."
