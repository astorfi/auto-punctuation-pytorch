We keep seeing the same old thing made new in video
glasses/wearable displaysâ€”what can we say? Like most
other wearable displays (see: Mitsubishi's Scopo,
Second Sight,
Video Eyewear, Glasstron,
Eyetop Centra, etc.) some kind of video input
is provided to the Teleglass (in this case, they use a portable DVD player or digital camera as an example, though
specifics on interconnects are not mentioned), which then projects images the equivalent size of a 14-inch screen from
3 feet in your field of vision. We know there will always be a market for people so obsessed with video in their field
of vision that they'll wear sunglasses indoors, so it follows that they're just the kind who'll pony up the 470
some-odd dollars for the things. For the rest of us, well, we can all have a bit of a laugh at their expense and carry
on looking at our screens the old fashioned way.
