Griffin Technology has finally begun accepting pre-orders for the long-delayed iFM â€” an attachment for the iPod that
works as an FM radio, voice/radio recorder and remote control. The $49.99 unit had been announced by Griffin over two
years ago, and after taking pre-orders, the company cancelled it, blaming changes in the iPod's remote interface. The
new version will work with all 3G and 4G iPods, though recording won't work with the iPod mini.
