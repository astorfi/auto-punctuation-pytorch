 If you've been waiting for a way to get Sunday Ticket at home without signing up for DirecTV, congratulations because today is your day. The USA Today reports DirecTV is expanding access to its online streams from New York to the rest of the country this season. $350 buys a full slate of games available on PC or cellphone in up to 720p, however the only people allowed to sign up will be those who can verify they aren't able to access DirecTV, possibly because they aren't allowed to post a satellite dish or can't get a clear view to the south. Ordering for non-subscribers should start the week before the season, so keep an eye out until then.
