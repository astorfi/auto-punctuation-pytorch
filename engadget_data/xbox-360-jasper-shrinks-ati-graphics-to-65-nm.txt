 After Falcon, there's Jasper. At least that's how Dean Takahashi of the San Jose Mercury News claims the Xbox 360 timeline will progress. The Jasper motherboard is said to extend the 65-nm shrinkage to the ATI-built graphics chip. As the source for most of the Xbox's heat, that should make Jasper-based 360s more reliable than the existing 90-nm versions. The updated gaming rig will also pack physically smaller memory chips. With any luck, the lower material costs will hopefully be passed along to us when these pop for retail sometime around August 2008. [Via Joystiq]
