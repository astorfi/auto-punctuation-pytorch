This week it broke ground on DC 2, a four-story 193,000 square foot building that should be ready to go in 2014 with studios, control rooms with plans to take over as the new home of SportsCenter. There's no word on exactly what tech ESPN is putting in, but with ESPN 3D already up and running and the 1080p-ready LA studios plus MPEG-4 broadcast equipment ready to go, it wasn't a shock to hear Chuck asked people to "get used to hearing the term 4K TV." If you're not familiar with the name, check after the break for an Engadget Show segment we filmed with him in Bristol last year as well as a press release that rattles off his (long) list of accomplishments.
