 
To capture the true essence of a handset, we typically like our visual footage in-the-wild style -- but there's something to be said for the clean, refined appearance of a good press shot, too -- and on that note, well, here ya go. The shot clearly shows what could end up being the HTC Kaiser's revolutionary feature, a flip-up screen that adds another dimension (literally) to the form factor popularized by its predecessors, the venerable Wizard and Hermes. Of course, with HSUPA data on board, the trick screen is far from being the only hotness here, so it pretty much goes without saying that we're a little excited for the (planned) mid-year release in "P4550" HTC-branded trim.
