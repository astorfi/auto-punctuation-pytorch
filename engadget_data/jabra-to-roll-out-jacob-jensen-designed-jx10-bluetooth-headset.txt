In the race to get them to market, most makers of
Bluetooth headsets seem
to have settled on a pretty similar design, with the main point of differentiation being size. Now Jabra is trying to
grab some design cred, and has enlisted Denmark's
Jacob Jensen to add some style to their JX10.
Personally, we think it looks a little chunky, but at least Jabra hasn't given up on the size race: the JX10 weighs in
at about 10 grams, putting it in the same league as the Nextlink
Bluespoon and the Plantronics
Tahiti.
