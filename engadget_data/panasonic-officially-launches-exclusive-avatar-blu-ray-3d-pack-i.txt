Despite being the highest grossing 3D movie of all, it's still not available at retail and is unlikely to show up there anytime soon, sending the price of those pack-in copies skyrocketing on eBay as owners of non-Panasonic 3D capable TVs try to get their hands on the ultimate demo material. Many current auctions are above the $200 mark, while the highest sold price we saw was $399 about a week ago, although considering a copy of Bee Movie went for $400 back in the day, we can't say we're too surprised. Check out the details about Panasonic's current promotions on its highly rated HDTVs (and the demo tour that just started) in the press release after the break and bring your calculator, if Dances With Smurfs wasn't your cup of tea anyway, we might have found the perfect way to finance your new home theater upgrade.
