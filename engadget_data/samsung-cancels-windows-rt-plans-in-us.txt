 Well, the Windows RT tablet market just got a bit less crowded, as Samsung has confirmed to CNET that its ATIV Tab won't be sold or distributed in the US. The company's decision is based in part upon feedback from retail partners, which suggested that such a product would be only modestly successful in the marketplace. Samsung also pointed to the lack of education about Windows RT, and suggested that it would require too much of an investment to properly inform consumers of the differences between it and Windows 8. Instead, the company will take a wait and see approach to gauge how the Windows RT market develops -- we've heard this line before. It's currently unclear whether Samsung's decision will affect the availability of its Windows RT tablets in other markets.
