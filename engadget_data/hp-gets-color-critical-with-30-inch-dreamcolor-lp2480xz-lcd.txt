Now, however, HP's aiming to make a professional display that's actually somewhat affordable for the layman, and that monitor is the DreamColor LP2480xz. Checking in at 24-inches diagonal, this 30-bit, LED-backlit monster provides "a range of more than 1 billion colors" and "achieves more than 64 times the colors available on mainstream LCDs." It was designed in collaboration with DreamWorks Animation and comes bundled with the HP DreamColor engine software and calibration kit. Oh, and if you've been wondering just what the definition of "affordable" was, you can procure this one right now for a modest $3,499. Action shot after the cut.Update: Looks like we conflated that 30-bit spec with inches, post has been updated. We're also hearing this thing runs at a standard-for-its-size 1920 x 1200 pixels. Thanks to everyone who pointed this out.
