Amazon sure knows how to pique our interest -- it recently posted an invitation to a Boston recruiting event that, until an edit, teased the possibility of working on something "even bigger than Kindle." The original pitch (preserved by Boston.com) is all too short on details, but it hints at a first-generation digital media product co-developed by the hardware-focused Lab126 team in Sunnyvale, California. It's not just a souped-up Kindle Fire, then. So, what is it? A smartphone? A wireless network? We don't know; all that's certain is that Jeff Bezos has more surprises up his sleeve than just delivery drones.
