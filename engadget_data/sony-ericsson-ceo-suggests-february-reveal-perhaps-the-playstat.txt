"There's a lot of smoke, and I tell you there must be a fire somewhere," CEO Bert Nordberg told the Wall Street Journal, adding that some sort of new Sony Ericsson product will be unveiled at Mobile World Congress this February. While that particular item could easily be the 4.3-inch Anzu slate rather than a PlayStation slider phone, the chief executive didn't seem to shy away from video games in a series of additional quotes. "I haven't dug into that history, but the future might be brighter," he said when asked why the company didn't make a PlayStation Phone years ago, and later suggested that gaming might be the ticket to help SE diversify its offerings. "Sony is of course a very strong brand, and why shouldn't we use that?" he asked the Journal. We can't think of a single compelling reason, Mr. Nordberg. Bring on the games.
