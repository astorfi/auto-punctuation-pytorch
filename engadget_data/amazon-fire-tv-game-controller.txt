We all expected this, right? Yes, Amazon has a game controller, and it works with the company's newly announced Fire TV. Sure, you could use the set-top box's remote or an upcoming custom app to play games, but there's a dedicated controller too that's ready to wrangle Minecraft Pocket Edition, NBA 2K14 and titles from other big-name developers Ubisoft and Take-Two. "The controller is comfortable; it's familiar," noted Amazon Games' Mike Frazzini. As you might expect, this means that there's a four-button, dual-thumbstick and d-pad layout similar to the Xbox's option. With Amazon's offering, there are skip and play/pause media controls along the bottom edge with navigation controls placed front and center. There's even a GameCircle button that offers easy access to scores and achievements. And yes, dual triggers and a pair of shoulder buttons rest along the top edge. 






          
 
 
 Amazon's Fire wireless game controller runs on two AA batteries and touts 55 hours of juice before needing a rest -- thanks to "Intelligent power management with auto-sleep." The accessory will set you back an additional $40, but it'll come with 1,000 Amazon Coins and Sev Zero (an Amazon Game Studios third-person shooter) to get the action started. What's more, the outfit says that the average price of games on its platform is around $1.85 with over 1,000 free options to boot. That's good, because from the looks of things, Amazon's own game devs are hard at work on a truckload of titles that are "coming soon." If you're itching to place your order, jump over to the source link to do just that.
