Here are the major changes us lay folk are going to care about: 

Support for multiple Google and Exchange accounts
Third-party "sync adapters" allow apps to tie in to the phone's sync services
Quick contact menus for fast access to specific key pieces of contact information
Unified email inbox (yes!)
SMS and MMS search
Text message auto-delete after a user-defined thread size is reached
Significantly improved camera controls with white balance, macro, effects, and more
Improved keyboard layout, dictionary, and algorithm based on multi-touch support
Double-tap zoom in browser, support for HTML5
Bluetooth 2.1 support with addition of OPP and PBAP profiles
"Better" graphics hardware acceleration


Needless to say, we're extremely excited about the changes Google's made here -- and on top of the Droid, we can only hope this action is coming to legacy devices on the double. We'll find out soon enough (hopefully). Check a video of 2.0 in action after the break!
