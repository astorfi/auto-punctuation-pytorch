  Armed with some more interesting topics we once again try and broadcast the Engadget HD Podcast live via Ustream. Luckily this week we took a little different approach and did our best to ignore the chat until after we said what we had to say. Ultimately we think it turned out pretty good and are leaning towards making it a permanent part of the show -- but we'll wait on that decision until after we've read your comments. The highlight of the show this week was the DIY CableCARD PC news, which is really getting interesting. But we also talk about how silly the latest Vudu news is as well as how useless BD+ has turned out to be. Finally we talk a little TiVo, Hulu and DirecTV, so there really is a little of everything.
