It can check individual channel strength, whether you're properly paired and provisioned with the cable company and that you've been set up with all the channels you're paying for. The bad news is you probably won't be doing any of this, unless the software leaks or something changes, since it's only going to be available for the ($500 membership fee required) Media Center Integrator Alliance. For those who've dropped coin on a high end custom media center installation, it should cut the time and heartache installed significantly, but detailed help for the rest of us is in another castle.
