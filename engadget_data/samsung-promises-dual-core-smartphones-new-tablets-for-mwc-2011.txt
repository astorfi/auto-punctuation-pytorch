That show gets started on February 14th, but Sammy plans to get things going early with an announcement of dual-core smartphones and new tablets on February 13th. Such is the word straight from the company's mobile biz president, JK Shin, who says Samsung is "in a position to supply 4G smartphones and tablets to all the carriers in the US." Naturally, this 4G strategy will include both LTE and WiMAX, while another major prong of the company's future roadmap is to curtail its featurephone offering in favor of low-cost smartphone devices. Interesting times certainly lie ahead.
