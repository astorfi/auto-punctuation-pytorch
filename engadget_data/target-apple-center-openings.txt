A representative for the bullseye store told The New York Times that 25 locations will be getting what it describes as "extended displays." The mega-retailer refused to go into details, so far as what the areas will stock, but it will likely contain, at the very least, the iPads and iPhones the store already carries. Not word on an exact date, either, but the areas should be open before year's end.
