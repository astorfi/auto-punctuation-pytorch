 
You didn't forget did you? Today's the day that the WiFi-only iPad makes its inaugural appearance at Verizon. Whether it's the beginning of better days between the two US giants remains to be seen. As a reminder, Verizon's offer bundles a MiFi 2200 mobile hotspot with your choice of 16GB ($629), 32GB ($729), or 64GB ($829) iPads and 1GB ($20), 3GB ($35), or 5GB ($50) of data per month without contractual commitment. 

Of lesser interest is the fact that AT&T will also begin selling the WiFi + 3G version of the iPad today in 16GB ($629), 32GB ($729), and 64GB ($829) with contract-free data plans for 250MB of data ($14.99) or 2GB of data ($25) per month with free access to AT&T's 23,000+ domestic WiFi hotspots. AT&T's also offering international plans ranging from 20MB for $24.99 per month on up to 200MB for a staggering $199.99 per month.
