   Ice Cream Sandwich is slowly trickling out to the masses, but we're still waiting on the major phone vendors to come out with their own tweaks of the latest Android dessert. We've known that HTC's busy plugging away at its Sense-ified version of Android 4.0, but the company's finally ready to start discussing specifics. According to the outfit's UK Facebook page, the update will begin rolling out to the HTC Sensation and Sensation XE by the end of March, with the Sensation XL following suit. Additionally, owners of the EVO 3D, Incredible S, Desire S and Desire HD still haven't been forgotten, but their long-awaited upgrades to Ice Cream Sandwich will come sometime "later this year." That sure narrows down the timeframe. Hopefully we won't have to wait until the end of March to officially cast our eyes on the new Sense, as we're keeping our fingers crossed that we'll see some ICS love in new devices at Mobile World Congress later this month.  Update: HTC's US Facebook page also announced the update, and added the Rezound, Vivid, Amaze 4G and EVO Design 4G to the list of devices that should receive ICS later this year.  [Thanks, Willy]
