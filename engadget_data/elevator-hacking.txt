Calling this a hack is way too generous, but TheDamnBlog has a little tip for getting the most out of your next
elevator ride. Apparently lots of elevators have an express mode that lets you override everyone else's selections and
go straight to the floor you're going to.Â  You just press "Door Close" and the button for your floor at the same
time. Should work on most Otis elvators, as well as a few other models that are out there, but don't blame us when you
accidentally go plunging to your death (blame TheDamnBlog, if you must).
