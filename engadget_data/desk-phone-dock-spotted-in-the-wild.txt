 
Still harboring some lingering doubts that the Desk Phone Dock is as real as you hoped it to be? Then it looks like you can now cast those worries aside, as our pals at Engadget Chinese have spotted the device in the wild following its debut at the China Sourcing Fair. Unfortunately, there's still no word on a release date, but the dock will reportedly run $150 "or more," and it does seem to work just as promised, with the speaker at least loud to be heard on a crowded trade show floor. Head on past the break for a quick video, and hit up the source link for plenty more hands-on shots.
