 Duelling isn't the only thing the Japanese haveplanned in the nextdecade for robots in space. Apparently as reported by the Asahi Shimbun the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency(which we can only assume is tantamount to our own NASA) are taking action on their earlier intentions to build lunar and inter-planetaryexploration and colonization robots. Meaning they've gathered their team to develop robots with artificialintelligence to land on and explore the moon within 10 years, and independently colonize the joint within 20. But oncethese robots have completed their objective of taking over the moon, what makes the Japanese think they're gonna handit over just like that?
