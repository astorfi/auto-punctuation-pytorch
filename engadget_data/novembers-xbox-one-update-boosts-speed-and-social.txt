Microsoft has revealed new details on the major update coming to Xbox One this November. The tile-based Xbone dashboard that we've grown accustomed to since the days of the 360 will be replaced with a sleeker and faster UI based on Windows 10 and geared heavily towards social interactions. The company initially revealed the update back at E3 in August. The new dashboard will reportedly "get you to popular gaming features up to 50 percent faster," according to a recent post by Mike Ybarra, Director of Program Management for Xbox.




The high points of the update will include backwards compatibility for 100 Xbox 360 games with the ability to enter multiplayer games with folks still on the 360 (though we already knew that). Additionally, the Home screen and Guide have been revamped to enable players to jump into games and parties without waiting (though we already knew that too). What's more, the Community section will be rejiggered to allow users to see what their friends are up to through the redesigned Activity Feed (again, nothing new here). What you may not have already heard about is the Xbox's new OneGuide which lists trending live TV shows and now includes picture-in-picture. The Store has also been re-optimized to help you spend money faster with clear and concise categories as well as a new vertical gallery view.
