The previously unheard of VAIO model PCG-11111L is definitely a Sony of some sort complete with CDMA850 and CDMA1900 courtesy of Qualcomm's Gobi silicon. Just don't get your hopes up that it'll be sporting Qualcomm's latest chipsets with HSPA+ and LTE coverage as it looks like those frequencies will be locked out with the help of some rather unhelpful firmware at launch. It'll also be packing 802.11b/g/n WiFi and Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR whenever it does make its first appearance, which, by the looks of a very specific confidentiality request, will be on around May 13th at a Sprint or Verizon retail store. Check the radio bill of materials and CDMA2000 declaration after the break if that's what turns you on... really, that's cool, we're not going to judge.

Update: Looks like PCG-11112L has joined the party, but its only claim to fame is "acting as slave and operating on 2.4GHz band." Sorry, no EVDO for this one.
