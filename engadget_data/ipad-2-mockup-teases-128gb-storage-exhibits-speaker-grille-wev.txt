We've just come across our second iPad 2 mockup, this one a lot more comprehensive than the first, which seems to mesh well with some earlier imagery we've seen of the supposed next-gen Apple tablet. Not only that, its rear label reveals an A1337 product code -- one that's also shared by the current iPad WiFi + 3G -- and lists 128GB of onboard storage, two times the current tablet's maximum. We don't know what material it's made out of, but it felt felt the same as the current iPad's aluminum shell. All that said, this is still just a mockup from a no-name accessory maker and we're just as willing to believe it was put together on the basis of some decent rumor research as we are to think that it really is the iPad 2. No harm in browsing some pictures of this 9.4mm-thick device, though eh?
