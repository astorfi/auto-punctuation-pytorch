We'll also have Engadget auto editor Tim Stevens, a very special guest from IBM's Watson team, hot new devices, crazy giveaways, and much more! We've also got amazing chiptune music from Note! and visuals from Batsly Adams. You seriously don't want to miss it.

Update: That's all, folks!
Update 2: We're sorry about the poor quality stream some people saw; we had some network issues that slowed it down.
