That's a bit later than the the summer release that had been anticipated, but that date apparently had to be pushed back after the company was forced to change transmission vendors. This latest delay also follows a slight scaling back of range targets earlier this year, although neither set-back seems to have been enough to get any of the 600 or so buyers already lined up to ask for their $100,000 back. According to Reuters, Tesla plans to make 1,000 2008 model year cars, which you'll soon be able to check out a dealership likely not near you. After that, the company plans to produce a five-passenger sedan dubbed the "White Star," which it says will sell for between $50,000 and $65,000, although likely not before the 2010 model year at the earliest.[Via Motor Authority]
