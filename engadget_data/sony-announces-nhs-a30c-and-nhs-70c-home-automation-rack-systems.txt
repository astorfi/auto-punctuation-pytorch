That said, even the laypeople in attendance can sneak over to "that guy's house" and check out one of Sony's two new fully-featured NHS rack systems. Picking up where the $85,000 NHS-130C left off, the NHS-A30C and NHS-70C are fully integrated racks that come pre-built, wired, tested and ready for installation. They provide Control4 home automation integration, iPod support, 5.1-channel surround sound (7.1 in the 70C), a built-in Blu-ray deck and a second zone of HD video (and a third for audio). The 70C also adds in a 400-disc DVD / CD changer, 160GB music server and room for three auxiliary devices like a cable set-top-box or PlayStation 3. Best of all, the prices on these are much more manageable than the aforementioned predecessor -- the A30C will run between $15,000 and $30,000, while the 70C rings up between $30,000 and $50,000. Full release after the cut.
