New specs in the filing are hard to come by, but everything we already knew is there -- baby-brother U73T sports a 4.3-inch display, while the U83T gets a 4.8-inch screen, Bluetooth, and an accelerometer to allow the unit to keep the guidance going even when the GPS signal fades. No word on pricing or availability, but you know we just love the pretty pictures anyways.
