   Been having WiFi troubles ever since you gave your Nook Simple Touch the old 1.1 upgrade? You are not alone. Barnes & Noble confirmed what e-reader forum frequenters have known since last year -- the firmware upgrade has done a number on some users' connectivity. The bookseller told us that it's aware of the issue and that its team is working "diligently" to address the issue. In the meantime, enjoy the video of a corgi puppy embedded after the break.  [Thanks, Dina]
