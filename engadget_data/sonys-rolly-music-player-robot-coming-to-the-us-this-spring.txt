As we've extensively detailed, the odd little oval is packed with all kinds of zany abilities, not the least of which is playing MP3 or AAC files via Bluetooth with A2DP off of its 2GB (which is an improvement on the Japanese version's 1GB) of flash memory. No word on price right now, but you won't care once you see how darn cute the little guy is.
