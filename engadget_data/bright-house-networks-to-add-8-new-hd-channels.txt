 Just like we've come to expect, when Time Warner Cable adds new channels, so does Bright House Networks. And, the latest addition is eight new HD channels that we've recently seen added to other nationwide providers. We know TBS HD is already live in at least one BHN market, but we don't know exactly when the rest of these channels will be launched which include; Food Network, History Channel, HGTV, Discovery Science, The Learning Channel, Discovery and Animal Planet. Still no word on CNN HD, but we'd bet it is added before too long.
