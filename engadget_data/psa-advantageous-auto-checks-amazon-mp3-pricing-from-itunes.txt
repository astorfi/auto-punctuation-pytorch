Yeah, it's not perfect -- it fails if you're logged in with iTunes store credit and it's far from bulletproof otherwise -- but it's a fine way to at least have kids or the less computer-savvy stop and check prices with at least one competitor before laying down an extra thirty cents on each purchase. This is has been a public service announcement... with guitars.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]Read - Advantageous for WindowsRead - Advantageous for Mac
