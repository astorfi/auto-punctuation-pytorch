What a tease. Brand director Hashimoto-san, who's worked on the likes of Kingdom Hearts, Chrono Trigger and a raft of Final Fantasy titles over the years, took to the stage. And what did he have to tell us? Could Square Enix be working on yet another Final Fantasy title for Sony's new PlayStation 4? Well, yes. Naturally. But that was about it, adding that they are "preparing for development of a Final Fantasy title. Please be excited for E3 this year." What's another few months? Right?
