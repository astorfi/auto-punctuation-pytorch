The site doesn't provide specific release dates for the systems (the $699.99, 40GB SSD equipped 1000, and the $649.99, 80GB HDD equipped 1000H), though we're figuring it can't be too long till these models hit shipping centers. In the meantime, we recommend going for long jogs.Read - ASUS Eee PC 1000 40GRead - ASUS Eee PC 1000H 80G[Via I4UNews]
