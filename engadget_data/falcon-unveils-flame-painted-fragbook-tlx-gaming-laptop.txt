 Falcon Northwest has unveiled the FragBook TLX which, as you can probably tell by the name, targets Falcon's traditional audience of hardcore gamers. Similar to its FragBook desktop replacement brethren, the TLX is based around a 17-inch, 1680 x 1050 LCD; but unlike the DR model, the TLX has a relatively diminutive design. At only 1.5-inches thick and weighing 7-pounds, it's certainly not what you'd call an ultraportable, but then again, most ultraportables don't feature the TLX's 2.33GHz Core 2 Duo processor, up to 160GB of hard drive storage and 2GB of RAM, nor the nVIDIA GeForce 7600 GO graphics card with 256MB of video RAM. The combination of thinness and performance doesn't come cheap though, as the starting price of the TLX is $3,516. Those of you who really want to burn money -- and be able to prove that you did so -- can opt for an optional flame painted color scheme for $426.[Via Techie Diva]
