Notably, this puppy lacks the white bezel we'd seen in the European rumor, but regardless, it's still a whole lot paler than any version we've seen launch thus far. No word yet on what sort of space-age materials, science, and technology went in to getting this thing manufactured as of press time; if your interest is sufficiently piqued, SKT is the carrier you're going to want to hit up.
