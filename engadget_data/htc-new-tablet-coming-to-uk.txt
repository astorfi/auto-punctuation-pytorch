The Flyer remains the last tablet to arrive -- due to a lack of 4G networks, the Jetstream didn't make the trip across the Atlantic. It remains a very vague tease, with no promise of a launch even within the year and not even a nod to whether the OS will be Android or something else altogether. HTC's apparently holding back until it has something unique to offer, a strategy that other companies seem to be following in a bid to avoid the pile of tablet also-rans.
