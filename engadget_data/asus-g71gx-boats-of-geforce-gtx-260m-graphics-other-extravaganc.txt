The 17-inch laptop packs a WUXGA (1920 x 1200) resolution, backed up by a brand-new NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260M graphics card with 1GB of VRAM. There's also room for 12GB of RAM and dual 500GB hard drives inside, along with Blu-ray and Altec Lansing speakers to wrap it up with a bow. No word on price, but we're guessing ASUS isn't stuffing these things in cereal boxes.[Via iTech News Net]
