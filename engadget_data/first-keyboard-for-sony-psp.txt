Our sister site Joystiq gets the goods on the first PSP keyboard… what goods
there are to be had, anyway. It's a 47-key foldaway keyboard that doubles as a screen protector, and additionally
enables usage of the PSP as a handheld or desktop unit. The actual "features" column on the Gameseek site is
maddeningly empty, though, so there's not too much else we can tell you other than that it looks suspiciously cramped
for anyone who is manually well-endowed. Get your minds out of the gutter, people — we're talking about hands, dig?
