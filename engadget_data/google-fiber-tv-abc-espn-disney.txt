The official list of the first "fiberhoods" Google's Gigabit internet + TV service will be available in doesn't come out until tomorrow, but it's already looking like an even more attractive option thanks to a few newly announced channel additions. The team's blog post lists several ABC channels that will be available on the HDTV service, not the least of which is sports giant ESPN, along with ESPN2, Classic, Goal Line, Buzzer Beater, Deportes, ESPNews, Longhorn Network and ESPNU. We've confirmed ESPN3 is also included, while WatchESPN and WatchDisney mobile access is planned for the "near future." Overall it appears that ABC has squeezed its entire bundle including the Disney channels into the lineup (check the list after the break). That may not curry favor with those hoping for some revolutionary a la carte options, but should make switching to the $120 bundle easier for sports fans and families. Check the original launch announcement for more details on the Nexus 7-controlled service that blends standard TV and streaming options if you're pondering a move to Kansas City.



Newly Added Channels: ABC Family, ABC News Now, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, ESPN, ESPN Buzzer Beater, ESPN Classic, ESPN Deportes, ESPN Goal Line, ESPN2, ESPNews, ESPNU, Longhorn Network, Ovation, SOAPnet, TBN, TBN Enlace, Velocity
