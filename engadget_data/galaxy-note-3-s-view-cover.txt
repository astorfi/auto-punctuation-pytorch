Samsung is launching a new S View Cover to go with its equally new Galaxy Note 3. The protector includes an extra-large window for controlling the smartphone while the cover is closed; you can even use the S Pen in this mode. The accessory will ship in a wide variety of colors, including seasonal collections, metallic hues and special variants designed by Moschino and Nicholas Kirkwood. Samsung hasn't provided launch details for the covers, although we'd expect them to ship at the same time as the Note 3 itself.
