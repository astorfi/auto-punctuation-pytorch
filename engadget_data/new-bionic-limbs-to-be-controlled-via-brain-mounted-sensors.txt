 Researchers at Osaka University are redefining "thought-controlled" limbs. Hailed as the first endeavor to dabble in the world of bionic phalanges by requiring open-skull surgery, the research is seeking to develop "real-time mind-controlled robotic limbs for the disabled." Of course, it's not the goal that's striking, but the means. Essentially, gurus working on the project are hoping to place electrode sheets directly on the surface of the brain in order to "obtain a more accurate signal," and amazingly enough, they're currently working to sign up willing subjects that are already scheduled to have brain electrodes added to deal with "monitoring epilepsy or other conditions." Maybe the bionic beings really aren't that far off, eh?[Via Pink Tentacle]
