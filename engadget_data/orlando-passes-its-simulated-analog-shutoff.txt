For the benefit of viewers, the stations broadcast a 10-second long pass/fail message for analog and digital viewers, respectively. The two Cox stations in the group, WFTV and WRDQ, reported that only 501 viewers called in to register their outrage at the brief interruption. Fully 146 of those calls came from analog Comcast customers who are fed a retransmitted OTA analog broadcast of WFTV. The second most popular group of complaints, 123 callers, were legitimate, though -- older TVs that pick up OTA-only. All said, it's a pretty good sign that the world will still be turning come February 18th.
