Baby brother 401 will sell for $129 and has a 4.3-inch screen and four million preloaded POIs, while the $169 501 bumps it up to 4.7 inches and 12 million. Both have Mio's newish "Spirit" interface, but we're most intrigued by the repeated mentions of gas price searching and Google Send to GPS in the docs we were leaked, which suggest integration with a service like MSN Direct. We'll find out soon -- these are set to land in Radio Shack in mid-May.Update: Mio just pinged us to say that these prices are wrong, but they didn't tell us anything else, so stay tuned.[Thanks, Anonymous]
