However, we can't help but be a little dubious of such claims. As near aswe can tell, it's basically a humidifier coupled with an ionizer. Even if the device is able to kill viruses in the airover a limited space, it's still not going to stop you from getting sick via more common causes like getting sneezed onat close range or just shaking hands or touching a contaminated object. We think you'd do better following your mom'sadvice and washing your hands frequently and keeping them away from your face during the flu season. But we're stillsure Sanyo's going to sell a lot of these; after all, Sharper Image hasproven that an air-cleaning system doesn't need to be effective to be a big seller. And as much as we'd like tothink otherwise, we suspect that Japanese consumers will be as gullible as their American counterparts.[ViaAkihabara News]
