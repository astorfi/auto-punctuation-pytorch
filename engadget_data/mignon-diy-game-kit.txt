In direct contrast to the philosophy of building
locked, proprietary gaming systems, the
Mignon game kit has as its core philosophy that of the DIY designer/hacker/programmer. The kitset was created by Olaf
Val to allow console owners to develop highly individual and personal relationships with their devices through the
process of construction and self-production of a minimalist "gameboy"-like unit. Ideal for first time forays into
micro-electronics as well as advanced game programming, the Mignon kit is incredibly reasonably priced, starting at
about $37 for a bare bones kit on up to $89 for the deluxe version.
