Ever since Apple added some leeway (and snark!) to its App Store submission rules, the approved apps have become increasingly more interesting: Google Voice clients, a Commodore 64 emulator, and now the VLC Media Player with claims to support "nearly all codec there is." We've spent a few minutes with the program already, and while it's import method is reminiscent of CineXPlayer (i.e. via the Apps tab), the thumbnail-rich interface is much prettier. Official launch date is tomorrow, but we've had no problem downloading from the US and UK stores already, so go ahead and give it a whirl. Or if not, our gallery is below.
