 Anyone who checks Google Now compulsively on a Jelly Bean-equipped Android phone might have noticed a surprise appear while they were checking for directions home from that big Halloween bash. An unannounced pedometer card has surfaced that shows just how many miles we (or our phones) have been biking or walking in a given month, with the intent clearly to spur couch dwellers into action. The discovery at Droid-Life reveals that Google has been using the GPS information it already had to catalog our athletic progress since at least September -- a bit creepy, but not shocking when the positioning is already needed for directions. As for the mileage figure you see above? It's not this writer's only phone, so that distance is much lower than it should be. Really. Honest.
