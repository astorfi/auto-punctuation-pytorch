Now company chairman Jonney Shih has confirmed not only one tablet, but two. "Netbooks are the best combination of personal computing and cloud computing, but between netbooks and smartphones and e-readers, we think there will be a space for something like a tablet or slate PC." This is where ASUS will insert a pair of models set to be unveiled sometime this year. One is said to run a Google OS of some sort, either Android or Chrome, the other running Windows. We're expecting some level of hardware differentiation between the two as well, but at this point we don't know anything else -- except that the Google flavored version "will have a lot of media." We like media.
