LetsGoDigital calls the XS the XSi's "twin brother" on the outside, with only minor differences between the two like the smaller 2.5-inch screen on the XS. On the inside, the XS is fairly similar to the XTi, with a 10.1 megapixel resolution, but Live View, DIGI III and auto ISO to keep things interesting. The 17.7 ounce weight is the lightest ever for a Canon DSLR, with a tiny battery and only SD card memory, and the price should be similarly miniscule when the XS lands this July.
