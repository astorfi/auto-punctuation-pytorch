(Then again, Sony's contribution also made a cameo earlier this week at a Best Buy event, but we digress.) The event's invite is vague on the "line of products" (note: plural) it'll be showing, but we'd venture a guess that Revue has already RSVPd and been promised some stage time. With any luck, the Lonely TV will MC the proceedings -- hey, we can dream.
