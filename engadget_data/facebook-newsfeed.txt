In an unsurprising revelation, it turns out your Facebook news feed is watching you almost as much as you watch it. The Menlo Park-based company announced today that it is "improving" its news feature by taking into account not just whether someone liked or commented on an article but also by how much time they spent reading it. "Just because someone didn't like, comment or share a story in their News Feed doesn't mean it wasn't meaningful to them," Facebook explains."There are times when, for example, people want to see information about a serious current event, but don't necessarily want to like or comment on it."



This relevance weighting adjustment is more than just a fancy digital timer. To account for slow internet connections, the system will compare how long you look at a particular story versus your general browsing habits. The company says that this way, it can better identify which posts are actually important to you. The feature is currently rolling out and will continue to do so over the next few weeks, so you can judge for yourself its impact on what you see.
