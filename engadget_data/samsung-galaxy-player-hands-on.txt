Samsung's showing off its Korea-bound Galaxy Player at CES today and we've got to say, it's almost indistinguishable from the European Galaxy S handset. The small differences include the addition of a second speaker on the back of this device, offering a stereo sound experience when you're away from your headphones and, of course, a retractable TV antenna (it's for the Korean market, after all). Availability is set for this month in Samsung's home nation, but our queries about US plans were unfortunately met with uncertainty. Samsung says nothing's yet been announced for bringing this creation to retail shelves in North America, but the gallery is right here and right now.
