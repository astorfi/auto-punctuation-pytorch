 We have no ideawhy they chose today to do it, but today seven major movie studios announced they'll be selling movies online throughMovielink and CinemaNow. Warner Bros, Universal, Sony, Paramount, Fox, and MGMwill all be distributing first-run titles online -- definitely something they've never done before -- through Movielinkfor between 20 and 30 bones (way, way too much if you ask us), with older movies going for between $10 and $20.Lionsgate (and Sony) also announced distribution through CinemaNow. Really this was only a matter of time -- for theseguys it was either sell these things online DRMed all to hell for way too much money (see above), go the subscriptionroute (like Vongo, for example -- not likely) or continue whiningwithout any justification whatsoever about pirates stealing movies in the Internet. At least now they can say they'velegitimately offered their digital content up online (hey, you can even make a DVD backup for use only onMovielink-authorized computers), even though they still can't account for the artificial demand they try to create byreleasing movies for purchase months after the films have gone out of theater.[Thanks, Phil]
