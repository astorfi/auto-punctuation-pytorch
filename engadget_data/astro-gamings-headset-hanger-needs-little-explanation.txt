In fact, we dare any HP Blackbird owner to give the read link a look and not have even the slightest desire to pick this here gizmo up. The Headset Hanger, contrary to popular belief, actually isn't a makeshift racing wheel; rather, it's designed to be the first (and only, probably) accessory to bolt directly onto the Blackbird's built-in VESA-compliant hardpoint. The purpose? To hold your gaming headphones, which would obviously be the A40s if Astro had any say in the matter. You could spend $19.95 on this just to satisfy your curiosity, but we'd recommend just glancing through the gallery a time or two until you're over it.
