It's official: the news just broke a few minutes ago that IBM is indeed selling their PC business to Chinese
computer maker Lenovo. IBM settled for $650 million in cash and $600 million in Lenovo stock, a deal with gives IBM
ownership of 18.9% of Lenovo. Lenovo gets all the associated "Think" trademarks, like for the ThinkPad and the
ThinkCenter, and will hire on 10,000 or so of the employees in IBM's PC division. We're curious to see what Lenovo will
end up doing with the ThinkPad, but we're even more curious to see what IBM decides to do next.
