That consists of a typically RED-looking base station, along with either a CompactFlash card reader module or a 2.5-inch SSD / hard drive reader, or both. Each of those modules also naturally packs an ample supply of ports, including not one but two FireWire 800 ports, and a single eSATA and mini USB port. Of course, all that doesn't exactly come cheap, with each piece of the puzzle set to run about $250 when they roll out on April 16th. RED isn't quite done with NAB just yet, however, as it also plans to show off a working EPIC camera at the show.
