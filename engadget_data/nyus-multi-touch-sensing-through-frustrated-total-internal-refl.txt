Then we decided to give the linked vid a look, and discovered that NYU'sMulti-Touch Sensing through Frustrated Total Internal Reflection Display (1. We swear that's what it's really called,and 2. Can any marketing majors out there please give these guys a hand?) is way cooler than Trivia Whiz or Photo Hunt.Using a rear-projector that throws an image onto a screen similar in composition toÂ  fingerprint scanners, Jeff Hanand his team at the Media Research Laboratory have built a scalable system that allows multiple points of input by oneor more users (think: digital conference table). Some of the stuff they do in the video is wild, such as two-handedscratching of digital turntables, and future iterations of the project will attempt finger-specific recognition for aneven higher degree of flexibility.[Thanks, Ryan]
