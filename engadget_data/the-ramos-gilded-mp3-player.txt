For whatever reason dunking our laptops in molten platinum is proving more difficult than getting our first pair of
Adidas bronzed, so until we figure a better way to sate our Midas-like obsession, we're forced to buy only what are
invariably the most tacky of
gaudy of
ridiculous consumer electronics. Like the RAmos,
for example, a gold-plated number available in sizes up to 2GB. Who cares what it does, man, it's freaking
gold.
