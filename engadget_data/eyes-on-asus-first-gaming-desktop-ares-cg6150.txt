The ARES CG6150 is said to offer "breathtaking performance in a menacing armor-cladded case." We'll see. One thing's for sure, they've taken more than a few design hints from Alienware. Republic of gamers, unite!Update: Details are in. Under the armor you'll find a Core 2 Extreme CPU with support for up to 8GB of DDR3 memory, NVIDIA's 3-way SLI graphic technology, up to 4 Terabytes of hard disk, Dual Power power modules and liquid cooling. Grrr.
