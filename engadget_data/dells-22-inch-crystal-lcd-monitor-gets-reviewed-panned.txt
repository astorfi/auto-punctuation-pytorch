Said to have exhibited "absurd glare, low grayscale range and fussy touch-buttons" the 22-inch stunner frustrated critics beyond the point of forgiveness. More specifically, the glare was said to be so bad while watching dark scenes in a film that it "destroyed the picture." To its credit, it did manage to present ultra-vivid colors and an accurate dynamic contrast, but those two bright spots were far from being enough to overcome the negatives. Needless to say, the unit did well to fetch the 5 out of 10 score that was bestowed upon it, and based upon what we're hearing, we'd highly recommend checking one of these out in person before buying this thing on appearances alone.
