One unnamed source reports that such devices would be a "means to an end," meant to enable easy purchasing of Amazon's content, which currently includes music, movies, and digital books. The source said that CEO Jeff Bezos' intent for Lab 126 was initially to build multiple devices -- including apparent discussions to enter the mobile phone market -- but that the Kindle eventually became the main hardware focus. The report also notes that Amazon's hardware division currently has about 80 job openings, which would lend credence to the idea that more devices could be on the way.
