The team at Gogo is flying high lately both in the sky and on the ground thanks to its new hybrid GTO technology, which brings in-air download speeds up to 60 Mbps. To test the future of in-flight WiFi, Gogo uses the "Gogo One," a flying laboratory that comes outfitted with some pretty intense equipment.




Not content to keep the fun to itself, though, Gogo is flying one lucky person to our Engadget Expand New York event, taking place November 9th and 10th, where Gogo will be running demos on the show floor. Just meet Gogo at its home base outside Chicago, and climb aboard -- in addition to networking gear hidden in a closet, you'll find comfy couches, complete with custom-embroidered throw pillows.


Here's how it works. Head over to the sweepstakes on our Engadget Expand Facebook Page and complete the entry form. That's it. We're keeping things simple. You have until October 23rd at 11:59 PM ET to enter. What do the winner(s) get?
