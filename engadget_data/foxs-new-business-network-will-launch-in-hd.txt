We're not sure how many newly created networks had both an SD and HD simulcast of their channel from day one, but when Fox Business News launches next month it will. Like most newly launched networks, only DirecTV is listed as having a carriage agreement, but we'd expect to see it pop up on other providers as well. And, unlike some other business networks, this one will actually have HD video.
