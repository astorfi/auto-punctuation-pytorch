A few more details about that E Ink wristwatch from Seiko
Epson are coming in from Japan. The watch will be called the "Seiko Spectrum," and it's set to be released on
January 27, 2006 in Japan. Save your money for this one â€” pricing is set at 262,500 yen, or around $2,200 USD. Or just,
you know, wait until they get cheaper. At least it's a step in the right direction; there's not really much room to
argue against the advantages electronic ink provides over conventional displays for these kinds of applications. By the
way, if you do want one of these watches, get moving: only 500 will be produced.
