 Intel may be the big winner today, given
Apple's announcement that they're going to ditch the
PowerPC processor for Intel's chips, but that doesn't mean IBM, which makes the PowerPC, is the day's only loser.
Transmeta — which once seemed
poised to take on Intel with its low-power Crusoe processor — is selling its processor business to China's Culturecom
Technology. Transmeta will still hang around, as it attempts to rebuild its business around its power-saving
technology, but all-in-all, it's definitely been a very nice day for Intel.
