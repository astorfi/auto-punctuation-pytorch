Sure, 9.2-inches is a decent bit of display as far as these setups go, and the 800 x 480 widescreen resolutionis welcome, but with as hot as the 360gets already, we don't think it'll take very kindly to having its side vents sealed off by a hunk of plastic. Wealso can't imagine this thing riding on your lap while you game in the backseat of your next roadtrip, but it doesn'tlook like even JoyTech would presume that, and instead probably hope to squeeze this into a few tight dorm rooms thatwould otherwise resign to being entries in Xbox 360 Fanboy's most pathetic 360 setupcontest.[Via Xbox 360Fanboy]
