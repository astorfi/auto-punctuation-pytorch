 The 57th Miss USA Pageant will make the jump to high definition for the first time April 11 at 9 p.m. on NBC. Live from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas via Sony HDTV cams, contestants are judged in the usual three categories -- swim suit, evening gown and interview -- and judged by a panel of "stars" including an NFL player, one of the Back Street Boys, Rob Schneider, a celebrity hairstylist and others. Hosted by the Osmonds, we'll tune in at least for the sometimes tricky interview segment.
