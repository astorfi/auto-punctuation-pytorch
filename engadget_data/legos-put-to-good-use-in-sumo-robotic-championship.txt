Bots compete head to head, ramming each other out of the ring -- or more often than not, blindly searching for an opponent to ram. Seven bots competed in the second round of the fights, and "No Screwdriver Needed" was on the scene with play-by-play video and snarky commentary. Our personal fave? "The Bird," which attempts to fool its opponents into climbing over its deployed wings. Who knew Legos and subterfuge mixed so well?
