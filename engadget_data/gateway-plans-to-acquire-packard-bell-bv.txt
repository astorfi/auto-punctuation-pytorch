The computer giant first gained the ROFR in Summer of 2006, in an agreement made with the former owner of eMachines, Lap Shun (John) Hui. Apparently, Mr. Hui proposed sale of the his share in PB Holding Company, S.ar.l, based on a price offered by a mysterious "third party." It's all becoming clear to us now... Acer is interested in purchasing Gateway so they can get to the diamond-in-the-rough that is Packard Bell! Very sneaky guys.
