This Batmobile (circa Batman Forever) is hand-built by a sculptor named Bob Causey and features a retractable hard top, a high-tech interior (including three LCD displays) and, the builder assures us, is actually road worthy. If anything, this guy should provide the perfect vehicle for your neurosis. Because, let's face it -- this whole donning Lycra Spandex and looking for people to beat up act? It's a cry for help.
