It seems AT&T tethering wasn't the only thing hidden in iPhone OS 4.0 beta 4 -- 9to5Mac found a variety of telltale references to an a flash when pouring through the update's source code. Does that mean that the iDevices will actually get cameras, let alone supporting light fixtures? It's too early to tell... but we did spot an LED flash on that early iPhone HD, and a recent Vietnamese leak proves that Apple at least prototyped an iPod touch with a camera -- though no flash, sadly -- as well. Is Apple simply updating their error messages, or is there something to this? You make the call.
