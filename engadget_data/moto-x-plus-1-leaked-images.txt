Want a good, clear look at one of the devices Motorola is expected to unveil at its September 4th event? You've got it. As a parting shot, retiring leaker Evan Blass (aka @evleaks) has posted press images for Motorola's next big flagship smartphone, frequently known as the X+1. It largely confirms what previously appeared in some dimly-lit photos, including dual camera flashes, a wooden back option and Moto E-style front-facing speakers. There are a couple of new tidbits, though. The Verizon logo leaves no doubts about one of the supporting US carriers, and we're curious about those dots on the top and bottom bezels -- are they Fire phone-like face tracking cameras, plain old screws or something else? You'll get the full scoop in a couple of weeks, but this serves as a nice (if very unofficial) teaser.
