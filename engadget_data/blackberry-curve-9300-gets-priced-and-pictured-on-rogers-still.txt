We're looking at a quad-band GSM and HSDPA 850/1900/2100 candybar with 802.11n WiFi, GPS, 256MB of RAM, a 2 megapixel camera, microSD expansion (2GB in the box), and 2.4-inch display throwing 320 x 240 pixels. And no, that's not the latest and greatest OS which makes us wonder about the possibility for a BlackBerry 6 upgrade. Maybe T-Mobile USA would like to say something, anything? 

[Thanks, Samir A.]
