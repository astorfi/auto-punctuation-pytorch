Wacom has released what may be the Cadillac of LCD graphics tablets. The 21-inch Cintiq 21UX tablet has a 1600x1200 display, can handle a full range of pen input from forms entry to animation, and works with Macs and PCs. While graphic artists may find themselves drooling over this, for $3K, we can't help but wish they'd included Bluetooth, so we wouldn't have to be tethered to our computer via a USB cable.
