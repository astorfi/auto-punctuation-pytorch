If you haven't already updated your Apple TV to version 6.0, you'll have to wait: Cupertino has discreetly pulled the software upgrade. Although no official statement has been made, users on Twitter have been reporting connectivity issues and accidental resets throughout the weekend. An unlucky few even saw their devices bricked entirely. Now, manually checked boxes report that version 5.3 is "up to date." There's no word yet when a more stable version of the software will be available for download, but when it is, it should bring users the AirPlay from iCloud support (for devices running iOS 7) and iTunes Radio access Apple promised on Friday.
