It is also a great example that some new releases will sell much better to the Blu-ray audience than to the more general audience of DVD. Alvin and the Chipmunks only slightly outsold the three week old I Am Legend on Blu-ray, while at the same time, the SD version outpaced its counterpart by almost 10:1. So it seems more likely that overall Blu-ray sales were down -- rather then red being up -- when you compare the Red vs Blu chart, as Red has its best week in almost a month at 36 percent. The other stat that enforces this is the fact that unlike the last time Red had this much market share, not one HD DVD made the top ten. We expect much of the same next week considering the releases, but will be interested to see if Warner's I Am Legend will see any success on the now defunct HD DVD.
