After some delays, at least one British retailer now has those official HTC-branded units in stock -- you won't have any place inside the phone to stow it, of course, but we're sure you'll figure something out. Heck, even if you do end up losing it, they'll be more than happy to charge you 17 quid (about $28) for another, so rest easy and keep those digits toasty.
