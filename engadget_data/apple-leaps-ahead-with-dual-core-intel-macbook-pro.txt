That's right. Breaking from itslong-standing PowerBook and iBook labels, Apple has created a whole new brand to commemorate its first Intel-basedportable. As expected, the new portable is powered by an Intel Core Duo processor at either 1.67 or 1.83GHz, 512MB -2GB RAM, built-in iSight, FrontRow, FireWire 400, two USB 2.0 ports, ExpressCard/34, MagSafe power, 802.11g (AirPortExtreme), Bluetooth 2.0 EDR), gigabit Ethernet, backlit keyboard, Apple remote input, 15.4-inch 1440 x 900 display, ATIMobility Radeon X1600 with either 128 or 256MB of RAM and dual-link DVI (for 30-inchers), an 80GB or 100GB drive, anddual-layer DVD burner. It'll cost $2,000 or $2,500 to start. It's an inch thick. It weighs 5.6 pounds. It'll runWindows. We think we're in love.
