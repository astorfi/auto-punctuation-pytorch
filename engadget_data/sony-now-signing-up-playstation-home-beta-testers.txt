Apparently not everyone who applies will be accepted (shocker, right?), but it's good to know at least there's some movement in PS3rd Life Home process. Let us know if you get an invite, and definitely let us know if you get accepted.P.S. -Sorry, we don't have a link to share at this time, the invites seem to be per-user.[Thanks, Dustin]
