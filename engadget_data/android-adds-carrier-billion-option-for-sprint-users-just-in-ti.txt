The same courtesy has already been extended to T-Mobile users of Google's OS back in 2009 and then to AT&T in 2010, and now Dan Hesse's crew is joining in on the credit card-hating action. Right now, this new payment option is only for splashing cash in the Android Market, however its availability ties in neatly with Google's recent acquisition of PushLife, a music store service that has carrier billing for track purchases as one of its core features. Another brick laid in the foundations of a Google Music service? Let's hope so.
