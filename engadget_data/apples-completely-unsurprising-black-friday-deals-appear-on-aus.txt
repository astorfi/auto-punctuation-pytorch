It looks like the biggest cut will be on the new MacBooks and iMacs -- up to $100 off, with some smaller discounts on iPods and the Apple TV. Everything else falls pretty much in line with what we've seen in previous years. It's nothing terribly exciting or unexpected for sure, so if you were thinking about busting down the doors in search of a $7 iPhone tomorrow morning, you might want to cuddle in for a few extra winks instead.
