 UHDV, or Ultra High Definition Video might be the next big thing after our HDTV transition. UHDV boasts a mind-boggling screen resolution of 7,680 x 4,320, or roughly 16 times greater than 1080i, which is 1920 x 1080. The 32 million pixels of UHDV also blows away the 2.1 million of today's best HD displays. If that's not enough for you, how about a refresh rate of 60 frames per second, or roughly double today's video? The new format is under research by NHK in Japan; the same folks that began developing the current HDTV standard back in the mid-1960's. NHK hasn't forgotten the sound quality either: UHDV supports 22.2 sound, so plan your future entertainment room accordingly. I doubt we'll see this technology in mainstream adoption within the next ten to fifteen years, so don't expand your rooms just yet.Read [free subscription required]
