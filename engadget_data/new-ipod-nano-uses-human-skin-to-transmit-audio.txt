 If you're a regular reader of Engadget then you know the two best means of securing research funding are: (1)claim you're developing a robotic companion for the elderly or, (2)somehow link yourself to the Ã¼ber product du jour, iPod. Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Scienceand Technology (KAIST) took up the latter approach yesterday by unveiling an iPod nano which communicates withearphones via your body's ability to pump electrical signal. Oh sure, the prototype requires the user to keep a fingerpressed to the iPod to close the circuit and there's always risk of a nasty infection after implanting the10-microwatt/2Mbps chip in your forearm but hey, prototype or not think of the time you'll save not having to untangleyour headphone cables every morning. Hey KAIST, don't forget to pay out royalties to Microsoft when this goes big'cause they hold patent No. 6,754,472 (source of picture) detailing the use of human skin as a power conduit and databus, mkay? Apparently the prototype was demonstrated without humans, but come on, you know some undergrad meat-sackwent and secretly "sacrificed" himself for the cause...wouldn't you?[Via MobileMag]
