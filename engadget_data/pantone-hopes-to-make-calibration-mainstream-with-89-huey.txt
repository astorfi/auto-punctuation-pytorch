Now, Pantonehopes to bring the calibration experience to mainstream consumers, with the huey, an $89 device that the company says istargeted at "digital photo enthusiasts, gamers and any computer user wanting absolute color and clarity."While we can see prosumer digicam users showing some interest in this, point-and-shooters who print at CVS are unlikelyto fall for the pitch. And we really don't see the gaming connection; gamers are likely to push their own gamut, and notworry about what color Pantone tells them that blood on their screen needs to be in order to match a print profile.
