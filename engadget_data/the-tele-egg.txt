 A cute piece of
annoyance-reducing technology (which is almost annoyingly cute in itself), the Tele-Egg wiggles its legs whenever you
receive an incoming cellphone call so your phone can be put on silent so as not to bug everyone in hearing range with
whatever the inane ringtone du jour is. Of course, if this thing makes some bothersome mechanical sound of its
own it might not even be worth it. Better to go with the Mobile Sensor Pen we wereÂ 
telling you about a few weeks ago.
