In addition to the company releasing a terse, carefully worded response to the Apple iPad's apparent lack of Flash, the Flash Blog took a much more truculent approach. Exhibit A: a post entitled "The iPad provides the ultimate browsing experience?" followed by several mockups of sites laden with the infamous Blue Lego Block of Ambiguityâ„¢. Adding to the conversation in the comments, Adobe employee / platform evangelist Lee Brimelow accuses Apple of not wanting the Flash player to succeed, and that the company's tried to work with Cupertino since the iPhone. "
They don't want you to go to Hulu or play Flash games because they worry that you won't buy their apps," he says. Frankly, we wouldn't be surprised if that's the case, and while we understand Adobe's frustration, this probably isn't gonna help relations between the two tech firms. Hey Adobe, trust us, we feel your pain -- we really want Hulu on the iPad, too.

In other, more amusing news, it seems Apple's official iPad promo has slipped up a bit in showing off what the tablet can really do. Namely, one clip of the New York Times and an article on 31 places to go in 2010. Here it clearly shows a Flash-based module up top, inaccessible without the plugin. We're not thinking this is a sign of things to come -- if anything, it's probably just a mistake by the producers. Don't get your hopes up, folks.

Update: Clarified relation of The Flash Blog to Adobe.
