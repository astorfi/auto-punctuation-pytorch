The company just announced a limited edition PS3 bundle pairing Call of Duty: Black Ops with a 160GB console. For $299, Sony's also throwing in the First Strike content pack -- not too shabby, considering that's the standard price for a bare console. Depending on your proclivities, that may or may not trump a complimentary RC toy or Michael Jackson singalong, but if you've got a taste for first-person shooters, it should be right up your alley. First-time buyers can find it next week, starting on May 31.
