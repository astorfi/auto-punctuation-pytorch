We've got a hunch they've all got something a lot like Intel's 5350 WiMAX / WiFi card tucked away in there, and now that it's hit the FCC, we're being treated to some class-A photography of the lil' bugger. Yep, still useless without a network -- but if that $12B Clearwire deal pans out, you might get to get familiar with the user manual located just beyond the read link.[Thanks, Stephen]
