If Chinese sources are to be believed, that time could be early this September. As detailed above, the i5 mainstream offerings will start at 2.66GHz (Core i5-750), alongside two additions to the Core i7 family, the 860 (2.8GHz) and 870 (2.93GHz). The new parts are highlighted by 8MB of cache and Turbo Boost -- Intel's auto-overclocking system that speeds things up when your cooling allows it.
