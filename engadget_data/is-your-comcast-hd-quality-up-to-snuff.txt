Reportedly, Comcast is squeezing three HD channels onto a 38.8Mbps QAM, which is typically used to handle just two HD channels. One particular user decided to pull screen grabs from shows seen on Comcast and Verizon's FiOS TV, and needless to say, the results were fairly startling. We aren't assuming that the overdone compression is being seen elsewhere, but we are curious to know if your Comcast service has taken a hit in quality. So, is your viewing experience as good as ever? Or have things become slightly less Comcastic of late?[Thanks, Dave]
