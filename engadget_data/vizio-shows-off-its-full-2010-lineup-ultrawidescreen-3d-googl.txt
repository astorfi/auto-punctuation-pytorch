 
No more dribs and drabs of information leaking out as Vizio has finally listed its entire 2011 LCD lineup, again featuring LED back & edge lighting across all models. That includes two ultrawidescreen 21:9 Cinema models in its Theater 3D line in 50- and 58-inch sizes, two VIA Plus TVs with Google TV in the XVT3D476SP and XVT3D556SP, and continuation of its existing Yahoo! Widgets based Vizio Internet Apps features including WiFi and Bluetooth QWERTY remote across TVs sized 22-inches and above. Check the press release after the break for all the models and what they offer, perhaps wisely there's no detailed information about when and for how much they'll be available just yet, so we'll still have to speculate about which models will represent the sub-$300 3D portion of the lineup.
      

 

Show full PR textVIZIO Announces Full Line Up of New LED LCD HDTVs Including Theater 3D™ and Cinema HDTV™ Ultra-Widescreen Models-VIZIO to extend its leadership in LED LCD HDTVs with models from 16- to 71-inch classes-Many models include Theater 3D technology for a superior 3D experience-Nearly all models feature VIZIO Internet Apps™ (VIA) with built-in Wi-Fi for even more entertainment on demandIrvine, CA-January 4, 2011 - VIZIO, America's #1 LCD HDTV Company*, announces over 40 new LED LCD HDTVs, from a convenient 16-inch class size to a larger-than-life 71-inch class size and two new Cinema HDTV™ LED lit models that supports 21:9 Cinema aspect ratio with Theater 3D and VIZIO Internet Apps™. The new models span across all three of VIZIO's HDTV product lines, from the essential E series, to the sleek design of the M series, and to the award winning, high performance XVT series.Already the North American leader in LED LCD HDTVs, showing 30% YoY growth from 2009-2010*, the variety of these new models will further demonstrate VIZIO's role as the leader in LED LCD HDTVs."LED's will account for about 21% of LCD TV shipments in North America for 2010, but jump dramatically to more than half of all LCD TV shipments in 2011** as the premium for them falls and a new range of more affordable edge-lit LED solutions are brought to the market," stated Paul Gagnon, Director of North American TV Research at DisplaySearch.VIZIO's Leading LED LCD Picture QualityAll E and M series LED LCD models utilize VIZIO's Edge-Lit Razor LED™ backlighting technology. Razor LED™ puts rows of LEDs along the edges of the screen, allowing for incredibly thin designs, and offering greener performance than other conventional LCD TVs. Many models also feature Smart Dimming, which intelligently controls the array of LEDs, organized in up to 32 zones. Working frame by frame, based on the content being displayed, Smart Dimming adjusts brightness in precise steps down to deep black level (where the LED is completely off in many models). This cutting-edge technology minimizes light leakage and can enable a Dynamic Contrast Ratio of up to 10 Million to 1, for blacker blacks and whiter whites.Most of the top of the line XVT Series LED LCD models have VIZIO's Full Array TruLED™ backlighting with Smart Dimming technology. With over 120 zones, TruLED backlighting is able to dim specific areas of the image, depending on what's on screen, resulting in the most incredible and life-like images that "pop" off the screen. In addition, LEDs are more energy efficient than other commercially available TV technologies, generally requiring less power to run. They also don't contain mercury, a toxin commonly found in conventional TVs."VIZIO's leadership in LED will continue with the introduction of over 40 models for 2011," stated Matthew McRae, VIZIO CTO. "The picture performance and environmental benefits are available in sizes ranging from the petite 16 inch class to the larger-than-life 71-inch class, ensuring there is an LED lit model that suits every need."Theater 3D - Superior 3D For AllAvailable on select models in the E and M series, and on the entire XVT series, VIZIO Theater 3D™ offers consumers a revolutionary new technology that renders flicker-free and brighter images than conventional 3D technologies currently in the market. By utilizing a circular polarized filter, the burden of 3D processing is built into the TV, allowing Theater 3D™ eyewear to be free of the batteries and shutter mechanisms inherent in Active Shutter 3D TVs. Theater 3D™ offers several performance advantages over conventional, "active" 3D systems. Theater 3D™ is up to 2X brighter, significantly reduces crosstalk compared to current Active Shutter LCD TVs, handles fast motion without blurring, has a wider horizontal viewing angle, and has none of the annoying Active Shutter 3D flicker that may cause eye strain. In addition, Theater 3D™ eyewear can be used to view 3D movies in a majority of movie theaters.Depending on the model up to four pairs of the lightweight and comfortable Theater 3D™ glasses are included with each TV. With this, VIZIO has eliminated two of the most common objections to 3D HDTV purchases: the need to wear bulky 3D glasses that require batteries or recharging and the need to invest in expensive additional 3D glasses so the entire family can enjoy it together. Half of the included glasses are specially designed to accommodate prescription eyeglass wearers. By incorporating all of the 3D processing into the TV instead of burdening the eyewear, as is the case with Active Shutter 3D technology, VIZIO Theater 3D enables users to wear comfortable, eco-friendly, battery-free eyewear instead of Active Shutter glasses that are heavy, awkward, and require recharging and other maintenance.Each Theater 3D™ model supports a wide selection of 3D formats to ensure compatibility across Blu-ray, broadcast, cable, satellite, and gaming. This includes Frame Packing, Side-by-Side, Top and Bottom, plus SENSIO® HiFi 3D and the RealD Format. VIZIO Internet Apps™ (VIA) - Entertainment On DemandAvailable on most VIZIO LED LCD HDTVs, VIZIO Internet Apps™ (VIA) offers content through the Internet from top brands including: Amazon Video On Demand, Facebook®, Flickr®, Netflix, Rhapsody®, Pandora®, Twitter™, VUDU®, and Yahoo!® TV Widgets, as well as several new apps recently released, including: Fandango®, iMemories®, MediaBox™, My-Cast®, TuneIn Radio™, Web Videos, Wiki TV and Yahoo Fantasy Football .VIZIO Internet Apps™ (VIA) delivers unprecedented choice and control of web-based content directly to the television without the need for a PC or set-top box. Many models come with IR or Bluetooth remote controls with QWERTY keyboards, making navigation incredibly simple and intuitive. State of the art wireless Internet access is available through built-in single or Dual-Band 802.11n Wi-Fi, allowing viewers to enjoy the convenience of on-demand movies, TV shows, social networking, music, photos and more with just the push of a button.VIZIO Internet Apps™ (VIA) Plus HDTVs The XVT3D476SP and XVT3D556SP are part of the new VIZIO VIA Plus ecosystem that combines the convenience of entertainment on demand with a consistent and seamless experience across all devices in the ecosystem, including the VIZIO Phone and VIZIO Tablet. VIZIO Internet Apps™ (VIA) Plus TVs, which will incorporate the Google TV platform, feature a sophisticated and intuitive user interface that allows users to access their favorite apps as well as search and browse the web using a premium Bluetooth QWERTY universal remote with touchpad and built-in dual-band 802.11n Wi-Fi.Cinema HDTV - Ultra-WidescreenTwo models in the XVT Series are part of the new Cinema HDTV™ line. These 21:9 aspect ratio models can display 2.35:1 ("CinemaScope") movies without any black bars for a true cinematic experience. Most HDTVs have an aspect ratio of 16:9, or 1.78:1, and a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 often referred to as 1080p Full HD. This aspect ratio was a compromise between the more square formatting of older televisions (4:3 or 1.33:1) and the wider 1.85:1 aspect of many movies. A 1.85:1 movie on a 16:9 HDTV will still show some black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Big-budget Hollywood blockbusters, though, are usually filmed in the much wider 2.35:1 or 2.39:1 aspect ratio. VIZIO's new Cinema HDTVs slot in between these "CinemaScope" aspect ratios perfectly with a 2.37:1 (21:9) aspect ratio. So whether you're watching 2001, Lord of the Rings, Kill Bill, Toy Story 3, or countless other movies, you can watch them in their original aspect ratio and without black bars.Each Cinema HDTV™ model also features VIZIO Internet Apps™ in Cinema mode, which allows users to simultaneously browse Apps while watching 16:9 Full HD content without compromise in resolution or change in size.Cinema HDTV models will be available in 50- and 58- inch class sizes. VIZIO will also be demonstrating a 71-inch class model at their private CES showcase at the Wynn Hotel.Advanced Audio To ensure the audio experience is every bit as good as the video, all the new LED lit models feature audio technologies from SRS Labs. E series models feature SRS TruSurround HD™, which creates an immersive, feature-rich surround sound experience from just two speakers, complete with rich bass, high frequency detail and clearer dialog. Also available on most models is SRS TruVolume™ - a revolutionary solution that provides a consistent and comfortable volume level while watching TV programming for a more enjoyable multimedia experience.Most M and all Theater 3D and XVT models feature SRS StudioSound HD - the ultimate all-in-one audio suite designed specifically for Flat Panel TVs. Years of excellence in audio, practical experience and patented technologies allow StudioSound HD to deliver the most immersive and natural surround sound ever using built-in TV speakers. The suite also delivers remarkably crisp and clear dialog, rich bass, an elevated sound stage and consistent, spike-free volume levels. StudioSound HD features optimized audio presets for movies, news, sports and music while also providing a built-in EQ toolset for peak audio performance.VIZIO continues to embrace its leadership in the LED LCD TV marketplace, not only being the #1 brand in sales, but also the brand in features, technologies and performance. The new LED lit models will become available starting this spring.VIZIO 2011 LED HDTVs at a GlanceModel Class/ Res.
