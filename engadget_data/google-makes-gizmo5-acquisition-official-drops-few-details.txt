 This one wasn't exactly the best kept secret of the week, but Google has now come out and officially announced that it has acquired VoIP company Gizmo5, and that Gizmo5's engineers will expectedly be joining the Google Voice team. This being Google, however, it isn't saying much more than that it's looking forward to "working together to bringing more useful features to Google Voice," although that's no doubt more than enough to make the folks at Skype have a slightly less relaxing weekend. Current Gizmo5 users can also expect their service to continue as normal, but Google has suspended new signups "for the time being," and existing users can no longer sign up for a call in number.
