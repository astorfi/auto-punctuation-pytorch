With the update on board, Play Store downloads now display the time left to their completion, and Android Debug Bridge security is shored-up with the addition of a whitelist. Now, WiFi and Bluetooth tiles can be toggled by a long press in the notification Quick Settings. The release also makes hardware play a tone when it begins to charge wirelessly with less than 95% juice left, and uses new low battery and cord-free charging chimes for the Nexus 4. Reports about possible Bluetooth fixes are mixed according to Android Police, and a reference to patching them up hasn't been spotted just yet. If you'd like to take a look at Mountain View's code commits, give the neighboring source link a jab.
