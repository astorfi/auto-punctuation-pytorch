As Sony Ericsson spokesperson Aldo Liguori bluntly puts it, "we have no plans for the time being to develop any new products to the Symbian Foundation standard or operating system." That doesn't completely close the door on Symbian, of course, and Liguori also said that Sony Ericsson still remains a member of the Symbian Foundation. Those future meetings should certainly be interesting, no?
