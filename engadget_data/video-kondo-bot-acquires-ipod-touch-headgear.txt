YouTube user 'ogutti' has posted a video of the robot he built using an iPod touch for its control unit and user interface. Details are skint, but apparently the device uses the Robochan app to program and play back the robot's various movements. At the very least, this thing does have a rather cute animated visage -- although it does seem a little too top heavy for any serious tournament fighting. See it in action for yourself after the break.
