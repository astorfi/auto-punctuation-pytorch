The terse tweets claim that the 820 is a 4.3-inch handset, while the 4.5-inch 920 will arrive with Nokia's magical new imaging technology. We're understandably skeptical, given the small size of the lens on the 920 (pictured, left) compared to the 808, but we can't fault the feed's track record for leaks so far.
