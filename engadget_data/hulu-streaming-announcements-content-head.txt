Are you caught up on all of Amazon's and Microsoft's news today? Good, because Hulu has a few announcements as well. First up, the streaming TV service has appointed a new head of content, Craig Erwich, who, given his pedigree, will likely help bolster the company's push into original content. Erwich comes from Warner Brothers' TV division where he oversaw business operations, development and production, and prior to that, he spent a dozen years at FOX Broadcasting. As Hulu tells it, Erwich has been "instrumental" in creating shows like House, Pretty Little Liars and 24. Speaking of TV shows, the video outfit has also announced that it's locked up exclusive streaming agreements for a handful of new programs.



As of today, Hulu Plus is the only service that will have Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Top Chef, Top Chef Masters and The Mindy Project. In terms of shows that you would probably rather that no-one knew you watched, The Real Housewives, Flipping Out, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, and The Millionaire Matchmaker are en route too. Hulu hasn't provided a firm date just yet, but says the new shows will be available in the coming weeks.
