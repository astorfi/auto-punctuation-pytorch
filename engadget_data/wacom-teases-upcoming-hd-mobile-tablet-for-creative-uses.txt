 Wacom's dipped its electronic quill in a lot of stylus-enabled tablets, but hasn't yet done what many of its creative pro users would like: build one of its own. It looks like that's about to change as the Bamboo maker has posted a teaser on Facebook saying it'll bring a mobile tablet "this summer" with a pressure-sensitive professional pen, multi-touch capability and an HD display. There are no other details like what OS such a device may boast, but if it offers its own functionality as well -- say, Cintiq-style input on a desktop machine -- then Wacom could be onto a winner.
