 Pioneer has announced its 8th generation of plasmas in Europe, with six 720p sets available in June in 42- and 50-inch sizes, and four 1080p sets in 50- and 60-inch flavors coming in September. All models have integrated DVB-T tuners and detachable speakers, with the 720p sets sporting a 16,000:1 contrast ratio, and the 1080p sets stepping it up to a whopping 20,000:1. Pioneer claims that it redesigned the sets from the ground up with improved color reproduction and contrast in mind, and have improved over older plasmas by up to 80%, including Intelligent Brightness Control, which promises to display the best picture regardless of lighting conditions. Prices and exact release dates have not been set, but Tech.co.uk is reporting potential model numbers of PDP508 for the 50-inch 1080p set and PDP4280XD / PDP5080XD for the 42- / 50-inch 720p units.[Thanks, Martin B]
