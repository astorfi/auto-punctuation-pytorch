Just to give you an idea of what it's packing, we're told to expect a DA3300ES receiver, CAV-CVS12ES Component via CAT5 Video Switch, BDP-S300 Blu-ray player, DVP-CX777ES 400 DVD changer, CAV-M1000ES A/V Switchers and a Control4 HC500 controller with 160GB of space for a skimpy audio library. In essence, having this in your crib will enable you to pipe audio / video to 12 separate zones, with the main rooms having outputs for HDMI, IR out and 7.1-channel sound. You'll be able to control it via ZigBee and the on-screen HD menu and integrate it with existing Control4 setups; there's even a trio of empty racks with component / HDMI hookups (Xbox 360 / PS3, anyone?). Chances are fairly high you'll spot one of these in 2009's Home of the Year, but 'til then, check out some sneak peeks in the gallery below.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
