"The Blaster"), peripherals big shot Joytech has snuck onto the scene with a similar product called the Sharp Shooter. The lack of details on Joytech's site means all we know is that "the Sharp Shooter brings Wii shooting games to life with amazing realism," though how the contraption actually pulls this off is still somewhat of a mystery. No word on price or release dates either, but we can comfort ourselves in knowing that when the Shooter does hit shelves, it will work on "ALL TV's and displays" (emphasis theirs, not ours).[Via Joystiq]
