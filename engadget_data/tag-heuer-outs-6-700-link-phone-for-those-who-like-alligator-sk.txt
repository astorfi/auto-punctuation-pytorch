  As far as most of us are concerned, if we're going to pay a lot for a phone -- you know, like, $350 on contract -- it had better come with the works. We're talking a qHD display, dual-core processor, 8 megapixel camera with 1080p recording, NFC, 1GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and a 4G radio, to boot. If you're someone who buys things made by TAG Heuer, you've got different priorities. The company just introduced the Link Phone, a darling clunker of a handset festooned with steel, 18K rose gold, or titanium, topped off with leather, alligator- and lizard-skin, rubber, and diamond accents -- a medley that'll set you back no less than â‚¬4,700 ($6,712). What's that you say? You want specs? The Link, named after the Swiss outfit's storied watch line, runs Android 2.2 -- a clear step up from its feature phone predecessor. Other ho-hum features include the 3.5-inch (800 x 480) display, 5 megapixel autofocus camera, 256MB internal memory, an 8GB memory card, 1400 mAh battery, and EDGE / HSUPA connectivity. TAG Heuer also says it'll be particularly durable, though it's coming up short on specifics. Somehow, though, we don't think it will survive when we accidentally drop it in our gold-plated toilet.Update: TAG Heuer might not have the chops to build a highly spec'd phone, but it sure knows how to root one. As a tipster pointed out, if you pause the video at 1:18 you'll see Superuser in the app menu -- a telltale sign of hacking if ever there was one. Freeze frame after the break.
