Needless to say, speech-to-text isn't accurate enough to make it work, so the company has partnered with Hamilton Relay Service to have actual relay operators push the text to you. In order to use it, you'll need a Nokia E5 -- an odd choice for a carrier that thrives on hardware simplicity, except for the fact that a smartphone platform like S60 probably gives Consumer Cellular the flexibility it needs to deploy a usable relay app. In states where Hamilton is authorized to provide relay service, Mobile Captions is available now -- for free -- to qualified users.
