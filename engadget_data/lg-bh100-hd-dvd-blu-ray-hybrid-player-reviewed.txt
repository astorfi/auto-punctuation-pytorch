 As promised after teasing us with their unboxing pics, the folks at Gadgetaholic have put down the camera and delivered a full review of LG's format-agnostic BH100 HD DVD / Blu-ray hybrid player. On that all-important point, they found that the player handled both formats "flawlessly," with picture quality for each pretty much in line with standalone HD DVD and Blu-ray players. Of course, you'll have to make do without HDi functionality or HDMI 1.3a support, which LG now says won't be able to be remedied with a firmware update. They also found the player to be somewhat lacking when it came to the still-important question of DVD playback, with the quality of upconverted DVDs varying noticeably from disc to disc. Add all that to the relatively steep $1,199 price tag, and Gadgetaholic has a tough time recommending the player for most users, finding it notable for what it achieves, but ultimately viewing it as more of a historical footnote than a serious contender.
