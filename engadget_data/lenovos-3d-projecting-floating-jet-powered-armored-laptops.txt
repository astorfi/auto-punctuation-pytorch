Footage that shows the "Skywalker"holographic projection unit (ala "Help me Obi Wan Kenobi"), a laptop dropped that lands gently thanks toretractable rocket boosters, and Batman-esque armor plating that prevents coffee spills? Sure, what the hell. Afterall, not too many people gonna argue that outside some especially ruggedized machines (Panasonic, we're looking your way), you don't get manylaptops more sturdy than a good ThinkPad. With armor.[Thanks, mc steelcut]
