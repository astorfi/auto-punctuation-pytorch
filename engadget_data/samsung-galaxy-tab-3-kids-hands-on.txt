Sure, Samsung's Galaxy Tab 3 Kids broke cover late last month, but it's joined the rest of the firm's brand-new displays and gadgets at IFA. Relocated capacitive buttons and repositioned camera aside, the child-friendly pad's internals are identical to the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0: a 7-inch 1,024 x 600 display, dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 8GB of storage accompanied by a microSD slot, 4,000mAh battery, 3MP front cam and a 1.3MP rear-facing shooter. While the tablet felt sturdy enough to withstand light abuse on its own, an optional case packing a blue handle makes it more kid-proof. The shell isn't there just for protection and portability either, as its handle houses a chubby stylus (no, not an S Pen) and folds to prop up the slate. If you'd rather give your tyke something a little less heavy-duty, a simple tangerine silicone case from the outfit helps the hardware endure additional rough treatment.


When it comes to performance, the pad handled itself admirably, jumping between apps and across pages without stuttering. As for software, the Galaxy Tab 3 Kids runs Android 4.1 and comes pre-loaded with apps for young 'uns, which include games, a camera and a paint tool. While the package features an interface and app store just for the little ones, full-blown Android is just a few taps away. Pricing is still MIA, but it's launching in Korea this month and is expected to follow suit in other regions afterward. Check out the gallery below to get better acquainted.
