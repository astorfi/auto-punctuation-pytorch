 One of the nice things about our little site isthat we sometimes get to bring you helpful tips along with the usual lineup of snarky posts. Today's lesson involvesthe proper way to keep someone from using/looking at your cellphone for either saving precious minutes or keeping thosesteamy convos with/pics of your mistress a secret. A bit of common sense would indicate that either removing thebattery, the SIM card, or smashing the phone to bits are all good ways to accomplish this task, yet a Missouri womanfelt that the best way of making her mobile inaccessible to her boyfriend was to put the whole damn thing in her mouthand swallow it. Not surprisingly, the cell got caught in her throat (this is why we buy RAZRs, people!) and she had tobe rushed to the emergency room, where her condition is not currently known. We are looking forward to someoneeventually lodging a phone in their nasal and ear cavities, so we'll have witnessed cells stuck in each and every humanorifice during our lifetime.[Thanks, Brian]Update: No one's got the straightskinny quite yet, but apparently the cell-swallowing mightnot have been voluntary after all. Blue Springs police are actually now citing the incident as assault, and thewoman's boyfriend is suspected of involvement. Via the WirelessWeblog.
