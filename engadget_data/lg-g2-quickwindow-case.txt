The curtains on the LG G2 won't be pulled back until August 7th, but that hasn't stopped the South Korean firm from announcing a case for the smartphone. Dubbed QuickWindow, the sheath sports a slot on its front that reveals a portion of the device's screen Ã  la Samsung's S View Cover. Just slide a finger against the exposed display and a special QuickView UI will light up the area with incoming call details, text messages, a clock, weather report, alarm or music player. Though a release date for the G2 is still MIA, the case is set to launch alongside the phone in black, blue, mint, pink, purple, white and yellow. In a world filled with case leaks for unannounced hardware, we can't help but feel strange seeing a bonafide cover before we've officially laid eyes on the device it's made for.
