       In a curious move, MGM (despite being 20% owned by Sony) has decided to take their home video distribution business elsewhere, and go to Fox. Fox is still within the Blu-ray fold, so no major changes there however Sony loses control over timing and pricing, as noted by VideoBusiness. mediabistro suggests that the synergy of Sony picking up MGM to keep them from Time Warner in the first place was a mistake, which seems to be borne out by their sudden desire to have all their internation and domestic video releases under one roof at Fox. The upcoming James bond film, Casino Royale, will still be distributed by Sony. Read - VideoBusinessRead - mediabistro
