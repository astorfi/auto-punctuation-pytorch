Anyway, besides UMTS the K618 has a 1.9-inch, 176 x 220 pixel LCD screen, a 2.0 megapixel digital camera, and Bluetooth EDR (and support for A2DP, which means you can use it with stereo Bluetooth headphones). Should hit "selected markets" sometime in Q3 of this year, and no price is listed. Click on to see a couple shots of the K618 in white.
