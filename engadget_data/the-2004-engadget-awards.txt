It's time for the 2004 Engadget Awards! We're asking you to nominate
your favorite gadgets in each of 17 categories, as well as your picks for Gadget of the Year, Disappointment of the
Year, Merger of the Year, Worst Gadget of the Year, Comeback of the Year, and the Most Anticipated Gadget of
2005.


 We'll keep the nominations open until 11:59 pm EST on Tuesday, December 27th. We'll pick five finalists for each
category and then you'll have a chance to vote for your favorites from Thursday until Saturday. We're also going to
pick our favorites from the 5 finalists, with both Engadget's and the readers' choice winners to be announced next week
after we fully recover from all the New Year's debauchery. We'll be awarding both a Reader's Choice Award and an
