No word of a North American release just yet, but folks in Europe will be able to pick it up this fall for €99 (or about $140, though we're guessing the actual US price would come in below that; the standard PSP-3000 currently demands €130 in Europe). Hit the gallery below for a closer look.

Update: Sony has now also confirmed that the device will be dubbed the PSP E-1000, and that it will indeed only be available in PAL territories.
