 Sherwood's been known mainly for its audio, but TWICE has the details on two new Blu-ray players on the way at CEDIA. Consisting of the high end $499 MSRP BDP-6003 and the mass market-targeted $299 BDP-5003 are both Bonus View Profile 1.1 players that upscale all content to 1080p and decode all Blu-ray audio formats, with the 6003 including 5.1 analog out, while the 5003 makes do with just stereo. Front mounted USB ports, DivX, JPEG and MP3 playback, HDMI 1.3 and Ethernet ports are consistent across both players, but we'll wait for a hands-on next week to see if analog surround sound is enough to bring this hardware on a level with the competition.
