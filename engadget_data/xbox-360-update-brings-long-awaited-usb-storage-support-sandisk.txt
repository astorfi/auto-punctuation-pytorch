Once the tidy little exchange of data with Microsoft's servers has been completed, you'll at long last be able to plug USB memory sticks in and exploit a bit of functionality that frankly should've been there from the start. So that's it, all your game saves, profiles and other 360-related trinkets can finally be taken on the move without resorting to lugging a HDD around. In the mean time, SanDisk's previously rumored Xbox 360-branded $40 8GB flash drive is looking all the more real, with Amazon now offering pre-orders at a slightly less crazy $35 price point. You know, in case the millions of USB storage options out there aren't doing it for you.
