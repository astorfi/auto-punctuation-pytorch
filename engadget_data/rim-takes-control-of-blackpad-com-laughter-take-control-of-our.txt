 A quick WHOIS confirms that RIM's taken control of blackpad.com -- yes, it's long been rumored as a potential name for the BlackBerry tablet, but we're certainly hoping Waterloo's just parking a domain name to keep squatters at bay, because, seriously, we just got over the iPad jokes, you know?

P.S.- And might we see whatever this is at the RIM / AT&T event on Tuesday? Consider our interest piqued.
