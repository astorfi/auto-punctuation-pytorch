The trio consists of the One Touch X'Pop, S'Pop and T'Pop, which will be sold throughout Asia, Europe and Africa. Unfortunately, it's difficult to determine how aggressively Alcatel plans to push these devices, as the company hasn't announced pricing for any of the handsets.

 Leading the pack is the X'Pop, which includes a 4.5-inch qHD (960 x 540) display, a dual-core 1GHz CPU, 512MB RAM and Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean). The phone also features a 5-megapixel primary camera, a front-facing VGA shooter and a microSD card slot. The X'Pop is set for availability this month.

 All three Pop handsets will come in two different flavors: one that offers HSPA connectivity over the 900 / 2100MHz bands, and another that sports HSPA access over the 850 / 1900 / 2100MHz bands. In all cases, quad-band GSM is part of the mix. To learn about the One Touch S'Pop and T'Pop, just hop the break.

 Alcatel's One Touch S'Pop is positioned as the middle child within the company's budget lineup. It features a 3.5-inch HVGA (480 x 320) display, a single-core 1GHz CPU, 512MB RAM and Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean). The phone also features a 3.2-megapixel primary camera, a front-facing VGA shooter and a microSD card slot. The S'Pop is set for availability next month in Asian markets.

 Pulling up the rear is the One Touch T'Pop, which largely amounts to a crippled S'Pop. It features a 3.5-inch HVGA (480 x 320) display, a single-core 1GHz CPU, 256MB RAM and Android 2.3 (Gingerbread). Here, both the 3.2-megapixel primary camera and microSD slot remain, but the front-facing VGA shooter is nowhere to be found. For better or worse, the T'Pop is set for availability this month in Asian markets.
