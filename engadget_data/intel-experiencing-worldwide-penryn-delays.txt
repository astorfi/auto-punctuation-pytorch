       According a message purportedly sent from a Lenovo rep to resellers today, Intel's T9500, T9300, T8300 and T8100 Penryn chips are going to be delayed, affecting the laptop industry worldwide -- and obviously Lenovo's latest in particular. The word is that a thermal sensor issue is to blame, and supply on the chips will be tight through February. Nothing official from Intel yet on the matter, so we're going to keep this in the rumor category for the moment -- but don't be surprised when that shiny new Penryn laptop of yours ends up taking a few extra weeks. Be strong, we can make it through this together.
