       DirecTV has done a great job of reminding everyone how many HD channels they will be adding this year, but for whatever reason they don't say exactly when or how. Sure most Engadget HD readers know that the current MPEG4 satellites in service are specifically designed to spot beam HD locals, and it would be a waste to transmit national HD channels. DirecTV's priorities aside, now that DirecTV is providing HD locals all over the US, it is finally time to launch two new DirecTV satellites that are specifically designed for national HD channels. The first of which is DirecTV 10 and seems to be scheduled for a Russian launch on June 20th. If everything goes well, it will be operational in time for those new HD channels due in September.
