The RemotePoint ONYX presentation remote carries its own USB Auto RF receiver, which operates at up to 100-feet, and automatically switches between 64k unique addresses to keep make sure nobody else starts running your presentation. The unit also has a built-in laser pointer, the requisite buttons, and a nifty clock to keep you on schedule. No word on price of availability, but a CES 2007 launch would be a good guess.
