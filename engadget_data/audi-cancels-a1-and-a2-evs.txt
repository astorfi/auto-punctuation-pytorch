According to Car Magazine, the auto maker is cancelling production of the two models due to concerns about pricing. The projected cost is apparently just south of $50,000. That's not to say that Audi is giving up on developing EVs entirely, though -- it's still pushing the A3 e-tron pilot program announced earlier this year.

 Update: As it would turn out, Audi states it never actually announced it would be producing these vehicles, thus there is nothing to cancel.


 The Audi A2 and A1 are concept vehicles only. To say that "production was cancelled" isn't accurate.   The A2 concept was meant to provide a preview of electric driving in the mega-cities of the future. Audi hasn't commented on possible series production. With the A1 e-tron, Audi has demonstrated an approach to electric mobility that combines an electric motor with an internal-combustion motor as range extender. The A1 e-tron is currently undergoing testing under everyday conditions within a fleet trial in Munich. Based on the results from the fleet trial, Audi will decide on a concept that is aligned as closely as possible with the needs of customers. Audi has not commented on speculation as to decisions on volume production.
