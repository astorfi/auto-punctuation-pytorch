 
Android boss Andy Rubin almost always makes for an entertaining interview, and his appearance at AllThingsD's D: Dive Into Mobile conference in San Francisco last week was certainly no exception. The introduction of Android 2.3 Gingerbread and the Nexus S were the official news items of the day, but Rubin took the opportunity to showcase the next version of the platform -- Honeycomb -- running on a prototype Motorola tablet that no one had seen before. He also runs through a breakdown of Android's business model (hint: it's profitable), muses about video calling, and gives us a look at that crazy new 3D-capable Google Maps app. Follow the break for the footage.
