Obviously, it's next to impossible to glean anything other than the brand (Pentax) and style (DSLR) from the shots, though we will say that the mode dial's copious amount options has our interest piqued. Give 'em a look if you're not susceptible to motion sickness, and feel free to dish out your wildest accusations in comments below.Update: Could these be non-blurry pics? Or just meaningless renders? You decide. Thanks, Andrew!Read - First sneak peekRead - The other two
