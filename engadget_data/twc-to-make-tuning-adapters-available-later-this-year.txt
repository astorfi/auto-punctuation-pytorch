Of note, the letter was addressed prior to the FCC slapping it with a fine for deploying SDV in an apparently improper manner, but at any rate, central NYers using a standard TiVo Series3 / TiVo HD now will see a whole slew of channels go dark on November 13th. The note also asserts that "it is currently contemplated that the Tuning Adapter will be provided at no additional charge," but that's a far cry from outrightly saying that they'll be doled out gratis. Guess we'll see in time, huh? [Disclosure: Engadget is part of the Time Warner family]
