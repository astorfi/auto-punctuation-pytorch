Boy oh boy, do we know what we're asking Santa for this year. Screw the
nano, forget the
360, we're talking some high-end, USB, Christmas
tree action. And this one totally blows away last year's
model. It includes wind blown snow from an internal fan, a music player with a medley of Christmas carols, and
features either Santa with his sleigh, or a girl with a mobile phone, both of which always fill our hearts with holiday
cheer. Remember guys, nothing says "I love you" like a piece of frivolous seasonal gadgetry.
