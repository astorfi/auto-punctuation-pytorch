 Therule of thumb about antennas has always been "the uglier it looks the better it will perform." The HD signalthough allows for 'cleaner' looking antennas. Terk has had nice looking antennas for a whilebut Terrestrial Digital has kicked it up a notch. TheLacrosse not only looks good but also has a 10.8 dB gain. It is 14" tall and 20" wide and only weighs 6.8lbs. It has a max range of 40 miles and starts at $179, plus it looks good for the fashion conscience in all of us.
