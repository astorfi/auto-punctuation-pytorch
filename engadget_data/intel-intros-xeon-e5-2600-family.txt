Best data center performance per watt with over 50 percent1,4 gain on SPECpower_ssj*2008 plus extends platform power control with Intel® Node Manager and Intel® Data Center Manager.  SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Addressing the incredible growth of data traffic in the cloud, Intel Corporation announced the record-breaking Intel Xeon processor E5-2600 product family. These new processors deliver leadership performance, best data center performance per watt1,4, breakthrough I/O innovation and trusted hardware security features to enable IT to scale. These processors are not only at the heart of servers and workstations, but will also power the next generation of storage and communication systems from leading vendors around the world.  "For businesses to capitalize on these innovations, the industry must address unprecedented demand for efficient, secure and high-performing datacenter infrastructure. The Intel Xeon processor E5-2600 product family is designed to address these challenges by offering unparalleled, balanced performance across compute, storage and network, while reducing operating costs."  Forecasts call for 15 billion connected devices5 and over 3 billion connected users6 by 2015. The amount of global data center IP traffic is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2015, surpassing 4.8 zetabytes per year, more than 3 times the amount in 20116. At these levels, each connected user will generate more than 4GB of data traffic every day – the equivalent of a 4-hour HD movie. This will increase the amount of data that needs to be stored by almost 50 percent per year7. In order to scale to meet this growth, the worldwide number of cloud servers is expected to more than triple by 20158.  "The growth in cloud computing and connected devices is transforming the way businesses benefit from IT products and services," said Diane Bryant, Intel vice president and general manager of the Datacenter and Connected Systems Group. "For businesses to capitalize on these innovations, the industry must address unprecedented demand for efficient, secure and high-performing datacenter infrastructure. The Intel Xeon processor E5-2600 product family is designed to address these challenges by offering unparalleled, balanced performance across compute, storage and network, while reducing operating costs."  The key requirements to enable IT to scale are performance, energy efficiency, I/O bandwidth and security. With the best combination of performance, built-in capabilities and cost-effectiveness, the new Intel Xeon processor E5-2600 product families are designed to address these requirements, and become the heart of the next-generation data center powering servers, storage and communication systems.  Leadership Performance with Best Data Center Performance per Watt  Supporting up to eight cores per processor and up to 768GB of system memory, the Intel Xeon processor E5-2600 product family increases performance by up to 80 percent1,2 compared to the previous-generation Intel® Xeon® processor 5600 series. The family also supports Intel® Advanced Vector Extension (Intel® AVX) that increases the performance on compute-intensive applications such as financial analysis, media content creation and high performance computing up to 2 times9.  Additional built-in technologies such as Intel® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0, Intel Hyper-Threading Technology and Intel® Virtualization Technology provide IT with flexible capabilities to increase the performance of their infrastructure dynamically. These performance advances have led the Intel Xeon processor E5-2600 product family to capture 1510 new dual socket x86 world records.  Modern data centers must improve the raw performance they deliver, but also do so efficiently by reducing power consumption and operating costs. The Intel Xeon processor E5-2600 product family continue Intel's focus on reducing total cost of ownership by improving energy efficient performance more than 50 percent1,4 as measured by SPECpower_ssj*2008 compared to the previous generation Intel Xeon processor 5600 series. These processors offer support for tools to monitor and control power usage such as Intel® Node Manager and Intel® Data Center Manager, which provide accurate, real-time power and thermal data to system management consoles. In addition, Intel's leadership performance allows IT managers to meet their growing demands while optimizing software license and capital costs.  I/O Innovation and Network Capabilities  With the unprecedented growth in data traffic it is essential that systems not only improve computational abilities, but also enable data to flow faster to support data-hungry applications and increase the bandwidth within the data center. The Intel Xeon processor E5-2600 product family meets these needs with Intel® Integrated I/O (Intel® IIO) and Intel® Data Direct I/O (Intel® DDIO). Intel® DDIO allows Intel Ethernet controllers and adapters to route I/O traffic directly to processor cache, reducing trips to system memory reducing power consumption and I/O latency. The Intel Xeon processor E5-2600 product family is also the first server processors to integrate the I/O controller supporting PCI Express* 3.0 directly into the microprocessor. This integration reduces latency up to 30 percent11 compared to prior generations and with PCI Express* 3.0 can up to triple3 the movement of data into and out of the processor.  The high-performance processing power along with Intel® Integrated I/O and advanced storage features such as PCIe* non-transparent bridging and asynchronous DRAM refresh, makes the Intel Xeon processor E5-2600 product family also an ideal choice for storage and communications solutions.  Increasing bandwidth demands driven by server virtualization and data and storage network consolidation have led to strong growth in 10 Gigabit Ethernet deployments, with adapter port shipments exceeding 1 million units in each quarter of 201113. Today's announcement of the Intel® Ethernet Controller X540 demonstrates Intel's commitment to driving 10 Gigabit Ethernet to the mainstream by reducing implementation costs. This industry-first single-chip 10GBASE-T solution is designed for low-cost, low-power LAN on motherboard (LOM) and includes flexible I/O Virtualization and Unified networking support at no additional cost.  Trusted Security  The Intel Xeon processor E5-2600 product family reaffirms Intel's commitment to providing a more secure hardware foundation for today's data centers. Intel® Advanced Encryption Standard New Instruction (Intel® AES-NI14) helps systems to quickly encrypt and decrypt data running over a range of applications and transactions. Intel® Trusted Execution Technology (Intel® TXT15) creates a trusted foundation to reduce the infrastructure exposure to malicious attacks. These features in partnership with leading software applications will help IT protect their data centers against attack and scale to meet the demands of their customers.  Extensive Industry Support  Starting today, system manufacturers from around the world are expected to announce hundreds of Intel® Xeon® processor E5 family-based platforms. These manufacturers include Acer*, Appro*, Asus*, Bull*, Cisco*, Dell*, Fujitsu*, HP*, Hitachi*, Huawei*, IBM*, Inspur*, Lenovo*, NEC*, Oracle*, Quanta*, SGI*, Sugon*, Supermicro* and Unisys*.
