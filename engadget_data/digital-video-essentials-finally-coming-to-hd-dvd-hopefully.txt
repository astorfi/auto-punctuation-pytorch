 Digital Video Essentials is a must have for any home theater enthusiast's toolbox due to its low price and uncanny calibration ability. The disc is seriously one of the best ways to get your HDTV properly setup but some question the quality of calibration via a 480p DVD player. What we need is a high-def version but the disc has been constantly pushed back but hopefully this time around we will finally see the disc hit shelves come February 27th. This will be the best $34.99 you have spent on your HDTV if you happen to have an HD DVD player and unfortunately for Blu-ray owners, they haven't announced that version yet.
