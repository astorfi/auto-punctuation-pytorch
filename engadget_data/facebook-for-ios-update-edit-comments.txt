Stop the presses. A new Facebook for iOS update hit iTunes today, and it brings with it a handful of relatively minor features. Now, you can edit your posts and comments through the app to fix any egregious mistakes you might make, after which a label indicating that the post has been edited will appear. And for those situations when mere words will not suffice, version 6.6 allows you to add photos and emoticons to your comments (though the latter is only available if you use the English version of Facebook). Additionally, privacy shortcuts can now be accessed by simply tapping the lock by your name on the main menu. If these new features tickle your fancy, you can download the update at the source link below.
