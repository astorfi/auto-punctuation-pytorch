It kind of figures, right? Famed American Idol judge Simon Cowell sports a phone crafted by a Finnish handset maker. We know, that's not quite England, but it's close enough. In tonight's episode, he proceeded to tell the iPhone that it simply "wasn't the complete package" while alluding to the lack of copy / paste, the T-Mobile G1 that it was "too young to be taken seriously" and the BlackBerry Storm that it just "pushed his buttons the wrong way." Ultimately, Paula, Randy and even Kara were coaxed into agreeing, sending the N95 8GB to Hollywood for one more shot at stardom. Sigh.
