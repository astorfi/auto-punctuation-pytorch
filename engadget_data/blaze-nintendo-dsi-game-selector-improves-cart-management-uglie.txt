Fret not, as the carefree crew over at Blaze has your best interests in mind. Hailed as the first 3-in-1 game selector for Nintendo's DSi, this mildly unsightly attachment simply plugs into your game port and then houses a trio of your favorite titles. Once you've got it mounted, just flip the switch to change the title, though we'd suggest powering your DSi down before doing so. It's available now to solve a problem you probably only think you have for Â£14.99 ($24).
