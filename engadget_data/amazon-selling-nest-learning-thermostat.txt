Joining the likes of Apple, Lowe's and, naturally, Nest's official site, Amazon is the latest shop to welcome the famed Learning Thermostat onto its shelves, with availability expected as soon as tomorrow (June 8th). As for pricing, that won't be changing much, which means you'll still have to shell out $249 -- though, you could see it hit your doorstep sooner without paying extra if you have one of those fancy Prime accounts. In any case, folks looking to grab one of these notorious Nest thermos can do so from either of the source links below.
