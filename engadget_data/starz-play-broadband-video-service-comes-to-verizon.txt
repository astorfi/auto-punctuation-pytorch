Of course, folks interested will still have to fork over $5.99 per month to access the subscription based service, but at least you can do so with the knowledge that "exclusive content" will soon be at your fingertips. Moving on, the two also expanded their current FiOS TV affiliation agreement, with the new deal securing delivery of all 16 Starz, Encore and MoviePlex premium channels, all of its HD channels and every VOD / HD VOD outlet. Now that's something we can really smile about.
