 It's easy to pass off the rumored Cubic as just another of the seemingly countless Sammy full-touch dumbphones and Windows Mobile smartphones, but hold up a second, there, partner -- rumor has it that this might end up being one of the company's first Android devices. If you're wondering how the S8000 model number morphed into Cubic, the answer lies not in the cutely cubic d-pad (at least, we hope it doesn't) but rather in the interface, which could sport the usual TouchWiz with 3D enhancements like we've seen on the OmniaHD. Add in HSDPA, WiFi, AGPS, FM with RDS, a 3.5mm headphone jack, 2GB of internal storage with microSDHC expansion, and a WVGA AMOLED display clocking in at 3.1 inches, and you've got yourself a bona fide superphone here -- only questions are when it'll launch, and how much brutally excessive financial stress we'll need to endure to get it.
