JVC justdropped their new GR-D650 BabyMovie miniDV camcorder. No surprise then, to find these targeting both new parents and pastel craving device junkies alike (you know who youare). The cam features a 1.33 megapixel CCD, 16:9 aspect recording, a 2.5-inch LCD, and F1.2 lense with 15x opticalzoom. And that 1 lux sensitivity coupled with a built-in LED light are perfect for those late-night, panicky new-parenttrips to the crib to check if your little babe is still animate. Expected in May in “clear silver” and ofcourse pink and blue to complete your child’s gender uniform.[Via AkihabaraNews]
