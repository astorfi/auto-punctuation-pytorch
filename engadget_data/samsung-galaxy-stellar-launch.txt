Our source has confirmed that the Stellar is now expected to launch on September 6th, and has provided some documentation that reveals the vast majority of the phone's spec sheet. Starter Mode once again gets mentioned here -- according to the docs, it's a "new, simple way to interact Access apps and control device settings with ease." As far as specs go, these docs back up the details leaked on Best Buy's website earlier: Android 4.0, a 1.2GHz dual-core CPU, 3.2MP rear camera and 1.3MP front-facing cam and 800 x 480 WVGA display. Additionally, Amazon Kindle, Audible and Zappos apps are mentioned, as well as Bluetooth 4.0 and 4GB internal storage. Dimensionally, the phone will weigh 4.73 ounces and measures 121.92 x 63.75 x 11.94mm (yes, that last measurement is for thickness). Given the lower-end specs, the Stellar likely won't launch to a grand amount of fanfare -- especially if the $100 price point is accurate. Check out our gallery below to see a few more images of the crucial docs.

 As a sidenote, many of the images will have creatively blurred-out sections in order to protect the identity of our source.
