Seriously, the only thing surprising about the Hello Kitty phone is that nobody had done one already. The phone,
which looks like a modded version of the Nokia 3595, is due out from Cingular's pay-as-you-go service sometime around
now (mid-December) and will come with "exclusive" Hello Kitty games, wallpapers, and ringtones. We'd say it'd go great
with your Hello Kitty Bluetooth headset (teen
girls are dying to walk around with headsets), but the 3595 doesn't have Bluetooth, so it's a moot point.
