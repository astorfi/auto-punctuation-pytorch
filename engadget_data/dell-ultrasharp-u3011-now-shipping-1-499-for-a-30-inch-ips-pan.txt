This 30-inch IPS wonder offers a 7ms response time, 178-degree viewing angles on both axes, an eye-searing 370 nits of brightness, and a satisfyingly dense 2560 x 1600 resolution. A pair of DVI-D ports are kept company by a single DisplayPort and two HDMI inputs on the back, meaning that if you've got the cables, you'll probably never have to reach around back after the initial setup. CNET's done an early review of this fresh new UltraSharp below and, if you must know, the 10-bit IPS panel walked away with an Editor's Choice badge and a few stolen hearts. That menace!
