We still don't know how long it'll be until we get our own launch this side of thePacific, but AV Watch's DEVICE Viking (ahem) took a good long look at the portable media device that firstwhet our appetites at CES. We won't waste your time with so much wonkymachine translation interpretation, but from what we could tell, they liked it -- you know where to go if your appetitetoo could use a little re-whetting.
