So it looks like J Allard's had
his eyes on Sony's EyeToy camera of
PlayStation 2 fame. In a recent interview
with Bloomberg News, he hints strongly that Micrsoft is planning to come up with their own version of the body
movement-controller device for the Xbox 360. This would
have to mean MS will be developing some new games to take advantage of the controller, which opens up some new
possibilities on that platform. Of course, all is still sight unseen until E3, but Allard's quotes seem pretty
unambiguously pointing in the direction of a nod to Sony's device (which is pictured at right).
