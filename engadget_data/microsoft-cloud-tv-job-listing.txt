Take this Microsoft job listing, for example, which reveals that the company is recruiting engineers to work on a new Cloud TV platform. The Mountain View-based team will work under Redmond's Mediaroom business, which already powers IPTV services like AT&T's U-Verse. Personally, we're hoping it's the genesis of a Steve Ballmer-fronted reality show.
