As an industrial designer, Starck has been responsible for some of the most groundbreaking -- and divisive -- products ever created. He's been both vilified and deified, and while there are solid arguments for both stances, there is no denying that he is a force to be reckoned with. Fresh off of his design of LaCie's new Mobile and Desktop drives, Engadget's Senior Editor Thomas Ricker had a chance to sit down with the man himself in Paris and hear his thoughts on life, love, and good design. What we learn will shock you, amaze you, warm your heart... and convince you that Starck is a serious Apple fanboy. The full video is after the break. Don't be a fool -- watch it now!

Bonus round: Catch a game of word association with Starck right here!
