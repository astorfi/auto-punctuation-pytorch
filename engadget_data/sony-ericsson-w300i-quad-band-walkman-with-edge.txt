Thisquad-band EDGE clamshell expands upon the Walkman series byoffering all that MP3/AAC playback goodness in a compact design with integrated VGA camera -- yeah VGA, which soundseven worse after SE's earlierannouncement. The W300i ships with a 256MB Memory Stick Micro card and features a 128 x 160 262K color TFT maindisplay with a second 1-inch 101 x 80 display for viewing track info and caller ID when the flip is closed. The W300ifeatures dedicated music keys as you'd expect from a Walkman in addition to a shuffle function, flight-mode, up to 30hours of music playback per charge, Bluetooth, and RDS FM radio. The W300i measures in at 90 x 47 x 24 mm (3.5 x 1.9 x0.9-inches) and 94 grams (3.31-ounces) and will be shipping in Shimmering White and Shadow Black starting Q2. Lots moresnaps after the break.
