The former stone specializes in providing mobile content / entertainment, and apparently, it's hoping to share "expertise in IPTV, place shifting, mobile internet and mobile entertainment platforms" with the latter. Essentially, ROK sees convergence between laptops and mobile technologies as imminent, and while specifics of the agreement weren't really detailed, we're already getting anxious to start sidetalkin' on our next Rock machine.
