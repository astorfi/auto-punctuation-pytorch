Pogue digs deep (well, not that deep) into his theatrical bag of tricks to pull out the all singing, all geeking musical entitled, "I want an iPhone." Absurd as it is endearing, he deftly pokes fun at the device's flaws while simultaneously expressing devotion. Hell, he even unites iPhone haters (rolling your eyes right now) and cultists (if you end up singing along) alike with a high-larious jab at AT&T -- after all, who ever heard of an AT&T fanboy?
