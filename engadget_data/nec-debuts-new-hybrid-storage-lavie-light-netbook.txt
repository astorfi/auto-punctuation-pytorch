That includes a slimmer form factor (1-inch at the front, 1.4-inches at the back), an improved 10.1-inch LED-backlit display, an Atom N280 processor, 1GB of RAM, 802.11n WiFi, an optional high capacity battery and, of course, those dual 16GB SSD and 160GB hard drives. No word on a release 'round here, but folks in Japan should be able to pick this one up this month for a hefty Â¥70,000 (or about $730), or they can save a few thousand Yen and grab one of the non-hybrid models.[Via Portable Monkey]
