If you'll recall, the company told us that it wouldn't be available until March when it launched three weeks ago, but hey, you won't find us kvetching about early availability. For those who've forgotten, this compact camera touts the same 12.3 megapixel image sensor as the E-30 and E-620, and the $599.99 asking price also nets you a 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko zoom lens. Good luck resisting.

[Thanks, Ron]
