This Mbook boasts a 1.1GHz Atom CPU (the M1 has a 1.3GHz Atom), and lacks both the webcam and the DMB module. Other than that, we're looking at the same cute little guy we've come to know and love. The M1D is launching in Korea next week -- but still no word on if or when it'll ever make its way to the States or elsewhere, or its official price. There's one more shot after the break.
