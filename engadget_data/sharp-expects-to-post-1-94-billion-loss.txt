According to Reuters, the Japanese firm hopes to post an operating profit for the current term, but will take a $1.94 billion loss for the year as a whole. This prediction is a tad more dismal then its earlier forecast, which predicted a $1.25 billion loss for 2012. The TV maker also cut its predicted net loss from ¥240 billion to ¥450 billion ($5.6 billion). Sharp still is hoping its cuts, layoffs and mortgages weren't in vain -- and a short term profit for Q2 could be all it needs to vindicate the $4.6 billion loan it took out in September. Sharp also said it was penning in $1.1 billion for restructuring expenses in Q2, hopefully helping it stay on track for its 2014 profitability goal.
