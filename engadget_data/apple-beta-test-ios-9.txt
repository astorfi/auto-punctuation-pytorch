Worried that the next iOS update could repeat last year's glitchy rollout of iOS 8? We imagine the folks in Cupertino feel the same way, and according to a report from 9to5Mac, they plan to avoid it by adding public beta tests to the mix. Specifically, the move will mirror its early test of OS X Yosemite, with iOS 8.3 getting a preview in mid-March, and then iOS 9 over the summer. Those willing to risk some stability to help out can sign up for the AppleSeed program here although that doesn't assure inclusion -- the test will reportedly be limited to 100,000 people.
