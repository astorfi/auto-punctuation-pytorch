 The BlackBerry Z10 is now attainable on three outta the four big US carriers, leading many to wonder what a BB10 phone would be like. Well, if you haven't had a chance to fondle the handset in-store, Heins & Co's got another way for you to (somewhat) experience the OS through its "glimpse" website. Load it up in the browser of your iOS or Android device, and it'll take you through a linear tour of some of the gestures and ways to multitask, as well as show you the BlackBerry Hub, BBM and Time Shift camera feature. It's far from a full emulation, but at least you'll be a little more informed at the end of it. Point your portable's browser at the source link to see what we mean.
