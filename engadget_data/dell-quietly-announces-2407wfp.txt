Looks like among the other things Dell brought to the table yesterday, the US launch of the latest version of their 24-inch monitor was included, however quietly (it still doesn't appear to be up on their site, but according to CNET they've definitely loosed the thing). As we well know, It's not a whole lot different than its predecessor, the Engadget-gold-standard 2405FPW, but this one -- for better or worse -- adds HDCP to the mix. CNET says you'll pony up $949 to get one, but before you do you'd better make sure you're emotionally prepared to erase that desktop color mode for good.[Thanks, Pramit]
