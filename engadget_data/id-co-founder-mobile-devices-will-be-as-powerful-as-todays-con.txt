Given the explosion of phone-based gaming, it's not hard to see why -- in fact, the speed with which devices have advanced has apparently left co-founder John Carmack's mind reeling. In a recent interview, the Wolfenstein / Doom / Quake developer noted how iOS has gone from non-existent to a major gaming player in the time that it has taken the company to develop the still forthcoming Rage. And while the iPad 2 isn't quite as advanced as some might suggest, Carmack predicts that in two years, mobile devices will "almost certainly" be as powerful as the current crop of high-end consoles. Don't say we didn't warn you.
