Well, the opposite may be the case -- according to Bloomberg, the company can get a reduced rate if regulator's requests become too pricey. A discount of sorts would be available to AT&T if the remedy to-do list surpasses 20 percent of the deal's original $39 billion price tag (about $7.8 billion). Also of note here: the company could leave the proverbial table altogether if the concessions top the 40 percent mark, only owing a break-up penalty... and shelling out the $3 billion contingency fund to Deutsche Telekom AG.
