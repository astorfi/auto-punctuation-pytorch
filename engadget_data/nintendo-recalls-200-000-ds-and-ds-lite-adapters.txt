 "Early and often" isn't quite the mantra you want when it comes to recalls (early is enough, thanks), but it looks like 200,000 Japanese DS and DS Lite adapter units is what's for dinner at Nintendo today. We don't have much more info than that -- sorry, we wish we could tell you if you were at any kind of risk or something -- but given N's kind of scary dominance in portable gaming, we'd imagine 200k units is a drop in the bucket, so the numbers are probably on your side. Stay tuned for a US announcement soon, we imagine it's likely to follow.
