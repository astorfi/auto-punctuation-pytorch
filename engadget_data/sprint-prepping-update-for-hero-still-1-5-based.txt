 Looking forward to a warm, delicious Donut or Eclair to get beamed down to your Sprint Hero? Well, keep on waiting -- because there's an update in the works, but it's still going to rock the same Android 1.5-based core that you're already enjoying. It looks like users can expect a so-called maintenance release in "the next few weeks," and while a complete changelog isn't yet available, folks are being told that it'll fix DST and messaging issues. As far as we know, HTC hasn't put the finishing touches on Sense for 2.0 anyway, so we wouldn't get discouraged just yet.
