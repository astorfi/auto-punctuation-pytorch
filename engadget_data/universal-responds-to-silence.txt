       Universal's none announcements at CES has many people worried and while some in the HD DVD camp say it's nothing to worry about, that isn't making everyone feel better. Universal has told The Digital Bits that they plan to release 100 HD DVD tittles in 2007 including TV-shows like Battlestar Galactica. While the continued HD DVD support by Universal is great news for the HD DVD camp, we would like to have some release dates, but it appears that this will keep up the recent trend of studios to announce much later than we have come to expect with DVD.
