Brawl in 720p is enough to make any of us wonder what a world where Nintendo didn't hate HD (even yanking 480p capability from the Gamecube, we're still not over that) would be like. These games aren't merely upscaled like DVDs, they're being rendered in a high resolution natively with extra anti-aliasing Xbox 360 BC-style, producing surprisingly crisp visuals. Check out the embedded videos after the break (remember to hit the HD button) for an example, including how to set this up on your own computer.
