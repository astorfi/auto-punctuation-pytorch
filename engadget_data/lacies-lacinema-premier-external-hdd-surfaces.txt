This USB 2.0 "multimedia hard drive" arrives in 500GB, 750GB and 1TB flavors, packs 7,200RPM hard drives within and outputs via composite / S-Video / component (rear shown after the break). Furthermore, it supports 1080i upscaling and provides S/PDIF optical and coaxial digital audio outputs, and just in case you're curious, it'll handle MPEG1/2/4, ISO, IFO, VOB, MP3, WMA, AC3, OGG, JPEG, BMP, TIF and PNG file formats. Yeah, it also touts that played out "one-touch backup" feature, but we know it's the bundled remote that really turns you on. Apparently, the trio starts at around £149.99 ($299) and tops out at £324.99 ($648) for the 1TB edition.[Via Gizmos]
