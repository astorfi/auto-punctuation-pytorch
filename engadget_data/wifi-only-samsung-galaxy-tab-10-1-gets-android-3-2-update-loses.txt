It seems users are encountering a host of issues, including a lack of WiFi connectivity -- pretty essential for a WiFi-only device. In addition, auto-rotate functions no longer work correctly and a few have noticed Bluetooth loss (pun fully intended). Some are reporting that the download is failing after a partial install and a hard reset doesn't offer a fix. It seems what was supposed to be a sweet Honeycomb treat is leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of early adopters. Have you tried to install the upgrade for your Galaxy Tab 10.1? Let us know how it went in the comments below, but please -- keep the swearing to a minimum.

Update: We've received word from Samsung Mobile that the upgrade has been pulled until the issues can be resolved. The company has confirmed that there is a problem with the update and is working actively to find a solution.
