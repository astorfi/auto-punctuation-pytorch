So we got a chance to play around with the mock-up for the Ultra Mobile PC, that new concept design for a mini
Tablet PC with a 6-inch display that Microsoft was showing off at the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference earlier
this week. This isn't really a prototype, since it's just a plastic model with some dreamy future specs, but Microsoft
says that the goal is to have something that's this small and thin out within a year or two after Longhorn debuts
(which means we'll be reviewing this on Engadget in 2007 or 2008 at best). Even when/if it does come out, the Ultra
Mobile PC will still fall squarely into the no-man's land of portable computersâ€”it's too big to fit in your pocket and
too small to serve as your main machine.
