The next stop on Intel's wearable train is a smart earpiece, dubbed Jarvis (hello, Iron Man). The hardware listens for voice commands and can act as your personal assistant -- and it replies, to boot. You can make appointments cross-referenced with your calendar, check messages and set reminders. To prompt the device to listen for actions, users just say the words, "Hello, Jarvis." Mum's the word on price, but Jarvis is set for release sometime this year.
