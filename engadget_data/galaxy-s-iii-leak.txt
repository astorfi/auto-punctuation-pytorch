Vietnamese site Tinhte, which has past form on these kind of things, has got its hands on the GT-I9300 -- purportedly the Galaxy S III if Samsung decides to follow its own naming convention. According to the specifications leaked, Tinhte reckons the phone houses a 4.6-inch display at 720 x 1184 resolution (roughly 320 DPI, picking up Android's XHDPI classification -- thanks Rawat), while a quad-core 1.4 GHz processor works on keeping the Ice Cream Sandwich OS running smoothly. Other hardware mentions include 1GB of RAM, 8-megapixel camera, 16GB of storage plus microSD capability. In a side-by-side comparison with the Galaxy Nexus, it looks like the phone's display is incrementally larger, although we're unable to tell the precise size, nor whether we'll be treated to Super AMOLED Plus or some Pentile substitute.

 According to Tinhte, the 2,050mAh battery will arrive with NFC capabilities baked in, like the Galaxy Nexus before it. There's an iffy plastic rim surrounding to the whole device that has apparently been added not to ruin the surprise of how the device looks ahead of its official launch. While we've seen some similar hardware leaks already, this video makes a very strong case for it being the real deal. Take a look for yourself right after the break, alongside a picture of the back.

 Update: It looks our source link has disappeared and the video has now gone private. Fortunately, we grabbed our own copy of the video and you can find it below.

 Update 2: We reached out to Samsung for a comment, and here's the not-so-surprising response:

  "We will be able to tell you more at the 2012 Samsung Mobile Unpacked."
