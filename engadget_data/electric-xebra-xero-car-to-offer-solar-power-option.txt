Xebras get their main charge from a standard 110 volt outlet, but the solar panel can power short-distance trips all on its own. Compared to pricier, stranger-looking alternative energy vehicles, a Xebra Xero will give you not a bang, but a solid scoot for your buck, with a top speed of 40 mph and estimated price tag of $12,000. Xebra Xeros are best-suited for city use and are available as a 4-door sedan or 2-passenger pick-up truck. Though you might be a little embarrassed to pick someone up in a whip like this.
