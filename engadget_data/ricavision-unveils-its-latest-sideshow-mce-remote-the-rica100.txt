There's been a few changes since -- Bluetooth range has been increased to 300 meters, the button layout has been substantially beefed-up and revised to meet Microsoft's MCE guidelines, and the docking / charging cradle has been totally redesigned into a smaller, sleeker unit. All those changes don't come cheap, though -- the RICA100's MSRP is now $299, up from $199. We can't help but notice that this design is just a render too, though -- let's hope Ricavision shows off an actual physical product sometime soon.[Via eHomeUpgrade]
