We're totally impressed that Issac Hayesimov has been able to write so many awesome science fiction books and record
so many good funk albums and find the time to be a voice on South Park. What a career! There's been a
lot of misinformation about his work, and fortunately reader "Shane" (in the comments to Phillip's
I, Robot is out, do the robot dance..
post from the other day) was able to set all of us straight on what Isaac's Three Laws of Robotics really are:



A robot must risk his neck for his brother man, and may not cop out when there's danger all about.




A robot must be a sex machine to all the chicks, except where such actions conflict with the will of his main
 woman.




A robot must at all times strive to be one bad motha-shutchyomouth.



We're waiting patiently for the robosploitation remake of I, Robot.
