Or so we're led to believe. The shot above is purportedly the first leaked image of the outfit's forthcoming E-PL2, the Micro Four Thirds followup to the E-PL1. The real question here is this: did Olympus' engineers take your advice on how to change it? According to 43 Rumors, this guy will ship with a new 14-42mm f/3.5 - 5.6 kit lens, a 'direct movie' button, high-res 3-inch display, an ISO ceiling of 6400 and an intriguing Bluetooth module as an option. Cleverly dubbed Penpal, this is essentially the most sensible method of sending photos you snap on your camera to the web, be it on Facebook, Flickr or any other social network. If you've got the apparatus plugged into the hot shoe, you can sync it with your BT-enabled smartphone (Android or "Windows Mobile," we're told) and use its cellular connection to complete the upload. Definitely a more logical approach than shoving a 3G chip into a digicam, and undoubtedly a trend we expect to see take off in 2011. Regrettably, there's no pricing or release information to share, but all should be revealed in a matter of days.
