After all those drugs in the 60's, we're big fans of synaesthesia. As it turns out, there are some pretty practical
applications for it beyond having something to chat over with Timothy Leary when you make it on to the next life. Pat
Fletcher, who has been blind for 25 years, is able to see again by translating visual images into soundscapes with the
help of a tiny video camera and a software program called "The vOICe." She stashes the camera in her shades and gets a
"sound picture" generated from her visual landscape. It's an approach not terribly dissimilar from the idea of using
echolocation to translate spatial data into auditory
feedback, but this method frees up your hands as you don't have to carry any sort of cane device.
