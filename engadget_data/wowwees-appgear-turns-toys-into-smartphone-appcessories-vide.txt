AppGear combines actual physical toys with iOS and Android apps, like the launch title Foam Fighters. Each collectible, action figure or playset is paired with its own free, downloadable app that offers an augmented reality game or virtual way to interact with the toys. The line will be launching in "early" 2012, for between $9.99 and $19.99 depending on the particular toy. Six products will be available at launch, including Alien Jailbreak, Zombie Burbs, and Elite Commander which you can check out in the videos below alongside some incredibly vague PR. And we'll be gunning for WowWee booth when we land in Vegas to get some hands-on time with this lineup of AR-toys.
