But the X100 carries a $1,400 sticker price, and that 23mm lens -- as sharp as it may be -- is permanently fixed to the mount. That's why we were rather exited when Fuji announced its X10 earlier this week. Would this be a much more capable (and affordable) replacement for the X100? Turns out it's not -- well, not exactly -- though this latest model is certainly a better fit for the consumer market. We had a chance to go hands-on with an early prototype on display at the company's IFA booth, and while some features (notably the pop-up flash) weren't yet functional, we're told it's a rather accurate representation of what we'll see when the X10 hits stores in late October, priced within the â‚¬499-599 range (about $715-860).

The first thing you'll notice with the X10 is that, well, there's nary a power button in sight. Instead, you'll rotate the 28-112mm f/2-2.8 manual zoom lens to fire it up. There's also no aperture ring, unlike its more powerful sibling, and manual focus is handled electronically, instead of directly on the lens. Upon closer inspection, you'll find that the X100's slick hybrid viewfinder has been replaced with a strictly electronic one. And what about image quality? We weren't able to take away any sample pics, but with a much smaller 2/3-inch sensor, we haven't a doubt that images won't look nearly as good as those shot with Fuji's better-equipped model. To compensate for that, the camera's EXR mode can bump the resolution down from 12 megapixels to six, in turn capturing higher quality images in low light. We're looking forward to checking out a production version sometime this fall, but in the meantime, thumb through the images below, or jump past the break for a video overview.
