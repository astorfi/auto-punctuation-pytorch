Michael Dell and investment firm Silver Lake Partners' joint bid to take Dell private has just cleared its final obstacle: regulatory approval. That means the deal is now all but completed. The transaction, valued at $25 billion, will see Dell transitioning to a private entity by the end of the company's fiscal Q3 2014 (which wraps this month). It also puts the company back firmly in Michael Dell's control, as he'll now own 75 percent of the new entity. And, as he discussed on the company's last open call with investors, that means a return to "innovation" for the PC, tablet and enterprise markets that will come to define the new Dell.
