 Welcome to the party, guys. Actually, Samsung was already a member of Google's Open Handset Alliance -- so a welcoming committee really isn't necessary, and it comes as no surprise that the company has now gone on record saying that it wants an Android phone on the market in early 2009. If anything, it's a little surprising they're waiting so long, considering Samsung's tendency to crank out new models at a largely unrivaled pace -- and also considering that several of the company's existing handsets already include Google functionality of various sorts out of the box. Switch, anyone?
