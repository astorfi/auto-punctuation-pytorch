Apple has just released a new standalone app dubbed simply "Podcasts," which is available for iOS devices running version 5.1 or later. It expectedly offers a variety of ways to browse and discover podcasts among the thousands available (including a new Top Stations feature that groups select podcasts by category), as well as the ability to either stream episodes or download them for offline use. The app is also optimized for the iPad in addition to the iPhone, and it's thankfully able to sync podcasts with iTunes on your Mac or Windows PC (just be sure to upgrade to iTunes 10.6.3 first). No charge for this one, either.
