Organization is the key to a happy inbox, and Google's taking you one step closer to that stress-free experience. The company announced today that it'll be bringing a new tabbed layout to the desktop and mobile versions of Gmail, safely filing messages where they belong. The redesign lets you add up to five tabs, reorganizing them via drag-and-drop. You can set senders to appear in specific tabs and can move messages up to the primary one with a star. The upgrade is coming to the desktop, Android and iOS version of Gmail in "the next few weeks," though you can get a sneak peek on your desktop earlier by watching the mail program's gear / settings menu in the interim. There's also a video detailing the updates after the break, if you're so inclined.
