Not to be outdone by Albertsons Shop 'n' Scan system,
Cub Foods introduced yet another hi-tech
shopping solution when they began testing biometric payments on Monday. The Pay By Touch system reads the shopper's
finger (its unique heat signature, not the fingerprint) and then accesses their "electronic wallet." While this will
help reduce latency in the twinkie-to-couch mean round-trip time, supermarkets are most stoked at giving those darn
credit card companies (and their transaction fees) a real drubbing. Please, do not steal your rich friends'
fingers.
