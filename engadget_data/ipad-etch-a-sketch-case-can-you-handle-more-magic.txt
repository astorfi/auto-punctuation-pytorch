Made from ABS plastic, the case features rubber feet, felt backing, and retractable kickstands for laying the iPad flat or angling it for on-screen keyboard use. And those knobs? Decoration only son, they don't actually do anything. And while it promises to make you the "coolest kid in the conference room," it's more likely to confirm your boss' suspicion that he hired an overgrown baby -- such is the price for wistful affection. Oh, and the $39 required to take this home.
