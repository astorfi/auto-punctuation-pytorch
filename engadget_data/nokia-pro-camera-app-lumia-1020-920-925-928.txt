One of Lumia 1020's main attractions is its Nokia Pro Camera app, which completes the phone's 41-megapixel camera with a bunch of handy features. In our video after the break, you can see Niina (not a typo) from Nokia demonstrating the manual focusing and lossless digital zooming. The latter actually works both ways: even if you've zoomed in before capture (and still get native 5-megapixel resolution), you can also zoom back out while browsing these photos, as the app captures both the zoomed-in 5-megapixel image as well as the full 38-megapixel image simultaneously. This way you can reframe the image and even focus on a different subject, as CEO Stephen Elop showed us in our earlier interview. But if you don't need this feature, you can simply set the app to capture just 5-megapixel images by default.




The Pro Camera app also comes with a bunch of manual settings, and these can be toggled through sliders on top of a concentric circular interface. The settings come in this order from left to right: white balance, manual focus, ISO, exposure time and compensation. More serious photographers can enable different kinds of viewfinder grids in the settings menu, including these options: rule of thirds, golden ratio, crosshairs and square.

If you already own a Lumia 920, 925 or 928 then we have good news for you. Earlier today, Nokia confirmed that the Pro Camera app will be making its way to the aforementioned PureView devices, provided that they have received the Amber update. But of course, you'll have to grab a Lumia 1020 if you absolutely need the funky zooming capability.
