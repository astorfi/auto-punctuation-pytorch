  
Just in case you were concerned, we've landed safely in LA for a fanboy-filled week of E3 coverage. We've teamed up with Joystiq to bring you up to the second breaking news, keynote coverage, and in-depth interviews here on Engadget, and over at e3-2006.joystiq.com. Sony kicks off with the first "big three" keynote around 4PM tomorrow, followed by Nintendo and Microsoft on Tuesday around 11AM and 2PM respectively. Now is the time to call out your predictions for maximum cred potential. Our bets are all set for a Sony controller design reminiscent of the Wiimote, an "oh snap" HD DVD moment from Microsoft, and an open apology by Nintendo for the Wii moniker, but maybe that's just us.
