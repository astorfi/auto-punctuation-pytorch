A new Flip video camera with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz 802.11n WiFi just popped up in the FCC database. Based on the shape of the FCC label, the location of the HDMI port, and the M3260 model number, it definitely looks like a member of the Mino family, but that's really all we know -- although if we had to bet, the 5GHz support is there so it can beam movies to the FlipShare TV. We'll see, we'll see.
