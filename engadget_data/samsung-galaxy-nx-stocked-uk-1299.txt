We expected the Samsung Galaxy NX camera to cost a bundle when it was first announced, and if pricing from UK retailer Jessops proves accurate, we aren't going to be "disappointed." The Android-powered mirrorless model will run Â£1,299 ($2,000 or so) with an 18-55mm kit lens, more than Canon's fearsome EOS 70D and pushing Panasonic's flagship GH-3. As you may recall, the Galaxy NX is the first-ever interchangeable-lens camera to run Android, and packs 3G / 4G LTE radios along with a 20.3-megapixel APS-C sensor, 8.6fps shooting speed, WiFi, 16GB built-in storage, and 1/6000 shutter speed. We noted such strange bedfellows might make it a hard sell, especially considering some shortcomings for demanding photographers, like a slow start-up time and lack of manual dials. Jessops is showing the model in stock, while another retailer called Wex merely has it up for pre-order, so we're not sure which has it straight. In any event, if you're one of the few who thought high-end cameras really needed an Android OS, hit the sources.
