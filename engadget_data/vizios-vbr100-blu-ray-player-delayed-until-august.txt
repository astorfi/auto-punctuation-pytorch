After April came and went with nary a hint of the firm's VBR100 Blu-ray player shipping, we decided to inquire about its status. The outfit's primary press contact informed us that it now "looks more like August at this point" in terms of a ship date, and we're still waiting to hear back on the whos, whats, wheres and whys. We're crossing our fingers that late summer will bring more features and a lower price point in exchange for our patience, but we aren't getting our hopes up too high just yet.Update: According to Vizio, there won't be any changes made in the unit while we wait. Bollocks.
