The AuraGrid is a two part system which pumps yourInternet connection from the router through your home's existing coax cable infrastructure and terminates in an antennathat eliminates those pesky dead spots in your WLAN coverage. Simply unscrew your router's antenna, attach the port to acable jack, and any other room with a cable jack can get all WiFied up. The only caveat here is that homes withsatellite TV cannot use this system on the same coax wiring grid. Still, if you have cable or satellite with a separatecable infrastructure, this could be the best way yet to make your wireless connection useful beyond the 20 feet radiusof your home office
