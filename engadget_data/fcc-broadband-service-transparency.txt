If you're like me, you've paid for a certain speed from you internet provider only to get a fraction of the promised bandwidth. The FCC is reminding those who control access to the interwebs to be honest and forthcoming with their advertised data with the Open Internet Transparency Rule. The decree requires providers to give you every bit of data on their broadband services needed to make "informed choices." It also requires the disclosures to be "accurate and truthful," covering network management (handling congestion, etc.), performance, terms of service, plan descriptions, pricing and fees. You know, to eliminate surprises down the road. Of course, spilling data on expected and actual speed figures are part of the lot as well. And the Commission urges you to keep a watchful eye on your service, reporting any discrepancies with advertised numbers. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's full statement on the matter awaits after the break.

"Consumers deserve to get the broadband service they pay for. After today, no broadband provider can claim they didn't know we were watching to see that they disclose accurate information about the services they provide. The FCC's transparency rule requires that consumers get the information they need to make informed choices about the broadband services they purchase. We expect providers to be fully transparent about the details of their services, and we will hold them accountable if they fall down on this obligation to consumers."
