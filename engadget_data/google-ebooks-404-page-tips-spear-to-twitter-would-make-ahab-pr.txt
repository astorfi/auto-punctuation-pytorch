The rest, of course, is history and, with the launch of Google eBooks (n√©e Google Editions), the Googs is giving something of a tip of the hat to Twitter with its own error page -- but putting a literary spin on things. You can see the result above, a dejected man finding a decidedly non-white whale, and you don't have to be called Ishmael to catch the reference here.
