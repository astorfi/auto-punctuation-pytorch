At least that's the plan backed British Home Secretary John Reid, who is calling for a summit to develop innovative new methods to keep thugs from swiping shiny new toys from the hard-working hands of legit buyers. We're sure Apple and Sony can both come up with some interesting new shutdown / lockoff / phone-home features (that might also compromise end-user privacy), but nothin' says lovin' like bureaucrats solving society's ills by trying their hands at consumer electronics design.
