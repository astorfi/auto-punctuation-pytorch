 
We reported yesterday that Vodafone customers would be the first to get their hands on the lightweight 10.1-inch tablet, and now we're getting word via Twitter that Vodafone UK will carry the Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 exclusively in Britain, at least to start. Thus far, that's all she wrote -- Vodafone's tweet ends with "More info Coming soon!" but they've yet to follow up. So there's still no confirmation of a solid release date -- we've heard March for Asia and Europe -- or pricing, and Americans eagerly awaiting the tablet's Stateside debut have been left out in the cold, but at least our British friends will know where to go when the slim slate makes it to market.
