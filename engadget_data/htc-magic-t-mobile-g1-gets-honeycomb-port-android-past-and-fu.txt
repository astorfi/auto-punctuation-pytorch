Even in spite of its long overdue end of retail life last summer, the handset continues to see support from grassroots modders and tweakers, with the latest project being the most ambitious of them all: an Android Honeycomb port. A pair of xda members have succeeded in splicing Android's most senior hardware with its very latest software and the results are available to see on video after the break. As usual with these builds, half of the phone's functions have still to be enabled and the UI lag seems like it'll be a permanent feature whatever happens, but still -- it's Honeycomb on the G1!
