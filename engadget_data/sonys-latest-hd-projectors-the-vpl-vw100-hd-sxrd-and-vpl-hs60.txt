Take that, Qualia: Sony persists in continuing
to announce devices in Japan we probably won't get to hack it on, but we're not anyone to argue with their new
VPL-VW100 HD SXRD projector. The three-SXRD (Silicon X-tal Reflective Display) 1,080p monster has a 400w Xenon lamp,
15,000:1 contrast ratio, and all the digital inputs you're gonna need—but a matching pricetag of ¥1,365,000 (about
$12,500 US). Almost as an afterthought they announced their new VPL-HS60, too, which is a 10,000:1 contrast ratio 720p
device which will hit your bankbook for a significantly smaller chunk of change: ¥409,500 (about $3,750 US).
