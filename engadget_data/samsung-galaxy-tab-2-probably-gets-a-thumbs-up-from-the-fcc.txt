   Unless Samsung's produced yet another 7-inch tablet that's unannounced, we can be reasonably sure that the slate seen departing the FCC's underground bunker is the Galaxy Tab 2 (7.0). Eagle-eyed viewers will notice the back plate in the image above resembles the Tab 7.0 Plus -- but don't write in just yet, as the documents confirm the GT-P310 (Plus) schematic was used to disguise this new GT-P3113. The usual multimeter-and-ruler prodding revealed there's a Broadcom radio module with 802.11 b/g/n WiFi and Bluetooth 3.0 tucked inside. It jibes with what we've heard about an initial UK release for the device in March, but perhaps the company is ensuring it has worldwide approval, or that the USA can start getting excited about the budget ICS device a little sooner than expected.
