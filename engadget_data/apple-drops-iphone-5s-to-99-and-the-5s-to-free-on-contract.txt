We're at Apple's big iPhone 6 shindig, and as you might expect, Apple's new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch handsets have rendered its previous handsets a little more... moot. But hey, that means it's discount time! As with previous phone launches, Apple has lowered the starting price of the current 16GB iPhone 5s from $199 to $99 on contract, while the bottom-rung 8GB 5c runs a cool "zero." Both devices will also ship with iOS 8 starting September 17th.
