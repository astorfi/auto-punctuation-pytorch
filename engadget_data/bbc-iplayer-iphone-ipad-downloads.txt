First reported by The Guardian, it will let those with paid up TV licenses load their phones and tablets with plenty of programming to view when and where (including abroad) they want, for up to 30 days or within 7 days of being watched. Those restriction will keep viewers from building up libraries they can truly keep with them indefinitely, and it should be noted that the app will only let users download shows over WiFi for now, not surprising when we remember how long it took to add 3G streaming. Also interesting is the Beeb's decision not to charge extra for downloads, but we'll have to wait and see if competitors like ITV follow suit. The app is not live in iTunes yet, but we'll keep an eye out and let our UK based friends know when it's available to download. That here in the US we're (still) waiting for global iPlayer access hasn't made us jealous at all.

 Update: Version 2.0.0 is out, check the gallery for screenshots or the BBC's blog post for a few more details and stats on how people are using iPlayer.
