 Hiddy Ho Mr. XPS M1730, nice to see you up and dancing on Dell's own website for a change. While it's not exactly official, reader Evgeni noticed that a little E-Value code tomfoolery will pull up pictures, specs, and prices easy enough. $4,192 will take home a crimson red, 17-inch WUXGA beast with a Vista Ultimate pre-load and the following specs:

2.8GHz Intel Core 2 Extreme X7900 processor (800MHz FSB and 4MB cache)
2GB 667MHz DDR2 memory (4GB for an additional $375)
2 x 200GB 7200RPM disks
DVD burner (upgradeable for Blu-ray playback for an additional $550)
512MB Dual (!) NVIDIA GeForce 8700M GT with nVIDIA SLI Te
802.11a/g/n WiFi
9-cell primary and 9-cell secondary batteries

That's only the start.
 

You also have the option to slap in an AT&T HSDPA 3.6 or Sprint / Verizon EVDO rev. A card for an additional $163 and $129, respectively. Hell, while you're at it, why not just throw in a pair of 64GB SSDs for an additional $1,625? Egads, that's a lot of kit. Still no official announcement from Dell so don't go pinching exact pennies just yet gamers, these prices might change before the rig is finally turned loose.[Thanks, Evgeni N.] Read -- $2,999 configuration Read -- $3,599 configuration Read -- $4,192 configuration
