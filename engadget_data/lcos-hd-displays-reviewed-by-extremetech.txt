ExtremeTech subjected the sets to a set of, well, extreme, tests, to determine both whetherLCoS as a technology lives up to its hype, and which of these individual sets should rule your home theater. Theirconclusions? You'll have to wait for Part B of their review (ah, what teasers they are!). But, in the meantime, you cancheck out their detailed explanation of how LCoS works, and drool over the pics of the sets. We know we will.
