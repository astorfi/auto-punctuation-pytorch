We haven't heard a single peep about the new tablet until the advert you can see above mysteriously leaked, at which point Viewsonic confirmed to Tablet Test that the device not only exists, but will be coming out "soon." The ViewPad 10e gets a 9.7-inch, 1024 x 768 IPS display (that's the same size and resolution as the TouchPad and iPad 2's display), a 1.3 megapixel camera and it's only 9mm (0.35 inches) thick. We don't know much about what's on the inside, except to say it'll be running Gingerbread solo, rather than the "dual OS" setup of the ViewPad 10pro. There's nary a release date to be found, but we do know that when it arrives, it'll set Europeans back to the tune of â‚¬250 (about $340).

[Thanks, Andreas]
