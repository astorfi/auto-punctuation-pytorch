Then, earlier this year, we were there when Jeff Hawkins announced the ill-fated Foleo at D5. We got the first ever hands-on of the thing, and eventually wrote a letter to Palm which not only prompted a public response from CEO Ed Colligan, but that many attributed as a cause of the Foleo's death. And lucky us (we think?), we managed to snag one of the few Foleos ever produced.
