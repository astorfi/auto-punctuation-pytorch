Just like the Japanese unit we toyed with a few months ago, there's no denying the sexiness of the hardware here -- the OLED screen is gorgeous, and the faux-granite shell is quite nice in person, lending the whole experience a nice solid feel. We just wish the gigantic FCC sticker on the back wasn't so nasty -- it's strangely cheap compared to everything else about the device. We're putting this thing through its paces and we'll have some more impressions in a bit, but for now check the unboxing and a quick head-to-head with the iPod touch in the gallery!
