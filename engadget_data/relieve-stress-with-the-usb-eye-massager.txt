USB—which, if you've forgotten, can do just about
anything for your
desktop—gadget makers have finally birthed the USB Eye
Massager. You know, normally we don't quote sites, but it's an irresistible marketing pitch:




USB Eye Massager is the latest-designed health care Product specially for the Person which long time use their
 eyes, Such as the Computer operator.



We don't know about you people, but that particular finger configuration only means one thing to us when it
