 We thought the idea of top Oscar nomsgetting special edition Moto PEBLs was prettysweet. But Kodak's topped that, and proven that digicams are as worthy of bling as iPods, cellphones and laptops. Thecamera company is shacking up with Kwiat Diamond for a special edition EasyShare V570, which comes encrusted in 75Kwiat diamonds in each of the Best Actress nominees' initials (we're guessing this one's Reese Witherspoon). Each isvalued at $20,000 ($20,400 if you include the cost of the camera), so even if they don't win the little gold man, atleast these ladies walk away with a very subtle reminder that they're rich, famous, and can still hack getting givengifts from gadget companies worth more than some people make annually.
