 Ah, how we adore a textual / vocal slugfest between two mega corporations who should certainly be focusing their efforts on more pressing matters (like ramping up production for launch day). This matchup sees a mysterious (if unknown) Sony spokesperson supposedly criticizing Microsoft's latest Live Video functionality, claiming that the poor ole Core customers are getting hung out to dry when it comes to downloading HDTV flicks and programming. It was stated that the "PlayStation 3's content is designed for everyone to enjoy right out of the box, no matter which configuration is purchased," which is indubitably accurate, except the fact that Sony's cheapest offering sports a $500 pricetag, while the Core Xbox 360 only demands three-fifths of that. Digging that hole even deeper, they went on to say that "[Sony] would never segregate or shut out any of our consumers from our entertainment experience because they didn't buy the top of the line system," which seems to omit the lack of memory expansion slots and built-in WiFi on the "low-end" PS3. Nevertheless, Microsoft does give consumers the option to snap up a $99 20GB hard drive if they so desire, and just might be ready to drop an even larger version for the heavy downloaders out there -- but regardless of who's right here, we can't wait to hear Microsoft's sure-to-be-forthcoming reaction.[Via Joystiq]
