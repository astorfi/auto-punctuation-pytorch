Those who preordered this little guy for $249 should start receiving it shortly, as a series of frustrating delays finally come to an end. We can't wait to plug this network tuner in and toss up to three HD feeds at a time through our Ethernet cabling and expect most others feel the same way. Check out out our pics in the gallery below, we'll let you know if the InfiniTV 4 has competition worth worrying about -- seems like it, given the price drop -- shortly.
