First it showed up on the company's site, and now here it is getting man-handled by Mr. Blurrycam. The footage is a little dark and hard to see, but that certainly looks like an ice cream sandwich running on there -- and crashing from time to time. The video popped up on YouTube and was promptly pulled -- but don't worry, we kept a copy. Enjoy that after the break, and swing on back by here in a few hours for the liveblog.
