 Samsung started pushing a new Jelly Bean update to its Galaxy S III phones yesterday, and it's posted a video breaking down some of the features. Many of the "Premium Suite" upgrades are cribbed from the Galaxy Note II, but we're sure users will still enjoy multi-window, a customizable notification panel, smart rotation and more. The video shows off the new multitasking, NFC and reader features, plus contextual awareness tweaks that adjust the phone around your actions. Some of the other new features are apparently being saved for part two of the video, but if you need something to keep busy until 4.2 eventually arrives you can check it out after the break.

 Update: Samsung has posted part two, breaking down new camera features, accessibility options and even stereo sound balancing.
