Microsoft listed off a list of titles coming to Xbox One back at E3, but it's Gamescom time, folks, and that means we get to find out about quite a few more games coming to the console. As of August 19th, the number of Xbox One games has grown to 50, with titles that should appeal to almost any kind of gamer. Battlefield 4, Call of Duty: Ghosts, and FIFA 14 will be coming with exclusive Xbox content, joined by 19 other titles that are exclusive to Xbox or will be arriving first exclusively to Microsoft's console. Joining exclusives we already knew about like Killer Instinct and Forza Motorsport 5, are Powerstar Golf, Sunset Overdrive and D4, among others. Naturally, there's a whole host of other games coming to the One as well, but we'll let you peruse the full list over at the source link, so head on down to see what gaming goodness awaits in your next-gen future.
