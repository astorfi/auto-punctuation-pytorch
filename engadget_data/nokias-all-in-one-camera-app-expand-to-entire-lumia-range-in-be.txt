Devices with the PureView tag attached have not only the best shooters in Nokia's Lumia range, but also exclusive access to the relatively new Nokia Camera app. Today, though, that latter privilege is being extended to all Lumias with the launch of the Nokia Camera beta program. Any Windows Phone 8 handset that's been updated to Amber or above can now use the software -- an amalgam of, and successor to Nokia's Pro and Smart camera apps. As it's not quite ready for a full store debut, you'll need to sign up with Nokia Beta Labs at the source if you want early, and perhaps buggy access.
