File this one under: "Only in Japan." In America we are forced to watch Paris Hilton publicly humiliate little
Tinkerbell by dressing her up in all kinds of gaudy designer outfits; the Japanese, on the other hand, seem to prefer
the more humane practice of dressing up their
AIBOs in wacky costumes. At the Tokyo
Competition 2005 in the Marunouchi shopping district, 40 artistic robot dog lovers showed up to compete for the title
of "Most Cleverly Dressed Robotic Companion" (we made that up), displaying such gems as the Spiderman Dog, the Ninja
Dog, and what looks to be an AIBO completely covered in bath sponges. No mention here of the winner, but when robot
dogs get all decked out and hit the town, aren't we all winners in some way?
