Those unspecified toys will apparently make use of NeuroSky's ThinkGear bio-sensor technology which, according to the company, uses "dry active sensors" that eliminate the need for contact gels while also maintaining a small form factor. Given the vagaries of the announcement, however, we wouldn't expect the toys to be hitting store shelves anytime soon, but you can be sure that there'll be plenty of attempts to "repurpose" them whenever they do.[Via Gadget Lab]
