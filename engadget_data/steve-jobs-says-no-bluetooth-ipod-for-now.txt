We know we're not the only ones who have been quietly clamoring for a
Bluetooth-enabled iPod, but it
looks like we're going to have to keep dreaming — in yet another statement to the press at the big Apple Expo in Paris
today, Steve Jobs trashed the idea of a Bluetooth iPod, saying that,



The problem with Bluetooth headphones is that it's not just recharging your iPod, you have to recharge your
 headphones too. People hate it. There are quality issues - the bandwidth isn't high enough, and even if it does get
 there some day, people don't want to recharge their headphones.



He's dead wrong about the bandwidth issues — Bluetooth 2.0 most definitely has the necessary bandwidth for crystal
clear stereo audio, but we'll concede that having yet another gadget to charge can be annoying, even though hundreds of
thousands of people who use Bluetooth wireless headsets with their cellphones every day have somehow managed to get
over that issue. Anyway, you know how Steve is, once he's made up his mind about something that's it….until he
announces at Macworld that he's changed his mind.
