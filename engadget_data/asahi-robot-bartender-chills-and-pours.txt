 Looking for a bartender whowon't drink up all the brews and slack off when you need him? Japan's Asahi Breweries has the answer: the company'srobot bartender can open a can of beer and pour it into a glass, guaranteeing a perfect head each time. And the bot'sbody is a fridge that holds a six pack. As part of a promotion, Asahi is giving away 5,000 of the bots. Unfortunately,it's a Japan-only deal, so if you want a robot bartender of your own, you'll either have to hop on a plane, or see ifyou can hire the Motoman RoboBar, whowe hear is looking for some work just about now.
