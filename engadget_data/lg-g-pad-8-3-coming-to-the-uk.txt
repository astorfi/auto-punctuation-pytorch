We first got our paws on LG's 8.3-inch G Pad tablet back at IFA, today it's been confirmed that it'll be coming to the UK and Ireland. Brits who want a slice of the action can expect to pay around £259 for the privilege, while Irish buyers can snap one up starting within the next two weeks. LG reminds us this is only part of the broader global rollout, which will see it land in over 30 total markets by the end of the year. You might have to wait a little while longer, though, if you're done with the whole "flat" thing.
