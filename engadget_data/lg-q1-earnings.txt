 LG has released its earnings report for the first quarter of 2013, and while they were down overall from last year, there is good news to report for its phones. A net profit of $20.3 million is lower than Q1 2012's $214 million -- but better than Q4's lawsuit-related $428 million loss -- blamed on weaker earnings in its home theater business. The good news is reserved for phones, where sales were up 30 percent from last year thanks to devices like the Optimus G (original, Pro and Nexus 4) and L series. Home Entertainment sales dropped to their lowest level in the past year, blamed mostly on a decline in plasmas and professional displays. Q2 is expected to be another good one as the Optimus L Series II, 5.5-inch Optimus G Pro and Optimus F ship worldwide. According to LG its LCD sales were actually up thanks to growing demand in Europe and China, but profits took a hit because of increased competition. While it doesn't expect the overall market to change, it is looking for better results in Q2 as its new Smart and 3D TVs hit shelves along with upcoming 4K and OLED sets. We'll keep digging through the numbers for more details, check the source link below to take a look for yourself.



  Show full PR text   LG ANNOUNCES FIRST-QUARTER 2013 FINANCIAL RESULTS  Quarterly Results Reflect Record-High Smartphone Shipments   SEOUL, Apr. 24, 2012 â€“ LG Electronics (LG) today reported a solid first-quarter performance due to a resurging handset business which shipped 10.3 million smartphones between January and March, the highest for LG since it entered the smartphone race. Better-than-expected performance in LG's mobile operations offset weaker results in the home entertainment business.

   First-quarter operating profit of KRW 350 billion (USD 322.88 million) and net profit of KRW 22 billion (USD 20.30 million) declined somewhat from the same period last year. However, revenues in the first quarter rose 6.8 percent year-over-year to KRW 14.10 trillion (USD 13.01 billion) mainly due to the improved performance of the mobile business.

   LG Home Entertainment Company revenues of KRW 5.17 trillion (USD 4.77 billion) declined year-on-year due to lower sales of plasma TVs and IT products. Sales of LCD TVs increased in Europe and developing markets such as China and CIS from the same period last year. Operating profit of KRW 30 billion (USD 27.68 million), although lower than last year, increased compared to the previous quarter. Although TV and IT market will continue to be stagnant, LG expects stronger results with the rollout of new 3D Smart TVs and ULTRA HD TVs.

   LG Mobile Communications Company results improved significantly in the first quarter, recording revenues of KRW 3.21 trillion (USD 2.96 billion) on smartphone shipments of 10.3 million units, an increase in revenue of 28.5 percent from the same period last year. Healthy sales of LTE smartphones such as the Optimus G and Optimus G Pro along with 3G smartphones including the Optimus L Series and Nexus 4 contributed to the improved results. Operating profit increased almost four-fold from the same period last year to KRW 133 billion (USD 122.69 million) thanks to stronger revenue and better cost structure. The company expects to further increase shipments and sales in the second quarter with the worldwide rollout of Optimus L SeriesII targeting 3G markets with the 5.5-inch Full HD IPS Optimus G Pro and Optimus F Series in countries with 4G LTE networks.

   LG Home Appliance Company sales in the first quarter of 2013 increased 11 percent from the same period last year to KRW 2.81 trillion (USD 2.59 billion), largely due to improved sales in the United States, Central America and the Middle East. A 29 percent decrease in operating profit year-over-year to KRW 102 billion (USD 94.10 million) reflected increased investments in R&D and marketing. LG will focus on strengthening its competitiveness and market leadership in a weak worldwide market with differentiated products and a strengthened product line-up.

   LG Air Conditioning and Energy Solution Company revenues were KRW 1.23 trillion (USD 1.14 billion) in the first quarter, mainly as a result of improved performance in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Due to successful new products, operating profit was virtually unchanged year-on-year at KRW 73 billion (USD 67.34 million) despite an increase in R&D expenses. LG expects to improve its sales and profitability by introducing more energy efficient and localized air conditioning products.
