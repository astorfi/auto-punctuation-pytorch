The peripheral outfit has hooked up with Sixense to bring motion sensing controls to PC gaming, and it utilized a wild demo of Left 4 Dead 2 to showcase the device. We hate to link everything to the Wiimote, but if you're desperate for a quick n' dirty explanation of this, it's sort of like a Wiimote / Natal mashup, but just for PCs. Users will find one-to-one tracking, and while further details were few and far between, we're told that devices based around the tech would be launched later in the year. Enough chit chat -- hop on past the break for an unashamedly gory clip of this thing in action.
