Hugeness. They've been making noise about doing video-on-demand before, but TiVo actually took everybody's advice
and is teaming up with Netflix to introduce a new service where if you subscribe to both TiVo and Netflix you'll be
able to get your DVDs delivered to you directly over the Internet rather than having to wait for the discs to arrive
through the mail (you will have to wait a few hours for the movie to download to your TiVo's hard drive). The deal
hasn't been totally finalized yet (it's still awaiting approval of TiVo's board of directors), but we're still sorta
dealing with all the weirdness of the two companies actually listening to what people were telling them and teaming
upâ€”we never thought it'd actually happen.
