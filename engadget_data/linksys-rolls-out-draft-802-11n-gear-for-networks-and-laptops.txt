The company's new additions are theWireless-N Broadband Router ( WRT300N) and Wireless-N Notebook Adapter (WPC300N ). As you've probably already figuredout, the WRT300N can connect your equipment to your broadband network and serve as an access point for wireless devices-- such as a laptop equipped with the WPC300N (or, of course, most 802.11b/g devices). The WRT300N is expected to retailfor about $150, while the WPC300N should go for about $120. Seems a small price to pay for 100 mbps throughput -- if youcan really get that kind of speed, that is.
