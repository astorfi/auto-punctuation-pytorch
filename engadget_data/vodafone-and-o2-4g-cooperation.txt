While the two carriers will still compete for customers, it'll pool the infrastructure needed to roll out 4G coverage. Both companies will run on separate spectrum and each will have access to around 18,500 masts, apparently boosting the number of sites by more than 40 percent for each operator. The duo will also cooperate on new masts in remote areas and intend to start later this year -- once Ofcom's had its say.
