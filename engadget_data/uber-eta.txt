Uber's latest update tackles that age old question: are we there yet? The company's offering up an ETA feature that'll let you share your estimated arrival time with friends and family via text message. Enable the feature in the app, enter your destination and once your driver starts his or her trip, you can text your real-time ETA along with map link to concerned parties. The latest version of the app is available now for iOS and Android. No word on how time traveling DeLorean rides are expected to impact the app's estimates.
