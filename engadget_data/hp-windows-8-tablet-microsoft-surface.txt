That's now changed thanks to an interview senior sales VP John Solomon gave to CRN, however, where he promises that HP will have more to share about its business-minded tablet "pretty soon." What's more, unlike some other big OEMs, Soloman says that HP doesn't see a problem with Microsoft's Surface plans. He says that he thinks Microsoft "was basically making a leadership statement and showing what's possible in the tablet space," adding that, "our relationship has not changed at all due to Microsoft's announcement. In fact, I applaud it." That's not to say he doesn't take some issue with Microsoft's efforts, though, noting that while the Surface's keyboard accessory is "a great occasional use keyboard," there's "no way" that professional content creators will "use a keyboard like that for everyday use."
