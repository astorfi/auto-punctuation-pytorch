While it's not the Mario Kart movie we'd all been hoping for (c'mon, right?,) it's arguably the next best thing. Sony is reportedly developing a film about that other petrol head game -- Gran Turismo. It's claimed that Mike de Luca and Dana Brunetti (The Social Network / Fifty Shades of Grey) are onboard with the project, which no doubt hopes to capitalize on the PlayStation title's solid following. That or Sony got sick of waiting for a certain other series to end before pursuing the idea. While we're not suggesting that our plot expectations are low, there's still hope other game crossovers might give us some faith in the format first.
