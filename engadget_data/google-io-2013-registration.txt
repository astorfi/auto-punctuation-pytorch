General admission is $900, while full-time students or faculty members of high schools and colleges can score a discounted Academic pass for $300. In order to attend Google's three-day shindig, you'll need to be at least 16 years old, have a Google+ profile to sign into the registration process and a Google Wallet account to purchase your ticket. While it remains uncertain if the company will be serving up slices of Key Lime Pie at this year's conference, we wouldn't be surprised if some type of dessert-flavored software is announced along with a few other goodies. Google warns that tickets will be limited, so if you plan on attending you'll definitely want to set yourself a reminder and make sure that all of your ducks are in a row in order to increase your odds of securing a spot.
