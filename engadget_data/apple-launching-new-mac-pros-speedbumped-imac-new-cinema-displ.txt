John also says the Magic Trackpad might also arrive tomorrow, but he's calling that one a "double-hypothetical," so who knows -- we'd think anything more serious than hardware refreshes would warrant a Jobs introduction, but hey, maybe Steve's all talked out for the month. We'll see what happens -- stay tuned.
