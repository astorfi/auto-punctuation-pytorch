Sure enough, it's sporting the requisite 850 / 1900MHz WCDMA bands for the American carrier (though it could just as easily appear at Canada's big three) as well as Bluetooth, single-band 802.11 b/g/n WiFi, and 13.56MHz for RFID. In case you're curious, the latter indicates that the curvy handset will almost certainly keep its NFC capabilities. So, Samsung... are you about ready to tell us about that GT-i9023?
