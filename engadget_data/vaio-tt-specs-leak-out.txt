Yeah, we'll take three. The other configs aren't quite as smoking hot, but you're looking at 11.1-inch screens, 160GB hard drives, 1.2GHz SU9300 Core 2 Duo processors, and Vista Home Premium all the way around. Too bad we don't have prices, pictures, or release dates yet, but we're guessing we'll find out lots more soon.
