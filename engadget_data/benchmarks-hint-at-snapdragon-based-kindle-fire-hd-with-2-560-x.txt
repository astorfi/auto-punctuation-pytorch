While benchmark leaks can be wobbly info-stones to tread upon, the arrival of some purported Kindle Fire HD scores could be the first steps toward a timely refresh. The results in question refer to a "Amazon KFAPWA" device with a reported Adreno 330 GPU, which by implication would likely mean a Snapdragon 800 SoC. The field that really leaps out, however, is that 2,560 x 1,600 resolution. If true, it could mean the 8.9-inch version is getting a bump from the previous iteration's 1,920 x 1,200 display. This certainly chimes with earlier reports, and, if nothing else, would certainly make that new browser UI all the more pretty to look at.
