       We've been hearing the faintest of whispers that Lenovo had a new IdeaPad on tap, and while we haven't received any official confirmation just yet, we figured it prudent to pass along the latest. According to an anonymous tipster, the G430 will boast a 14.1-inch WXGA display, 2GB of RAM, a 160GB hard drive, Vista Home Basic, a DVD burner, NVIDIA's 256MB GeForce 9300M GS and a 6-cell battery. Furthermore, you'll find 802.11a/b/g WiFi, no webcam and an undisclosed array of ports. Your guess is as good as ours when it comes to pricing / availability, but surely we'll know something more soon. Surely.[Thanks, anonymous]
