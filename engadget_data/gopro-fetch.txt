It's easy to get a dog's-eye view of the world by strapping an action camera to your canine, but making it stable and comfortable is another matter -- you don't want Rover shaking off that costly video gear. That's where GoPro's new Fetch mount should come in handy. The padded harness lets your dog carry up to two cameras (back and belly) in comfort, whether it's a tiny French Bulldog or a bigger Golden Retriever. The add-on includes a camera tether and water resistance, too, so your companion can play rough without losing any equipment. You'll have to spend a significant $60 to make Fetch happen, but it might be worth the outlay if you're eager to record the adventures of a four-legged friend.
