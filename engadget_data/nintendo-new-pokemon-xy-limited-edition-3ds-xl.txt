Kids love colors. Kids love Pokemon. Collectors love limited editions. And that's all you need to understand about Nintendo's 3DS marketing strategy. So, what's a Xerneas and an Yveltal? They're Pokemon things -- Legendaries, in fact -- and we have no idea. But we do know Nintendo's two new Pokemon XY edition 3DS XLs are going to sell out like a Miley Cyrus concert sponsored by Blow Pops and Build-a-Bear when they hit stores on September 27th. The plus-sized systems come in two striking color combos -- blue/black and red/black -- and feature a pre-loaded digital copy of the game, as well as abstract sketch designs of the aforementioned deer-like, fairy Xerneas and hawkish, dark and flying-type Yveltal. Nintendo hasn't priced these two custom cash cows just yet, but consider yourself warned: if you don't act fast and catch'em all when they hit, you can can count on them being as rare to find as the Pokemon they represent.


Update: Turns out these new bundles don't include digital copies of Pokemon XY. The game will be available for purchase separately.
