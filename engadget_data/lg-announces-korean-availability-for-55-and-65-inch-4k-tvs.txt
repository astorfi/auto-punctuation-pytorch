A few folks have already picked up LG's 84-inch monster Ultra HD TV, but most videophiles are looking for something that'll actually fit in their living room. Thankfully, the firm is prepared for those buyers too, and is now taking pre-orders for its 55 and 65-inch 4K Ultra HD TVs. Korean customers with money to burn can pick up the 55-inch set for 7.4 million Won (about $6,541) and the larger variant for 10.9 million ($9,635). Hardly cheap, but comparable to the competition and definitely an affordable alternative to LG's $20,000 display. Check out LG's official (machine translated) announcement at the attached source.
