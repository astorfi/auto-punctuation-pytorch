The iW1, as it's been named, is much slicker than its minimalist looks would suggest: the portable speaker system features a built-in lithium-ion battery with an inductive charging base so you can just grab and go, Bongiovi Acoustics audio, capacitive touch controls and support for iHome's iOS configuration apps, and a USB port for charging and local audio playback. Oh, and it can stream music from iOS devices and iTunes using AirPlay, of course. Sadly, there's still no price or ship date, but if this thing is priced anywhere close to earth we'd say the Sonos S5 has got itself some serious competition.
