Unfortunately, the same source says this thing doesn't have Sammy's new Super AMOLED screen, so we'd assume it doesn't have that new faster processor from the Galaxy S either -- all of which means the HTC EVO 4G is still really the Sprint device to wait for. But hey, maybe you love TouchWiz? Is that a thing? It's hard to say what the kids are into nowadays.
