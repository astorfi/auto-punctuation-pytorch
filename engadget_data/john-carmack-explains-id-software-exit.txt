We know the basic reason why John Carmack left id Software: he wanted to concentrate on his work at Oculus VR. However, we now know that it was more complicated -- it was the result of a dream denied. The game developer explains to USA Today that he had proposed a deal between ZeniMax (id's parent company) and Oculus VR that would have games like Doom 4 and Wolfenstein: The New Order support the Oculus Rift. He was heartbroken when the pact didn't come to be. "When it became clear that I wasn't going to have the opportunity to do any work on VR while at id Software, I decided to not renew my contract," Carmack says. The departure is ultimately "bittersweet," but it reflects his sincere belief that wearable displays represent the next big thing.
