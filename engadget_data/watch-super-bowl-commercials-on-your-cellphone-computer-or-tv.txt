 If you need to take abreak during the best part of the Super Bowl --and, of course, we're talking about those multimillion dollar commercials -- don't worry. The NFL will berebroadcasting all of the game's commercials next Monday and Tuesday, via the web, the football league's cable channeland Sprint's cellphone network. So there you go; you now have no excuse to miss this year's GoDaddy (or"1984") moment. Miss a key play or a halftime "wardrobe malfunction," on the other hand, and you'reon your own.
