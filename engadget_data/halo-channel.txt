As if Halo: The Master Chief Collection wasn't a juicy enough feast of your favorite Xbox sci-fi military franchise. Today at Gamescom Bonnie Ross, GM at 343 Industries, revealed an new hub for fans of the game on Xbox One -- The Halo Channel. It'll coincide with the launch of the The Master Chief Collection in November, and you'll be able to chat, catch news and, of course, dive right into your preferred edition of the game (we're fans of the original if you're asking). As you might expect, the channel also comes with the obligatory exclusive content and Twitch integration too.
