Although the update is downloaded via satellite, the update is kicked off when your TiVo phones home. Unfortunately all the calling in the world won't necessarily get you the update. DirecTV is rolling out the updates in their own way and there is no way to tell when they will activate it on your TiVo. Some at TiVoCommunity are lucky enough to have it already and are confirming the new folders and increased performance. Our friends over at Dealdatabase are figuring out ways to activate it themselves, but of course this requires that you already have a hacked TiVo with telnet enabled. They are also trying to figure out if it is possible to enable MRV with the new update.Read - TiVoCommunity.com's 6.3 Update ThreadRead - DealDatabase.com's 6.3 Update Thread
