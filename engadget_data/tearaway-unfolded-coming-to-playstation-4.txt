Developing for the PlayStation 4 allowed Media Molecule to add wholly new gimmicks. One such gimmick featured a player exploring the game world by using the lightbar on his PlayStation 4 as a makeshift flashlight that can only illuminate objects in the game. Another saw a player catch an object thrown by a character in the game, only to shake it up, fling it back and destroy a building in the background.

Don't be confused by these new tricks, however. This is not a new game. Instead, Media Molecule claims that Tearaway Unfolded is the "same overall journey as the Vita, only on the big screen." Following the press conference, the PlayStation.blog posted additional information on Tearaway. Almost all of it is contained in the trailer below the break, but keep in mind that the game will run at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second when it makes its PlayStation 4 debut.
