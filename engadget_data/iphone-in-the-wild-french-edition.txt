Here we see an innocent, mild-mannered iPhone test subject caught candidly making a call (to John Appleseed, we assume), while walking down a sun-filled, money-lined avenue in the sleepy burg. The photographer manages to steal a moment with the gentleman for a close up shot, and hey -- that screen looks pretty good in the sun. Check the link for translation and photos.
