IOGEAR has just introduced it's USB 2.0 Docking Station, a fairly straightforward looking unit for your laptop (but
that's probably what you want a dock to be).  Just connect your laptop via a USB cable and you'll instantly add an
Ethernet port, two PS/2 ports, audio-in/out jacks, a serial port and three USB 2.0 ports.  And even though it
looks like it'd be a good match with your shiny new PowerBook G4 perfectly, this one isn't Mac compatible.  But PC
users can get it now for $89.95.
