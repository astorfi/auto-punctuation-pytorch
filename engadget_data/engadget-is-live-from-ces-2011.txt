 
Oh yes humans of Earth and other humans and aliens not from Earth -- it's officially that time of the year again. CES time. As you can see in the photos above and below, Engadget is most definitely on the ground and ready for action. As in years past, we've got the entire Engadget team (including many members of our international teams) in beautiful downtown Las Vegas to cover every crazy nook and cranny of one of the biggest tech shows in existence. The gang is stationed in our double-wide trailer right outside the Las Vegas Convention Center, and we'll be hitting every piece of news that comes out of the show, liveblogging loads of press conferences and events, and stalking the halls looking for the juiciest devices known to man.

Engadget is once again the Official Blog Partner of CES (three years strong!), and we're ridiculously excited to have the opportunity to broadcast it out into the universe. Check out our extremely fancy and new CES hub here for a blow-by-blow look at the show, tune in nightly for our CES podcast, and get ready for the wildest week in tech news ever. Ever. Ever!
