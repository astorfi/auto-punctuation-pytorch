Samsung's original NX300 mirrorless camera came with little to shout about beyond its gimmicky 3D capability. This refreshed NX300M brings something more useful to the table, however: a 3.31-inch AMOLED touch display that can now flip around 180 degrees instead of just 90, making it possible to easily frame up your selfies. Other features remain unchanged from the original, like the 20.3-megapixel APS-C sensor, 100-25,600 ISO range, 8.6fps continuous shooting, dual-channel WiFi with SmartShare and NFC capability. Users in Korea will be able to grab one now in white, black and brown with an 18-55mm kit lens for 890,000 won (about $839). There's no word on US pricing or availability, but that shouldn't be too far behind.
