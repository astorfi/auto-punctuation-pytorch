It seems that just about every Blu-ray title we add isn't available, and while we're not sure how widespread this is, we do know we've received emails -- thanks Andy! -- complaining about the exact same thing; and with HD DVDs too. We understand that there are a lot of new HD movie player owners out there after the holidays and that with the WGA strike, there is more demand than ever for movie rentals. But still Netflix, get it together and increase your stock, so we don't have to wait forever to see a new release in HD.
