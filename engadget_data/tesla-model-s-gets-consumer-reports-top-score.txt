While we largely enjoyed our time behind the wheel of the Tesla Model S, we clearly didn't have as much fun as Consumer Reports. The often stringent outlet just gave the EV sedan a 99 out of 100 rating, which makes it not just the publication's highest-ranked electric car, but its highest-ranked car... period. In particular, Tesla earned high marks for efficiency and quietness, as you'd expect, although CR is equally impressed with the Model S' performance and that inescapable 17-inch touchscreen. The review isn't uniformly positive, though: not surprisingly, the luxury pricing and inherent range limits prevent a flawless verdict. It's still a symbolic win for eco-friendly transport, however, and might help one Mr. Musk feel better about his pride and joy.
