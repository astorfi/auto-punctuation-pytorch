We're not entirely sure what the "Mammoth Project" 30-foot tall robot does, signifies, or why it otherwise
existsâ€”but we do know it breathes all sorts of fire. Not quite the
rocket punch we saw last year, though. Would you guys
pull it together already and loose this thing on Tokyo or something?
