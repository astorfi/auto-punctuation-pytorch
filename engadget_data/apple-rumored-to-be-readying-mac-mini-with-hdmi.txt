That's according to AppleInsider, at least, which has it from "two people familiar with the matter" that prototypes of a Mac mini with an HDMI port have been seen making the rounds in the usual inner circles. At least one of those prototypes was also said to be based on NVIDIA's MCP89 chipset, which means that any forthcoming Mac mini revision would pass over the latest Core i3, i5 and i7 processors in favor of older Core 2 Duos if it is indeed the chipset used in the final product. Unfortunately, there's nothing more specific than "this year" in terms of a rumored release date, and this is still just one rumor about what would be a fairly big shift in Apple's strategy -- so, you know, keep that in mind before you start ripping apart your current HTPC setup.
