The Scaleo Home Server will feature headless operation under Vista Home Server, a two disk 500GB SATA RAID array, gigabit Ethernet, and Energy Star 4.0-compliant energy usage of just 50W. Price estimates are ranging from €500 ($690) to €700 ($965), and availability is hazily pegged at "by the end of the year" -- projections that match the awesome blurriness of this render.[Via We Got Served][Thanks, tip-star]
