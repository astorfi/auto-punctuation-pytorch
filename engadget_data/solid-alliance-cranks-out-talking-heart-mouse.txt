On the surface, this shiny red USB mouse boasts a left and right click, a scroll-wheel, and a heartfelt (ahem) design, but apparently, this thing also emits optimistic phrases (read: I love you) to keep you mousing even when fighting through carpal tunnel syndrome. It's a little late (or way early, depending on perspective) for Valentine's Day, but for Â¥1,980 ($17), why not treat someone special anyway?[Via FarEastGizmos]
