 Last month, rumors swirled that Twitter had acquired music discovery service We Are Hunted to fold it into a forthcoming music app. Today, that acquisition has been made official, with the We Are Hunted team announcing that it's shutting down its services and joining team Twitter, with the promise that it would "continue to create services that will delight you." Alas, there's no more detail provided about what services it'll be creating, but its core competency of tune discovery sure will dovetail nicely with Twitter's rumored preferred method of sonic delivery, SoundCloud. Time will tell if this attempt at a musical social network goes over better than the last one.
