Since Betaworks purchased Instapaper earlier this year, a design update has made its way to the iOS and web versions of the app. Today, that refresh is hitting the save-now-read-later utility on Android. In addition to an overhauled interface, the update brings search (via in-app purchase) for scanning items in your Instapaper account for a particular keyword. Also new is InstaRank, which orders your list by article length, date, popularity and other factors. Rounding out the list are a shuffle button for pulling up a random article from your queue, and a built-in browser for previewing links within the app. Check out the link below to nab the download from Google Play.
