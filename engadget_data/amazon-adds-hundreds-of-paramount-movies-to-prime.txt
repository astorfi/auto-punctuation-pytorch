Instant Video is getting 'hundreds' of Paramount's movies, including both relatively recent movies like Nacho Libre and Mission: Impossible III as well as back catalog titles like Breakfast at Tiffany's and Clear and Present Danger. As always, the movies are watchable anywhere you've got broadband, and they don't add a premium to the $79 yearly Prime subscription. Just be prepared to explain why you're watching Urban Cowboy on your Kindle Fire at the airport.
