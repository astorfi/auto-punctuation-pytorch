Since Google bundling text messages into Hangouts, it's had its share of quirks, and the Android app's latest update addresses a few of them. If you were aggravated by the application converting group messages to MMS by default (and the possible upcharge to your mobile bill), then maybe the power to disable the function will fix that. What's more, you can now import existing SMS into the app, and Mountain View has added APN tweaks for those rocking certain unlocked handsets. The update is currently rolling out, but, if you're the impatient type, you can grab it from Android Police right now.
