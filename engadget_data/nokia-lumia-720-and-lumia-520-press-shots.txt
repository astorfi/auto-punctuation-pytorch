 See that group of phones just sitting around, pretending not to have a care in the world? Turns out, this is the new Lumia 720, which is now greeting the world for the first time in a leaked press photo. If you'll recall, this device, along with the Lumia 520 (shown after the break), was recently leaked for arrival within Indonesia. While we've yet to learn of other markets or concrete specs for the pair of smartphones, it just became a bit more likely that we'll see the Lumia 720 and Lumia 520 formally greet the world in just a matter of days. Game on, Nokia.
