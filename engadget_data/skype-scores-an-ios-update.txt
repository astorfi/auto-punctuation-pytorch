 Not every update from the Microsoft-owned VoIP service needs to be high-profile. Every so often a nice subtle tweak is all it takes to add a lovely layer of polish to an already beloved app. Both the iPad and iPhone versions of Skype were bumped to version 4.6 today. There are, of course, a number of bug fixes included in the update. But the most immediately visible change is to the UI for actually placing calls. The new look is a bit cleaner and more modern, though not very different functionally. There's also a new way to mark conversations as read with "just a few taps." Though, if you ask us "a few" is probably still too many. Hit up the iTunes app store now for your update and check out the source for a complete changelog.
