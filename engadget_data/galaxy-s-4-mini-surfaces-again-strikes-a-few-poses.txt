Mum may still be the word at Samsung, but between user agent profiles, leaked details and the word of the Wall Street Journal, the arrival of the Galaxy S 4 mini seems imminent. Still, there's nothing like a leaked gallery of snapshots to stoke the fire, and Weibo user PunkPanda -- who seems to have a track record of spying Samsung devices early -- is happy to provide. A series of new images shows the diminutive Galaxy sizing up to its full sized sibling and a stray cigarette. Rumor has it the handset will debut later this summer with a 4.3-inch display, a dual-core 1.6GHz processor and an 8MP camera. No word on pricing, availability or market just yet, but check out the attached gallery for an early eyeful.
