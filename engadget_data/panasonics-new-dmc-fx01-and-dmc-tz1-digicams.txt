It features a 5 megapixel CCD sensor, optical imagestabilization, a 2.5-inch LCD, SD expansion, and shoots up to 800 ISO in normal mode or 1600 when set tohigh-sensitive. The FX01 meanwhile is a 6 megapixel point-and-shoot with 3.6x optical zoom, 2.5-inch LCD, optical imagestabilization, and like the TZ1 can record 30fps in VGA wide aspect (848 x 480) for (pixelated) playback on wide-screenTeeVees. Both will drop in March for $350. DMC-FX01 pictured after the break.[Thanks, David]
