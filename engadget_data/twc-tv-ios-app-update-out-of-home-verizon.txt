 As we revealed a few days ago and Time Warner Cable announced yesterday, its iOS app has been updated with the ability to stream video even when away from subscriber's home networks. There's video on-demand available from 10 networks, and ten live TV channels ready for streaming. While the company's blog post only referred to access over WiFi, its about page confirms our initial information that 3G / 4G access is limited to Verizon Wireless customers. Our tipster indicted this exclusive would run out later this year, and the feature is also coming soon to the company's Android app and web portal for PC / Mac users. Today's update on iOS also tweaks the app's guide, with a new ability to filter by category, as well as sort alphabetically by network or show title. Subscribers can grab it at the link below -- let us know how well it works and if you've run into any unexpected restrictions.

 Update: Time Warner Cable has also published a few videos to go along with the launch, check after the break to see SVP and GM of programming Mike Angus discuss the latest update.
