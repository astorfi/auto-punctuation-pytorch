 
No shocker here: Sprint officially launched the Treo 700wx today. The specs haven't been a secret for a while, but we'll run 'em down for you anyway:

Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC (duh)
XScale 312MHz CPU
SDIO slot
128MB NVRAM (60MB user)
dual-band EV-DO / 1xRTT
1.3 megapixel camera
Bluetooth 1.2, IR
240 x 240 touchscreen
QWERTY keyboard

Apart from the extra RAM, the 700wx is about the same as its predecessor, the Treo 700w (which Verizon has had exclusively since January). Retail price is $499.99 after "available discounts and promotions," and $649.99 without.TreoCentral has a first look, CNET, Laptop, and MobileTechReview have reviews.
