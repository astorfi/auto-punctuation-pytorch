Not everyone is happy about a new X-ray scanner being installed at London's Heathrow airport which can see through
and reveal them in all their, uh, naked glory. Really excellent for finding stuff like concealed weapons (and it'll
certainly make things more interesting for airport security workers), but it's not just privacy advocates who are
worried about this one. An airport spokesperson was quick to try and assuage concerns, saying that no images will be
stored, it'll be operated by someone of the same sex as the person being scanned, and any x-ray scanner operator who
sees images won't also be able to actually lay eyes on the person being scanned..
