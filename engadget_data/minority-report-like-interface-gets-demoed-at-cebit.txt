As you can see for yourself after the break, the rig lets you do all the usual moving, flipping and resizing, without the need for pesky gloves or silly headgear. Needless to say, there's no indication as to where this particular bit of technology is headed next, but it seems safe to assume that it'll become a fixture of trade shows for years to come.
