Neither, then, did it take a lot of brainpower to take a stab at the carrier, seeing how we've only got one around here with the right kind of bandwidth. Sure enough, a HowardForums member has managed to score a couple shots of an N75 emblazoned with that orange... uh, thing of a logo we all love (or love to hate, as the case may be). Rumor has it the S60 3rd Edition clamshell is on a fast track for release some time in November; as always, we'll remain skeptical until a Cingular-branded N75 rests in our outstretched paws, but it certainly seems things are looking up for Symbian fans on Cingular.[Thanks, Louis]
