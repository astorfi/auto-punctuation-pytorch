 Hallelujah!Sony has done seen the light! According to BusinessWeek, the consumer electronics giant is set to announce a Librie-like E-ink e-book reader for the US that both--are you readyfor this--uses SD cards for data storage and displays native PDF files (along with a proprietary Sony format--babysteps, you know?). It seems that the lackluster success of the Librie overseas, combined with an upcoming wave ofe-book readers as competition, convinced Sony that more openness was key to the success of this device. Industryheavyweights Simon & Schuster, Random House, and HarperCollins are already signed up to provide content, with thelatter two promising to digitize their entire back catalogs for inclusion on Sony's Connect music-and-now-book service, for acombined total of up to 50,000 titles. Sony certainly has an advantage here by being first out of the gate with arelatively large content offering and purported 15-book battery life, but products from iRex, Jinke, and more flexible devices from othermanufacturers may prove more popular if they can provide consumers with similar content but better hardware.[Via MobileRead]
