 Skeptics still abound, but Treo hacker extraordinaire Shadowmite is vouching for the authenticity of those Treo 700p pics that popped up yesterday evening; thisdude's rep alone is enough to have most Treo fanatics convinced that this is the real deal. Anyway, we're still waitingfor a few new choice pics, but in the meantime in some specs are making the rounds, and the new Treo 700p, which willsupposedly be available from Sprint in April, will have a 312MHz processor, Palm OS 5.4.9, EV-DO, 1.3 megapixel digitalcamera, a 320 x 320 pixel display, and Bluetooth (they're not sure whether it's Bluetooth 1.2 or not). The news thatPalm is busting out a new Treo running on the Palm OS has to be good news to all the loyalists who were dreading havingto switch to Windows Mobile to get 3G on a Treo, but, man, Palm is really running Garnet into the ground, aren't they?Let's hope they managed to work out a lot of the stability issues that have plagued the Treo 650 before they releasethis one.[Thanks to everyone who sent this one in]
