 Just when we were feeling superior with our triple monitor setup, the techies at UC Irvine's Calit2 Center of GRAVITY (Graphics, Visualization and Imaging Technology) had to go and show us up with not a four, not a five, but a 50 display Frankenmonitor powered by 25 Power Mac G5s (each loaded with 2GB of RAM) supported by the team's proprietary tiling software. And these aren't any regular old monitors, mind you; they are Apple's top-of-the-line 30-inch Cinema Displays maxed-out at 2560 x 1600 resolution. To save you a trip to the calculator, the HIPerWall (for Highly Interactive Parallelized display) measures 192-inches diagonally and sports a maximum resolution of 25,600 x 8000-so although this enormous setup was designed with medical, meteorological, and military uses in mind, all we can think about is the number of Dashboard widgets we could cram in.
