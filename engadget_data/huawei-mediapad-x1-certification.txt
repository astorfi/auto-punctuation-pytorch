There isn't much choice among 7-inch Android tablets with high-resolution screens -- the Nexus 7 is frequently the only practical option. However, it's about to get a proper challenger. China's TENAA has certified the Huawei MediaPad X1 7.0, a small slate with a 1,920 x 1,200 display. It's not clear that the X1's 1.6GHz quad-core Hisilicon processor will outperform the Snapdragon S4 Pro inside the Nexus, but the device will be a featherweight at just 8.4 ounces and 0.3 inch thick. There's also 3G inside. About the only clear setback is the use of Android 4.2 -- where's KitKat, Huawei? The company hasn't said when it might reveal the new MediaPad, but certification raises the possibility of an announcement in the near future.
