Don't whip out your Wizard or Hermes and try this, folks -- you'll only end up with tears and a broken Pocket PC -- it's a hot new trick HTC's Hermes follow-on has up its sleeves. Besides the wacky flip-up action, the Kaiser ups the camera to a full 3 megapixels (an extra million pixels over its predecessor), adds HSUPA support for crazy fast uploads, GPS, and the now-obligatory Windows Mobile 6 Professional. No word on release, but we know with certainty that HTC wants this thing in users' hands in 2007, so we'd expect it to start showing up on European networks before too long.
