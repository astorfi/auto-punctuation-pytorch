And rounding things out from Nokia today is the N70, a new 3G two megapixel cameraphone which looks a lot like that
6680 handset they announced back in February. The N70 has
a second camera on the front for making video calls (the two megapixel camera is for stills), integrated flash, a
built-in FM tuner, Bluetooth, support for
Visual Radio, and digital
music playback software (though they don't specify which formats are supported). Should be out sometime in Q3 of this
year, with an EDGE-only version due out shortly afterwards (you'd think it'd be the other way around).
