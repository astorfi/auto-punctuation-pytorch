 British Telecom just announced its new Â£1.5 billion fiber fibre-based, broadband plan for the UK. By 2012, BT hopes to have "as many as 10 million homes" (about 40% of the UK) wired for service with speeds up to 100Mbps -- potentially capable of exceeding 1,000Mbps (1Gbps) at some unspecified point in the future. BT plans to deliver 100Mbps direct to new homes or 40Mbps (and possibly 60Mbps as they test new technology) to homes with a copper link to the fiber cabinet. For the plan to be implemented, BT says that a "supportive and enduring regulatory environment" is required with the removal of current barriers to fiber investment identified as a good place to start. In other words, 2012 might easily become 2020 (without the clarity) if an agreement with regulators and rivals can't be reached.[Via Guardian, Thanks L.Rawlins]
