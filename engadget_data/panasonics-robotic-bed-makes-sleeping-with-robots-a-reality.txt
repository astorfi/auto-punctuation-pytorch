Panasonic's Robotic Bed is set to change that by automatically transforming from a static bed to a mobile wheelchair... and back. Once converted, the robotic chair can navigate the home while avoiding obstacles with "no need for training," according to Panasonic. The canopy is fitted with a television and plugs into the home network so you can control home appliances and view security cameras. Obviously, its primary purpose is to give people with limited mobility more independence. However, bloggers can dream can't we? The Robotic Bed will be unveiled for the first time at the Tokyo Big Sight show on September 29th.
