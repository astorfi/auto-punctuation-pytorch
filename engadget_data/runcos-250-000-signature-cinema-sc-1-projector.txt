 We knew Runco was getting ready to unleash a smattering of new projectors, but its Signature Cinema SC-1 packs a spec list (and pricetag) that deserves some special attention. While 1080p projectors are becoming a tad more common, this DLP device outclasses the wannabes by sporting a 3-chip SuperOnyx DMD, 2,048 x 1,080 native resolution, NTSC / PAL compatibility, integrated DHD video processor, up to 25,000 ANSI lumens (depending on lamp choice), 2,800:1 contrast ratio, and the ability to shoot that spiffy high-def imagery onto a 40-foot surface. Runco also offers a (presumably pricey) CinaWide option, which conveniently adjusts 2.35:1 to fill the entire screen, eliminating those pesky black bars from view. The only dig we could find was the ginormous size: at over two feet across, one foot tall, and nearly five feet deep, this 342-pound beast will likely require an AV cabinet of its own. While the SC-1 is overkill (albeit the ultra sweet, drool-worthy kind) at its finest, it's likely to show you HD content in a way you've never envisioned -- but you'll need a quarter million bucks (and a small group of folks to unload it) to take this one home.
