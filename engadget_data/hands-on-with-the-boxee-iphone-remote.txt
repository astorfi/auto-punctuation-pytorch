We spent a few minutes playing with the free app and have to say it's the best 3rd party remote app we've tried. While most remote apps on Apple's app store are examples of how crappy a remote can be, the Boxee app pulls down cover art and adds controls that aren't possible with the Apple TV's remote. But more important than anything else, the Boxee app actually makes it easier to control Boxee then with the remote itself by thinking out of the box and adding gestures into the mix. To us this is very important as touch screen remotes are inherently crippled at navigating on-screen menus unless you actually like to continuously look up and down just to select something. The gestures are implemented well and are a pleasure to use, but just in case you don't like them, you can turn them off and switch to buttons. Overall we really like the app, but the one thing you can't do is actually launch Boxee on the iPhone. This doesn't surprise us, in fact we're not sure it would even be possible, but it would still be nice.
