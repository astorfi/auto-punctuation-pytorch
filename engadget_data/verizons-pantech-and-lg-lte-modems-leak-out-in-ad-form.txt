We've seen the VL600 at the FCC and in the wild before -- it's a dual-mode CMDA / LTE modem that'll work pretty much anywhere Verizon has coverage, while the UML290 has a note about global capability "coming soon," so we'd assume there's a GSM radio tucked in there as well. Both sticks look like they're pretty huge, which isn't uncommon for first-gen hardware like this, but we're hoping that rumored third Novatel stick is LTE-only and a bit slimmer. We'll see, we'll see.
