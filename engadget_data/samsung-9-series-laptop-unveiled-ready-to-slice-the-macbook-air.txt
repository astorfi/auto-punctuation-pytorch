Revealed ahead of Samsung's CES presser, the duralumin machine weighs just 2.89 pounds and measures .68 inches thick -- in comparison, the 13-inch MacBook Air measures 0.11 to 0.68 inches thick and weighs 2.9 pounds. Those specs seem pretty darn comparable to us, but there's no denying this thing is rail thin, so we guess we can let Samsung slide with its lofty marketing claims. Unlike the others that have attempted to craft incredibly thin Windows laptops (see: Adamo XPS), Samsung has managed to cram this thing with power, ports, and features. There's no optical drive, but it has Ethernet, HDMI, and USB sockets and a headphone jack. Perhaps even more impressive is what's Inside -- it's got a brand new Core i5 2537M processor, 128GB SSD, and 4GB of RAM. Not enough for you? Its backlit keyboard, 400 nit LED-backlit display, and two 1.5-watt speakers and a sub-woofer should seal the deal. So, how much for that beauty? Samsung says it should be around $1,600, though it isn't providing a release date right now. We are bursting at the seams to get our hands all over that daring black chassis -- stay tuned for some hands-on impressions.
