Motorola was planning a big shindig for May 13th, where it'll launch its first phone after being sold to Lenovo by Google. Unfortunately, any big surprises that were being kept for the day look to have been spoiled thanks to trigger-happy Brazilian retailer FastShop. The site has posted a full listing for the handset, and if it's genuine, then the Moto E will sit beneath the Moto G as the company's new ultra-budget device. Specs-wise, there's a 4.3-inch display, 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon paired with 1GB RAM, 4GB storage, a 1,980mAh battery and dual-SIM slots. On the expansion front, the microSD slot will only take cards up to 32GB, and there's a 5-megapixel camera poking out of the back. There's no word on price, but given that the Moto G retails for just under $200, we'd expect this to cost no more than a Benjamin-and-a-half.
