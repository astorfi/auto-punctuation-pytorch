We're pretty sure you'd end up with something like this sexy LG P220. We saw this light and thin laptop at the Intel booth at Computex and came away rather impressed. While the materials used (plastics) don't live up to the lofty standards set by Apple's popular notebooks, the innards appear to pack a serious punch. We don't have any specs, but the unit we handled was equipped with an Intel Core i7 processor, and LG's gorgeous super slim bezel-hating Shuriken display. We'll keep you posted with more info as soon as we dig it up -- in the meantime, why not take a look at this hot little number in our gallery and hands-on video after the break?
