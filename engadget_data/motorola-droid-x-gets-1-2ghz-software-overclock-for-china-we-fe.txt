Not for Motorola, who is bringing its 4.3-inch Droid X slab to China with one major tweak: a processor running at 1.2GHz. That's a 20 percent boost over its cycles in domestic form despite having the same TI ticker humming away in there. Now, that's not to say there aren't ways to unofficially overclock your X to 1.2GHz -- and beyond -- but those of us who prefer staying stock are left to wonder why, and to hope for an equivalent update on these shores. Futile hopes, these.
