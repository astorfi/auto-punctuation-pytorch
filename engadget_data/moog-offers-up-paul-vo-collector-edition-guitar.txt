The creator of all types of unusual and wondrous music makers has stepped up with the Paul Vo Collector Edition guitar, a fanciful six-string that does quite a bit more than just light up whatever amp is lucky enough to receive its vibes. Constructed from premium grade mahogany, the instrument affords players full sustain, controlled sustain and mute modes to crank out all sorts of atypical tones, and just in case those few don't get your juices flowin', you'll be happy to know that there's loads more where that came from. Granted, this gem will cost you a stiff $6,495, but considering the amazing amount of utility found here, true musicians are apt to deem it a bargain.
