 We know that many of you (and by you, we mean us) have been looking forward to Toshiba's Gigabeat S PMPs ever since you we saw them way back at CES in January, so we can all start getting a little excited about a print ad from Midwest electronics chain American TV that shows the hot little player on sale for $400 after rebate. The reason we can only get a little excited, however, is because calls to several of the company's retail locations reveal that they don't actually have the S in stock, with one clerk unable to give any arrival estimates, while another claimed that "we're getting a shipment today, maybe." It wouldn't be prudent at this juncture to start tossing out nasty terms like bait and switch, as we're sure American didn't knowingly advertise a product that they don't have in stock, but it's still a little irksome to see an ad for something you can't buy. On the plus side, both salespeople were able to confirm that Toshiba has not in fact gone and gutted this model's capacity to the mere 60MB that American is publicizing.[Via DAPreview]
