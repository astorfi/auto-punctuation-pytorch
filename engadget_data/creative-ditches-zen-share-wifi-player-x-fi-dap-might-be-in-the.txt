The company is blaming "technical complications," which we have a suspicion is shorthand for "building the necessary software to make WiFi helpful in a DAP is harder than we anticipated." That's too bad, but have no fear: Creative is replacing the project with a player due in the next two months that will sport an "exciting" design. We know, you're so excited right now. Rumor has it that the player could be an X-Fi-branded DAP with a metal back and X-Fi audio processing. Creative also confirmed that it's moving exclusively to flash memory.[Via Electronista]
