 
 As ever, Sony's IFA press conference was a veritable storm of products, but CEO Kaz Hirai was clearly the most excited about the company's new 84-inch 4K TV, the Bravia KD-84X9005, and after beholding the thing for a bit alongside a scrum of fellow tech journalists in Sony's booth at IFA, it's pretty clear why. The thing is beautiful -- and yeah, we can confirm, as Kaz suggested, that you really do want to stick out your hand and touch the picture when you're standing in front of it, particularly, when the video cycles through images of the ocean, with water droplets hitting the screen.

 At 84 inches, this thing is a beast, with at least a dozen or so folks standing comfortably around it to catch a glimpse of the display. The Bravia is surprisingly thin for such a beast. There are speaker bars attached to either side of the display, with a control panel along the bottom. The stand consists of two metal bars holding up what's surely a weighty set. Check out our eyes-on video after the break.
