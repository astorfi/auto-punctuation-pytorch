 Ok, so it's not exactly a brand new Micro PC, but an upcoming issue of the UK edition of Stuff reveals that Sony is rolling out a new version of the Vaio UX for the European market. Dubbed the VGN-UX1XN, this new model runs Vista and has a 1.3GHz Intel Core Solo U1500 processor, a 4.5-inch, 1024 x 600 pixel display, 1GB of RAM, a 32GB solid state disk, a Bluetooth 2.0, 802.11g, USB 2.0, Firewire, and CompactFlash and Memory Stick Duo memory card slots. No word on wide-area-networking capabilities, but price is listed as an intimidating Â£2,000.
