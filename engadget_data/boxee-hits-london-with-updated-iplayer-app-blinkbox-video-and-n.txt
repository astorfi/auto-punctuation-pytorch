This continues a trend that has seen the addition of Headweb video on-demand for Scandinavian regions and Databazaar's library of Bollywood flicks in the last week. Boxee had iPlayer before but it stopped working after some technical changes, while the blog post reveals Blinkbox support is expected arrive around the end of the year. Boxee flashed its iPad app at the party too, promising to bring the existing experience to your tablet plus the ability to send video back to a Boxee Box for watching on the big TV screen. Finally, VP of marketing Andrew Kippen mentioned streaming locally stored video to the iPad from new Boxee Media Server software. While adding Plex-style functionality is nice by itself, we're just excited to see any kind of reference to the software for PC and Macs that seems to have been ignored since Boxee got into the Box business.
