       We hate to say that we told you so,but...... The good news is that Warner has set a nice hard release date for their 3 HD-DVD movies. On April18th 2006 we will be able to watch any movie we want as long as we want to watch either Million Dollar Baby, The LastSamurai or The Phantom of the Opera. I don't know about you but I am going to watch the Opera one because I havealready seen the other two a few times. Seriously there are 17 more titles to follow in the followingweeks, including my personal favorite "The Matrix". I am going to hold out on buying a HD-DVD player untilthere are at least 10 titles to rent at Netflix, but that's just me.Are you going to wait or have youalready re-submitted your pre-order? Will Toshiba still release the players on March 28th without the movies?
