If our expectations are to be fulfilled, this hot little number won't only have EV-DO, but will drop with a QVGA display, MicroSD, Bluetooth, and a fat 3.2 megapixel camera. Expect more details as we get 'em, but for now click on to see some more shots of what may well be many a feature phone users' next device.
