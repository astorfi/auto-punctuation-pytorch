 During an analyst event today, JetBlue shared some more details about its upcoming in-flight WiFi product. The service, which will be powered by ViaSat's Exede, has been coined "Fly-Fi," and the airline plans to begin rolling it out to its aircraft "soon." JetBlue hasn't presented a firm timeline, but says "Barring any setbacks during certification, we expect our first Wi-Fi-enabled flight with customers to take to the skies later this year." That's perhaps not as soon as you may have liked, but based on a speed demo (comparing Exede, Gogo, Row 44 and Panasonic's offering), this new and improved solution will be worth the wait. Take a sneak peek in the comparison video after the break.
