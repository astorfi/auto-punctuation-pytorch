The new movies and TV shows mostly reach deep into the back catalog with classics like Dances with Wolves or the definitive spaghetti Western, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. A few more recent titles have crept into the collection, mostly in TV: if you're a fan of the Stargate universe, you're set. MGM video is folded into the $79 yearly Prime subscription and will let you relive Thirtysomething on a raft of devices, including your PS3.
