Starting today, every single U-verse customer can enjoy Animal Planet HD, CNN HD, Discovery HD, Science Channel HD, Starz Kids & Family HD, Superstation WGN in HD, TLC HD, Versus HD and Golf Channel HD. Thanks to these additions, AT&T can now claim that its fiber-based service includes access to over 40 high-definition channels, and adding HD service is still as simple as handing over $10 per month. For those out there with U-verse, how are the new members of the family treating you -- and more importantly, are you satisfied yet?
