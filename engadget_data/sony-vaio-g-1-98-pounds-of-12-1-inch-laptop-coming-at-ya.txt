 
 Oh sweet, sweet VAIO G... welcome. Weighing just 898-grams / 1.98-pounds, and sporting the same hard angles (new trend, Sony?) seen in their top-end projectors, this stealthy laptop features a 12.1-inch, 1024x768 display, a choice Celeron or Core Solo 1.06GHz U1300 or 1.2GHz U1400 processors, integrated Intel 945GMS Express graphics, up to 80GB of disk and 1.5GB memory, 6-hour battery, fingerprint reader, 802.11a/b/g WiFi and Bluetooth, and the usual array of in and outs including USB 2.0, a multi-format memory card and PCMCIA slot. A version sporting a dual-layer DVD burner and 6-cell battery sporting a 12.5-magical-hours capacity is also available but bumps the weight to a still feathery 1,145-grams / 2.52-pounds. And it's all packed into a tough carbon shell measuring 277 × 215 × 23.5~25.5-mm / 10.9 × 8.5 × 0.9~1.0-inches. Available starting December 2 in Japan for ¥215,000 (about $1,836) on up to ¥245,000 (about $2,093) full equipped. Hoozah!
