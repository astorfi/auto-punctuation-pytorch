 I'm hoping we have a few friends from Canada reading this. If you didn't already know, you've got another free high-definition choice via an over-the-air (OTA) antenna! CTV started broadcasting a high-def signal out of both Vancouver and Toronto. This is Vancouver's very first OTA high-def signal, while this is Toronto's third."CT HD West" can be picked up with a digital tuner and antenna out of British Columbia from Mount Seymour (as in: "see-more picture quality"). The CN Tower in Toronto is pumping out "CT HD East". If we have any friends from north o' the border, check in with us when you view your new channel and let us know what you think! There's nothing more exciting than hearing about someone's first experience of HDTV.
