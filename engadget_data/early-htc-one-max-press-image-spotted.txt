To date, our glimpses of the HTC One Max (aka T6) have been limited to a few small photos. Courtesy of @evleaks, we may have a better look: he just posted what's reportedly a "non-final" (if high-quality) press image of the giant smartphone. The shot matches what we've seen before, suggesting that the One Max really is the One writ large. The only major changes are the camera flash position and the more conspicuous side trim. While the image can't reveal what's inside, such as the rumored Snapdragon 800 chip and bigger battery, it does hint that HTC's supersized device could launch relatively soon -- possibly at IFA.
