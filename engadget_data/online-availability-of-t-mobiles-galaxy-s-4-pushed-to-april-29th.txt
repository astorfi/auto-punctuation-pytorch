 Folks hoping to get their mitts on Samsung's Galaxy S 4 have had a long wait, and those angling to snag the device from Magenta's online store will have to wait a tad longer. The Uncarrier sent word tonight that the handset won't be available online on April 24th as originally planned thanks to an unexpected delay with inventory deliveries. Instead, online sales of Samsung's smartphone wunderkind will be pushed back to Monday, April 29th. Of course, folks who want to hitch a Galaxy S 4 to a T-Mobile plan can always waltz into one of the firm's brick-and-mortar shops starting May 1st. Head past the break to take a gander at the carrier's full statement.


  We know customers are really looking forward to getting their new Samsung Galaxy S 4 soon. However, due to an unexpected delay with inventory deliveries, the Galaxy S 4 will not be available on www.T-Mobile.com as planned on Wednesday, April 24. Instead, online availability is expected to begin on Monday, April 29. We apologize for any inconvenience and are working with Samsung to deliver the device to T-Mobile customers as soon as possible.
