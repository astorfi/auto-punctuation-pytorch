Nike is betting that maybe one or two snowboarders like to showboat. So if you're more corkscrew, than chicken salad, the firm's LunarENDOR QS boots -- complete with 30 LED swoosh -- might catch your eye. If not, they'll certainly catch everyone else's as you tear down those nighttime black runs. Back in daylight, you can save power by switching off via the power button on the cuff. That said, we know any self-respecting, gear-loving riders out there will have enough juice to keep their whole techno-shredding set-up going all day. You'll have to wait until mid-December though before you can pull on your regular sneaks and head to a store to get a set.
