We just got an invite to a joint RIM / AT&T event next Tuesday, and we'd guess that means we're about to see the official unveiling of the well-leaked BlackBerry 9800 slider with a side dish of BlackBerry OS 6. Either that, or RIM CEO Mike Lazaridis is going to explain how working two-way Gmail sync is a real problem that affects every smartphone and give us a tour of RIM's top-secret email integration labs, but yeah -- we've got our bets on new hardware. We'll obviously be there live covering every detail, so make sure to tune in!
