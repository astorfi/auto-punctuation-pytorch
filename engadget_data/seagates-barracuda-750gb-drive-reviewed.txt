 No doubt youremember the leaked specs onSeagate's new Baracuda 7200.10 series of perpendiculardrives. Well, Seagate just made it officially, uh, official and PC World has a review for ya just to prove it. Now, wealready knew it would be the biggest 3.5-incher around, but PC World tells us that it might also be the best. In a"first look" of the SATA/300, 16MB cache version, PCW found the new 'cuda to scream across the spectrum oftests ranking it first overall among the bevy of 7200rpm spinners they've tested, bested only be the 10,000rpm RaptorX. Expect the 750GB model they tested to hit the streets for about $590, or $0.79/GB, which isn't really that bad.
