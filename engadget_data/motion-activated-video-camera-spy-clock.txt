Oh, Sharper Image never ceases with its wonders. No need to go all out with a computer-based
home security system when you can snag this
Motion-Activated Video Camera Hidden in a Clock (brought to us courtesy of the Verbose Marketing Department) for the
low, low price of $199.95. Yes, this all-seeing nightstand eye logs 12 minutes of full-motion video at 640 x 480 VGA
resolution on 64MB built-in memory, but is also expandable using everybody's favorite
MMC card standard. Recorded AVI format videos are
transferrable to your PC via USB. The spy clock runs on 4 AA batteries or an included AC adapter. What's the catch? No
audio! You won't be able to record for posterity the amorous screams of whomever's "motion" you capture in that
bedroom.
