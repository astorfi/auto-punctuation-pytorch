Yep, GSM -- US-friendly 850 / 1900, no less -- and WiFi, coexisting in blissful harmony to hook its user up with SIP-based VoIP at home and GSM on the road. It's a crying shame, then, that no amount of technological geekery would allow us to feel comfortable talking on the homely GF210. Hey, T-Mobile, would ya please hurry it up over there?
