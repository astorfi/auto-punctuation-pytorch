 Since writing about this one particularCupertino-based firm always seem to fire up vitriol in the comments, we're gonna go a different route here and try tofly below the Google radar. TiVoLovers has pictures of what is supposedly TiVoToGo running on a non-Windows operatingsystem from the company that also makes a darn nice DAP (hint: it's not BeOS). No word on when this software will beavailable for the few of us who happen to own said fruit-inspired machines.[Via TiVoBlog]
