We've heard companies make lots of claims, but this latest one from ASUS is mighty specific: The company says its new Transformer Book T300 Chi is the "world's thinnest 12.5-inch detachable tablet." Well then! Sounds like a not-so-subtle reference to the Surface Pro 3, if you ask us. In any case, to ASUS' credit, this does look like quite the savory device, with or without the marketing hype. What we have here is a 12.5-inch Windows tablet with an included keyboard dock, with top-of-the-line specs that include a 2,560 x 1,440 display, built-in LTE and "next-generation" Intel Core processors. As for that thin shape, it measures 14.3mm (0.56 inch) with the dock and 7.3mm (0.29 inch) thick for just the tablet. As usual, ASUS isn't talking price or availability just yet, but we'll update this post if we hear more.
