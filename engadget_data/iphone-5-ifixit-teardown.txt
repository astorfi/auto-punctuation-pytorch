 If it's the day that shipments of the latest iPhone arrive around the world, then it is just as surely the day that iFixit's teardown specialists break out their screwdrivers and show you what's inside. This is not the first teardown of the iPhone 5, but it will certainly be among the best and most detailed. Some pleasant surprises inside Apple's latest device are signed indicating it will be much more easily repairable than its predecessor, thanks to a case that opens front to back, a pop-out ear speaker and a display assembly the team says is reminiscent of the iPhone 3GS. Also good news for those suffering through worn-out home buttons is an integrated metal support this time around, which may help extend its lifespan and make replacing it easier when it does expire. Beyond that, a 28nm Qualcomm MDM9615M chip is handling LTE, HSPA+, EV-Do Rev B and TD-SCMA connectivity, while the new metal back casing barely outweighs the back glass from the iPhone 4S.
