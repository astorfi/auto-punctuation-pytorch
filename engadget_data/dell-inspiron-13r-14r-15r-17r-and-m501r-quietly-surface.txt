 It's hard to say at this point if this new spate of Inspiron machines are just region-specific lappies or totally new breeds of a tried-and-true original, but either way, they're alive and well on Dell's own website. So far as we can tell, the Dell Inspiron 13R, 14R, 15R, 17R and M501R are exactly like their non-R contemporaries save for a few choice options: the GPU assortment is far more robust on the new flavors, while there's a larger quantity of choices in the operating system, RAM and wireless departments. There's also word that a Dell Dock feature is built right into these, making it easier to access media for those who aren't exactly technically inclined. To quote Walt Mayo, vice president Dell Consumer Asia: "This is a laptop that moms will love and youths will desire." We can't say we fit that demographic in any way, shape, or form, but we can appreciate the "smudge-resistant palm rests, full-size, ergonomically-designed keyboard and stiffer frame" when compared to the other Inspirons. These seem to be available now over in Australia and New Zealand, which means that order pages could go live at any moment for the rest of planet Earth.
