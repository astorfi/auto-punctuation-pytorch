  Now that Apple has rolled out the MacBook, speculation has turned to the sole remaining PowerPC-based computer in the company's lineup: the Power Mac G5. And, as of today, there seems to be at least one thing that can be confirmed about the new computer: it will be called the Mac Pro. At least that's the assumption that can be made based on a recent Apple trademark filing, in which the company claimed the Mac Pro name for, among other things, "computers, computer hardware, computer software, computer peripherals, notebook computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, computer servers, handheld computers and mobile computers." Which means, of course, that this really doesn't confirm anything, except that Apple likes products with the words "Mac" and "Pro" in them -- which we kind of already knew. And this also raises at least one new question: if the Power Mac becomes the Mac Pro, will the iMac become -- a la MacBook/ MacBook Pro -- just the Mac?Update: Thanks to Jeff for pointing out that there is still one other PowerPC-based computer in Apple's lineup: the Xserve. We'll have to wait a bit to see whether they decide to rename that one.
