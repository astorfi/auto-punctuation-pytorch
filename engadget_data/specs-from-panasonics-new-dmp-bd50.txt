 
Panasonic just introduced their new Blu-ray player, the DMP-BD50. Like we heard at the press conference, BD-Live is getting rolled out across the lineup and this unit has all the other goodies you'd expect in the latest from Panasonic: Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD MA, PIP functionality and the Viera-link functionality for control of multiple components through a single remote. Video processing goes through the Unipher processor, a combination of chroma and deinterlacing developed by Panasonic Hollywood Laboratories. Last but not least, this player gets treated to playback of SD-based media.
