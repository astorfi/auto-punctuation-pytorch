There are always a few treats to be had at Vodafone's IFA booth. This year, the company was showing off the successor to the Smart Tab II -- a device we happened to first glimpse at last year's event. The Lenovo-designed Vodafone Smart Tab III comes in two flavors, a 1280 x 800 10-inch model and a 1024 x 600 seven-inch version. Both devices are running Android 4.2.2, with promised upgrades to Kit Kat when the time comes. The models we saw here in Berlin were also running Bild, a skin that aims to make app discovery easier from within the OS itself, thanks in part to its clustering together titles in categories like Social and Travel -- of course, that all makes things a bit tougher to find the first time you boot things up. We did manage to locate the settings panel eventually, though.


There's a 1.2GHz processor inside of both, along with 1GB of RAM and 16GB of built-in storage, which is expandable via a microSD slot. Both slates also feature front and rear facing cameras, the latter of which clocks in at five megapixels. Both are pretty solidly designed, with fairly slim profiles. The seven-incher has a front-facing speaker grille and the 10-inch version has two on the top of its textured backing. Also, in spite of Lenovo's input, the company hasn't branded either device at all. Instead, there's a single Vodafone logo smack dab in the center of both tablets' backs.
