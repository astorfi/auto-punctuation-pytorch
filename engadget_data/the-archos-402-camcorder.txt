Shouldn't be much news to ya'll by now, but now the Archos
Gmini 402 camercorder is officially official,
up on the site, and ready to snap 1.2 megapixel shots to its 20GB hard drive at your fancy. Like the
vanilla 402 before it, the 402 camcorder dropped the
CompactFlash slot in favor of USB On-The-Go (aka USB host), and plays back MPEG-4, WMV9 with WM DRM 10, and the rest of
the goodness you've come to expect from Engadget's Gadget of
the Year (2004).
