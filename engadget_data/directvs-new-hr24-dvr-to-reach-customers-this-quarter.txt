No prices and specifics just yet, but we do know that this DVR has somewhere between three and eight tuners, and you can connect up to eight H24 clients up via coax (thanks to MoCA) and watch recordings or live TV in up to three other rooms of the house at the same time. The best part is that since there's only one server, no matter what room you're in, you get the same exact experience. We also expect to hear that both Samsung and Sony have built the RVU client directly into their new TVs, and if so, then you wouldn't even need a set-top at the TV to watch the HD DVR.

UPDATE: The above pictured DVR that sports RVU is the HMC30, not the HR24. Which is due this quarter but is much more like the HR21 except with MoCA built in.
