 
Possibly one of the oddest contraptions to be unveiled at CES this year is coming to us courtesy of iriver. The WAVE-HOME multimedia communications device actually pulls double duty as a VoIP phone and a home networking controller (of sorts, anyway), as it provides an expansive 7-inch 800 x 480 resolution touchscreen for web browsing, photo viewing and interacting with all manners of connected widgets. Furthermore, the unit packs a 1.3-megapixel camera, inbuilt speakers, an Ethernet jack, SD slot, USB connectivity, a FM radio module and support for digipen input. So really, you're looking at an unpriced UMPC that's only fit for a desk. Clever, iriver. Full release is after the break.
