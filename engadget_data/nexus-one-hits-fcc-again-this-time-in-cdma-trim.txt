Using the same logic -- mainly label shape and model number -- we can safely say that this latest version to get approval is the dual-band CDMA variant that's almost certainly destined for Verizon within the next few months. There's not terribly much to see in the filing, but hey, take solace in knowing they've cleared this crucial bureaucratic hurdle (of course, Verizon's infamous internal testing is another bureaucratic hurdle altogether).
