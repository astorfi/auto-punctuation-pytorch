The past few weeks have been very busy for the Viber team, after first announcing new features for BlackBerry and following it up with a Windows Phone 8 update. Now the VoIP app is announcing version 4.0 for iPhone and Android, bringing with it the addition of push-to-talk voice services to both platforms, as well as optimization for tablets that are running Google's OS. Viber also bundled in a new sticker market (if that's your sort of thing), along with some extra customization options on iPhone and improvement notifications on Android. All in all, it's a pretty nice update, so go on and grab the fresh version from either the App Store or Google Play.
