And so it begins. With T-Mobile recently closing the deal to acquire MetroPCS, it was only a matter of time before we'd see more commingling. PhoneArena's uncovered yesterday that MetroPCS is about start using T-Mobile's network and GSM handsets. Two phones which are currently available on T-Mobile -- the recently launched Samsung Galaxy Exhibit (a Galaxy S III mini clone) and the LG Optimus L9 -- are making their way to MetroPCS, complete with GSM / EDGE and AWS-capable UMTS / HSPA+ radios (no LTE). Pricing for these devices is still unknown, but the company's expected to begin selling plans on T-Mobile's network as soon a June 12th. In addition, a service called BYOP (Bring Your Own Phone) will allow customers to bring their own GSM handsets to MetroPCS (excluding BlackBerry models). It's unclear if eligible devices have to be unlocked and / or T-Mobile branded but we'll find out soon enough. So there you have it -- the start of a perfect honeymoon.
