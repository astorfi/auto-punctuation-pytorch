We can pretty much bank on the fact that the HTC Thunderbolt is getting outed today and with this pic slapped up by Offwire -- which looks suspiciously like an unbranded version of this Verizon set we saw -- we may well be looking at another of Verizon's suite of new LTE sets. Nothing much is known about this 4G slate, aside from the obvious forward facing camera, but Verizon's press event starts in the next little while and we hope we'll learn more.
