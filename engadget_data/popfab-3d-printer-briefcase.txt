So far, Popfab has been shown doing a little printing during a brief video, but Moyer has promised a lot more to come, telling Core 77, "we also have toolheads working for vinyl cutting, milling and drawing," all of which promise to show up in subsequent episodes. The tool (which has other fans) has apparently already made its way around the world in the form of carry-on luggage, helping fulfill its creators desire to support "the nomadic designer" -- just a briefcase, a power source and a dream.
