And they want to do it through this insanely creepy robot bear, no
less. Revealed at Microsoft's annual gadget showcase yesterday, this "toy" houses four microphones and a camera that
uses face finding technology to help parents monitor their children via the web, and speak with them remotely via a
special phone. All appears normal until mom or dad log on and the bear's head begins swiveling to track the child,
which is the point where we'd hope any sensible kid would run screaming. Dude, haven't these people seen
Chucky?!
