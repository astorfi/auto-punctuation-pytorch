Google's always cooking something up, and the company has our undivided attention when the press gets invited over for a breakfast featuring Sundar Pichai, the man in charge of Chrome and Android. While the invite doesn't indicate anything specific, we're expecting to hear some sort of announcement next Wednesday, when the event takes place. We'd love to get some more details on the elusive Android 4.3 or perhaps a new Nexus 7 (heck, a new Nexus anything would be just fine with us), but we'll just have to wait and see what Sundar has in store.
