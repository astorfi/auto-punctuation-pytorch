When first asked, Samsung said it would take a few weeks, so this is certainly good news. You can either download the update from Samsung.com or use the Ethernet port in the BD-P1200 to download the update directly. In addition to the BD+ issue, the BD-P1200 update also improves the playback in some movies, enhances performance of in-movie games, and fixes some audio noise issues. We'll let you know how it works out.
