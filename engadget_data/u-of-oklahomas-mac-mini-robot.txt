Awwww, this lil' robot with a Mac
mini brain just warms the heart, doesn't it? The University of Oklahoma built this mobile robot to prototype a
visually and aurally tele-operated robot before designing their own from scratch. It's based on the Pioneer 3-AT
robotics platform and is controlled via a USB-to-serial connection, with visual feedback provided via
iSight. We applaud these tentative first steps,
but are holding out for the souped up hot rod Mac mini Monster truck mod. Any takers?
