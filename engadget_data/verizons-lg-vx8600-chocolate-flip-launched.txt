Still sportin' the specs leaked back in September, the VX8600 will cost you $129.99 on a two year contract after the on-line discount -- the rumored $249.99 full-retail / $229.99 one-year options don't appear on the site, yet. That buys you into a fashionable, V Cast musicphone with microSD expansion, A2DP stereo audio over Bluetooth, 1.3 megapixel shooter, and what's this... an enabled speakerphone -- gasp. [Thanks, John and everyone else who sent this in]
