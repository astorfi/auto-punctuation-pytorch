  Beethoven's Fifth or Michelangelo's Piet√† it's not but, while Master Moves Mickey can't stand as a cornerstone of civilization, it can certainly throw down on the dance floor. The b-boy bot has a speaker hidden under its garb that kicks out the jams while this mechanical mouse break dances its little Disney trademarked heart out. He's got 15 different signature moves, carefully choreographed to eight different built-in tunes and loads of personality thanks to a collection of self-depreciating one-liners ready in case he loses his balance. And all this legendary performer needs to keep earning his urban cred is a six AA batteries, oh, and your money -- $70 of it to be specific. Master Moves Mickey should be hitting shelves in August. Check out the video after the break.Edgar Alvarez contributed to this report.
