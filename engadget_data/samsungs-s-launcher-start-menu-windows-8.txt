Well, it turns out that while those desktops will be running Windows 8, Mashable discovered that they've got a little something extra added to Microsoft's stock OS: a Start Menu. Called the S Launcher, it's a widget that replaces that tried and true Start button the folks in Redmond saw fit to eliminate in Win8. As you might expect, it grants access to settings, files and programs in one convenient window, and making additions to the widget is a drag-and-drop affair. So, all you folks having fits about the Start button's disappearance, fear not, Samsung's got the software to soothe your troubled mind.
