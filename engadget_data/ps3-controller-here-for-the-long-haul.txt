Alright
Sony, we've really given you the benefit of
the doubt on this one. We weren't so hot on the boomerang controller when we
first saw it back in May, but you were all like: "Hey,
it's cool guys, that's just a conceptual design." But now you're saying that we're looking at the near final
banana controller? At least that's the word we're getting from Famitsu, a Japanese gaming magazine, saying a
Sony executive has denied the rumors of a PS3 controller redesign being unveiled at the CES, and that if any changes
are made they will be minor adjustments. We knew of the
patent troubles with the Dual Shock, but did Immersion
put a blanket patent on decent controller design?
