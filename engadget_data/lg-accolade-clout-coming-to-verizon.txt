Yes, granted, they seem to be better at catering to the specific "needs" of Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile more than any other manufacturer -- and for many customers, it's hard to argue with a decent-looking phone that costs a few bucks on contract -- but you'd think they'd be able to keep these handsets in the lineup for literally years on end without a single change. Alas, PhoneArena seems to have the inside line on a couple new ones for Big Red that do little to move the low-end needle, including this VX5600 Accolade (pictured) whose headline features are a 1.3 megapixel cam and Bluetooth support. There's apparently a second flip in the pipeline called the "Clout" that should be fixing to replace the year-old VX8360, so yeah, nothing that's going knock your socks off in this batch of rumors. Hey, they can't all be Snapdragon-powered beasts with WVGA displays, right?
