Whereas Netflix has expanded quickly onto numerous mobile platforms in the UK, Amazon can't claim the same for its own streaming service, Lovefilm. Aside from the obvious Kindle support, Lovefilm's iOS app has been iPad-only for two years, with iPhone and iPod Touch owners only being included from today. On the plus side, the app brings AirPlay and IMdB integration, and Lovefilm has been working hard to rack up more content in the UK -- having historically been regarded as stronger than Netflix in terms of its movie library. Meanwhile, there's still nary a peep of a Lovefilm Android app -- something even the most recent streaming contender, Wuaki.tv, has managed to deliver.
