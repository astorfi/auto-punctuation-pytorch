While it has a decent layout of controls, including your usual Xbox A, B, X, Y, and guide buttons, but the most notable buttons for us are the ones that are missing. As The Digital Lifestyle points out, it has no Windows Media Center buttons, unlike the previous Xbox 360 remotes. Does this mean its place as a Media Center Extender is suddenly unnecessary? We're not sure of that yet, it could just be a value choice made for the $20 remote that's due to ship in November, but with a press release playing up its ability to control Live TV it's certainly worth wondering what Microsoft is planning for the future.
