The new model -- a successor to the DSC-H9 "super zoom" camera -- sports a Carl Zeiss 15x optical zoom lens, a 3-inch tilting LCD display, ISO to 3200, and a long-distance flash (capable of lighting subjects from 55 feet away). The DSC-H50 also has an "advanced sports" shooting mode which allows it to utilize ultra-high shutter speeds (like 1/4000 of a second). The camera is expected to go on sale in May, and will only slightly break the bank at $400.
