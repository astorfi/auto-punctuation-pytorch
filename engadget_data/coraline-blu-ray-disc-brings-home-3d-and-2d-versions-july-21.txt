 Waiting for the next big 3D release to come home? Universal has slotted Coraline for July 21, with a 3D and 2D version included in the 2 disc set, along with four pairs of 3D glasses. Extra features like U-control and Digital Copy are 2D only, but with 5.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack and D-BOX Motion Code included, it's hard to see anything this release is missing. Of course, it could be proper stereoscopic 3D instead of anaglyph, but until those 3D HDTVs gain wider adoption, we guess this will have to do.
