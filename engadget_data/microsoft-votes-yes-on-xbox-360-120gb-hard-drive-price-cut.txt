According to a Redmond rep: "We reduced the price of the Xbox 360 120 GB Hard Drive to $149 in conjunction with the recent Xbox 360 console price drop. We believe this offers consumers even greater value when selecting accessories that meet their individual gaming and entertainment needs." Hey, no need to explain -- we like things to be cheaper.[Via Joystiq]
