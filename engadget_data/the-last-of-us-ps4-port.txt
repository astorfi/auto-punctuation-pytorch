Talking on CNN Turk's Multiplayer gaming show, a PlayStation exec claimed the port will have better graphics than the PS3 version, and will be available both digitally and physically. PS4 copies will apparently include the Left Behind single-player DLC, so newcomers get the whole story upfront, and diehards get to replay a prettier rendition. Additional single and multiplayer content is in the works, too, but even a straight port should keep most superfans happy while they wait for the movie.


Update (4/9): Sony has officially confirmed that yes, The Last of Us Remastered is coming PS4 this summer. All of the details above still apply, with the only new information a few details on the pre-order bonuses and a pic of the box art.
