While all shuttle launches are certainly worth watching, this one's particularly notable for a number of reasons -- it's the last mission for Discovery and the third-to-last mission for the entire Space Shuttle program, and it's the first mission to carry a humanoid robot into space: our friend Robonaut 2. Head on past the break to watch Spaceflight Now's live coverage of the launch.
