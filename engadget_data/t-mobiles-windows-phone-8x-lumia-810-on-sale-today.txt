 After what's seemed like an interminable wait, Microsoft's freshly baked Windows Phone 8 devices are finally beginning to flood the US market. And if you happen to be a subscriber on lady Magenta, well then, mark today as the day you can claim the 8X or Lumia 810 as your own -- the latter being a network exclusive. While you won't have your pick from amongst the vibrant color options we've seen so heavily promoted, you will get to choose between HTC's signature device (in California Blue) packing 16GB of storage for $199 or Nokia's all-black low-ender for $149, both available on a two-year contract with a $50 mail-in rebate. Not sure whether or not you should make the leap to WP8? Then be sure to check out our full review of Redmond's mobile OS -- it might help force your hand.
