 
What you're looking at is the latest status update to the Xbox MySpace page showing a November release for Microsoft Natal Kinect. You know, just in case you were looking for something to purchase in the run up to the holidays. How much is the big question now.

Update: John was kind enough to ping us and let us know about this mention of a November release date on a UK Microsoft press page, which we also have a picture of below. This would seem to imply it'll also be hitting Europe before the end of the year, but we'll find out when the timer on that page hits zero and Microsoft's second big event of the show kicks off. We'll be there.
