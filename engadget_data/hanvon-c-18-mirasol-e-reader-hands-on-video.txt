Manufactured by Hanvon, this device is officially labeled as an e-reader, though to be honest, it felt more like a tablet to us. Unlike the lightweight Kindle, the C-18 felt a tad heavy in our hands, with backlighting more typical of a slate than reader. It also runs its own Android skin, which raises some interesting questions of how many Android apps it would support. The color Mirasol display certainly piqued our interests, though we'll have to wait a little bit longer before we get a closer look at it, as the C-18 won't hit the Chinese market until February, with no set date for a US launch yet (price remains equally opaque). For more details, check out our gallery below, along with the hands-on video, after the break.
