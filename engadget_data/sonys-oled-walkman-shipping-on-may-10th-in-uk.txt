That said, the e-tailer has seen fit to post up an actual date rather than a vague window of time, so maybe it knows a bit more than Joe Six Pack this go 'round. At any rate, you can now pencil in May 10th over in the UK, with the NWZX1060B (32GB X-Series) priced at Â£283 ($395). Don't bet the farm on it or anything, but who knows what magic could happen if we all cross our fingers in unison.[Via SonyInsider]
