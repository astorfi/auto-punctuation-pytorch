So on top of that Full-HD, 1920x1200 WUXGA resolution, this display also promises both professional color reproduction and control with a decent pixel response time to boot -- "decent" under these terms is measured at 15-ms (7.5-ms intermediate color). The panel features a 750:1 (1500:1 with contrast ratio optimizer) contrast ratio, 178-degree viewing angle, and support for 16.7 million colors. Still, this monitor is just as likely to end up with the well-heeled consumer by hosting 2x HDCP-compliant DVI inputs, a D-Sub 15 if you must, and a 4-port USB 2.0 hub integrated into the chassis. Expected to hit Japan for Â¥158,000 (about $1,341) starting November 24th. Not bad pricing, considering.[Via Impress]
