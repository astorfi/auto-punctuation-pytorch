Both Android and Windows Phone 7 have reportedly crossed a couple of round number milestones recently, giving us a decent idea of the maturity gap between the two. Microsoft's brand new OS with an old OS' name has rounded the 5,000 available apps corner -- that's according to two sources keeping track of what's on offer in the Marketplace -- while AndroLib's latest data indicates Android's crossed the 200,000 threshold when it comes to apps and games taken together. We're cautious on taking either of these numbers as hard truth, particularly since AndroLib was reporting 100,000 Android apps when there were only 70,000 -- but they do provide rough estimates as to where each platform is in terms of quantity, if not quality. Now, where do you think each will be this time in 2011?
