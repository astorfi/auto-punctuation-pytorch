 We’ve been hearing the er, noise about whining MacBook Pros for awhile. Now however, the problem seems tobe widespread enough to warrant our, and possibly Apple’s, attention. As sister site TUAW points out, thehigh-pitched hissing/whining/squealing seems to be associated with an idle processor and does not affect all newMacBook Pros. However it affects enough to have sparked feverish discussion in your choice of Apple-related forums. Andas these things go, several “fixes” have been suggested including keeping the Photobooth app running in thebackground to keep the processors busy, installing/uninstalling certain widgets, and disabling the second coreprocessor altogether. Of course, many are simply holding out hope that a future firmware drops to sort it out all lickety-split quick. But that would require Apple to first own-up to an issue, which they haveyet to do (publicly) thus far.
