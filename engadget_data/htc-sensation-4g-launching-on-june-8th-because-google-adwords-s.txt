If you look up said phone on Google, you should see a cheeky Adwords ad mentioning a "6/8" date in the link. But wait, there's more: TmoNews also spotted the same date stamped on the Sensation 4G product shot from last week, which we've embedded after the break for your convenience. Of course, anything could change between now and June, but this preliminary date is certainly a good sign for all HTC Gingerbread anticipators -- or, you know, you could just get the leaked ROM right now.
