Well, it seems like India's OnePlus One users don't have anything to worry about after all. To clear up any misconceptions about the device and CyanogenMod's future in the region, the OS developer took to its blog. Cyanogen's Android ROM will continue to get firmware updates, world-wide, despite the outfit's exclusive partnership with Indian hardware-maker Micromax. As Android Central spotted, the post is pretty explicit about it too, saying:



"To clarify misinformation out there, the OnePlus One will get OTA firmware updates for all global devices, including global devices for our users in India."



So that's settled. Now, if only it were any easier to actually buy a One in the first place...
