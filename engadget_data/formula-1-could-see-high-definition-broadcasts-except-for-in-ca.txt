Last week, he apparently told German media that he's "not sure" whether the series will be in HD next year, citing problems fitting HD cameras on the cars. That other series like IRL have no problem squeezing the cams in has apparently gone unnoticed. At this point, we don't expect anything better than the current widescreen feed until well into the era of Super Hi-Vision, but just in case things change, we'll keep you posted
