It's nice to know someone's looking out to protect us against all those latex-mold equipped identity-forging
criminals looking to gain access into the top secret vaults of our finger-scanning
biometric USB drives.
Fujitsu's demoing a new infrared palm scanner
called the Contactless Palm Vein Authentication System (CPVAS, eh?), which instead of scanning fingerprints, scans vein
structures in the user's hand without actually making contact with the hand. Apparently they've already perfected it to
within a 0.5% false acceptance rateâ€”certainly pretty decent for a prototype. As always, just make sure not to get your
hand chopped off by corporate spies, okay?
