Remember, we're talking about a DSLR-sized sensor stuffed inside that retro compact body. Judging by the pics of E-P1, we're looking at a stock, 17mm lens with an interchangeable 14-42mm (3x) zoom lens available at launch. One more day and we'll have prices, ship dates, and full spec-sheet to share -- can you wait? 3x lens and few more color variations in the gallery below.Update: Possible specs accompanying authentic looking images have now entered the rumor mill. Said specs have the camera measuring in at 120 x 70 x 35mm (about the size of a Sigma DP2 or slightly larger than mainstream point-and-shoots) snapping 13 megapixel RAW images and 1280 x 720 pixel video to SD card, ISO 6400 sensitivity, 11-point AF, electronic anti-shake, and 3-inch LCD if we're reading the machine translated text correctly. It's expected to ship in July with prices starting at about $900 -- though it's unclear what you get at that price point.
