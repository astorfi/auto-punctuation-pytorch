The logic behind the WiFi feature is that it enables direct access to Microsoft's Sky Drive, E-Mail, PC Auto Backup, remote viewfinding and of course Facebook, Youtube, and Picasa right from your phone. The top of the line $379 WB850F -- the F designation indicates it has WiFi -- has a 16 megapixel BSI CMOS sensor, 21x optical zoom, 3-inch AMOLED display, shoots 1080p HD, and even has GPS with POI. The 16 megapixel $199 DV300F was also on hand with a 5x optical zoom, a 3-inch display and shoots 720p video. Samsung's 14 megapixel $229 WB15F also sports a 3-inch AMOLED screen, and shoots in full HD with up to 18x optical zoom. The tied-for-least-expensive $199 ST200F still puts in a showing with a 16 megapixel shooter, 10x optical zoom while still capturing HD video at 720p. Samsung launched one HD camcorder, the $299 Q20 which packs 20x optical zoom, time lapse, and HD recording at 1080i @ 60fps. All of the cameras have a similar heft and are built with similar materials which should help narrow people's purchase decisions to looking at what features they want and what's affordable. On to the gallery!
