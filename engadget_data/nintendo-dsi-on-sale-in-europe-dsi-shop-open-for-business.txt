As for everyone across the pond, we'll have to wait until Sunday for the official North America debut, but if you somehow managed to procure one early (hello there!), you can check out the DSi Shop, which has officially flung open its doors for eager buyers. Check out video of Josh spending some quality time with the DSi Shop after the break.
