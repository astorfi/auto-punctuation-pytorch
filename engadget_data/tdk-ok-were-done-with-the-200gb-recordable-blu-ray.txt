 That was fast. It took 'em years to develop recordable DVDs, then another couple more for the dual layer variety,but now but a few weeks after TDK announced their hard workin' intentions to develop 8-layer200GB recordable Blu-ray discs, they've got it bagged. Balls to the fact that we still don't have the players; theinteresting thing about these discs, however, is that the data isn't stored on thin layers of dye, no no. Apparentlywhen each layer of bismuth peroxide and germanium oxide is heated to 690K by laser, microscopic air bubbles form andcreate the bits we've come to know and obsess over. Oh sure, these discs are probably going to be horrendouslyexpensive in the beginning, but isn't it nice to know we're already good to go on capacities large enough to archiveyears of home movies?
