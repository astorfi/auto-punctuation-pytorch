The next time you get a specific urge to play a certain type of real-time strategy game, with a sci-fi theme, base-building and large quantities of blood for the blood god, Steam will have you covered. Instead of just browsing its catalog by genre, the Steam client now lets all users add their own tags to product pages -- tags which then become searchable by everyone else. The community seems to be embracing the feature quite quickly, with plenty of eclectic labels already visible (someone has already tagged CoD: Ghosts with the word "garbage," for example). As a result, the store should steadily become easier and more fun to navigate, especially with added features like automatic, tag-based game recommendations. Spess Mahreens, for the Emprah!
