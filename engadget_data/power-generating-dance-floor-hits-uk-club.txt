As you can see above, the dance floor makes use of a piezoelectric system that produces electricity as the dancers jump up and down, which charges some batteries that are used to power parts of the club. While that's certainly a practical application for the technology, we're guessing it's only a matter of time before some enterprising club owner combines one of these with an  LED dance floor to create a dance floor that powers itself, and thumbs its nose at other do-gooder clubs.Read - Dancefloor generates electricity at London's first eco-disco!Read - London Eco-Club to Get Its Power From Dancers on the Dancefloor
