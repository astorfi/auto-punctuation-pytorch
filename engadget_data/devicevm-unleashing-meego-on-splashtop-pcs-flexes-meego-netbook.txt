Chances are, sometime next year, you'll be getting a MeeGo app-capable upgrade. Splashtop manufacturer DeviceVM has just promised a MeeGo-based version of Splashtop to all current OEM partners for distribution in the first half of next year, and you should be able to simply upgrade the instant-on client in your existing PC. We spoke to DeviceVM in person at IDF 2010, and were told it's not quite as easy as it sounds -- for one thing, the Splashtop MeeGo Remix, as it's called, is still in the early stages, and it's going to be up to the ASUS, Acers and Dells of the world to actually roll it out. HP's committed to delivering an free, transitional version of Splashtop for its machines that will allow end-users to easily upgrade, however. What you're looking at above on this Lenovo S10-3t is the first step in the process -- MeeGo with Splashtop branding and some simple touchscreen drivers. To make up for the relative boredom, DeviceVM showed off something else moderately neat -- a port of its Splashtop Remote app to MeeGo that allows a tiny HP Mini to seamlessly remote into a Windows PC. Imagine the potential for covert fun with our video after the break!
