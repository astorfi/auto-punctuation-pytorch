 Seeing how iPhone rumors news has been a bit thin as of late, we present you with the latest chatter from the never-ending "Who Gets the iPhoneÂ®" drama. The Guardian is reporting that Apple is sitting down at the table with Europe's largest mobile carrier, Vodafone, as the big red giant vies for exclusive rights to this much sought-after device. The story now sees Apple -- and we are sure will this will delight Xmas shoppers everywhere -- getting the iPhone on shelves in Europe by year's end. Though make no mistake, nothing is final, and we would bet dollars to donuts that every other large provider in Europe is clamoring for a seat at the very same table.
