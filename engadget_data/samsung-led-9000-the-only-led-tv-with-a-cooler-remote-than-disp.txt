Packing a touchscreen LCD display and built-in Wifi, you can control streaming media, watch TV directly on the remote while something else is being watched on the TV, and, you know, change channels. After installing the included software to your Windows PC (sorry, no ETA on Mac support), you can also stream video, audio, and photos to the LED display that accompanies it. Needless to say we were really into this control scheme, and we're hoping the tech makes it way to some of Samsung's lower end offerings before too long.
