We learned a lot about Google Glass yesterday at SXSW, including a sample of the kinds of apps it will be running when it becomes available to the public. Today on Google+, the Project Glass team let out a bit of rather important hardware info: namely that Glass is compatible with prescription glasses. Turns out that its "design is modular, so you will be able to add frames and lenses that match your prescription," though the team is still working on the frame design to get it juuust right. The prescription compatibility won't be ready for the Explorer edition of Glass, but we can expect the frames to officially debut "later this year."
