 We're not exactly sure what's going on overseas, but the HD bug has certainly bit. Hot on the heels of Russia, Norway and the UK seeing their fair share of high-def expansion comes word that Swisscom is getting set to launch four new HD options on its Bluewin TV lineup. The IPTV service should be home to "BBC HD (English), Anixe HD (German), Arte HD (French) and the new channel HD suise from the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation" by the end of this month. Also of note, the latter station will be airing the UEFA EURO 2008 tournament in glorious high-definition, which is probably reason enough to look forward to the upgrade.
