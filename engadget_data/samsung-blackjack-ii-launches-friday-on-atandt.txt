The Windows Mobile 6 Standard device -- successor to AT&T's pretty darned popular BlackJack -- features integrated GPS, a 2 megapixel camera, HSDPA, support for Video Share, and stereo Bluetooth and will be available both in the original's black (albeit a bit glossier) and in "red wine." Black launches first, with red wine following on December 6 for $149.99 on contract after rebates.Update: Sounds like some AT&T stores are already hawking this thing ahead of schedule. Go pick 'er up now, or hold your peace until Friday![Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
