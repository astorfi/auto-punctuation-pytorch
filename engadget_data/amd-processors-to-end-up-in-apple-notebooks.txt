Considering AMD merged with ATi, there's a good chance that your PowerMac has a dash of AMD sitting in the PCI-e slot, but Taiwan-based passive component makers are suggesting that Apple's laptops may be AMD-powered before too long. While the MacBook Pro (and subsequently, the MacBook) took forever and a day to get suited with a Core 2 Duo, it's a far off possibility that the next revision may see the idolized laptops rocking yet another kind of CPU. Component makers are "witnessing an aggressive increase in orders for high-capacitance multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs)," with most of the units being reserved "for use in an AMD-based Apple notebook." Notably, AMD Taiwan declined to comment on the matter (a bit of Steve rubbing off?), and until we hear the final word from Cupertino, we're taking this one with a dash bucket of salt.[Thanks, Brett]
