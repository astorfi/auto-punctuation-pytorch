That Nokia tablet we've been hearing so much about? Just a couple weeks before its likely appearance in Abu Dhabi at Nokia World, we're now starting to see what it actually looks like outside of blurrycam leaks and tiny FCC diagrams. Tipster @evleaks just posted the above render of the Nokia Lumia 2520 in all its cyan glory. It's quite possible this will just be the first of many leaks -- hopefully accompanied by some solid specs to boot -- but only time will tell.


Update (10/12): Not so into blue? Maybe you'll like the photo of it in a fiery red that @evleaks posted today. You can check it out after the break.
