Besides the usual features you'd expect from one of the premiere manufacturers of pro audio equipment -- straight tone arm, two start/stop switches, S/PDIF out -- the T.90 USB also delivers USB connectivity (obviously) along with extras like "Key Lock", which allows you to adjust the tempo without affecting pitch. So far price and release remain a mystery -- Stanton's PR figures all we care about are the specs -- but plan on paying a few hundred bucks for gear of this caliber whenever it does hit shelves and etailers.
