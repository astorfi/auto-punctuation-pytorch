 With the obsessive push to make things smaller and smaller, Kingston is cramming 1GB of storage in its latest microSD card. Trailing behind SanDisk -- which has already released its own ultra-spacious microSD cards in 1GB and 2GB flavors -- Kingston is just now making the jump to a gig. Just in case you haven't forked out for that svelte Chocolate phone yet, the minuscule card comes bundled with a full sized SD adapter for use in "older" digicams and media readers. If you've been avoiding the SanDisk offerings (and their steep pricetags), you'll probably be delighted to find that Kingston's 1GB version is not only available now, but will only set you back $55.
