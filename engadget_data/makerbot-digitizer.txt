MakerBot tipped off some of its loyal fans last week by way of newsletter, but now the Digitzer's arrival is officially officially. The next piece of the Brooklyn company's ever-expanding 3D printing ecosystem has been revealed piece by piece since debuting back at SXSW, and now it's finally ready to make its way to maker hands. Well, in a few months, at least. Pre-orders for the spinning 3D scanner are open now -- plunk down $1,400 (plus $150 for the MakerCare support program, if you're so inclined), and one of these bad boys can be yours in mid-October. The device captures 3D images from objects up to eight-inches tall with help from two lasers and a camera, a system the company has, naturally, optimized for its own Replicator printers and Thingiverse 3D object catalog. There's a press release below for those seeking more info.
