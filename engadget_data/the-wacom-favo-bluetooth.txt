Wacom (or at least, Wacom Japan) is busting out a new Bluetooth version of their Favo writing tablet. The Wacom Favo
Bluetooth is more or less the same as their regular Wacom Favo, apart from not having a cord running out of it, and has
a range of about 10 meters. Sells for Â¥19,824 ($186) in Japan, no word yet on a possible US release.
