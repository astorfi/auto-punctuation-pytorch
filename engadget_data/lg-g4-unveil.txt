LG is scheduled to drop something big on April 28th. And if the "G's" in the save the date invites (above) it sent out to the press is any indication, we can most likely expect its next G-series flagship phone. Besides, several Korean publications already revealed that LG will launch the G4 by the end of April. Some of those publications also claimed that the phone will have a 5-inch curved Quad HD display, but there's probably no use speculating if that's true or not when we're this near to seeing the real thing. The South Korean company will hold an event in New York and other locations around the globe (New York, London, Seoul, Singapore and Istanbul), and we'll be there to cover it, so stay tuned!
