If you never gotten a piece of SMS
spam you should consider yourself lucky: a new survey conducted by Intrado, Switzerland's University of St. Gallen,
and the International Telecommunicaton Union found that over 80% of all European cellphone users reported receiving at
least one SMS spam last year (in the US it's estimated to be below 10%). SMS spam is already a huge problem in places
like South Korea and to make matters worse, spam is way
more annoying to receive on your cellphone that it is on your PC. Even if you're not paying per message you receive,
it's not like most users have the option of installing SMS spam filtering software on their phones to automatically
catch and delete any unwanted messages.
