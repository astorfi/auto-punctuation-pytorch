As predicted after that serious stutter in November sales, HTC's unaudited revenue for Q4 2011 shows a 2.49 percent fall on the same quarter in 2010. Unaudited operating income was just shy of 13 billion Taiwanese dollars (about $430 million), which represents a 22 percent decline on the year before. Prior to this, the company had seen nothing but upward movement after springing out of nowhere a few years ago and delivering us some rather nice handsets, but it looks like competition in the Android sphere (read: Samsung) is starting to make life harder for the Taiwanese manufacturer -- although none of its recent statements betray much in the way of self-reflection.
