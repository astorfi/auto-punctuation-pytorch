In addition to that multicolor backlit keyboard, both models pack a 17.3-inch 1920 x 1080 display, a Core i7 2630QM processor, a pair of USB 3.0 ports (plus three USB 2.0), 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. So what's the difference between the two? The big one is GeForce GTX 560M graphics with 1.5GB of GDDR5 RAM on the GT780R, compared to a GT555M with 1GB DDR5 of VRAM on the GX780. Head on past the break for the complete press release, and hit up either Amazon or Newegg if you're ready to place an order (both seem to have knocked $100 of MSI's price). Oh, and if you're interesting in seeing what this GPU can muster, tap that More Coverage link for a review of an all-too-similar sibling.
