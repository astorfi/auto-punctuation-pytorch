 We've already seen Mediacom and Comcast fess up to forthcoming price hikes, and now we've got Charter Communications pulling some of the same tricks. Recently, the cable carrier announced that (at least in some locales) it will be pushing the price of Expanded Basic up by $2 per month while lowering the HD Ultra View tier by $3 per month. Granted, "many" HD channels are being moved from the latter into the former, but there are the facts. On a positive note, the basic cable package, high-speed internet and digital phones prices are all staying put, so yeah, it could definitely be worse.
