The iOS crowd has been able to enjoy Verizon's FiOS Mobile service for some time now, but now it's the Android faithful's turn to finally experience what they've been missing. The application, which is said to be compatible with "many of your favorite Android enabled devices," gives FiOS subscribers the ability to live stream (some) channels and have access to on-demand video content right from their smartphone or tablet. Not surprisingly, a TV subscription is a must, meaning that folks who are on an internet-only plan won't be able to enjoy what the app has to offer. Verizon FiOS Mobile is now up for grabs via Google Play, so hit that source link below and let us know in the comments if it was worth the wait.
