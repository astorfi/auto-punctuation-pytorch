Amazon shows a pair of 55-inch UN55C7000 TVs with 3D 240Hz motion technology in stock with a $3,299.99 price tag and free delivery. Yeah, that's a day earlier than expected but we doubt anyone's complaining. Remember, you'll still have to drop another $150 or so on the shutter glasses if you ever plan to flip the switch from 2D to 3D mode; something you might want to do when actual 3D content starts to arrive.

Update: Looks like Sears is shipping now as well, including the 46-inch UN46C7000 little brother for $2,600.
