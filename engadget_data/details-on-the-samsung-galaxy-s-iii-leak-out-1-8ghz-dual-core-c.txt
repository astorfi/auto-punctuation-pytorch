  We're still awaiting the release of the Samsung Galaxy S II on T-Mobile this week, and yet it's already starting to look like yesterday's half-eaten breakfast. That's because some fuzzy details are now leaking out about its inevitable successor, the mystical Galaxy S III. The leaked presentation slide above, uncovered by Phandroid, shows a phone that's packing a 1.8GHz dual-core Exynos 4212 CPU with 2GB of RAM and a 12 megapixel rear-facing camera. Oh, and a 4.6-inch Super AMOLED Plus HD display isn't too shabby either. If this ends up being true, we're a bit puzzled by the inclusion of four buttons on the bottom -- a departure from the first two Galaxy S devices -- and why the slide refers to the original Galaxy S as running on an Exynos processor, rather than Hummingbird. Color us a shade of skeptic since we're still a few months out from CES and MWC, but it's never too early to start getting excited over an upcoming device, right?Update: One other piece of evidence that leads us to believe this is fake is the fact that the term "Super AMOLED Plus HD" is used; if this were real, Samsung would likely use its proper terminology, which is HD Super AMOLED.
