       Sure we're impressed (or not-so impressed) by Samsung's LED-backlit DLP rear projection televisions, but another advance in the technology is the new Slim DLPs. The idea is to create DLP HDTVs small enough for wall mounting solutions, and Samsung's first television based on the technology is on display at CEDIA 2006. The 46-inch 720p HDTV is a mere 10.6-inches deep, and weighs only 46 pounds. They expect to bring the set to retail by the end of this year for $1,799.Follow the link for a front shot of yet another HDTV.
