Microsoft is having its big Gamescom 2013 shindig at Cologne, and just announced some new Xbox One game titles. Fable Legends, which our sister site Joystiq espied earlier, will arrive exclusively to the new console, along with Fighter Within. The latter title (also previously rumored) takes advantage of the new Kinect sensor to allow total body "kicks, punches, throws" and more. Both are set to arrive for the holidays, likely around or just after the Xbox One itself launches (that date is still uncertain). Meanwhile, check the video trailer for Fable Legends or info about other games after the break.


Update: Although many expected one, Microsoft did not give a precise date for the Xbox One retail launch at its event. Shucks!
