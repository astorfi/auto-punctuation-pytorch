The only real standout was the new 7200 (pictured), which has a flat, glossy front, and is a joy to touch -- we're not positive it's capacitive, but it feels a ton better than the regular dull resistive touch of most GPS units out on the market. We also took a look at the 2200 and 2150 Max, as you can see in the gallery below. Knock yourself out.
