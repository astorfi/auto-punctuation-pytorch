It's the first time in almost ten years that something besides drinking has reigned atop the survey, but we have to admit though, drinking has the odds stacked against it. We'll see what happens to the Apple's sweet spread when we lobby the government to raise the minimum buying age for iPods to 21, now won't we?[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
