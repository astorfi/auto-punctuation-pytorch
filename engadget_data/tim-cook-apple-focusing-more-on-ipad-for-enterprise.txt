 
 Pretty chipper news all over for Apple shareholders during today's earnings call. Head honcho Tim Cook even took the time to highlight some sunny numbers for the iPad over on the enterprise side of things. According to the CEO, 94 percent of Fortune 500 companies have deployed or are testing the tablet. That number is at 74 percent amongst the Global 500. Apple, naturally, is looking to push that number even higher. Says Cook, "We're shifting our focus here to penetration in enterprise," adding that the device is "the most broad-based product I've seen in my entire career in terms of enterprise adoption."
