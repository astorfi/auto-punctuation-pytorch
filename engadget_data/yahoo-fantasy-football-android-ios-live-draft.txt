We can't believe it took until 2013, but Yahoo has finally filled in a major missing feature on its fantasy sports platform: the ability to participate in a live draft from a mobile device. Many thousands of leagues (including our annual Engadget HD Podcast group) run on Yahoo, and until this year that has occasionally meant bringing laptops into awkward places or sitting chained to a desktop at the appointed time. The updated iOS and Android apps also include support for mock drafts, so you can prepare for any possible draft-day surprises while on the go. Hit the links below to install the free apps and remember, friends don't let friends autodraft.
