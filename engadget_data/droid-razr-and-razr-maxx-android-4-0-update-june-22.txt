 
 Looking likely to sneak through in time for Motorola's Q2 deadline, Verizon has published support documents covering an Ice Cream Sandwich update for both the Droid RAZR and Droid RAZR Maxx. This preamble is typically followed by an update just days later and features the same build number that leaked out earlier this week. The refresh adds a four-way lockscreen shortcut, refreshed notifications, global roaming, a smart actions app update and plenty more Android 4.0 holo design riffs. Hit up the source for the documents and a handful of video tours.

 Update: VZW just confirmed the start of the roll-out on its news page.
