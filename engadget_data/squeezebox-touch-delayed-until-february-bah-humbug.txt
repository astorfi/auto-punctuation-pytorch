Originally, the device was slated to go on sale this month in order to get wrapped and tucked beneath a-many Christmas tree, but now we've heard directly from the company that it won't be shipping out until February 2010. We took a brief tour around the web, and sure enough, most respected e-tailers aren't showing any stock (or any sign of stock); what's odd is that we know at least a few of these things leaked out onto the market, though the whole "Logitech denying its existence" scenario that we saw play out back in August certainly makes a lot more sense now. Either way, it looks as if you'll be waiting if you're believing the official word, which just so happens to be quoted in full after the break.
      

 

Statement from Logitech Public Relations:Due to an unexpected product delay, this product will not be available (for review or sale) until February 2010. I apologize for any inconvenience this delay may have caused you.
