Just when you thought you had all of the sides in the
cellphone safety debate
down, here's another angle: Australian researchers have begun a study to determine whether electromagnetic radiation
from cellphones is harmful to kids. The three-year project, being carried out by the Australian Centre for
Radiofrequency Bioeffects Research, will track 300 Melbourne children to see whether cellphone usage affects their
hearing, memory, sleep, concentration and blood pressure. Of course, we have to wonder what kind of parents are willing
to allow their kids to be guinea pigs in a study like this, but we assume that their faith in the power of new
technology overrides any concerns they may have for the safety of their children. Either that, or someone wrote them
some very large checks.
