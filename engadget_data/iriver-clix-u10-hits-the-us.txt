It's the same device (well, this one's 2GB), but it looks like iRiver finally caught on to the fact that named products brand better and seem to sell faster than arcane alpha-numeric character combinations. Other than that this thing doesn't appear to be too different than its predecessors; CNET's got a review of it up (as well as one of Urge and Windows Media Player 11, here and here, respectively if you're interested).[Thanks, Jenn]
