By all appearances, the T-Mobile folks haven't lost sight of the popularity of the Galaxy Note, as a collection of snapshots obtained by TmoNews have revealed Samsung's phablet in none other than Magenta colors. At the very least, this suggests the Bellevue crew is considering bringing the 5.3-inch handset to its stores, and while the carrier's subscribers are currently able to use AT&T's Galaxy Note LTE on the Magenta network, it's a rather roundabout process and the results are less than ideal. We can only hope this one pans out, because really, who wouldn't love to take this monster for a proper ride on the little network that could?
