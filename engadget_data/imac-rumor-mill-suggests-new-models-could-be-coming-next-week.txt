That includes a report from 9 to 5 Mac that iMac orders are being delayed until May 2nd, despite the fact that they're still listed as shipping within 24 hours on Apple's website, and a separate confirmation from a trusted source of the site, who says that Apple will stop shipping iMacs to retailers this week in advance of next week's supposed release. That's further backed up by a report from Mac Rumors, which cites another source who says that Apple will be changing the promotional materials in its retail stores for a launch on Tuesday, May 3rd. Details are comparatively light on the rumored new iMacs themselves, but the safe money seems to be on Sandy Bridge processors and Thunderbolt ports.
