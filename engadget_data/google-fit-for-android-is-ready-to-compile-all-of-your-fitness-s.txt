We first heard about Mountain View's activity-tracking plans back at I/O, and now the Android faithful can get their hands on the goods. The Google Fit app, the company's answer to Apple Health, is now available for download, compiling all of those collected fitness stats in the same spot. By leveraging your phone's sensors, the software monitors walking, running and cycling activity, allowing you to set specific goals and benefit from some friendly advice. Fit also plays nice with third-party apps and devices -- and of course, Android Wear gadgets -- so that you can get an overall view of your progress from one place. Strava, Withings, Runtastic, Runkeeper and Noom Coach were specifically mentioned in the announcement and MapMyFitness is opting in as well. What's more, the initiative can be accessed on the web should the need arise (once you've logged in on your phone). Looking to get moving? You'll need a handset running Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or above, but if you meet the requirement, the app is available for download at Google Play.
