The reported model numbers are D-420, D-620 (pictured), D-820, and m-90, which range from12 to 17-inches in screen size. The bringer of these tidings noted that at the demo of the laptops, he saw a 185 poundman stand on a D-820 placed on its side and open in a "V" position, and that the notebooks have a newtri-metal composite chassis. He also noted that the 8 pound, 17-inch m-90 sports a 512MB Quadro graphics card. That'sall we "know" for now, but hopefully more will be revealed tomorrow.[Thanks, Omar]
