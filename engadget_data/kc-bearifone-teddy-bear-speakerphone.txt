Well the KC Bearifone certainly fits the bill, because what ismore pointless than a speakerphone shaped like a teddy bear? How about a bear-shaped phone that moves its mouth andeyes in response to a caller's voice? Sorry, KC, you're no Teddy Ruxpin. Available immediately if you feel likethrowing away $150.[Via TRFJ]
