Steve Jobs lashed out against "greedy" record labels at the Apple Expo today, warning them that any increase in the
price Apple charges for downloads from the iTunes Music Store would result in more piracy and fewer profits. He's
right, of course — if anything the price of a download should be even less than 99 cents (which is what they charge
here in the US) — but the record labels don't see it that way and think that they should be able to charge more money
for newer hits than they charge for back catalog.
