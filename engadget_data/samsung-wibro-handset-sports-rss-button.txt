Yeah, you read that right -- an RSS button. We're as crazy about this RSS stuff as you can get, but an entire button just for accessing your handset's feed reader? Then again, we are hitting the feeds these days as often as we check email, and we definitely don't mind having a phone with a dedicated email button. Anyone recognize this thing or know its model number?[Via Scripting News and kosso's braingarden]UPDATE: It's legit, the handset is the SPH-M8100.
