If you're into drones and wireless audio, then you'll probably agree that Parrot is the best thing out of France since Daft Punk. Personally, I've been most impressed with the company's wireless headphones, the Zik. In fact, I've been a regular user since it came out about two years ago. Even today, no other brands have attempted anything as advanced as these cans. Which makes sense: These are no ordinary Bluetooth headphones. In addition to being wireless, they feature effective noise cancellation and intuitive touchpad input, all tucked inside a quirky Philippe Starck design, no less. More importantly, the audio quality has gotten better over time as Parrot improved device compatibility via firmware updates.


But of course, there's always room for improvement; the original Zik is on the heavy side, and not everyone's a fan of its bulky look. Well, that's pretty much why we now have the Zik 2.0, and fortunately, it offers more than just improved portability. Read on to see if this new model is worth the $399 upgrade.





Hardware
The Zik 2.0 is essentially a lighter, more rounded and thus better-looking version of the first-gen Zik; and don't forget that it also comes in white, blue, mocha, orange and yellow. Our pre-production unit weighs 274 grams (it's officially 270 grams), a 17 percent reduction from the 327-gram original (325 grams officially). The difference was immediately noticeable when I first put on the new model. It feels more comfortable and secure thanks to the extra padding on the head rail, as well as the more spacious memory foam cushions. I can now lean backward or forward without the fear of gravity pulling off my headphones. Another notable change is that the oval cups are now covered with soft, faux-leather material instead of hard plastic, which adds some warmth to both the look and feel.
