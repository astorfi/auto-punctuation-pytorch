Taiwanese GPS company f-tech recently released the Solar 7, a (partly) solar-powered Bluetooth GPS receiver.
According to f-tech, you'll get 20 hours of juice from the Li-Ion battery alone, or 30 hours when it's working in
tandem with the solar panel. Bluetooth on the device is Class 2, with a distance up to 10 meters, and the company says
the built-in antenna will give users good signals whether they're in the mountains or in the city. No word on price or
availability in North America.
