Today's Spotify announcements are all about free - but it's not only tablets that are getting some love from the company. CEO Daniel Ek took the stage to announce that there will be a free version for any device that can access the service. The caveat here is that this is a new version of the app based around shuffling. So, things aren't quite so random as Pandora - you can actually listen to the artist you want, but you can only do so by shuffling through the artist's catalog. There's always a trick, right? The good news, however, is that you can skip through songs you don't like and add songs you do to a playlist.
