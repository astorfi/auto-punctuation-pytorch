 Oh, you too, T-Mobile? Without delving into details, T-Mobile USA has gone tit-for-tat with Sprint by dropping the knowledge that it'll be adding tablets (other than the Tab, of course) to its product portfolio in 2011 -- and as you might expect, they'll be using the network T-Mobile has taken to calling "4G." Though it doesn't meet any technical definition of 4G, the company's ever-expanding HSPA+ network is definitely hanging with the big boys running WiMAX and LTE right now, delivering downlink speeds of 10Mbps or more in some areas if you're lucky -- and that's just the kind of special sauce you're going to want when you've got a big touchscreen to consume content. No word on brand or platform, but we've no doubt some of that Honeycomb noise will be in the mix. Here's the full statement:

"T-Mobile is working closely with the majority of our OEM partners to deliver 4G products by integrating HSPA+ into roadmaps in 2011 as the dominant global standard. Consumers will continue to see HSPA+ fuel future innovation in a variety of mobile consumer electronics from smartphones and tablets to emerging devices. T-Mobile will continue to be at the forefront of wireless innovation, delivering an aggressive 4G product lineup in 2011, including 4G tablets."
