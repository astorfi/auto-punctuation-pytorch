According to a tipster who just today signed up for a new account and added Blu-ray access, a message popped up at the completion of the transaction notifying him that a $1 per month charge (plus applicable taxes) would be added once his free trial concluded. Just a wild guess here, but we don't reckon you're bailing out on your rental plan over this, right?[Image courtesy of Homotron, thanks Wesley]Update: We're hearing that some folks are seeing a $2 per month charge. Selective pricing, hmm?
