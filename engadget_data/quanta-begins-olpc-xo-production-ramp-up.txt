 Quanta Computer has finally received the green light to ramp up production of Negroponte's OLPC XO. The not-quite $100, open-source laptop should start shipping in quantity by October at a current cost of $176-per with the option of solar, foot-pump, and pull-string chargers presumably at additional cost. For those keeping track, that's about 4-months later than NickNeg's original estimate. Of course, as Nick likes to remind everyone, it's not about the laptop at all, it's about education. Former Secretary General of the UN, Kofi Annan, effusively described it as "an expression of global solidarity." Good, 'cause even humanitarian efforts will need a logo in Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong.
