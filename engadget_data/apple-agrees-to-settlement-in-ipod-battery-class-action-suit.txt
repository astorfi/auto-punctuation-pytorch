You know, lots of people complain about the iPod's non-user-replaceable (well, not easily, anyway) battery and its
tendency to just plain crap out after while. Then, there are some people who mount a class action lawsuit over it, and
it turns out they've actually won a settlement. Apple isn't actually admitting any wrongdoing or misrepresentation, but
they have agreed to the settlement, which stipulates that third-generation iPod purchasers who've experienced battery
failure during an eligible one-year limited warranty extension (presumably this adds a year to the warranty you
normally get) can submit a claim for either an iPod replacement or a $50 Apple Store credit (hmm, no brainer!). Those
who purchased a new first- or second-generation iPod on or before May 31, 2004 and who've experienced battery failure
within two years can choose between a $50 credit at the Apple Store (retail or online) or a $25 reimbursement check.
Anyone with a 1-3G iPod purchased before May 31, 2004 who has already paid for battery-related services under the Apple
Battery Replacement Program before June 3, 2005 (hurry!) is eligible for a 50 percent reimbursement. If you qualify as
a class member for any of the above, you'll want to go get some more details (peep the Read link), and you'll probably
be wanting this:
