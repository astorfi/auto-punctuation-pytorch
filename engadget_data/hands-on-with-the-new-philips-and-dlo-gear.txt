Of note was the DLO HomeDock HD, which will be released in August for $250, and has a bit of an updated look from when we saw it last -- and some pretty snazzy menus for its type of product. That DLO iBoom JukeBox is also getting an August release for $200, along with the Rhapsody-friendly Streamium NP1100, a Network Music Player that'll be out in July for $150. We didn't get a chance to listen in to the Eco's "invisible" speakers, but the principle is simple enough: there are two speakers mounted on the back of the TV that bounce sound off the wall. That sound is then dispersed by the curved acrylic frame around the edge of the device. Our advice? Buy some real speakers.
