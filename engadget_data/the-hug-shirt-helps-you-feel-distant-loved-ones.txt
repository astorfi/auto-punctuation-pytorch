These days you can send your hug lovin' via pillow,
cellphone, or
furniture — hell, you can even
fondle your chicken remotely if that's your thing. Here's
a wearable way to spread the love: the F+R Hugs is a soft Lycra shirt with embedded sensors that allows you to feel the
hugging sensations of a loved one far away. The hug shirt works via mobile phone networks to transmit the heart beat,
touch and body temperature of a remote companion in realtime, generating the sensation of a real hug. Actuators in the
shirt are embedded at major body intensity points for the most strategically "real" sensation (just look at that guy
and tell us he's not feelin' it.). There — now who said technology is making us more
antisocial?
