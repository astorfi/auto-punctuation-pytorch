 More of a heads up than anything else, PNY issued a release today stating its intention to debut is new SSD drive lineup at Computex early next month. We don't know the sizes or prices on these things, but we do know that every time a new company adds their products to the mix it only means everyone else has to work harder to make their gear cheaper and better -- and the sooner we can take out all the spinning disk drives from our machines, the better.
