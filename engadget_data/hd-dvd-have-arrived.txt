 I was reading the AVSForum and what do I find, but a guy from Surf City, CA managed to pick up a HD-DVD player from his local Best Buy. I guess they didn't know that they weren't suppsed to be released till Tuesday. Lucky for him, but not as lucky as you think, he still doesn't have any movies to watch. The forums members are keeping him busy with questions, this is starting to get exciting.
