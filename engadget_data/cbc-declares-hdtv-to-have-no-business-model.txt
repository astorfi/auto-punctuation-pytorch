 While we've seen plenty of HD expansion in our northern extension, it seems that Robert Rabinovich -- president of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation -- feels that broadcasters are getting the short straw. Contrary to the UK's Freeview system, which gives the public a bevy of cost-free SD channels and is seeing a mutual, unforced push to go HD, we here in North America tend to let content guardians keep a tighter grip on how things are done. Essentially, the prez stated that HDTV "has no business model," claiming a complete lack of motivation for advertisers to pay more to have their plugs shown during an HD show verses an SD show. Apparently his feathers are all ruffled because advertisers are saying that the choice to broadcast HD is "none of their business," leaving broadcasters that do pump out that HD goodness no actual way to recoup the costs. Although we can (kind of) see where ole Robert is coming from, claiming that HD doesn't influence the amount of viewers (which advertisers certainly are interested in) is a tad absurd, and if more companies would actually offer up HD commercials, we might actually slow down and pay attention.
