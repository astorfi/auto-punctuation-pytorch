 Convenience stores, cornershops, newsagents, call them what you will -- nearly 5,000 local businesses in the UK have now been signed up by Amazon to receive and look after its customers' precious packages. The "CollectPlus" scheme is currently on trial but The Telegraph reports it's expected to roll out across Britain, where it'll add one more delivery option for those who -- for their own strange and inexplicable reasons -- are rarely at home between 9am and 5pm.

 Update: We've just heard from CollectPlus that it should now be available as a delivery option at checkout, and equally Marketplace sellers can select it as a mode of delivery.
