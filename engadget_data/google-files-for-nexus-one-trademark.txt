Now, don't get too carried away -- sure, that could mean free unlocked GSM Android sets for all, but it could also just mean Google's planning to sell the Nexus One as its next-gen Android Developer Phone. Considering everything we've heard points to the device being limited to T-Mobile 3G, we'd say the developer phone theory is still the most likely, but it's all up in the air until Google provides a sample of the Nexus One mark being used in commerce to the USPTO -- or, better yet, announces something official.

Update: Ruh roh. As we're sure you're aware, the "Nexus" name is a riff on Philip K. Dick's Nexus-6 replicants in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and ultimately in Blade Runner -- and his estate is none too pleased that Google's using it without permission. According to the New York Times, Dick's daughter -- who is in charge of licensing his work -- was never told of Google's plans, and she's contacted the lawyers now that she's found out. We're guessing Google can still make nice though: she says she would have been open to an agreement had contact been made earlier. So... let's get on that, guys.
