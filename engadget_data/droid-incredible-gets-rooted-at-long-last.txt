You should be mindful that progress is still at a very early stage, and hacking your own Incredible is said to be both "very hard" and "not very repeatable." The important thing though, is that it's happened, and we're now probably only a few days removed from a user-friendly patch that lets us truly do whatever we might want with that handsome device. They say roots are an important part of a balanced diet, and this one should go very nicely with a bit of Froyo, don't you think?
