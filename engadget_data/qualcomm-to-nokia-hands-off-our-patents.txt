 Qualcomm announced today that they're suing Nokia, claiming the company infringed on two of their patents in Britain. Qualcomm is asking both for damages and for Nokia to stop selling phones in Britain -- something we're guessing they're not going to readily comply with. The suit specifically relates to GSM, GPRS and EDGE products and is an extension of a case brought in the US last November. For its part, Nokia says they haven't received a copy of the complaint and aren't commenting other than to say they'll defend themselves and believe Qualcomm doesn't have the right to an injunction.
