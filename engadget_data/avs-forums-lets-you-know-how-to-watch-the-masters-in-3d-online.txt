A 3D presentation will also be available online, but will of course require some additional hardware for you to enjoy it, like the nVidia 3D Vision kit (pictured above) and a PC display capable of accepting a 120hz signal (like most HDTVs, many PC monitors claim 120hz even if they only accept 60hz, these won't work). These details and more are spelled out for you over at the AVS Forum, but one other thing worth mentioning that you'll need is a internet connection capable of delivering a 10Mbps stream.
