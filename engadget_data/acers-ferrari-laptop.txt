Pure marketing gimmick? Well, yes. But setting aside it's blindingly bright red casing, Acer's new
Ferrari-themed "Ferrari 3000" is actually a decent laptop, with 512MB of RAM, an 128MB video card, a 15-inch
LCD, 60GB hard drive, Bluetooth, built-in 802.11g, and a multiformat DVD burner. Too bad the battery life (not
even two hours) is almost as bad as a real Ferrari's gas mileage.
