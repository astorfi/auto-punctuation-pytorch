 The two new Sony nav-u GPS units we knew were on the way Stateside are officially announced today. As expected, the NV-U73T is sporting a 4.3-inch screen with the higher end NV-U83T sizing up at 4.8-inches. The latter also features Bluetooth, gesture command, split-screen dual view, and an accelerometer for more accurate navigation when signal is low. Both units feature text-to-speech and a new "super suction cup" that reportedly really sucks (...in a good way) to achieve maximum adhesion to your location of choice. Both will be available this February for $350 and $500, respectively.  [Via press release]
