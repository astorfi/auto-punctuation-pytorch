 Remember how yesterday's release of iOS 6.1.3 was supposed to fix a security hole that allowed one to bypass the lock screen? Well, turns out Apple's got a bit more work to do. Today, a new lock screen sidestep was revealed by YouTube user VideosdeBarraquito, and this time around, running iOS 6.1.3 won't do you any good. The bypass involves invoking a telephone call by voice command and then ejecting the SIM card at a specific event. After a few steps, access to a users contact list and photo gallery becomes easily accessible. The upside? If you're genuinely concerned about your security, you can plug this hole yourself by disabling the voice dial option from the Password Lock screen within system settings. You can view the complete exploit after the break. As for Apple, looks like it's back to the drawing board.
