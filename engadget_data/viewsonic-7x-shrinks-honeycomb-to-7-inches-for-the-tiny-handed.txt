According to Pocket-lint, the company will debut the Tegra 2-powered ViewPad 7x at Computex later this month. The 7x will supposedly pack WiFi, HSPA+, and an HDMI port while weighing in at a svelte 0.84 pounds. Oh, and it's got a design on the back that is supposed to make it look "funky"... or something. There's no word on price but, it's rumored to hit shelves in June.
