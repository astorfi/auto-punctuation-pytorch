Major companies have a notorious reputation for quietly bringing unannounced products to trade shows like IFA 2013 and tossing them in some random part of the booth, which means we're always walking in expecting to find something new. Fortunately, LG did not disappoint us this time, as it showed off a new 13-inch "Ultra PC" Ultrabook called the Z935. Reps told us that this model, due to arrive in Korea this November for $1,000, is a minor refresh to its existing series of Ultrabooks; the Z935 in particular gets a bump in IPS display resolution to Quad HD (2560 x 1440) and also sports a Haswell SoC. The Win8-powered machine measures 314 x 219 x 13.6mm and weighs 1.15kg, much like the Z360 we peeked at in January. There's a USB port and HDMI port to the right, along with a headphone jack, while a pair of microSD slots are tucked away just a tad underneath the right-hand side, hidden barely out of sight but still easily accessible; USB and ethernet ports line the opposite side. All told, there are only a few minor design changes here, and we've put together a gallery of images for you to see it from all angles. We're still waiting for the full listing of specs, but we'll keep you posted as soon as we hear more.
