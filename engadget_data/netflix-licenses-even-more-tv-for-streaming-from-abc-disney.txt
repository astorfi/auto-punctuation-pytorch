The delay time for adding new episodes is at least 15 days for new programming so keep that ABC.com / Hulu bookmark handy if streaming video is your viewing method of choice, but with every single episode of older favorites like Scrubs, Ugly Betty and Reaper due up in 2011, plus expanded offerings from Disney Channel and ABC Family including Greek and the High School Musical / Camp Rock series of movies we're sure everyone can find something to watch in the meantime. ABC/Disney has been down with Netflix streaming since early on, not to mention 99-cent TV sales/rentals, whether the rumored popularity of cord cutting is true or not, it seems both companies have found a balance they can agree upon for now, check the press release after the break for more details on what's available and when.
