This time around, we've got a little more confirmation that the so-called Zeppelin from Moto is sporting Google code (allegedly Cupcake, sadly) with a dash of Blur added in for good measure. Gizmodo Brazil -- which scored some time with a prototype -- suggests that this'll see duty on the lower end of Motorola's smartphone lineup, and we tend to agree considering the HVGA display that takes up far less space than it could if Moto had wanted to go for broke. A keyboardless companion to the CLIQ / DEXT, perhaps? Carriers are an open question here, but we've heard rumblings of interest on T-Mobile USA's part; the site says it'll hit streets in March, so we shouldn't have long to wait to find out.
