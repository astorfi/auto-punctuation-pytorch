Were you confused when the FBI said that Hillary Clinton likely broke the law by sending classified email through her private email server, but recommended against charges? You're not the only one. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has announced that FBI Director James Comey will testify regarding that decision at a hearing on July 7th. Republican Chairman Jason Chaffetz argues that the recommendation was "surprising and confusing," and disagrees with Comey's statement that Clinton didn't mean to break rules. "Individuals who intentionally skirt the law must be held accountable," Chaffetz says in a statement.



The testimony could shed some further light on the FBI's stance. However, whether or not it actually leads somewhere is another story. After all, we've seen tech-related Congressional committees that are more about fueling the outrage of party supporters than taking action. Unless Comey says something new that could prompt a formal response, his presence may not do much to change Clinton's future.
