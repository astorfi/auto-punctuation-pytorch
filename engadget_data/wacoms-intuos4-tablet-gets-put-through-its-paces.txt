The gang at PC Magazine have just put one through the ringer -- and have been kind enough to post a review for all and sundry to peep as well. According to the reviewer, the device occupies a "sweet spot" in the company's lineup. While offering decent resolution and pressure sensitivity when compared to the cut-rate Bamboo (the Intuos4 responds to as little as one gram of pressure), it still can't hold a candle to the Cintiq series -- except in price. The latter will run you up to two grand, while Wacom's newest starts at $229 and includes any two of: Photoshop Elements, Autodesk Sketchbook Express, and Corel Painter Sketch Pad. But that ain't all -- be sure to hit that read link for the full review.
