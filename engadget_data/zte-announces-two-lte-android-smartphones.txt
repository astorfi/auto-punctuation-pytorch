  Looks like ZTE couldn't hold its horses until MWC. It's just unveiled product names and key specs (but alas no product photos) for two Android 4.0 thoroughbreds that'll be shown off in Barcelona. The first and more interesting is the PF200, which the press release suggests will house an unidentified "1.2GHz chipset," along with a 4.3-inch qHD display, eight-megapixel rear camera and 1080p (i.e. two-megapixel) front-facer. The handset will support LTE, UMTS and GSM and come with the usual range of sensors and connectivity, as well as DLNA, mobile high-definition link (MHL) and NFC. Meanwhile, the N910 comes with LTE FDD, CDMA and EVDO support, a 800 x 480 resolution, five-megapixel camera, 1080p front-facer and a 1.5GHz processor. There are no prices or release dates, but these phones are claimed to be mere "fore-runners of a wide range of LTE devices ZTE will bring to the market in the coming months." At least one of those as to be Tegra 3, right? Full PR after the break.Update: Now with product shots: the PF200 above, and the N910 after the break. Thanks, Xiong Jiao!
