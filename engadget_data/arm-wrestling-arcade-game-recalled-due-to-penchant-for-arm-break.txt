Atlas Co. is recalling its "Arm Spirit" arm wrestling arcade game from the market in Japan after the 150 machines scored three broken person arms between them. Spokeswoman Ayano Sakiyama had some smack for gamers puny enough to get their arms broken over the pink barrel: "The machine isn't that strong, much less so than a muscular man. Even women should be able to beat it." Yeah, she just shot down any robo-warrior cred you suckers might've been hoping for out of the situation. "We think that maybe some players get overexcited and twist their arms in an unnatural way," but they're recalling the machine as "a precaution."[Via Engadget Japanese]
