As promised late last year, ASUS unveiled its new Chromebox packing Intel's fourth-generation Haswell processors today. The most compact Chromebox yet, the computer comes sporting either Intel's Celeron 2955U or i3-4010 processor. Another i7 version of the box will be available outside of North America.


Under the hood of the svelte 4.88 x 4.88 x 1.65-inch device, you'll get Intel-integrated HD graphics and 16GB of onboard storage. If you need more room to store your stuff, ASUS is also offering buyers 100GB of free cloud storage through Google Drive. Display-wise, the i3 and i7 Chromebox supports 4K Ultra High-Definition displays, and all three have HDMI and DisplayPort out ports for dual-monitor capabilities. You'll also find four USB 3.0 ports on the device, as well as a built-in SD card reader. You can snag your own ASUS Chromebox in March starting at $179; check out more images below.
