Unfortunately, neither the Exilim EX-Z2300 nor the EX-ZR10 will be making a stateside debut, but those situated in continents not named North America may certainly be interested. The former of the two utilizes a 14.1 megapixel sensor, a 3-inch rear LCD (960 x 480 resolution) and a 5x optical zoomer, with other specifications including an SD / SDHC card slot, 34.9MB of inbuilt memory, 720p video recording, an ISO range from 50 to 3200, CCD-shift image stabilization and a rechargeable battery good for around 580 shots. 

Moving on to the ZR10 (not to be confused with Pentax's similarly named RZ10), this one is Casio's HDR baby. During the company's presser, executives went on (and on) about how wunderbar the camera's inbuilt HDR ART function was, and honestly, the images that were being displayed were indeed pretty fanciful. The point-and-shoot relies on a back-illuminated 12.1 megapixel sensor, the Exilim Engine HS, 28mm 7x zoom lens, an automatic panorama option and a newfangled burst mode that enables up to 30 shots of 10 megapixel images to be taken, with high-speed burst shooting at a maximum speed of 40 shots per second. Better still, the company has upped the video resolution here to 1080p, while also throwing in an SD / SDHC / SDXC card slot, ISO range of 100 to 3200 and a rechargeable battery. No one's talking pricing, release dates nor release regions just yet (aside from shunning America, of course), but we'll be sure to update just as soon as those facts and figures hit our desk. Oh, and we did manage to score a few precious seconds with this guy here in KÃ¶ln, and it's exceedingly slim given the feature set. We can't speak for the image and video quality first-hand, but based on what was shown and the aesthetic that we witnessed, we'd say the ZR10 has a bright future ahead of it.

Meanwhile, Casio's new HDR ART function produces artistic photographs that are radically different from conventional photographs. The EX-ZR10 offers a whole new way of enjoying the unique capability of digital cameras for creating and displaying images.With Casio's HDR technology, each press of the shutter button actually takes several shots with different exposures and instantly combines them into a single, great-looking image with a high dynamic range. This ensures that both light and dark areas are clearly visible in the photograph and minimizes washed out or overly dark areas. The HDR-ART function uses this HDR technology to create beautifully artistic photographs. It locally controls the contrast and the level of color saturation of the analyzed subject, and achieves the kind of novel effects that used to be possible only using specialist PC software - with a single press of the shutter. Now anyone can create dramatic, eye-catching authentic HDR images with ease.The wide-angle 28 mm 7X optical zoom lens achieves zoom performance equivalent to 14X optical zoom with Casio's Multi SR Zoom, which actually combines a number of still images to create a sharp, clear photo. In addition, the dual image processing circuits built into the new engine dramatically reduce the interval between shots, and ultra-high speed burst shooting captures crucial moments at a maximum speed of 40 shots per second. These functions let nothing slip by unrecorded. The wide range of shooting options also includes Premium Auto which takes beautiful photos with just a press of the shutter button, and Slide Panorama that allows users to easily capture 360-degree panoramic images. The camera also offers a full range of movie functions. In addition to high-speed movie recording at up to 480 fps for slow motion movies, the EX-ZR10 also takes Full HD movies (H.264).
