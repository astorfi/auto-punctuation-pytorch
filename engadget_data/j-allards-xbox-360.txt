While no one was looking last week at Xbox HQ we snuck
into J's office to rummage through his trash for information on the 3rd generation Xbox â€” instead we wound up swiping
his personal 360. The best part was when we ganked it from his desk to take some pictures of the thing his assistant
said in a very loving, motherly voice, "Oh, I see J's been working on it some more." Yeah, you could say that.
