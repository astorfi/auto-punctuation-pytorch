LG isn't beating around the bush this evening; its Snapdragon 800-based followup to the original Optimus G will officially be known as the G2. Naturally, with so many of the smartphone's secrets already on display for the world to see, the revelation is a minor one at best, but it fills in a small piece of the puzzle for what we might expect on August 7th. With the announcement, LG is also tweaking its branding scheme by dropping Optimus from the phone's name, while also reiterating the G series as the company's flagship lineup. Curiously, LG is also hinting at future smartphones with 4:3 displays, which will be known as the Vu: series. Place your bets now on whether the affordable L series receives the same naming treatment.
