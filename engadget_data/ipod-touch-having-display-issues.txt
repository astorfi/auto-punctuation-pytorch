Posters have described is everything from a "negative black effect" to "shimmering" to simply "washed-out." We're hearing that simply bringing a defective unit back to an Apple Store will result in an immediate swap, but it certainly looks like Steve was glossing over a detail or two when he said the touch had the "same screen" as the iPhone, eh?[Thanks, Mobilehavoc]
