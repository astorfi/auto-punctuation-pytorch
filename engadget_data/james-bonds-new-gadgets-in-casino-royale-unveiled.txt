 Over the years, gadgeteer James Bond has had everything from radioactive lint (On Her Majesty's Secret Service) to a wristwatch with a grappling hook inside (The World is Not Enough). Although we reported last fall that Bond wouldn't have any delicious spy toys in the upcoming Casino Royale, it looks like the movie won't, however, be entirely devoid of gadgets. Here's what we've heard thus far: Bond will get a new Nokia 8800 Aston Martin branded cellphone and his love interest, Vesper Lynd, will get a white Sony Ericsson K618 (or possibly a Sony Ericsson M600). Furthermore, Bond will have a very tense scene that involves an unreleased Sony Vaio, accompanied by a Sony Memory Stick Duo (are we sensing a theme here, Sony?). And yes, Bond gets a new ride (as always), rumored to be the new Aston Martin DBS. After we see the movie, we'll be sure to spill a 40 martini for our man Desmond Llewelyn.[Thanks, Juna]
