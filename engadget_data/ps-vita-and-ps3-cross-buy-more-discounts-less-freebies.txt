Taking the stage at its pre-TGS press event, Sony announced a new Hot Shots Golf game as one of the program's first adopters -- citing a price reduction, rather then a free game, for users who pick up either the PS3 / Vita version of the title. In contrast, Sony stated at Gamescom that buyers of PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale and Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault would receive a second copy of the game for free upon purchase, indicating that cross-buy discounts may vary from title to title. Remember kids: just because you bought it once, doesn't mean you won't have to buy it again.
