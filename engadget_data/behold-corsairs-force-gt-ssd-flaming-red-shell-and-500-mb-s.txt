 Feast your eyes upon the latest and greatest SSD from Corsair, the Force GT. Aside from its flaming red fa√ßade, the Force GT also promises snappy 520 MB/sec read and 500 MB/sec write speeds thanks to its SandForce SF-2000 controller -- nearly twice as fast as the company's previous SandForce drives. The 240GB SSD will officially be unveiled at CeBIT 2011 (which ends tomorrow), but we thought you'd like to see this ruby-red speed demon a little early. Enjoy.
