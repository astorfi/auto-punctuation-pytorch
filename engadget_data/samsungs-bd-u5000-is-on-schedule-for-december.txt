Today, Samsung let us know that it'll be shipping from their factories in October and expects it to hit retailers shelves in December. It's also been confirmed that the BD-UP5000 will be Profile 1.1 "ready", and there are plans to release a firmware update in January of 2008 that will make profile 1.1 a reality. It's not surprising that the BDA has provided this loop-hole when we consider that the first Profile 1.1 title isn't expected till next year.
