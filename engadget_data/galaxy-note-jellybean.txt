 It's been a long time coming, but Android 4.1.2 has finally arrived for the phone that began the whole "is it a phone, or is it a tablet?" quandary: the original international Samsung Galaxy Note GT-N7000. The Jelly Bean update brings a number of improvements to the OG Note, with a brand new Nature UX that brings it a little closer to the Note sequel in terms of look and feel. It'll also get features like Multi-Window, Page Buddy, Smart Rotation and of course, Google Now. As usual, the update will roll out in phases depending on your country or carrier and is available via Kies or over the air.
