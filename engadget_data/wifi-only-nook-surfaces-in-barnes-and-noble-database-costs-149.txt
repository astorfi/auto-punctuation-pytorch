While internal databases aren't the most reliable source for release dates even assuming the screenshot is legit, we'll know for sure in just days. The question now is how Kobo stacks up.

Update: Google's dropping some $149 - $199 hints about the new Nooks in its sponsored ads as well. See a sample after the break. [Thanks, Joseph]
