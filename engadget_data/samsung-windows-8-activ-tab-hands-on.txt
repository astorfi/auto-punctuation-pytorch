 
 Well, well, well, what have we here? It's yet another beautiful tablet from the folks at Samsung. We've got our hands on the Samsung ATIV Tab running Windows 8 on a low-power ARM processor (aka Windows RT) and it looks and feels fantastic -- and familiar. Yep, if you've ever seen or played with a Samsung Galaxy Tab, you'll know what you're in for, a solid and beautiful tablet with a brushed aluminum back. The screen is extremely vivid, and yeah, we had to turn it down to get some decent shots of the thing.

 The big tell, however, is the new square Windows button on the bottom bezel. Yep, this thing is rocking Windows RT, in all of its glory. The other big tip off: there's no stylus on the slate. You're going to be using you finger to navigate through the operating system -- sorry S Pen fans. The tablet is extremely zippy, as well -- and no question why -- the device is rocking a 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 processor on top of 2GB of memory. Obviously the tablet is best suited to the tile UI, though you can swap between that and the older familiar one by clicking the right tile.

 We'll get you more information as it become available -- in the meantime, please enjoy the following image gallery.
