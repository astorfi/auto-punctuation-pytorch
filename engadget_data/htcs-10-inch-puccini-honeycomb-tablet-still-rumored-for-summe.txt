Today's tattle has HTC's 10.1-inch LTE "Puccini" tablet hitting mass production in June with AU Optronics and Wintek pegged as the touch panel suppliers. Other specs, like the 1.5GHz MSM8660 processor and Android 3.0.1 build, seem to have been culled from that 911sniper leak which DigiTimes graciously cites as "sources in the supply chain." Of course, the June date has been tossed around before by DigiTimes but it's good to hear it again so close to the 10-incher's rumored summer release.
