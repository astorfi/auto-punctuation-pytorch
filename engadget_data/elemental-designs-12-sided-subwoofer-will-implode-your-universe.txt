Enter the Elemental Designs eD D1 Dodecasub -- a $2,500, ten-subwoofer-sporting, 12-sided polygon of bass-related pain. In case you're wondering, each subwoofer rocks 600-watts on its own, potentially creating enough bass to rupture not only your bowels, but your sanity as well. Finally, you can hear your Geto Boys album collection the way it was meant to be heard... with too much bass.[Via Crave]
