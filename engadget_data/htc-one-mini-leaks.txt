HTC One mini? HTC M4? Whichever moniker you want to give it, that appears to be what we see above. Shown in a bunch of photos on Estonian site forte.delfi.ee the 4.3-inch device seems to corroborate much of what we've heard already. Beyond the (slightly) smaller 720p display, the site also claims there's a dual-core processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB internal storage and a 4-megapixel shooter complete with UltraPixel technology. The same sources claim an August release date, at around â‚¬400, but we're not clearing our agenda just yet. That's all we've got to go on for now, but it seems 4.3-inch really is the new small.
