Rdio's used the past few months to bring an array of improvements to its iOS app -- some functional and some cosmetic. To keep the momentum going, the company today released yet another update, including a Station Tuning feature that lets listeners "adjust any station to play more familiar or more adventurous tracks." Additionally, the app's Collection tab now sports a redesigned look, which makes for an easier, better-looking way to view album artwork. Rdio says search within has been improved as well, while other undisclosed, under-the-hood UI enhancements are also part of this version. Per usual, we've included the download link below.
