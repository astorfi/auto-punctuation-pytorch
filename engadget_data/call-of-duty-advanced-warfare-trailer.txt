Miss that Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare trailer Microsoft teased at its big E3 press event? No you didn't: We have it right here. The well-rehearsed teaser follows a player through the streets of Seoul, South Korea, taking every opportunity to show off the new gameplay elements afforded by the title's imagined-future tech. This includes a jetpack-assisted fall, a peek at a powered armor suit and a small arsenal of far-flung weaponry. Oh, and it wouldn't be a Call of Duty trailer without some cinematic trauma thrown in there, too -- skip on past the break to see the full video in all its glory. Looking for some color commentary?
