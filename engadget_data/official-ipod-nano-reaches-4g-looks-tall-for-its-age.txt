As we heard, 9 colors, bigger $149 8GB and $199 16GB capacity, and wider 2-inch display under the control of an accelerometer for automatic switching between portrait and landscape modes like those early Canon PowerShots and uh, oh right, the iPod touch and iPhone. Looks just like the spy shots eh? Steve calls it the thinnest iPod ever with new Genius playlist, shake to shuffle feature, and 24-hour battery for music or 4-hours for video. In stores by the weekend, available immediately on-line. A few more pics after the break and the gallery below.
