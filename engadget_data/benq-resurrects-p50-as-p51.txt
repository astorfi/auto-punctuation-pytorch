So yeah, you could say it comes as some small surprise to us that BenQ is resurrecting the vaporous handsetwith Windows Mobile 5.0, and even throwing an integrated GPS receiver into the mix. They haven't given any furtherinformation than that as of yet, so while we understand the integrated WiFi is still intact, we don't know if it'sstill got the SDIO slot. But ultimately we're hoping for a few things here: namely that this handset won't cost morethan $800 (though we have a sneaking suspicion it may), that they'll have finally added at least EDGE, and that, youknow, they actually release it this time. Just a thought.[Thanks, Dave]Update: Engadget Mobile's got some more deets for ya, if youwant 'em. For example, the SDIO's still there, huzzah.
