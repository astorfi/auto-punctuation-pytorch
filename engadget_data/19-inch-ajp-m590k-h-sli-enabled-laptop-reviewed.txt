Most problematic, according to TR, were the low benchmark scores theM590K-H turned in with both graphics cards turned on -- in some cases, performance was actually worse than just runninga single card. Along with the weight (a backache-inducing 14.5-pounds), crappy sound (even with headphones),relatively-low resolution (only WSXGA ), and steep price (over $4,000), the unacceptable SLI implementation makes usthink we'll go with the reviewer's advice and hold off until the 7900 GT card goes mobile, or at least wait around tosee what Dellienware has tooffer.
