Fortunately, Intel's Anand Chandrasekher just stepped in, referee-style, and dropped the retraction hammer on his loose-lipped, ARM-bashing underlings with the following correction: "Intel's low-power Atom processor does not yet match the battery life characteristics of the ARM processor in a phone form factor; and, that while Intel does have plans on the books to get us to be competitive in the ultra low power domain - we are not there as yet. Secondly, Apple's iPhone offering is an extremely innovative product that enables new and exciting market opportunities. The statements made in Taiwan were inappropriate, and Intel representatives should not have been commenting on specific customer designs." So... friends, or are we doomed to repeat the whole toasted bunny thing again? [Via cnet news]
