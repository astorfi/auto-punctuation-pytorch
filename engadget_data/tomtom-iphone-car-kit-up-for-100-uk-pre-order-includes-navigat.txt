It'll cost 5 pence shy of £100 and ships in 2-3 weeks with the dock and adhesive disk in the box. Better yet, for that price you also get the £60 navigation app for the UK/Ireland. Then there's this little note: "The Car Kit dock is compatible with all iPhone models, but the Car Kit app only works with iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G"So what about the iPod touch compatibility as claimed in the TomTom FAQ? Or is that just a gaming device now?Update: Just hit mainland Europe for €99,95.Update 2: Oops! Looks like the page was pulled -- back to waiting! See the original after the break.[Via Recombu]
