Football season will be here in a matter of weeks, so to help fantasy football enthusiasts keep tabs on their rosters, ESPN has updated its suite of apps dedicated to the task. In addition to a fresh coat of paint for the UI, you'll be able to create a team or league from within, getting alerts for scoring, injuries and more all season long. If you're unsure of your pal's contact info, invites can be sent to those social media acquaintances worthy of a clipboard. While software for Apple's mobile operating system was already equipped with both live and mock draft abilities, the Android faithful can now do the same. New versions of both the Android and iOS applications are now available for download via their respective app libraries, so you can get started with the pregame strategery.
