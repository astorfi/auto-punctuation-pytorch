Here's a little bit of good news. Philips Semiconductor is introducing a single chip with both WiFi and Bluetooth on
it that'll let device makers add both wireless networking standards to their gadgets on the cheap, with the added bonus
of not having to find extra space for a second chip. Not that it'll make much difference here in the States â€” anyone
wanna bet that manufacturers will still refuse to give us the Bluetooth that they seem to be convinced we don't
want?
