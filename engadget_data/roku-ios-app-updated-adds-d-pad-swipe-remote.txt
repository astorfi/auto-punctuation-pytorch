   Good news for folks who are enjoying the virtual hook-up between a certain line of miniature entertainment boxes and an iOS device. The Roku app's just hit version 1.1 and is bringing along some relatively fancy, but more importantly, useful features. Some of the new bits include a D-pad filled with buttons and shortcuts for apps like Netflix, Pandora and Crackle. Also, there's the inclusion of a new swipe-based remote -- which is optional -- that should help make navigating through applications a bit easier while you're lounging on the couch. You can grab the updated goodies now by heading to the App Store or hitting up the source link below.
