Every time Apple holds one of its keynotes, we think to ourselves, "Maybe this is the year they'll kill off the iPod classic." Finally, after a years-long stay of execution, Apple's oldest living media player is going the way of the dodo. The company just reopened its online store after announcing two new iPhones and a smartwatch, and the iPod classic is conspicuously absent from the iPod section. The remaining options include the shuffle, nano and touch at the high end, with the max amount of storage being 64GB. If you're of a certain age, then, you can get ready to tell your grandchildren about the days when people carried 160GB of music in their pocket instead of streaming it all from the cloud. Oh, and get ready to explain what a spinning hard drive is, too.
