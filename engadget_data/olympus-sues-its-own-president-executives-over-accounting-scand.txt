The camera maker filed suit in Japan yesterday against its own president, Shuichi Takayama and 18 other past and present executives over the deal in which it worked to conceal $1.7 billion in loses. On top of that, current board members have agreed to resign, moving aside for investors to vote on new management for the company.
