Well, you're in luck: the Pandora pre-order page will continue to accept your orders through Sunday, and production will be increased beyond the initial 3,000 units to meet the demand. So what are you waiting for? You already blew your first shot -- and this is will be your last chance to catch the open-source sensation this year. Go on, get!
