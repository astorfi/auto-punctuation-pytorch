Ad-free, on-demand streaming is coming your way, following the launch of Rdio's new internet radio service for iOS and Android devices called Stations. The AP reports that from today, if you live in the US, Canada or Australia, you can take advantage of free music that has been matched to your taste based on certain genres, artists, songs or albums. The company hopes that you'll like the service so much, you'll pay the $10-a-month subscription to access more than 20 million tracks. It's also a direct play to lure customers away from rivals Spotify, Pandora and Apple's iTunes Radio -- which offer the same radio features in similar markets.


Free streaming has been made possible thanks to Rdio's partnership with The Echo Nest. The company also recently partnered with Cumulus Media -- owner of over 570 radio stations in the US -- allowing the operator to begin selling ads and serve them inside Rdio's web player (mobile listeners will not be subjected to ads, for now) . If you're already an Unlimited customer, today's rollout will not affect you -- the US company wants you to enjoy its music catalog sans interruptions.


Update: Rdio has rolled out a version 2.5 update to its iOS app that introduces the Free Stations feature mentioned above. It also now lets you share stations on Facebook, Twitter or with any of your pals on Rdio, and you can start new stations based on an album or playlist. While the Free Stations are only available in US, Canada and Australia, users worldwide should enjoy the rest. You can go ahead and download it at the App Store link below.
