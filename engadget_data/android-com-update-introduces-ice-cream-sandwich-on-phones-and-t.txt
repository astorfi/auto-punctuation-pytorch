Whether you need yet another breakdown of what the new version of the OS brings to the table is debatable, but there are a few fresh renders of the tabletized version of Ice Cream Sandwich included, as seen above. A quick look sees the new Roboto font displaying the time, and revised button scheme at the lower left. Click the source link and dive into the site for yourself for a few more pics.
