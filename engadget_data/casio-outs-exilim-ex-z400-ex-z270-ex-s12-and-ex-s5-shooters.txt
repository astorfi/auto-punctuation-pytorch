 
Four more compact cameras from Casio: EX-Z400, EX-Z270, EX-S12, and "sleek and sturdy" EX-S5. The top end of these lower-end shooters is the Z400 (pictured above) which features a wide-angle 28mm, 4x optical zoom, 3.0-inch LCD, CCD-shift anti-shake, and 550-shot battery. The Z270 drops the LCD down to 2.7-inches while the 12.1 megapixel S12 drops the zoom to 3x. Bringing up the rear is the 10.1 megapixel EX-S5 with YouTube capture mode for those who want (or need, frankly) to keep it simple. Sorry no 30fps burst or super slow mo' in this lot. Prices will range from $300 for the Z400 on down to $180 for the S5 when these pop for retail in March.
