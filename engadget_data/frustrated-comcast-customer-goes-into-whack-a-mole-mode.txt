 Don't try this at home, kids. Just like most of us, Mona Shaw has been frustrated by her TV service provider. After a few rounds of playing "wait for the service truck to show up" which ended in her cable service being cut off, the 75-year old climbed the next rung in the customer service ladder and went to her local Comcast office. With a hammer. You can read the link for an account of what ensued, but luckily the only thing smote was some office equipment. Her actions resulted in a three-month suspended sentence, a one-year restraining order and a $345 fine. All in all, a pretty expensive way to register her opinion on Comcast: "What a bunch of sub-moronic imbeciles."
