   
It'sbeen quite the Blu-ray party today, what with the LF-MB121JDfrom Panasonic, the BRD-UM2 and BRD-AM2Bfrom IODATA, and that decisive word fromPanasonic's CEO that dashed any hopes left for talks between the Blu-ray and HD DVD camps. Now Sony is joining the clubwith the pre-order availability of their BDP-S1 Blu-ray player. That'sthe good news. The bad news is that the unit will be going for the expected $1000, andhas a targeted availability of August 15th. Sure, all that 1080p, multi channel digital audio, and HDMI action is stillhere, but Sony sure isn't driving that hard of a bargain.[Thanks, Delerious]
