 Telus customers who can't part with their BlackBerry when they travel across the pond could rest easy when the 8830 was listed as coming soon on their website. As of yesterday, the price was $199 with a three year contract, had a 50% discount on international roaming through October, and was launching June 22. As of today, though, it was changed to $499.99 (ouch) with a three year contract and they removed the launch date. No word on what caused the surge in pricing but inquiring minds want to know. What gives, Telus?[Via BlackBerry Sync]
