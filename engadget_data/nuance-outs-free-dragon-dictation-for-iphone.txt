 
Talking on your phone is one thing, but talking at your phone makes you look like a crazy person. Of course, virtually everyone on the Engadget masthead is crazy in one sense of the word or another, so we have absolutely no qualms about the release of Nuance's Dragon Dictation for the iPhone, which uses the company's NaturallySpeaking engine to let you transcribe pretty much whatever you like. Of course, seeing how the iPhone lacks multitasking, it uses the clipboard as an intermediary -- talk into the Dragon app, then move over to wherever you want the good and paste 'em. It's free for a limited time, so you might want to grab this one sooner rather than later.
