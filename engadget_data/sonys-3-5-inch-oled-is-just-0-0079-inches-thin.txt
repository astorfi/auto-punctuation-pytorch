However, that panel's fracking impressive when compared to those relatively chubby 0.67-mm (and that's a world's slimmest), 320 x 240 pixel LCDs capable of just 2.2-inches of display. And just look at those blacks -- you can barely see the bezel.Update: Oh my... we just noticed that Sony's also showing off a 0.3-mm thin, 11-inch OLED with 960 x 540 pixel resolution. That's 10x slimmer than Sony's XEL-1 OLED TV. See it pictured after the break.
