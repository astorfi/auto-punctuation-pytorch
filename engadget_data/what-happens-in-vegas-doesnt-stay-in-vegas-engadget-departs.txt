Between the full-court press of 3DHD, Sony's announcement of the VAIO P netbook... er, ultraportable, and the nuclear bomb that was the Palm Pre announcement, no one will forget this CES anytime soon. As in previous years, the Engadget team came, saw, and worked nonstop to cover every piece of gear we could get our hands on. After keeping it in the red for days on end, we're all feeling pretty burnt and ready for a long nap, but insanely stoked that we could bring you CES the way it's meant to be experienced: like a screaming neon blur.We'll be back in full force for CES 2010, but until then, you can gestate on our hard numbers and sad trailer teardown video after the break.Update: We're adding pics to the gallery, and just added a new video of us working as we normally do.
