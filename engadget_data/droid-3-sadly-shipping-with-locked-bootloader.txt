According to a Motorola support forum manager the latest, landscape QWERTY slider from the company is not sporting the new unlockable firmware found on the Xoom. Now, before everyone gets up in arms, lets remember that Moto said it wouldn't be offering the new bootloader till "late 2011," and it's entirely possible the Droid 3 could shed those shackles with a future software update. So, we understand you're a little disappointed but, patience is a virtue friends.
