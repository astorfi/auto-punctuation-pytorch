We broke the news last night about three seemingly new names for upcoming HTC devices -- Vision, LED, and Glacier -- and Dutch site Tweakers.net is now reporting on a user agent profile for the Vision that lists the device featuring that mythical holy trinity: WVGA display, QWERTY, and Android. Furthermore, they've got the director of HTC Benelux on record saying that they're planning more Android phones with keyboards -- so that's a Good Thing to hear at a time when huge slates seem to be stealing the show in every segment of the market. With the Nexus One, Desire, Droid Incredible, and EVO 4G all alive and well, we think these guys would be well-served to play with other form factors for a minute or two, yeah?
