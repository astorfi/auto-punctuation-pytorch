We're guessing it won't be another actual Communicator
replica, but Sona Mobile in partnership with Viacom will be putting out a Star Trek-themed phone next month. It's
going to come equipped with a custom Star Trek faceplate and other themed features, which more likely means it'll be
some regular mundane phone rebadged and slapped with Star Trek paraphernalia. There will also be themed goodies on the
software end such as multi-player online Star Trek games, video streams, and other news and information for fans. No
word on whether it will help you be as suave as William Shatner.
