Now this is what we'd call bucking the trend: a leaked document obtained by Xperia Blog, allegedly pertaining to Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo, outs a new Sony device that looks to be a mini Xperia Z1. That Sony would be quick to jump on the mobile industry's popular 'mini' craze is unsurprising, but what does seem peculiar is how the company's approaching the specifications of this 4.3-inch Xperia Z1 f. Instead of just retaining the name and shrinking the Triluminos display down (here, it's 720p) while lessening the spec load, it appears Sony's porting over both the 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 processor and the 20.7-megapixel camera of the Z1. If true, that would explain the Z1 f's increased thickness, making this Honami mini a near-equal to its flagship namesake.


Its more pocketable screen size could also help attract customers (especially those with smaller hands) that would otherwise shun a 5-inch device. What's more, the Z1 f looks to be taking a page out of the industry's prized color book (see: Apple, Nokia) and could be available in bright pink and neon yellow, in addition to the traditional black and white. Of course, colorful phones are nothing out of the ordinary for Sony's home market and it's possible this variant could be Japan-only. Only time will tell if the Z1 f is more than a clever work of digital smoke and mirrors, but based on what we're seeing, we sure hope it isn't.
