The thing just showed up at the carrier's holiday preview event here in New York City. We're told it runs Gingerbread, which would make it AT&T's second Android 2.3 handset behind the newly launched HTC Status. Alas, AT&T won't say just yet when the Play will be available or how much it will cost on contract, but we do know a couple things for sure. One, it'll run on the carrier's 21MBps-capable HSPA+ network. Two, it'll be available in a "Stealth Blue" color option, in addition to the stock black model we've handled before. Other than that, the specs -- namely, the 1GHz Qualcomm MSM8255 Snapdragon chip and 4-inch (854 x 480 display) -- remain the same. Hands-on shots with the sparkling navy number below.
