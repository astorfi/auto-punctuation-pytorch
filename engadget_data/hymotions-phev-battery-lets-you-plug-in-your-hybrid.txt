But HyMotion is here to help with their new PHEV Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicle), which addsan extra battery to your hybrid that can be charged from a regular wall outlet. Once you run out of juice on thisli-ion secondary battery, you can resume normal operation, but for local travel you might be able to get by on mostlybattery power, leaving that ol' gas pump nearly a thing of the past. The system, which works with the Ford Escape andToyota Prius, is currently $9500, but only available to Government and fleet owners. HyMotion is hoping to have theprice down to $5000 when the kit becomes available to the public in 12 months.[Via gizmag]
