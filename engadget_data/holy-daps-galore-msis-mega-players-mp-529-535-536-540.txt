Whoa, MSI, you've been busy â€” why release one product at a time when you can throw down seven? There's a whole lotta
DAPpage goin' on here, so we'll try to sum up painlessly. The MSI MP-535 (above) has got a 20GB hard drive and line-in
audio but no video playback support despite its curiously PMP-like design. Click on for the rest of the goodies.



Next up, the MP-529 (below) ? also sporting a curiously large proportioned screen for having no video playback.Motion JPG is all you get, folks, despite its 2.5-inch TFT LCD. Other specs: MP3/WMA/WMA DRM/FM tuner/voicerecorder/12-hour battery life. Soft porn not included.    Onward to the MP-536 (below, right), a 5GB MicroDrive player with an SD/MMS slot and USB On-the-Go, and the MegaView566 Pro (below, left), an update to the MV-566. The newversion adds USB On-the-Go to the original, and supports MPEG4/DivX/WMV/JPG/BMP/GIF/MP3/WMA.    More? Dear god, yes. Below is the MV-571, which comes with a choice of 20/40/60GB hard drive and a high-res 640 x 480pixel 3.7-inch screen. It does MPEG1, 2 and 4 (ASF, AVI, MP4), DivX 3.11/4/5, Motion JPG, WMV9, MP3, WMA, Janus, AAC,WAV, JPG, and BMP. It?s also got an SD/MMC slot, USB On-the-Go, TV tuner (via docking station), audio/video recording,screen capture, FM tuner/recorder, and an optional Bluetooth module. It?ll go 3.5 hours for video playback, and 7 hoursfor audio alone.

   The MP-540 (below) is yet another micro hard drive-based player with a 1.8-inch color screen TFT.    The very last of the line is the MV-569 (not pictured), with a 7-inch screen (800 x 480) that does MPEG4, WMV9, DivX,ASF, AVI, JPG, BMP, GIF ? and may possibly sport either WiFi or GPRS. GPRS, on a PMP? WTF?
