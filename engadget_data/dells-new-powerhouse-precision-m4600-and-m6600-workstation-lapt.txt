There must be some mind readers in Round Rock, because today Dell revealed that the machines will make their debut on May 10 with prices starting at $1,678 for the M4600 and $2,158 for its 17-inch big brother, though prices surely escalate quickly from there. Turns out, the laptops also have optional IPS and four-finger multi-touch displays for your viewing pleasure and RAID support for your (and your employer's) peace of mind. That's some stellar hardware for some serious coin, so interested parties should start brown-nosing the bossman immediately -- or maybe just get a second job. PR's after the break.
