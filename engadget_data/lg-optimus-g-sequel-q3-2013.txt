LG's been teasing a big reveal for the start of May over in the US and we reckon it'll mark the official launch of the Optimus G Pro. But what about the not-so-humble Optimus G and the rest of the world? Well, we've been told that a (global-bound!) sequel flagship from LG will appear sometime in Q3. Direct from LG's HQ in Seoul, Won Kim, Head of Mobile Marketing says that we can expect "something different and something unique", which all sounds good to us. It'll also be something that won't skirt near the 5.5-inch screen size of the Optimus G Pro, and will instead stick closer to the five-inch mark. Unfortunately, he kept his explanation of new device tantalizingly vague for now, but it looks like LG will wait for the current flagship phone fight to settle a bit before it reveals its new weapon.
