Our understanding is that this is strictly an invite-only event and that non-Premier riff raff (and non-Sprint customers) will be turned away, but honestly, if we were in the market for a Pre, we'd probably loiter for a bit just to see what's up and get a gauge on whether they're willing to bend the rules -- particularly if the Pres end up not selling out by the time the night's over. Either way, if you want a Pre this weekend you'll need to leave your basement at some point because the phone won't be sold online initially -- so let us know how it goes out there in the trenches, folks, and we'll do the same. Stay tuned![Image via PreCentral]
