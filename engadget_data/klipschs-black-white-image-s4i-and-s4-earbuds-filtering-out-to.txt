Vann's already has the Image S4 in white up for pre-order, while Apple stores are set to receive their Image S4i (includes an in-line microphone for iPhone yappin') any day now. The former will sell for $79 while the latter demands an extra Jackson, but it's safe to say that either will put Apple's own white earbuds to shame.
