The tabs have been teased on the company's site for some time, but that's not holding the Chinese outfit back from making an official announcement at IFA 2012. Taking a slight step down in size from the S2110, the 9-inch IdeaTab A2109 ups the internal ante of its more premium stablemate with a 1.2GHz quad-core Tegra 3 buffered by 1GB DDR3 RAM, while also packing in a 1,280 x 800 LED display, 1.3-megapixel front-facing / 3-megapixel rear cameras, SRS sound, and ports for a 3.5mm headphone jack, micro-USB and micro-HDMI. And for users more accustomed to quality builds, the slate shouldn't disappoint as its rear encasement is of the all-aluminum variety and lending to its 1.3 pounds (570g) of bulk. Storage for this Android 4.0 slate is not as robust as its larger counterpart, but the 16GB allotted is expandable via microSD. The tab's already available online and at Best Buy, so if you want to call this your own, prepare to part with $299.
