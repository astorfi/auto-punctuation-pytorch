LG is just now releasing their 71-inch, 1080p MW-71PY10 plasma display in the states, whichfeatures a 1200:1 contrast ratio, along with plenty of HDMI, DVI, and component inputs. To celebrate the launch, LGhosted red carpet events at Ken Cranes Home Entertainment in LA and Sixth Avenue Electronics a bit north of NYC. Withcelebrity guests like Stacy Keibler (of "Dancing with the Stars"), it sounded a bit too high falutin for ourtaste.
