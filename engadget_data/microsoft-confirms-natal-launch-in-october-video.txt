 
We've heard it before, now Microsoft's Syed Bilal Tariq is repeating the October launch date for Natal. Speaking to GamerTagRadio, Microsoft's marketing manager for Saudi Arabia says that the Natal launch, 
"is going to be somewhere in October and we will be in a position to confirm the date at E3, which is in June, but definitely it is going to be October 2010."
 So there you have it. While we'd prefer to see an official press release on the topic, there's little reason to doubt what you can hear for yourselves after the break.

Update: It's not as clear-cut of a statement as we'd probably, but Microsoft has responded via email, telling G4, "Syed Bilal Tariq is not a [Microsoft] employee... He is a vendor employed through a third-party company on behalf of the Microsoft subsidiary in Saudi Arabia." Sure, that downplays his realm of knowledge, but it doesn't completely discredit. No comment was given as to the October date. At least E3's a few hours closer now, right?
