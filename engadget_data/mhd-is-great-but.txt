 There is that one stupid commercial that is at least 13db higher than anything else is on the station. Hate it. All the commercial is about advertising is that you are in fact watching MHD for three seconds but those three seconds will blow your speakers if you were already jamming to some music. We are hoping that someone over at MTV's headquarters will read this and go tell the tech to turn down the level on the MHD spot that plays every 45 minutes. The HD MTV station is a nice compliment to any HD tier with 100% HD content, but it's that one commercial that is going to make us change the channel.
