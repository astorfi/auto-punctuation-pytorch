A handsetsnear the end of the year, and now the first pictures of two models from Motorola have surfaced. Besides their abilityto jump on iDEN for walkie-talkie action, nothing really stands out about these devices; they both incorporate the samefunction-over-fashion design that we've come to know, if not love, from the Nextel-Moto alliance. PCS Intel reports thatthese two unnamed handsets could go on sale as early as November, for an unknown price, with more feature-filled (read:multimedia-centric) models popping up in the second quarter of next year.[Thanks, John R.]
