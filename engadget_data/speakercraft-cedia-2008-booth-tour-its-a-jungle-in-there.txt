From a dozen yards out, you could feel the bass pumping, you could sense the ground moving, and you could see the mass of people gathered at the SpeakerCraft installation. Upon heading over, we realized that it had brought along the jungle (and even its inhabitants), and we found all sorts of drivers hung up in trees and underneath canopies. Put simply, it was just too bizarre to not pass along, so here you go.
