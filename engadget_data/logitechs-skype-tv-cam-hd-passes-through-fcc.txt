 Logitech isn't giving up on living room video chats just yet. Sure, the Revue and the Viera-friendly TV Cam failed to set the world on fire, but a new TV Cam HD just hit the FCC and appears poised to bring Skype to your couch. There was a promo video on Vimeo, but it's since been pulled. Fortunately there's still a Best Buy listing (at the more coverage link) for the device which has it priced at $200. When will it hit shelves? That's anyone's guess... but we imagine it wont be much longer.
