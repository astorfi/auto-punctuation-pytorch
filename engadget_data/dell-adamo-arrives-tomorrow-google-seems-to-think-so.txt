Instead of the vague "Learn More" promised by similar sponsored links in the States, the ad on Google Ireland says that we can "Discover the Love Story on 17/3." Dell has been pretty mum on a release date -- most details, in fact -- for this laptop, so it'd be quite the pleasant surprise to be staring at an order page for the thing as of tomorrow. Of course, the sponsored link goes to the same old splash page for Adamo we've got, so we'll probably have to wait until tomorrow to find out what this really means -- maybe Dell's planning on teasing us another few months with vague statements and flashy imagery; wouldn't that be thrilling?[Thanks, Niall]
