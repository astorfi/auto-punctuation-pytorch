A second image (after the break, and full size at the link below), also reveals a few more interesting details, like a port below the hotshoe that would presumably be used for a detachable EVF, and a built-in pop-up flash. Otherwise, about all that's clear is that the camera itself appears to be slightly smaller than the Olympus E-P1, and that it's prompted an endless stream of speculation on the photography forums.[Via Digital Photography Review]
