Although there aren't any glamor shots or specs available, the design shown closely matches the tablet we spent some hands-on time with at Computex in June and a quick zoom in the lower right corner reveals that new Windows logo alongside another one for Intel. When we saw it last the spec list included a 10.1-inch 1366 x 768 display, Intel Clover Trail CPU, 2- and 8MP cameras front and back plus the usual assortment of connectors. Check after the break for a bigger look at the diagram and zoom of the revealing logos, or hit the source link to go through any unsealed documents with a fine toothed comb.
