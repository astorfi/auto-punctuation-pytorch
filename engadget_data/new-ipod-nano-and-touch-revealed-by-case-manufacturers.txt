Yeah, those times are over -- check out these silicone cases for a fourth-gen iPod nano and second-gen iPod touch that just appeared on Alibaba. We're not totally sold on the touch cases, but the nanos look way more legit, especially since we've seen some others matching this general look before; while nano KIRFs in this form factor aren't uncommon, we'd say it's pretty unlikely that anyone's making several different types of silicone cases for them. We're not calling this anywhere near 100 percent yet, but let's just say we're hoping Apple's press photographers can make the new nano look a whole lot better than our pal Mr. Blurrycam by the time September 9th rolls around. More case photos after the break.[Thanks, Samm]Read - iPod nano caseRead - iPod nano caseRead - iPod touch caseRead - iPod touch case
