If a new DigiTimes report is to be believed, however, it looks like the tablet will use AMD's dual-core C-50 Ontario APU (or accelerated processing unit), which itself consumes just 9W of power and packs a built-in Radeon HD 6250 graphics chip. What's more, DigiTimes is also reporting that Acer's 10.1-inch Android slate rocks Tegra 2 and will, in fact, support WiFi and 3G. Wait and see.
