Apparently one of the campers called in sick (for two weeks?), and had to postpone his engagement to divert the ring fund to a PlayStation 3, while another guy quit his job altogether. Hit the read link for a full video of these crazies, who fend off naysayers saying "They look at us like we have nothing to do... but we are getting a PlayStation 3." Well, we would sure hope so!
