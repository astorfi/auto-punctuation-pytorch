Assuming they are indeed legit, it's looking like the Incredible 2 will be a world phone with both CDMA and GSM connectivity, and that it will boast a new 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera to go along with the standard 8 megapixel shooter 'round back. You can also apparently count on getting a 16GB microSD card with the phone, and that use of the 3G mobile hotspot will cost you an extra $20 for 20GB, at least according to the document -- although Android Central rightly notes that may well be a typo. Here's hoping Verizon finally clears up some of those details itself sooner rather than later.
