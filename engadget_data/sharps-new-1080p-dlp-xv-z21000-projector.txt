The projector manages a 1,920 x 1,080 resolution, 12:000:1 contrast ratio and 1,000 lumens to prop up an HD picture, while its dual HDMI ports (with HDCP), DVI plug and assorted other HD and SD connectivity should provide plenty of options to your collection of video devices. Sharp has also loaded in plenty of image processing and color reproduction niceties, and promise 3,000 hours of lamp life. However, the 1,250,000 Yen pricetag ($10,870 USD) might be a bit hard to swallow. Too bad that "international cooperation and commiseration" World Cup excuse is in the past.[Via Impress]
