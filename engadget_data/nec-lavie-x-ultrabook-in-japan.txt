 Following the announcement of its somewhat flexible LaVie Y in Japan, NEC's now introducing us to a new, much sleeker member of the company's Windows 8 lineup. At first glance, you may quickly notice that the novel LaVie X clearly takes a design cue from another NEC affiliate, the Lavie Z, but does sport a relatively larger 15.6-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 IPS display, a more powerful Core i7-3517U CPU which clocks in at 1.9GHz, 4GB RAM and a 256GB SSD -- all while being wrapped in a slim 12.8mm package. The LaVie X is expected to hit Rising Sun shelves starting December 27th, with NEC slapping a cool 175,000 Yen (around $2,100) price tag on this slim, Windows 8-loaded Ultrabook.
