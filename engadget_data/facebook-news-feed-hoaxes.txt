Sure, I've clicked on a link from Facebook only to discover it was a hoax. Don't judge me. In an effort to waste a bit less of your time when perusing that News Feed, though, the social network will flag posts that other users say are untrue. Content that gets flagged or deleted will get reduced visibility in that rundown of goings-on -- including links, photos, videos, and status updates. If you see something fishy, you can report it as false just like you mark tweets for spam on Twitter. And if the item in question draws enough scrutiny, a line of warning text will appear above it in the feed. In case you're wondering, Facebook says users tend to give obvious satire a pass, so if you're a fan of that, don't expect those posts to be affected.
