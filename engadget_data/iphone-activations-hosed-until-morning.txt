       We've been hearing scattered reports some that newly-christened iPhone owners are having a heck of a time finalizing the activation process in iTunes. That sucks for a couple reasons: first, these puppies are darned near useless without being activated, and second, it seems the procedure is hanging after the point at which existing customers' current SIMs are deactivated. So yeah, long story short, there's a few people out there left phoneless while AT&T gets its act together, which it's been said may not be until morning. Burnin' the midnight oil over there, O Masters of Activation?
