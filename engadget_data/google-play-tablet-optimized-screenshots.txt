 Tired of accidentally downloading apps to your Android tablet that look best on a smartphone? If so, it appears that Google has heard your cries. The company recently updated its developer console to accept app screenshots that are specific to 7-inch and 10-inch tablets. While it's not the most monumental change, once developers fulfill their end of the bargain, you'll be treated to UI images that best suit your device. Until then, you'll still have to endure a few more games of app roulette.
