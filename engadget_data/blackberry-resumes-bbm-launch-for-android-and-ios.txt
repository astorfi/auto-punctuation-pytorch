BlackBerry is at last ready to resume its paused BBM rollout for Android and iOS. The instant messaging client should reach the App Store, Google Play and certain Samsung Apps portals within the next few hours. Not everyone can start chatting right away, however. To prevent a repeat of last month's server troubles, the company is implementing a queue system: those who signed up in advance can use BBM right away, while latecomers will have to secure a spot in line. It's not quite the broad launch many were hoping for, but it is good news for a company that has lately been feeling down.
