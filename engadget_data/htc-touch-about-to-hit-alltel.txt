 Now that there's a CDMA version of the HTC Touch available, it stands to reason that pretty much every CDMA carrier under the North American sun would have at least a moderate interest in adding it into their mix; after all, it's attractive, it's functional, it's 3G, and what marketing department wouldn't be happy to hear that they've got an iPhone alternative in the lineup? Indeed, we're hearing from multiple tipsters that Alltel's own version of the Touch is poised to launch as soon as the 10th of this month, slotting in alongside the PPC6800 to shore up the regional's WinMo 6 Professional offerings. We'll follow up on this one as soon as we know more.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]Update: Yeah, seeing how Alltel's already taking preorders for the darned thing, we'd say it's pretty much a lock. $499.99 off contract, $199.99 on a two-year plan after rebates. Thanks, everyone!
