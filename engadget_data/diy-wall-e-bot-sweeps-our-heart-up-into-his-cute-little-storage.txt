He's thinking: "Oh, sure, life is grand on this work bench, picking up nuts and bolts, but I want to explore the big wide open. I want to be built by that person, reading this post right now on Engadget, so we can be friends forever and ever." Now, how can you resist a face like that? This particular DIY Wall-E's creator wrote up a 50 step tutorial so you can get to work right this very moment bringing this robotic little fuzzball to life. Don't delay. Video is after the break.[Thanks, Joe]
