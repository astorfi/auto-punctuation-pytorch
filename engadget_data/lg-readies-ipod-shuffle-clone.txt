Looks like the iPod shuffle knock-off game isn't limited to
cheap OEM players anymore. LG Electronics (LG!) is now
showing off their own display-free shuffle clone, which comes in red, black and — of course — white, and packs 512MB or
1GB, along with support for playback of MP3, WMA, ASF and OGG audio files. Much as we'd love to see a little legal
catfight between LG and Apple, it seems really doubtful that anyone's going to get sued over this one.
