 AddPortugal to the list of countries working on newtechnologies to enable the blind to see. In this case, the procedure, developed by Dr. William Dobelle of the DobelleMedical Institute in Portugal, links the brain directly to a set of eyeglass-mounted cameras. The cams capture images,transfer it to a shoulder-mounted computer and upload the info to the brain. The device is designed specifically forindividuals who have lost their eyes and/or use of their optic nerves, and currently has been tested with just 16patients, including one eyeless woman from the US. Using the $120,000 setup, she can now see flashes of light, thoughher vision is expected to improve with greater computer power.[Via MobileMag]
