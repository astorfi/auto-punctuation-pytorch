 The first wearable "augmentations" span from the 11th and 12th centuries all the way up to Google's side project that has built a ton of momentum this year. In the cover story of this week's issue of our e-magazine, we take a look at Google Glass and the timeline of wearable computing that's led us to this point. Eyes-On keeps up the theme while taking a gander at Garmin's Fenix and we offer up an in-depth review of the second coming of Jawbone's UP. If that's not enough, the brains behind the Pebble smartwatch, Eric Migicovsky, submits his responses to the Q&A. Unfortunately, this issue isn't wearable itself, but all of the usual download links are ready to meet your swipes and clicks just down below.
