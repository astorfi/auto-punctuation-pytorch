 Good news, folks -- Kevin Martin believes that more mobile broadband is good for this nation. And we're all about getting the WiFi to the people. Just as expected, the FCC chairman has voiced his support for using vacant airwaves from the looming 2009 digital TV transition to bring mobile broadband to more areas. According to Martin: "No one should ever underestimate the potential that new technologies and innovations may bring to society." His proposal was issued ahead of an official report asserting that potential interference with existing infrastructure could be avoided if "technical safeguards" were put in place to prevent it. Sounds good from here, now go 'head with your bad self, Mr. Martin.[Image courtesy of TechLuver]Read - ProposalRead - Official interference report
