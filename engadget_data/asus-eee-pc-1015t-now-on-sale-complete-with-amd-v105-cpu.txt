 So, the mystery's solved. If you'll recall, we spotted ASUS' Eee PC 1015T sittin' pretty at Computex, but considering that the OS was wiped by the time we got to it, we were left to take the placard's word for it when it came to specifications. Now, B&H has begun to offer this bad boy here in the States, with $349.99 nabbing you a 1.2GHz AMD V105 processor, 1GB of RAM, a 250GB (5400RPM) hard drive, ATI's Mobility Radeon HD 4250, a 10.1-inch LED-backlit panel, inbuilt webcam, 802.11b/g/n WiFi, a 32-bit copy of Windows 7 Starter and a six-cell battery. All told, it rings up at 2.8 pounds and should last anywhere between three and six hours on a full charge, but we're guessing real-world performance will swing towards the former. It's available right now in blue, black and white, and if you're looking for a way to stick it to Intel's sluggish Atom line, here it is.
