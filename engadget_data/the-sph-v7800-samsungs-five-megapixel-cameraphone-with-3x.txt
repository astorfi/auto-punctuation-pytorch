Samsung's finally figuring out that it's not all about the megapixels anymore, and are adding some extra niceness to
the SPH-V7800, their new five megapixel cameraphone, like a 3x optical zoom lens auto focus, a flash, manual white
balance, 13 different scene modes, a widescreen 16:9 picture mode and support for PictBridge. The rest ain't bad
either, and the V7800 also has a QVGA LCD screen, EV-DO, a
MMCmicro memory card slot, and an
antibacterial silver nano coating.
