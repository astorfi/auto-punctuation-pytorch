 Chris Walsh -- one of the forces behind the ChevronWP7 app sideload hack for Windows Phone 7 -- went on record earlier this week saying that the first platform update coming early next year would be "massive" with so many improvements and new features that "they could have called it Windows Phone 8." That's a pretty bold statement, and it's been making the rounds so fiercely today that Microsoft felt the need to lay down the law with an official statement -- albeit not a very strongly-worded one:
"Microsoft is committed to delivering regular updates to the Windows Phone experience. Our first update will make copy & paste available in early 2011. In addition to this first update, all Windows Phone 7 users should expect to see additional updates delivered in the future as part of Microsoft's ongoing update process."
So it sounds to us like priority one in Redmond is to get copy and paste up and running (which is basically the message they've been delivering for a while), though we should expect plenty more through future updates. When you figure in the size of the team Microsoft has built for engineering this platform -- and the fact that they've now got the initial retail release out of the way -- we're hoping they've got nothing better to do than to churn on some of these pain points users have identified over the next few months. Should be a heck of a year coming up, eh?
