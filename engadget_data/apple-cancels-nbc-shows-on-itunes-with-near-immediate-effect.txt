The New York Times was on the money when it said the reason for the cancellation revolved around NBC charging more for its shows: it turns out NBC wanted twice as much, with Apple saying it "would have resulted in the retail price to consumers increasing to $4.99 per episode from the current $1.99." The press release from Apple almost sounds bitter, with the company stating that it decided to end the contract early, since NBC was happy enough with withdrawing "their shows in the middle of the television season." Boo hiss NBC and Apple, don't you see that the only people that get hurt in all this are the consumers?
