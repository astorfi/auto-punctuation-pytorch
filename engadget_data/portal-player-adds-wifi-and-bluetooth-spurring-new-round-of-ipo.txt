While there's no word that Apple has anyplans to make use of wireless technology in upcoming iPods, PortalPlayer's move could open the door for versions of theaudio player that can work with Bluetooth headphones and download music directly over WiFi. And we're certain that,within the next few hours, rumors that Apple is announcing just such a product (perhaps on February 22?)will swamp the internets.[Thanks, James Wouter]
