 The 128 x 160 pixel displayon this one seemed a little, uh, petite, but then again we're probably not the target demo for the W300i,Â  thatnew clamshell-style Walkman musicphone Sony Ericsson announced this morning. Note that SE put the music control buttonson the side of the phone near the hinge rather than on the front like with most other music-centric clamshells.
