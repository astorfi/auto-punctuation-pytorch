 Samsung pegged its new Note for an October launch in Europe and Asia, in typical FCC fashion, it's passed through those wireless testing labs ahead of its arrival in stores around the world. For US readers, there's a severe lack of compatible US LTE bands on this Galaxy Note II, which suggests this is a global model we're dealing with, likely to connect with other 4G networks -- there's a whole lot of them out there. Aside from that, there's a typical selection of 850/1900 GSM/GPRS/EDGE and 850 WCDMA/HSPA radios inside this GT-N7105 model. However, we're expecting another Note II iteration -- packing friendlier LTE frequencies -- will make an appearance at the FCC pretty soon.
