Grand Challenge 2005returned to the desert with oohs and ahhs with four vehicles actually completing the rugged, 132-mile unmanned coursein less than 10-hours. Now, DARPA presents the third and best event yet, the Urban Challenge! This time around, DARPAwill award prizes to the top three ($2M, $500k, and $250k respectively) autonomous ground vehicles that safely completea 60-mile urban course on a simulated military supply mission (read: not likely to be blowing things up) in under6-hours. The main event is schedule for November 3, 2007 with several qualifying events to be held in the run-up. Andyeah, you can expect a full-on grudge-match between 2005's winning Stanford team and runners-up CarnegieMellon (owners of the Crusher) who bothannounced participation in what was hopefully a sweaty, WWF-like expletive-ridden shout-off with folding chairsa-flyin'.
