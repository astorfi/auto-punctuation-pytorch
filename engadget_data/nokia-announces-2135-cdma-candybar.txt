The just-announced 2135 is a basic candybar ("popularly priced" is the terminology Nokia's throwing around here) with a 400-entry phonebook, 3.5 hours of talk time, 11 days of standby, integrated speakerphone, voice recorder, and that's about it. Heck, we probably wouldn't even bother mentioning it if it were a GSM release, but Nokia's tumultuous relationship with Qualcomm makes this a pretty big deal. No word on whether Sprint or Verizon (or someone else) will be picking it up around here, but expect it to be available in the next month or two.
