 Well, well, isn't this a pleasant surprise. With prices for Microsoft's impending Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on having being quoted as high as $500, it's certainly reassuring to hear DigiTimes confirm reports that the movie-playing optical drive will cost just $200 at its holiday release. Now it's not clear if this will be the price for stand-alone units or those that come as part of a "value" bundle (perhaps the one that Richard Teversham recently referred to?), but either way, the low cost would definitely help reinvigorate interest in the 360 in the face of fresh competition from Sony and Nintendo. So please, Microsoft, do us cash-strapped gamers a favor and make this happen -- we promise that we won't even feel too guilty if you're taking a huge loss on the hardware.[Via HDBeat]
