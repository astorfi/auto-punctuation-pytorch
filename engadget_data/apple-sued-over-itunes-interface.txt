We've seen a lot of oddball patent battles in recent years,
mostly of the "business method" variety (remember when Amazon patented one-click ordering and sued Barnes & Noble
to stop them from using it?) and here's another one to add to the list: Vermont-based Contois Music Technology is suing
Apple, saying that the iTunes user interface violates a six-year-old patent that the company obtained for a "Computer
Control System and User Interface for Media Playing Devices." According to the suit, Apple employees saw Contois'
software at trade shows, and copied interface elements, including "the ability of the software to transfer music tracks
to a portable music player, and search capabilities such as sorting music tracks by their genre, artist and album
attributes." Somehow, we seem to remember seeing both software and hardware that could do those things a little more
than six years ago (like, say, MusicMatch and WinAmp, circa 1997, and MP3 players from Eiger and Rio, which came out in
1998). But, hey, you can't blame Contois for trying. For all we know, they may be able to get a
few hundred mil out of Apple just for bringing
this up.
