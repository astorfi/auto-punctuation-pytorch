SanDisk used the occasion -- the unannounced occasion, that is -- to let some members of the press know today that Microsoft's Pink devices will be compatible with its line of microSD cards. That seems like a pretty lame way to ride on the coattails of a big hardware launch, but then again, when your most exciting products are nondescript pieces of plastic half the size of a postage stamp, how else are you going to make the news?
