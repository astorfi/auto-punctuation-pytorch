 Well kids, it's official... the Beast is loose. Dell's M1730, which had been extensively leaked over the past few months, has been made public on the Dell blog (they even go as far as naming us in the notice). As expected, the gaming laptop is crammed full of over-spec'd gear, like the Core 2 Extreme X7900 (which they say is now overclocked to 3.2GHz), dual NVIDIA GeForce Go 8700M GT GPUs, and a slew of other lap-burning components sure to make even the toughest dude start crying immediately. The whole fugly package is available for purchase on the Dell website right now, but approach it with extreme caution. Look, all we're saying is this: when the Beast crushes and dismembers everything you hold dear, don't say we didn't warn you.
