While there's no price to be seen, the ad does apparently confirm that the console will come bundled with a wireless controller, a 256MB memory card, and five unspecified arcade games. Still no word from Microsoft on all this, of course, although we have a sneaking suspicion that the next "sighting" will likely be in the form of an official announcement.[Via Joystiq]
