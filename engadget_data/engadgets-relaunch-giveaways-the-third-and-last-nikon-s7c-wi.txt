1600 ISO and image stabilization

To be entered to win this fine piece of photographic equipment, all you have to do is join the Engadget Flickr group. What can we say, we do love Flickr! You must join up by this Sunday the 15th to be eligible for our random selection -- only members of our Flickr group will be eligible. As always, please mind the rules!

You may enter other Engadget contests, however...
You may only enter this contest once; if you enter more than once on this particular contest post you'll be automatically disqualified and barred from all future giveaways. (Yes, we have robots that thoroughly check to ensure fairness.) You may enter future Engadget relaunch giveaway contests though!
You can only win once. (If you win and then try to go for a second prize during our relaunch giveaways, you'll be automatically disqualified, etc.)
This contest is open to the US only, sorry!
You will be shipped your S7c in a few weeks when all our contests are over. Thanks for your patience!

Good luck, and be sure you've entered our other contests, as well!
