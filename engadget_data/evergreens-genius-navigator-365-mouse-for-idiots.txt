It's a 1600/800dpi laser mouse and you guessed it, a gamepad all wrapped up in a single package. Neither of which we suspect works as well as a pair of dedicated devices. Look, we may not approve of your choice for this mouse, but we'll fight to the death for your right to choose it. Ok, maybe not this time.
