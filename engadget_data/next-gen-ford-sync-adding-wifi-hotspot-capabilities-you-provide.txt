Ford's next generation of Sync systems will have built-in WiFi and the capability of sharing a 3G connection with the car's driver-defined white list of approved devices. It's a bring-your-own-3G-card affair (you jack into the Sync's USB plug), and sounds like a nice way for Ford to get you to pay for a 3G connection that could theoretically fuel some of those upcoming Sync apps. The second generation of Sync is due to launch next year, and we should be seeing plenty of it at CES in January: Ford's CEO has the opening keynote.
