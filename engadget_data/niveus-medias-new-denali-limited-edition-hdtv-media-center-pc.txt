If you can actually afford the Niveus Media's new Denali Limited Edition HDTV Media Center PC, which they're
claiming is the world's first Media Center PC with 1TB of storage and four TV tunersÂ (two NTSC and two
ATSC/HDTV), you can probably afford to hire someone to move it for you, too: this behemoth weighs a full 60 pounds. Not
sure where all that extra weight comes from, but the Denali LE also packs in a 3.4GHz processor, 2GB of RAM, a
dual-layer DVD burner, an ATI X850 ISF PCI Express video card, 24-bit/192KHz audio, and runs Windows XP Media Center
Edition 2005.
