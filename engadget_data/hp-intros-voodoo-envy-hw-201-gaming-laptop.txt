 It looks like VoodooPC's still up to its old tricks despite now flying under the HP banner, trotting out its latest bit of laptop excess at CES. Packing admittedly "non-existent" battery life, the Voodoo Envy HW:201 should be more than adequate as a desktop replacement for all but the most demanding gamers, with a 20.1-inch display, AMD Turion 64 X2 dual-core processor, and your choice of 512MB GeForce Go 7950 GTX or Quadro FX 2500M graphics cards in single or SLI configurations. Further filling out the Envy's 18.75 x 13.5 x 1.9-inch frame are two hard drives providing up to 320GB of space (available in RAID 0, if you choose), along with built-in WiFi, Bluetooth, and a "theater audio system." While it's supposedly set to begin shipping today, the behemoth hasn't yet made an appearance on Voodoo's website, giving the majority of us a bit more time to pretend we can afford it.
