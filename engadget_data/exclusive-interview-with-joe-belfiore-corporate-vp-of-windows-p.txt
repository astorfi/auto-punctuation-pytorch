 
By now you've probably read our in-depth blowout of Windows Phone 7 (and if not, what are you waiting for?). But what you haven't seen yet is our exclusive sit-down with Microsoft's Joe Belfiore, wherein we talk about the ins and outs of the new mobile operating system. We grill the Windows Phone corporate VP about a whole stack of items, and do our very best to make him start crying like a Barbara Walters interview subject (spoiler alert, he doesn't cry). Still, we think there's some good insight here into what the company thinks of its odds in the smartphone wars, and what kinds of features we will (and won't) see when these devices launch this fall. Take a look at the video after the break -- you won't regret it.
