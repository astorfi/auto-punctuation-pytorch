       The Broadcast Flag is one step closer to reality. The entire act made it through the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Our friend Sen John Sununu (R-NH) objected the entire way but the whole thing, including the new digital audio clause, will be presented to the Senate if the rest of the bill is approved. But that might not happen. The chairman of the committee, Ted Stevens (R-AK), still has to decide to send the bill to the full Senator for their vote. He doesn't think that the proponents could get 60 votes to stop a filibuster. At least there is some good news here.We'll keep you updated when we hear more.[If you are just joining us on this whole Broadcast Flag, you might want to check out EFF.org description of it and also some of our previous posts.]
