This week's Ask Engadget question is coming to  us from Cameron, who'd rather buy the most powerful laptop the world has to offer than subject himself to a "desktop PC." If you're looking to send in an inquiry of your own, drop us a line at ask [at] engadget [dawt] com.

"I'm looking for a desktop replacement laptop. It needs to have at least a Core i3 processor, 3GB of memory and a 320GB hard drive. Of course, more is always better, but I'm not looking to spend a fortune. Recommendations?"
We're going to suggest looking Clevo's way if you'd rather not pay the Alienware label premium, but we've got a feeling some folks in comments may know a few more underground avenues for securing a well-built beast-of-a-laptop. Help a brother out, won't you?
