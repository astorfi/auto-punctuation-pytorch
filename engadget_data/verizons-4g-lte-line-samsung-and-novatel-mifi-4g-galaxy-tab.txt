The MiFi devices were decidedly thicker than our existing MiFi 2200 (shown left, above), but it's a price we'd be willing to pay for the ability to surf on both of VZW's networks. Gallery's below for those seeking a closer look, and you should expect the whole lot to hit your local VZW store between March and July.
