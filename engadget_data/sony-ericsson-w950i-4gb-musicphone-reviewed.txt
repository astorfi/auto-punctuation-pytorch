 Mobile-review has taken SonyEricsson's upcoming W950i musicphone through their usualexhaustive testing, and although the translated-from-Russian review may be a bit difficult to fully comprehend, theplethora of screenshots and comparison pics alone make it a must read for anyone considering this Symbian-poweredhandset. Although its 4GB of flash memory and integrated RDS-enabled FM tuner clearly make this a music-orienteddevice, S-E's inclusion of the UIQ 3.0 interface along with a ton of productivity software (Opera, QuickOffice, PDF ,along with the usual PIM suite) allow the W950i to easily do double duty as a smartphone. Easily, that is, for those ofus who aren't diehard QWERTY-enthusiasts -- the flush keypad only offers regular T9 input along with the never-pleasanton-screen handwriting options -- or don't require WiFi and a camera in our pocket at all times. Still, the UMTS radioshould suffice for most data needs, and music lovers will appreciate the A2DP-enabled Bluetooth and 13 hour real-worldbattery life, making the ~$740 W950i look like strong competitor for such storage-heavy models as the Nokia N91 and Samsungi300/300x when it hits stores in July.
