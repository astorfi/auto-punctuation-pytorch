       HP may have discontinued their DLPs, but they have certainly not abandoned HDTV. The new HP MediaSmart HDTVs, including a 42" and 47" 1080p LCD. The most interesting feature of course is the Vista Media Center extender and even without Media Center it can connect to HP Media Portal for access to services including Snapfish, Real Rhapsody and Live365 Radio. Not only that, but it supports many formats including DivX. It has a 1200:1 Contrast Ratio, 8 ms response time for the 42" and the 47" is 6 ms. Since you will no doubt want to connect this to your network it includes integrated Ethernet and 802.11 a/b/g/n. Like many other new sets this year it has 3 HDMI ports and of course an integrated ATSC/NTSC/QAM tuner, but no CableCARD. [Warning: PDF link]
