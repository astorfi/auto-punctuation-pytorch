 Yah need more HDMI ports? How about a dedicated video processor and scalerthat will do up to 1080p? Yeah? Well lets throw in separate picture control for each input. Cool. DVDO introduced us to just a device way back in the summer of 2005 and the iScan VP30 is nowavailable for purchase. The device will allow consumers to hook up the old VCR (maybe a Betamax), a DVD player, thekids Xbox and the high-def cable box. The VP30 will then take all those different resolutions and present the HDTV withits native resolution. DVDO says it best with "any rez in â€“ any rez out." This unit is aworkhorse in a good great home theater. Would you be willing to spend the stickerprice of $1,999 for the ability to get the best picture possible? We would.
