We'll say this about Microsoft's OneNote team: It's clear they want to be on every device, even ones you might not be buying. Earlier this year, the company came out with an Amazon application in the wake of some truly awful Fire phone reviews. Now, Microsoft is releasing OneNote for Android Wear, Google's still-nascent smartwatch platform. Starting today, if you happen to own a Moto 360, Samsung Gear Live or LG G Watch, you can capture a note by saying "OK Google, take a note."



Meanwhile, OneNote's other apps have also received updates. With iOS 8 coming out tomorrow, iPhone and iPad users can now save clips to the web, as well as save pictures and send file attachments -- all without having to leave your current app. ("Extensibility," as it's called, is one of the big new features in iOS 8. You'll probably see lots of apps get similar updates.) Finally, in a similar vein, the so-called Office Lens for Windows Phone will now let you save scanned photos as a Word or PowerPoint file. That's all you need to know for now, but we've included Microsoft's official blog posts below, where you'll find download links and maybe a demo video or two.
