 Nothing says, "Nintendo news" quite like watching Nintendo president Satoru Iwata gesticulate in a featureless white room for nearly an hour. This morning's Nintendo Direct presentation didn't disappoint in that respect, with Iwata moving his hands this way and that, all the while detailing upcoming system updates to the Wii U, new features and mobile access for the Miiverse social network, and Virtual Console finally heading to Nintendo's latest console. That's to say nothing of a new yarn-based game starring Yoshi and the HD remake of Wind Waker. But you're not here for that, are you? You just wanna watch Iwata make silly arm movements? Done and done -- head past the break for your fix.
