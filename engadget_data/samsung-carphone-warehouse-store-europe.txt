Nothing says that you're a heavyweight tech brand like your own store, a flagship retail location that screams your brand from every wall and window. Samsung's got a few of these already, but now it's on a mission to conquer the shopping malls of Europe. The Korean giant has signed a deal with Carphone Warehouse, where the latter will open and operate 60 Samsung-branded shops within the next three months. Some of the locations will be new and the rest will be re-branded CPW stores, but either way -- Samsung's brand is about to get a lot more visible.
