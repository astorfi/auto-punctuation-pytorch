Now "a person close to the situation" tells InfoWorld that the Dream is indeed HTC's Android phone. Remember, HTC is widely expected to be the first from the gate with a retail phone featuring Google's open source OS. The Dream is said to measure 3-inches wide by 5-inches long and feature a full QWERTY keypad that "either slides out or swivels." Right, exactly what Forbes told us 5 months ago. Still, it's always a good sign when the rumor mongers align. Whatever happens, we certainly expect the first Android phone to be exceptionally spec'd as a showcase of the OS' power and possibilities to come.
