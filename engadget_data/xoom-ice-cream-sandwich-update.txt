  You might have thought being the first Honeycomb tablet, and offering a completely stock Android experience, would give the Motorola Xoom some sort of priority when it comes to updates to Android 4.0. Sadly and surprisingly for tablet early-adopters that was not the case, with the Transformer Prime first to hop the update train to Ice Cream Sandwich Town. A week later the Xoom is now catching up, with an OTA update percolating down from the cloud to users, but for the moment it appears only American Wi-Fi versions of the slate are receiving. International and LTE-equipped ones are going to have to wait at least a little longer.
