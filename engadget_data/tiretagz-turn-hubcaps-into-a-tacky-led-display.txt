Looking to make one more part of your car into a blinking, neon display? Tire Tagz, which will no doubt appeal to
the same drivers who go for spinners and flashy rims, use LEDs to display animated or static images while the car is in
motion. When the car is stopped, the unit displays nothing, making it a less obvious target for thieves. We're sure
this will also end up in another market: as a more versatile successor for those
hubcap-based ads we saw on some New York taxis last
year.
