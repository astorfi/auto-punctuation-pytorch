The P5100 represents Nikon's Coolpix flagship model: 12.1 megapixel 1/1.72-inch CCD with new EXPEED image processing engine; 3.5x Zoom-Nikkor lens with optical lens shift vibration reduction; ISO 3200 capability (for 5 megapixel or smaller images); manual and automatic shot modes; and optional expandability with 0.67x wide-angle and 3.0x tele-converter lenses. Expected to roll in Europe for €379/$516. The P50 scales things back to 8.1 megapixels, ISO 2000 max, electrical VR, with a 28-mm 3.6x optical zoom thrown in for about €229/$312.
