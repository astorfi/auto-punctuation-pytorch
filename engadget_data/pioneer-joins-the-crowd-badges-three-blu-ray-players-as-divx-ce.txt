This is no DivX HD certification like we saw in UniPhier-packing Panasonic players, but we'd venture to guess it's a slightly more useful spec than Profile 2.0 for most folks. The units should ship with this feature onboard, which might give them a few months of time before a flood of DivX HD Certified devices hits the market and renders the spec "meh;" but we figure that if you're shopping these Pioneer devices that the styling as important as any other feature for you.
