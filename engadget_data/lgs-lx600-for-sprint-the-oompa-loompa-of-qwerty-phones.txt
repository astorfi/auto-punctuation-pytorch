But then we saw the perfectly-shaped Sprint logo, at which point our thoughts quickly changed to "oh, no." But oh, yes, ladies and gentlemen: this appears to be LG's upcoming LX600 for Sprint, a bizarre little creature that flips open to reveal a 2.4-inch display and a full QWERTY keyboard (a la Rumor) for ease of texting. Little else is known about what the hell is going on here, so it looks like we'll have to wait until closer to the phone's release, which is currently rumored to be October 16. In the mean time, does anyone out there want to fess up to this being nothing more than a disgusting Photoshop job of theirs? Please?[Thanks, Nate C.]
