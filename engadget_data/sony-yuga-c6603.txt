 The folks at Mobile-review have been dropping hints that they have an unannounced Sony handset in their possession, and now they've released a gabble of specs and images to prove it. Sony's "Yuga C6603" bears all the potential hallmarks of a flagship, sporting a 5-inch screen running at full HD resolution (1,920 x 1,080), although some of that real estate is occupied by on-screen buttons. The display is loaded with an impressive 440 ppi, just like HTC's Droid DNA, and Sony's Mobile Bravia Engine has been employed for color reproduction. Under that screen we find a quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro CPU with Adreno 320 graphics, and 2 gigs of RAM for Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean to take advantage of. In terms of connectivity, it's got USB host and micro-HDMI ports, Bluetooth 4.0, standard WiFi, NFC and a Qualcomm modem of the LTE variety. A 12-megapixel shooter can be found on the back (perhaps using the same HDR sensor as the Oppo Find 5), a microSD slot supporting up to 128GB cards on the side, and a non-removable battery of unknown capacity hiding within. That's pretty much it for now -- but judging by how final this hardware looks, there's a chance we might see more of it at CES.
