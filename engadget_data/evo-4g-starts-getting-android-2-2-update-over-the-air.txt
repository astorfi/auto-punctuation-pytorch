We've just gotten a deluge of tips that EVO 4Gs are starting to get blessed with the official update to Froyo -- a few hours prior to the promised August 3 rollout -- so if you've got one handy, you're going to want to start checking it right this second. Seriously, now that it's got a trick flashlight app included in ROM, what could you possibly be waiting for? On a related note, if you happened to apply that early update that HTC posted and pulled late last week, the company's working on a fix so that you aren't out of the over-the-air update loop and promises to "get back" in "the coming days."
