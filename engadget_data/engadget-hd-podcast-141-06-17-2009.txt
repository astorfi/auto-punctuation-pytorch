  After last week's sleeper of a show we were excited to jump in and talk up interesting topics like Managed Copy, the digital transition and the latest do it all media device from Popcorn Hour. As you've come to expect, we took questions via comments, the phone, and the live chat; so don't hesitate to let us know how you feel, any way you like.  UPDATE: Looks like we have some gremlins in our MP3 version of the podcast, but the other formats should be fine. Please bear with us as we try to get the MP3 sorted.  UPDATE: Things seem to be working now, so you can finally hear how Ben managed to lose 20,000 rankings across his music library in one fell swoop. Ouch!
