 Those Redmond folks are sure on a good news streak. After announcing 1080p upscaling and a delightfully low-priced HD DVD drive for their 360, they're offering a helping hand to early adopters who haven't had quite as much fun with the console. Microsoft is offering free fixes to all problematic Xbox 360s built in 2005, and is sending out refunds to users who paid for repairs to that "three red lights of death" problem or other quirks before this dealio went into effect. Of course, one could argue that Microsoft should've been doing these repairs for free from the outset, and it seems like 2006 Xbox buyers are just SOL, but this is at least an improvement to the situation.[Via DailyTech]
