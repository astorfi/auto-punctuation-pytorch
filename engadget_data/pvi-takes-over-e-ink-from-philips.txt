A Taiwanese company by the name of Prime View International just recently acquired Philips' e-ink business,
something which might not sound like a big deal until you realize that it was Philips that made the electronic ink
technology used in Sony's Librie
e-book reader. PVI says they're to start pumping e-ink displays out in volume starting in the fourth quarter of this
year, something which will hopefully result in both cheaper prices and more widespread availability.
