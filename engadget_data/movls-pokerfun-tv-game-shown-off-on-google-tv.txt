MOVL scored a win in Samsung's Free the TV Apps competition for its WeDraw Pictionary-style game (which also runs on Google TV) and this is the followup. They showed it off at Google I/O and it allows users with most any smartphone to connect to the same poker game and control play live on the TV. Founder Alan Queen has a post on the Google TV blog remarking how much he likes the platform for its ability to link other devices and use a full web browser to build its games on which is a good sign, but we'll wait to hear more reports now that the Fishtank is out to find out how things are going.
