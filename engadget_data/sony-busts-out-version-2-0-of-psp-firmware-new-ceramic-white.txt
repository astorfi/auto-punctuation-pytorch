We know that your friend who has a friend whose dad works at Sony sent you a pic of a white
PSP months ago, but this is the real deal: Sony
officially announced a new white PSP, as well as version 2.0 of the console's firmware, at the PlayStation Meeting 2005
in Japan earlier today. The update will be free, natch, and besides almost certainly disabling any and all homebrew
hacks (you know how Sony rollsâ€¦), v2.0 of the firmware will add WPA (finally!), a legit web browser, a new mode for
wirelessly swapping pics with other PSP users, and support for a new service called Portable TV for transmitting video
directly to a PSP (this one might only be for Japanese users). Firmware 2.0 should be available in Japan this coming
Wednesday, with the new white PSP due out September 15th.


 [Thanks to everyone who sent this one in]
