 We've known Sony would bring Men in Black to Blu-ray for a while, but thanks to an ad in the latest Home Media Magazine, we now know the date is June 17. High Def Digest points out the ad mentions the long-awaiting BD-Live extra will include a trivia game, although hopefully it will be more interesting than War's disappointing Yakuza Fighter. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones blasting aliens in 1080p sounds good to us, but throwing the latest tech on top doesn't hurt a bit.
