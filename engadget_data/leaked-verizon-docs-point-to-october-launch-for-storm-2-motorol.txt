The same documents also point to an October launch for Motorola's Android-based Sholes smartphone, as well as a "mid-October" launch for LG's vx8575 "Chocolate Touch" (which we assume is the same or a variant of the BL40 Chocolate Touch). All in all a pretty big month for Verizon -- assuming everything actually pans out as rumored, of course.
