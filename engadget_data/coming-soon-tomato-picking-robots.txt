 Would you stop worrying about white collar jobs being offshored
to India for a sec? This is serious news: scientists are working on a robot that will ensure we don't need
tomato-pickers anymore, too. Under a grant from NASA, Peter Ling, a researcher at Ohio State, is developing a robotic
tomato-picking machine to harvest crops grown in space (at space stations, of course). While we didn't realize picking
low-hanging fruit was all that hard (compared to say, tree-borne fruit), growers around the country have expressed
interest in the machines for obvious reason.
