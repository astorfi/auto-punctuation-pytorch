 In a bid to "stop automotive theft" from occurring so frequently in Malaysia, the Road Transport Department will begin fitting vehicles with RFID-equipped license plates that can be quickly scanned and analyzed by the boys in blue. The plate itself will receive a few minor aesthetic changes, but the integrated microchip is where the rubber hits the road; only authorized mechanics will be able to actually install the plates, and the microchip onboard will house information about the vehicle's model, make, and even driver information. The e-plate, as it's so aptly named, has already quelled theft in Japan (and hit Britain, too), and the RTD hopes that Kuala Lumpur will see the same drops in crime as the new plates make things much more difficult for carjackers since swapping out the plates won't exactly bypass security. The RTD's director-general has already set the implementation in motion, aiming to equip "new cars" first, while "older" (read: less desirable) whips will get the RFID treatment later on.[Via Inquirer]
