Ah, yes, that's the crew that's responsible for Thermaltake's Level 10 PC case, and we're desperately hoping that this concept has an equal (or greater) level of success in the open market. The subway car you see above is purportedly 97.5 percent recyclable, with an aluminum chassis, vivacious hues and a ridiculously spacious interior. It's being labeled the Siemens Inspiro, and it's on track to show up in Warsaw's Metro Warszawskie just over a year from now. No word on where to sign up for conductor dutie, though.
