The Taiwanese manufacturer wants to run with the big boys when it comes to overselling the emotional power of a gadget. Take, for instance, this promotional clip for the upcoming Iconia Tab A200. Yes, we understand that the 10-inch slate can play games and "share memories" but, what exactly Honeycomb has to do with creating family rituals or why you'd bring a tablet camping is lost on us. Sadly, the clip doesn't reveal too much about Acer's new slab. We can see that vanilla Android is out, simply by looking at the navigation icons, and there's a new feature called Acer Ring, which appears to be some sort of task manager with shortcuts to common tasks, like taking screenshots. It also appears to be sporting a full-sized USB port and a microSD slot but, otherwise, we've still got very little info on the spec front. Check out the video after the break.

[Thanks, Manuel]
