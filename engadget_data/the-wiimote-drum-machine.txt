 We're not going to cover every Wiimote hack that comes down the pipe (especially given the rate they now seem to be flooding in), but this one's just too good to pass up. Building on earlier Wiimote developments, Bob Somers took up the less practical but equally daunting task of turning the humble Wiimote into a one-handed air drumming machine. As the video after break clearly shows, Bob was not only successful, but able to bust out a decent tune as well, complete with 80's-style electronic drum sounds. What's not so clear, however, is whether you can use two Wiimotes for some full-on drumming action, though it would seem to be within the realm of possibility (assuming you can get your hands on second one). While Bob has made the necessary software freely available for download, it seems that (as of this writing) his site has been temporarily shut down by his hosting provider in the face of the barrage of Phil Collins wannabes. In the meantime, it looks like you're only options are to keep checking in or hope that a mirror pops up. [Via Joystiq]
