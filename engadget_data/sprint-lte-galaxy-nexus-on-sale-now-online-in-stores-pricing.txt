The other CDMA / LTE-infused Galaxy Nexus is now shipping from Sprint, several months ahead of its first LTE rollout. $199.99 on a two-year contract nets you a device, while you can snag one for $549.99 sans any strings. It's also available in stores nationwide for those who'd prefer to try before they buy, and yes, Sprint users who activate a Google Wallet account within a week of activation will receive a $10 instant credit and an additional $40 within three weeks. Just try to ignore that Galaxy S III that'll launch next month, okay? (It's not a pure Google device, anyway.)
