We just weren't satisfied with the karaoke phone, nor
the karaoke video service â€” what we really wanted was a
way to DIY our ringtones with the smooth golden magic of our own voices. Leave it to Korean provider KTF to give us the
goods in the form of a service called Magic Ziller Joy (how can you go wrong?). Users record their, um, masterpieces at
karaoke machines operated by TJ Media, a karaoke content provider, and download the results as ringtones. It sure beats
Crazy Frog... we hope.
