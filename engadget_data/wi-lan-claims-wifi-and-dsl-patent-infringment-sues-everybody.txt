 Sadly, we can't say the story of "random company decides it has patents worth milking, sues world + dog" is a new one, but it's still fun for a quick laugh. This time 'round it's Ottawa-based Wi-LAN with a bone to pick with the likes of Apple, Belkin, Best Buy, Dell, HP, Intel, Netgear, Sony and pretty much any other major electronics manufacturer or retailer -- 22 all told. Wi-LAN claims that those companies are swiping its technology related to WiFi and power consumption in DSL products, so anybody making or selling a router, modem or laptop is a target. Apparently Fujitsu struck a licensing agreement with Wi-LAN in July. Like most patent troll suits, this one's going down in Marshall, Texas.
