Remember when Twitter rolled out its way of buying stuff from within the mobile app? Well, it turns out the startup behind the micro-blogging firm's commerce function is powering Facebook's payment service, too. As Recode tells it, Stripe is the sole provider for the purchase-service and also helped with the auto-fill system for Zuckerberg's mobile payments last year. Apparently that deal ended up working out pretty well. When you impulse-buy a new watch via The Social Network, at least now you know who to blame.
