Ever-so-shortly after the IdeaPad G series was made official half a world away, the IdeaPad S family is apparently next in line for the immensely important stamp of public recognition. A smattering of the 8.9-inch netbooks were captured on video at a New York-based preview show, though we are told that the ones on display were merely "prototypes." Is it wrong that we're having a tough time getting excited about yet another underpowered, incredibly portable PC that will likely be priced a few Benjamins too high? On second thought, don't answer that -- just point your attention to the vid waiting after the jump.[Via jkkmobile]
