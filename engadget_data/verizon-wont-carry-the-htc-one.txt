 You may have noticed a conspicuous absence in the US carrier plans for the HTC One. Your eyes didn't deceive: once again, Verizon is sitting out the primary launch of an HTC flagship. Just why isn't clear. When asked, Big Red told us it doesn't comment on its device strategy; an HTC spokesperson pointed to the Droid DNA, saying that there was nothing more to announce at present. As such, it's tough to know whether or not Verizon will have another specially-built phone as a consolation prize. While it's hard to complain too vociferously when the carrier already has a 1080p HTC smartphone, those who want the device maker's latest will have to turn to one of the three other major networks in the near future.
