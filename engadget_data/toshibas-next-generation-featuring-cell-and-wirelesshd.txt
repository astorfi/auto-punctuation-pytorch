       Toshiba's presence at CES isn't limited to just LCDs due in the first half of the year. We already got wind of a few products with no definite release date. First up is the Cell B.E.-equipped Qosmio (Cell-less current model pictured) and standalone HDTV prototypes designed for video upconversion, with the usual gamut of realtime video transcoding demonstrations. Also on tap is the next generation of REGZA Link based on WirelessHD and a Direct Methanol Fuel Cell for mobiles. Sounds like things could pretty interesting in Toshiba-land real soon.
