A safe haven for rampant geekery -- that's what we strive to make our personal twitter stream -- and we're here to help you with that. 

In this new series, we'll cobble together our best recommendations for who you should follow on Twitter. We'll bring you lists by category, but first up, we thought we'd start with ourselves. Trust us: we're super, super interesting. Be sure to let us know your Twitter following suggestions in the comments but keep in mind: we're already hip to Ryan Seacrest's secret account.
