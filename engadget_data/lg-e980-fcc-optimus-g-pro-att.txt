 It's reported that the E980 is LG's codename for the Optimus G Pro (considering that the E970 is the Optimus G), and while we've already reviewed the global variant, it sure looks as if AT&T is setting itself up to carry the handset here in the US of A. Arriving in the FCC's database today is the item you see above, replete with LTE bands that match AT&T's profile. Assuming it's the G Pro, AT&T loyalists can get ready for a 5.5-inch, 1080p display, one of the fastest mobile processors on the planet, 2GB of RAM and a Jelly Bean-infused edition of Android. The only remaining questions? When, where, how much, and in what color.
