  After delivering its official remote app for iOS in December, Roku has quickly followed that up with a version for Android. Claiming compatibility with any Android 2.1+ device, it appears to have all the latest tweaks from the iPhone version already included, with a D-Pad and shortcuts to popular apps. Users can also do the same basic functions like add / remove / rate channels, control playback, and control multiple Rokus. Hit the Android Market at the link below to snag the free app for yourself or head over to Roku's blog to let it know if this is truly better than the numerous unofficial apps already available.
