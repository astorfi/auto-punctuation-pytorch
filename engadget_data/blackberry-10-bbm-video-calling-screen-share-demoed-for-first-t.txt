 We'd had some indication that it was on tap, but RIM BlackBerry has today demonstrated BBM video calling in BB10 for the first time, as well as a new screen sharing feature. The video calling feature looks to be as straightforward as you'd expect, while the appropriately-named Screen Share will let you share a mirror of what's on your screen with the person you're chatting with -- it apparently won't let you hand over control of your device to them, though. Details on both features remain a bit light beyond that, but we'll hopefully have some hands-on time with them in the near future.
