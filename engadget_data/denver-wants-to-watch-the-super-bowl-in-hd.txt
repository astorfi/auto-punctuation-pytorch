 Rhode Islandisn't the only place in America that isdesperate to watch the Super Bowl in HD. Denver's Channel7 is putting up a temporary antenna on top of the tallest building in the city. All we can picture is some dudeclimbing the building with a coat hanger so his buddies can watch the game in HD. Funny picture.We have hadnumerous comments over the last few months that cited Denver's poor ABC over-the-air signal. The station indicated thatthis tower should help with that signal. In case you were wondering why a large market like Denver is waiting to put upa ATSC tower, you can blame somelocal residents. According to CARE, Canyon Area Residents for theEnvironment, they're concerned about an unsightly antenna and the "dangerous" broadcast frequencies itemits.
