After an excruciatingly painful wait for it to slide from concept to production, it was largely met with praise from the industry. Of course, smaller rivals have since emerged, leaving early adopters with an expensive piece of larger-than-necessary kit. Still, we're anxious to hear if you MFT believers that jumped at the chance to own a GH1 are still satisfied with your decision. Is the image quality where it should be? Are the controls implemented well? Do you have to keep stealing it back from your lady friend? Rip it or praise it, but whatever you do, do it in comments below.
