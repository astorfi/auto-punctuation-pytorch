 We already know a lot about the Surface tablet line's birthing process. However, Microsoft has only really been comfortable with showing the finished product -- until today. The company's Panos Panay just gave The Verge a peek at some of the earliest prototypes and design decisions, some of which break from the officially rehearsed story. Microsoft had considered multiple PC form factors before settling on Surface, Panay says, and the tablets didn't always have that sharp-angled design: the firm tried curved backs before deciding that the flat surfaces were more reassuring in users' hands. The concept of a keyboard cover appeared relatively soon into the design process, however, and it was mostly a matter of evolution as the all-important peripheral slimmed down and fleshed out. As for the future? While we weren't expecting to hear very differently, Panay confirms that Microsoft is working on multiple future generations of Surface products. At least for now, this isn't a one-off experiment.
