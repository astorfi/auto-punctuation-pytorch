That's beyond some of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns yet, including Double Fine's $3.3 million for the Broken Age adventure game, $1.2 million for Massive Chalice, and the close to $2.3 million pulled in by Cryptozoic Entertainment's Hex.

That $3.8 million figure is just counting Kickstarter donations, though. With additional pledges through Paypal, which Comcept says make up $186,380, the final amount is $4,031,550.

Mighty No. 9 is perhaps best described as Inafune's spiritual successor to the Mega Man series. It's a retro-inspired action-platformer starring a robot boy named Beck who must battle a series of robot bosses infected with a mysterious virus. The game is planned for launch sometime in the spring of 2015 for Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, PS Vita, 3DS,Wii U, Mac, Linux and PC.
