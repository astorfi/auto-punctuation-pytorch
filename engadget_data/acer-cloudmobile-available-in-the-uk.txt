 Acer's sleek CloudMobile smartphone was slated to launch on September 5th in the United Kingdom, but unexpected delays caused the handset to be MIA for nearly a month. Today, however, the first-class, 4.3-inch device looks to finally be ready for UK prime time -- and, unlike in some cases, here it's still running Android behind that 720p, IPS display and the 1.5GHz, dual-core CPU. The Acer CloudMobile's priced at Â£290 (about $470) SIM-free, and retailers such as the one linked below appear to be taking orders as we speak. Better late than never, right?
