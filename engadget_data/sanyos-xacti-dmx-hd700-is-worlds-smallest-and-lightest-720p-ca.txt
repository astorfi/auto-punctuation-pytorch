On sale starting October 19th, the "world's smallest and lightest 720p" camcorder records MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 video and 7.1 megapixel stills to SD/SDHC cards. It's also loaded with the ability to track up to 12-faces, a 2.7-inch LCD, and ISO 3200 sensitivity. Expect to drop an estimated Â¥70,000 (about $609) or so for the privilege.
