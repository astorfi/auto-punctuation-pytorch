We got our hands on some pics of HP's upcoming
hw6700 series iPaq smartphones, courtesy of Pocket
PC Thoughts, and they seem to jibe with the specs that were
leaked a few weeks back. A quick recap for the uninitiated: HP announced (and then waited on) and finally released
a much-hyped smartphone model earlier this year, the
iPaq hw6510/15 (the former excludes a camera). As
with so many other full-featured devices, these phones were being touted as "Treo-killers" due to their impressive spec
sheet that included a 312 MHz processor, 1.3 megapixel cam, two media card slots (miniSD and SDIO), Bluetooth, and
(arguably the biggest draw) built-in GPS with TomTom software. Unfortunately for the hoard of anticipatory consumers,
the 6500 series got knocked in early reviews for its
non-standard 240 x 240 display (which turned out to be incompatible with some PocketPC software), lack of built-in
WiFi, outdated OS, and buggy keyboard. Fast forward to
the present, where HP is trying to address some of these complaints by way of the 6700 series (6710/15), mainly by
adding WiFi (but subtracting the SDIO slot), more ROM, and Windows Mobile 5.0. Seems like screen orientation is still
going to be an issue, but with all these goodies, we may be able to overlook that.
