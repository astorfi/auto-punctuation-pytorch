Of course, this could just mean a computer built to PC Gaming Alliance specs -- Acer is on the PCGA's board -- but Acer's James T. Wong did make comparisons to Nintendo and Microsoft's offerings, calling them closed and proprietary systems. With a history of console prices subsidized by game sales, it's hard to imagine an "open" platform being able to compete in that space -- and even harder to imagine a company like Acer getting that kind of traction with the consumer -- but even if it is just a PCGA spec machine, we don't think it could come soon enough for the struggling PC gaming market.[Via GameStar; thanks Akshay]
