  You've come a long way, Big Red. For a network that launched a little over a year ago, VZW's LTE service is about to hit a high water mark, blanketing 203 markets come tomorrow's planned expansion to an additional seven territories. But the nation's top wireless dog isn't taking this milestone as a moment of respite; the carrier's aiming to double its current footprint by end-of-year 2012, boosting its tally to a potential 400-plus areas. As for the grand honor of being the 200th to come under the operator's 4G breadth, well, that distinction goes to a little town by the name of Dothan, Alabama. Sadly for those local folks, no festivities, fireworks or even service discounts are planned. Check out the PR after the break for the full list of cities joining the 700MHz brigade.
