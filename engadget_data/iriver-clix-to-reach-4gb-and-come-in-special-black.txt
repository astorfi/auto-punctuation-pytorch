 Now normally when some random Joe tosses up idle rumors or speculation about high-profile products, we would just as soon hit the delete key without a second thought. But when Sean Alexander, a group product manager at Microsoft, blogs a rumor about the iRiver Clix, we may not necessarily sit up and take notice per se -- but we'll at least glance in his general direction, given that those two companies are, like, totally BFF. Alexander writes that iRiver America is "close to announcing a special Black, 4GB version" of its portable media player. Of course, Alexander may be totally pwning us with this line, but because the Clix is already black (no idea what "special Black" means), and that a 4GB version seems within the realm of possibility, we'll give him the benefit of the doubt.
