Toyota claims they're hitting 65 mpg on average, 10 mpg higher than the brand new 2010 Prius "regular," and credit that fancy new lithium ion battery, which lets the car store up a lot more energy than an average hybrid. They also claim that this didn't involve any special hypermiling techniques, the drivers were instructed to drive like any other vehicle.
