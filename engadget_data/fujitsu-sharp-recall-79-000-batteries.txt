 Well it appears that we haven't heard the last from Fujitsu concerning battery recalls. Today the company announced that it will take back 51,000 Sony-made batteries in addition to the 287,000 that it announced last week. As if that weren't enough, Sharp, who until now has been an innocent bystander to this whole affair, said that it too would be joining the party that Dell, Apple, Lenovo / IBM, Panasonic, Toshiba, Hitachi and especially Sony wished had never even started. Reuters reports that Sharp will be recalling 28,000 of its laptop batteries, bringing today's sub-total to 79,000 and the grand total of recalled Sony batteries to over 7.7 million. We're pretty sure that Acer and HP are praying that they don't have to join in on the fun too.
