 Toshiba promised that a fix for its Thrive tablet's pesky resume-from-sleep mode issue was coming this week, and the company's now let us know that the remedy has indeed rolled out today. Thrive owners can download the update simply by opening up the Toshiba Service Station app on the tablet -- if only all sleep problems were cured so easily. As mentioned earlier, the update also apparently enhances the "multimedia playback capabilities of the device," although it's still not clear exactly what those enhancements entail.
