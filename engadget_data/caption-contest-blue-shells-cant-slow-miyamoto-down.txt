There's been plenty of confusion regarding what his new duties at the company will entail, but this image makes it pretty clear. All hail Nintendo's new shopping mall test driver.

Tim: "I'm developing a new power-up. It's called Golden Parachute."
Richard Lai: "I once gave Kaz's ex a ride on this."
Myriam: "I guess the shrink ray finally works."
James: "The new Hotel Lobby level proved a success"
Billy: "What? At least it's a hybrid."
Mat: Miyamoto looks forward to exhibiting at next year's Tokyo Motor Show.
Brian: "Miyamoto had an important message to impart on the youth of today: do enough magic mushrooms, and you're going to end up driving your car through a mall food court."
Sean: A clean shave and a suit jacket revealed far more than Mario had ever intended. "Well," he thought, "at least I can still keep the 'M' logo."
Jon: "In movie news: Photos from the 'lost camera' sequence in the upcoming The Hangover III started surfacing today..."
Darren: "You should see what happens when I get Star Power."
