	Alongside the wireless goodness, and new Snapdragons, Qualcomm's pulled out a new Mirasol e-reader. Manufactured by Hanvon, we're promised that 90 percent of content will be in color, and perhaps more notably, it'll be able to juggle both text and video. The e-reader is destined for China, with 150,000 titles and over 100 newspapers to keep our Sino friends in wordage for a while. No word just yet on pricing and launch dates.
