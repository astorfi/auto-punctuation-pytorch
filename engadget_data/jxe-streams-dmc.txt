Devil May Cry, in addition to sounding like a scrubbed Pablo Neruda poem, was an evolutionary leap from the clunky 3D action games of the '90s when it hit the PS2 back in 2001. Capcom's game delivered a heady blend of The Evil Dead and anime flash, while redefining how free-flowing action felt in a video game. Oh, and it looked cool as hell. When it was announced that 2013's DmC: Devil May Cry would both reboot the series and come from the drastically different creative culture of the UK rather than Japan, fans balked. How could it possibly live up to the legacy? Now DmC is getting another shot with a PS4 and Xbox One definitive edition which we're playing on JXE Streams.



Starting at 3PM ET on Engadget.com/gaming, Twitch.tv/Joystiq, and right here in this post, we're playing a solid two hours of DmC: Devil May Cry Definitive Edition on PlayStation 4. Dig on the improved visuals, faster speed, and the wholly bad ass brawling and platforming that made the game great the first time around. Most of the JXE Streams crew will be hanging out as well so come by and ask questions!

Enjoy the streams? Follow us on Twitch to know whenever we go live and bookmark Engadget.com/gaming to check out our upcoming schedule.
