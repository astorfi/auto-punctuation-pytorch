That word apparently comes from a leaked presentation from the company which, unfortunately, doesn't include all the details we'd like, but does at least reveal a few tantalizing bits of information. As Notebook Review reports, the device is based on ATI XGP technology, which supposedly provides a 4.7X boost in graphics performance over a standard Fujitsu AMILO laptop (it's not clear if they're talking about integrated graphics or not), or a score of about 8,000 in 3DMark06 benchmarks. What's more, the device will also apparently let you connect up to three external displays to your laptop, with both DVI-D and HDMI ports provided. Of course, there's no word on pricing or availability, which could lead one to suspect that this is yet another device we'll still be hearing about a year from now -- if you're the cynical type, that is.[Thanks, Master_P]
