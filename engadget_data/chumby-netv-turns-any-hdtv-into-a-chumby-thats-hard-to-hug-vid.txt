It's developing the NeTV, turning any TV (geddit?) into a giant, unhuggable Chumby that connects in-line between source and TV, overlaying the interface on top of your picture. It ships with a seven button remote, but most people should consider using their Android phones to get the most out of the on-board WebKit browser, seamless photo sharing and notifications that put your SMS messages and emails onto the big screen. Developers are gonna get their mitts on the device later this month, but you can catch a sneak peek after the break
