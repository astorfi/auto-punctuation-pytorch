 For the second timein as many days, Intel has come up with a proposal to challenge the One Laptop Per Child project, this time offering up a plan for whatthe company calls the "Community PC." Unlike the $400 Edu-Wise mini-laptop Intel showedoff in Brazil yesterday (pictured), the Community PC is being designed to target the specific needs of a developingregion, in this case rural India. The new platform would be ruggedized, would be able to withstand extremetemperatures, and would be able to function using alternative energy sources, such as car batteries (though not,apparently, a hand crank). According to reports, Intel will work with local manufacturers in India, such as Wipro andHCL, the latter of which says that the first versions could be available within 30 days. The Community PC is expectedto sell for about $550. The relatively high price is expected to be mitigated by plans to provide the computers inpublic-access kiosks, rather than as individually owned units, allowing entire communities to contribute to thepurchase price.
