Palm just announced that a PDK (plugin developer kit) would be loosed at the Game Developers Conference in March, and that'll enable coders to get their own games onto webOS. In the meanwhile (meaning today), Palm users will be able to sink their teeth into Need for Speed and and Sims 3 (among other titles) thanks to a partnership with EA Mobile. We're told that "lots" of games will be available in the App Catalog starting today, and the demo shown during the press event was remarkably lag-free. Another neat bit is the ability for games to integrate seamlessly in webOS, so any new texts you receive can be spotted while the game is playing, and if you switch cards to respond, the game just pauses until you return.

Update: The official release is out, and we're told that titles from EA, Gameloft, Glu Mobile and Laminar Research are available to users today. Head on past the break for a more thorough look.
