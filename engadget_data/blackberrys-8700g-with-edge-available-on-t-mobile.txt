 It was bound tohappen sooner or later, and now the Blackberry 8700 smartphone isfinally available to push email-loving members of the T-Mob, as the 8700g. As far as the features go, well, you shouldall know them quite well by now, as Cingular has had this modelsince late last year: quad-band GSM with EDGE data, a 312MHz Intel processor, QVGA color display, Java, andBluetooth 2.0, plus the standard suite of RIM-supplied applications. Getting your Crackberry fix from the big"T" will cost you $300 with a contract (after $100 in rebates).[Thanks, Phil G]
