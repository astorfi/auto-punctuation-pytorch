We also know that HTC is throwing developers some neat API tools, so it's no stretch to imagine that the two projects might one day play nice together. Sure enough, a developer API is on its way -- good news for music loving app makers eager to hook into the tune-enhancing functionality. HTC told us the tools will "allow third-party developers to harness the potential of Beats Audio and bring that top-notch audio experience to their own apps," although with no release date, it's still out of ear-shot for the time being. That said, the timing might be perfect given that Google's download store just went official. While we're looking forward to hearing how those clever coders will make use of the tools, and exactly what goodies HTC is offering, we're hoping at least some ideas won't be given the Beats factor.
