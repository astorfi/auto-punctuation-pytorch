Granted, $2,700 is still a pretty steep price to pay, but if you've already bit the hi-fi bullet and picked up Bang & Olufsen's satellite dish-inspired BeoPlay A9, you'll probably be happy to learn that the speaker just got Spotify Connect. If you're a premium subscriber to the streaming service (more money, we know), you can hit play on the speaker to stream your music from the cloud, the minute you get home. You can control the music from your mobile device, but you don't have to worry about pairing it with the speaker. Hey, no one ever said convenience was cheap.
