AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon have all pledged to PCMag that they'll support WP8, with those first two publicly promising to have devices by the end of the year. None of them is a big stretch, even Verizon -- but it's good to know that the HTC Trophy is still on track to get a successor. Other carriers aren't quite so enthusiastic. Sprint prefers to keep things a mystery and will only say that it won't comment on unannounced products, while Cricket and MetroPCS won't budge from their fence-sitting. As such, this year's American release appears to be a repeat of years past, just with a possible dash of Nokia.
