This 1080p SXRD two-fer offers up 24p True Cinema technology and the BRAVIA Engine video signal processing engine. As for the VPL-VW70, it checks in with a 60,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio and 800 ANSI lumens; the VPL-HW10 offers up half the contrast ratio and 1,000 ANSI lumens for use in brighter areas. Full specifications are just after the cut, but if you're anxious for pricing: the VW70 will hit this November for a staggering $8,000, while the HW10 can be had later this month for around $3,500.
      

 

SONY INTRODUCES TWO NEW 1080p SXRD FRONT HOME THEATER PROJECTORS  DENVER, Sept. 3, 2008 (CEDIA Booth #600) – Sony Electronics today unveiled two full high-definition 1080p BRAVIA® projectors (models VPL-VW70 and VPL-HW10) offering more choices for customers looking for the ultimate home theater viewing experience.  The new 1920 x 1080 progressive Silicon X-tal Reflective Display (SXRD™) projectors feature 24p True Cinema™ technology, delivering film-like performance.  Built for the home theater enthusiast, the VPL-VW70 features 60,000:1 dynamic contrast, brightness of 800 ANSI lumens.  The model can accept an external anamorphic lens (sold separately) that, when paired with Sony's Anamorphic Zoom Mode, allows users to take full advantage of panel resolution and screen size while watching a movie with native aspect ratio of 2:32:1. When Anamorphic Zoom is selected through the remote, the VPL-VW70 will output a trigger signal that can be used to activate the optional lens and screen transition to maximize the theater experience with a 2.35:1 movie.  For customers looking to enter the full HD home theater at a value, Sony's VPL-HW10 model features a 30,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio, 1000 ANSI lumens for brighter room applications.  Specifically designed with the custom installation market in mind, the projectors are also equipped with a panel alignment adjustment function that aligns each red, green and blue pixel for precise images. The adjustment range is +/-1 pixel in 1/10 pixel steps. The VPL-VW70 takes it a step further with panel zone alignment allowing users to further calibrate the picture. The model also adds a unique automatic lens cover that helps protect the lens from dust. Both models feature the BRAVIA Engine™ all-digital video signal processing engine with unique algorithms for noise reduction and color enhancement to deliver sharp, vibrant images. The VPL-VW70 projector will be available in November for about $8,000, while the VPL-HW10 unit will be available in September for about $3,500. Both models will be offered direct at Sony Style® retail stores nationwide and authorized dealers around the country.
