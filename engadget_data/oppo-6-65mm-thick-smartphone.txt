Instead, what we have here is an exclusive leak that shows off a 6.65mm-thick device -- just 0.03mm thinner than the Ascend P1 S from local rival Huawei. In other words, if all goes well then Oppo will have us the world's slimmest smartphone. Details are scarce at the moment, but judging by the above picture this phone will come with a metallic bezel of some sort, along with three capacitive buttons and a three-pin contact for dock connection. Obviously, stay tuned for more deets.
