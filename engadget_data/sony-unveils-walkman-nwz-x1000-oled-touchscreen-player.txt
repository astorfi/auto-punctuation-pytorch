Front and center is a beautiful 3-inch touchscreen OLED display, which means lower power consumption and a wider color gamut than a traditional LCD, and Sony also worked in WiFi and headphone-independent noise cancellation. The player will come in 16GB and 32GB flavors. Details are otherwise scant at this moment -- we're particularly interested in the software specific and price, which we're guessing Sony will be announcing at its press conference this evening -- but let's just say that faux granite shell is a definite mark in the "please, yes" category.[Via OLED-Display]
