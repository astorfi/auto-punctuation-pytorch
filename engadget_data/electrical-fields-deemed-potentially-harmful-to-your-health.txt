 We've already heard that electricity could cause all sorts of fatal side effects, and it's all but conclusive that stray WiFi can warp your brain, but how come magnetic signals are helping people get their lives back together? If you haven't already guessed, here we have yet another alarmist story which claims that "electrical fields generated by everyday electrical equipment may cause an increased risk of respiratory diseases and infection." The study, published by Imperial scientists, strongly suggests that these toxic fields (some created by computers, no less) can attract airborne particles thanks to stray electrostatic charges, and can then lead to excess amounts of potentially unwholesome deposits making their way into one's lungs. Of course, unless these masterminds wrote their research up via pencil and paper while dressed in ESD suits, we'd say they're just as exposed as the rest of us.
