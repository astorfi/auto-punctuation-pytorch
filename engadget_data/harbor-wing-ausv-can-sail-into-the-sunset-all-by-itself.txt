Among other things, it employs a specially-designed "WingSail" that can rotate a full 360 degrees to let the vessel maneuver efficiently upwind or downwind, and it uses a custom-made guidance system that can relay vital navigational and situational data to a "semi-portable" command station, which can apparently also be used to pilot the vessel in a pinch. Be sure to head on past the break for an interview with Harbor Wing's Ken Childress courtesy of Engineering TV, which also includes a glimpse of the current prototype in action.[Via Engineering TV]
