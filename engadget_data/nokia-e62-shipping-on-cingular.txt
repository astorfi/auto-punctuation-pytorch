Besides the lack of 802.11, the E62 gives up the E61's UMTS 2100 support, but Cingular's guessing its average buyer isn't going to mind (seeing how we don't do UMTS 2100 in these parts). With the QWERTY market heating up in the next few months, it's unclear whether Nokia and Cingular ultimately have a winner here, but any way you look at it, it's a win for American S60 proponents who generally get pretty well starved for handsets of any form factor.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
