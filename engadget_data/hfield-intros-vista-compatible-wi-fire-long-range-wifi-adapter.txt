What's more, the Wi-Fire is also now considerably cheaper than it was when it was first released last year, with it now setting you back just $79. It also now comes with some updated software for both XP and Vista, but otherwise appears to be the same 3 x 4 inch device as before, including support for 802.11b/g networks only and, of course, that aforementioned 1,000 foot range.
