And it's not just any flavor of Google's OS -- oh no, this is the frosting-covered goodness of Cupcake. Sadly the demonstration is nothing more than showing the desktop with that big, iconic clock, but it's proof enough that Round Rock's finest are working on something special. Also shown are 10v's running standard Ubuntu and the Netbook Remix, but they don't taste nearly as good. Video after the break.[Via Pocket-lint]
