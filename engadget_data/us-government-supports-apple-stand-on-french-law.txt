 In what's shaping up to be the biggestFranco-American battle since US lawmakers renamed their favorite side dish "Freedom Fries," the US governmenthas now declared its support for Apple in the company's dispute with France over DRM interoperability. US Secretary ofCommerce Carlos Gutierrez, questioned about the case on CNBC, declaredthat he would "compliment [Apple] because we need for companies to alsostand up for their intellectual property rights. At issue is a draft law that wouldrequire Apple and other companies to open up their DRM to competitors or allow consumers to do so on their own, so thatmusic purchased in an online music store could be played in any manufacturer's digital audio player. Earlier this week, Apple referred tothe French bill as part of a "state-sponsored culture of piracy." While Guiterrez didn't say whetherthe US government would do anything specific on Apple's behalf, he did say that it's a good policy to "have thegovernment work with other governments." We assume this will continue to escalate, and it'll only be a matter ofdays before French students start burning iPods in the streets and Americans retaliate by torching Archos Gminis. Andit looks like the cafeteria in Cupertino will have to start serving iToast for breakfast.
