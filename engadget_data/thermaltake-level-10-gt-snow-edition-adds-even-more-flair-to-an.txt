The Snow Edition restores some of its gaudy flair by slathering its accents and protrusions in glossy white paint. In fact, it looks quite a lot like the version we spotted in NVIDIA's booth at Computex in May. The roughly $280 case isn't for the casual system builder, but DIYers who cherish style, silence (HotHardware called it, "easily one of the quietest full-sized ATX cases") and expandability it's a small price to pay. Or, to put it in colloquial terms, this is a bad-ass enclosure. Check out the source link for a thorough review.
