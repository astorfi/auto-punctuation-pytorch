We wouldn't call the company headed by ex-Oppo exec Pete Lau unoriginal though, as we can't claim to have seen another smartphone developed with such transparency. OnePlus has been systematically posting info about "the perfect smartphone" to its announcement forum, seemingly as it's decided upon. We still don't have any clue as to what it'll look like, other than its dimensions are smaller than those of Sony's Xperia Z1, but we do know it'll sport a 5.5-inch 1080p display on the outside, with a 2.3GHz Snapdragon 800 and 3,100mAh battery within. The company's also been working with partner CyanogenMod on "mystery tech" to optimize battery performance, and most recently, has teased an always-on voice recognition feature, while also polling suggestions on what phrase should trigger it. Probably the most interesting number thus far is the One's sub-$400 price tag, however, and although there's much left to learn about the device, we're most certainly listening.
