Last we heard, the platform was still on track for a summer release, and at least in our hemisphere, April ain't summer. For what it's worth, Taiwan Economic News is reporting that Acer is looking to launch 11.6-, 13-, 14- and 15-inch machines with CULV processors within, and if rumors prove true, at least some of 'em will make their debut next month. Don't bet the farm, but you're probably safe to pencil it in.[Via NotebookReview]
