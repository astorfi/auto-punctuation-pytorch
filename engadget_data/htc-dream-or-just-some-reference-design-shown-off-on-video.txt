From what little we can make out, we've got to say that it's not the sexiest thing we've ever seen -- and the Dream has been so built up in our minds at this point that we're expecting to have our socks knocked off hard by the time it's officially unveiled. The silver lining here might be that the phone in the video bears an uncanny resemblance to a "reference design" made by "a partner" of Google's that was demonstrated by none other than Google's own Andy Rubin back in February of this year. Of course, that reference design could be getting refined and retooled to end up becoming the HTC's inaugural Android effort anyway, but we're hoping and guessing that the real Dream's going to be at least a little more dreamy than this.[Via Boy Genius Report]
