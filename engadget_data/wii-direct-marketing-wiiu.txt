The difference between the Wii and Wii U are readily apparent to most contemporary gamers, but some consumers are having trouble telling them apart. "Some have the misunderstanding that the Wii U is just Wii with a pad for games," Nintendo president Satoru Iwata told Investors last week, "others even consider Wii U GamePad as a peripheral device connectable to Wii." Nintendo is eager to clear up the confusion, of course, and pushed a notification to internet connected Wii consoles stating it plainly. "Wii U is the all-new home console from Nintendo. It's not just an upgrade -- it's an entirely new system that will change the way you and your family experience games and entertainment." The note also assures readers that their Wii accessories will work on the new console, and gives a brief run down of the console's selling points: the Wii U GamePad, backwards compatibility and HD graphics. The humble message probably isn't enough to repair the damage done by product's nearly identical names, but it's definitely a step in the right direction. Check out the full statement after the break.
