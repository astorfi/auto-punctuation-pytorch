Unfortunately for our childish hopes, Ultra Motors' A2B electric bike actually won't be used in the next X-Games, but it may just get you to and from your downtown apartment. This comparatively small electric bike features a full suspension setup, an oversized seat and a battery arrangement that provides 20 miles of travel without a touch of the pedal. Also of note, riders can reach speeds of up to 20mph (or 50mph if traveling downhill, so we hear), and an optional secondary battery can double the aforesaid distance capability. Look for this one to hit authorized dealers next month for a presumably lofty amount of scratch.[Via OhGizmo]Update: And we've got a price of $2,599. $2,675 with pegs, a splash guard and a few random stickers.
