At first glance, you may assume that you're about to discover what's likely the planet's first cellular telephone to run a full-fledged version of Windows XP. Sadly, we've got to slot the device shown above squarely into the MID category -- GSM support be darned. Still, we can't help but applaud the engineering efforts; after all, this thing somehow packs an AMD CPU, 1GB of RAM, a 64GB SSD, 4.8-inch 800 x 480 touchpanel, WiFi, various cell radios, a 1.3 megapixel camera and a battery good for five solid hours of use into a device barely larger than the average, yawn-inducing MID found in every last corner of Computex. In fact, it's so impressive that we're beginning to question its authenticity as a real, working product. Much like the number of licks to the center of a Tootsie Pop, the world may never know.
