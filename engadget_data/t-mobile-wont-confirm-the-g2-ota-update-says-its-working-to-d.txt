In a statement issued to Phone Scoop, T-Mobile said that these features "are not currently supported" on the handset, although T-Mobile thankfully added that it "knows these features are important to consumers and we're working to deliver them to G2 users in the future." It's hard to tell if that means an update is just minutes away from widespread distribution, or if we've still got weeks or months to wait for these features. Familiar story?
