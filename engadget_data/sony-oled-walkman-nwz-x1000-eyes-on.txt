So we can't get an actual hands-on with the Walkman, but we don't need to touch it to know that the OLED is seriously gorgeous and the UI looks super crisp. Sony's reluctance to pull this out of its casing seems to show the player's not ready for primetime, but we'll keep trying to get something a bit more gratifying.Update: Engadget Spanish got a video of the device in action, so check after the jump if you wanna see more and learn a little espa√±ol.
