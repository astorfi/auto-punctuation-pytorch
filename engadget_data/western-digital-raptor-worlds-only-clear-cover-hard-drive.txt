WD took their new enterprise class SATA Raptor which wasalready throwin' down 150GB with 16MB cache and slapped on a transparent lens capable of withstanding the heat andpressure generated from the 10,000 RPM platter spin while still coping with electrostatic discharge. Check out theactuator arm in the vid kicking out that 4.6-milisecond average seektime. The "world's only clear-cover hard drive" is available now for pre-order at $350 -- a mere $50 premiumto feed your moddin' jones.
