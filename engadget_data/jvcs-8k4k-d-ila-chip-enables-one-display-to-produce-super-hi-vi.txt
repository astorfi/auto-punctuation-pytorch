Just under a year after the firm unveiled its 4K2K D-ILA chip, it's now trumpeting the almighty 1.75-inch 8K4K, which touts the "world's highest 35-megapixel pixel count," which is roughly equal to 17x full HD resolution. Not impressive enough for you? It also gives whatever projector it's in the ability to display Super Hi-Vision imagery all by its lonesome. Sadly, JVC left us hanging when it came to finding out when this gem would be available in consumer wares, but there's still a few trade shows left to go this year for it to make an appearance.[Via AkihabaraNews]
