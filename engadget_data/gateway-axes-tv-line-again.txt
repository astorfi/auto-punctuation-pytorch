They're in! They're out! They're in again! Now they're
out again! That's right, Gateway is once more closing up shop on some of their consumer electronics—their
plasma and LCD TV business, in this case—in
order to focus on their PC business. Is it just us, or is this starting to sound kind of like a on-again off-again
relationship? Shame too, they were so good for one another.
