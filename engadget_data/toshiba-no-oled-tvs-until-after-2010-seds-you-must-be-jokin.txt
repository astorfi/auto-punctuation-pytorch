While Tosh will continue its efforts to commercialize small OLEDs for cellphones and such, they have shelved plans for that 30-inch OLED TV due to manufacturing costs. At least through 2010 when the effort might again, become viable. Oh, and they commented on their SED tech too. You remember, the 100,000:1 sets they told us would hit the market in late 2007. No change, no SEDs on the horizon. Ouch, was it something we said? [Via Impress]
