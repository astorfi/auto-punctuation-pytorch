 C'mon, don't act so shocked -- you had to realize that these record sales of NAND-based iPhones and iPods were using up some serious flash memory, right? Turns out, Apple's two biggest hits are "expected to consume 25-percent of the global flash output," which could in turn drive up prices of said memory in the not too distant future. DRAMeXchange, a market research company out of Taiwan that tracks the memory industry, further suggested that it could take "about two to three quarters before manufacturers can raise their chip yield rates to a higher level," which doesn't bode well for anyone hoping to see a price cut on any of Apple's handhelds due to increased volume purchasing in the memory department.[Via CNET]
