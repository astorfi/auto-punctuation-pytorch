 Last weheard, things degraded from gung-ho to so-sofor Samsung on the prospect of going in on a dual-mode device that'd bridge the gapbetween HD DVD and Blu-ray for the consumer. But it looks like guarded has now turned toclosed-until-further-notice according to a SVP of Marketing at Samsung North America, Peter Weedfald. We had no ideathere were licensing agreements in place that prevented a dual-mode player, but apparently "Until everyone agreesto check their egos at the door and help the consumer, there is nothing [Samsung] can do about a universalproduct." And thus today our final hope for a truce -- even if involuntary on the part of both warring factions --is dashed. We're not going to worry too much, however, you know how these things like to turn around every fifteenminutes, or how tech execs get "misquoted" and rescind.
