Unless someone seriously got their wires crossed, it looks like the adapter will start shipping on November 3rd, which we presume is also the date that the MSRP of the previous generation WiFi adapter will officially drop (to $80, last we heard), 'cause GameStop sure isn't going to be moving many of them at the $100 it's asking right now.[Via Joystiq]
