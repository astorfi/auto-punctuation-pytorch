 The Xbox 360 certainly isn't suffering from any shortages in the entertainment department, but that's not to say Microsoft's not willing to welcome new app additions to its growing, decade-old ecosystem. Today marks Rhapsody's turn to join the likes of Hulu, Netflix, Crackle and, most recently, WatchESPN on Redmond's Dashboard, bringing its known on-demand music streaming service to Xbox Live -- and, naturally, it'll be available at no additional cost to current Gold and Rhapsody subscribers. Rhapsody is set to arrive on Xbox Live today, but fret not if you don't see the application right away, as it may take a little while before it pops up on your console.
