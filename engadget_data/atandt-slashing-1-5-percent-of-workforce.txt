The company calls it the "next step in streamlining its operations," and will shelling out about $375 million in Q1 to make the layoffs happen. According to some dubious maths perpetrated by the Engadget staff, 1.5 percent of AT&T's workforce is about 4,635.75 humans, not a minuscule cut by a long shot. We'd certainly hate to be in Mr. 75 percent's shoes right now.
