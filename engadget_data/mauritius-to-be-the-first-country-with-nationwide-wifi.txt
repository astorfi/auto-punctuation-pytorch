Like most Americans, you've probably only heard of Mauritius if you were actively looking for a vacation spot
(actually, we were thinking of having our first Engadget getaway either there or Morocco). But the 1.2m island nation
is putting itself on the map so to speak by installing nation-wide municipal wireless Internet accessâ€”apparently
besting Taiwan to be the first. And we were all about it too, until they declared, "It is our
vision to transform Mauritius into a cyber-island." Which, as a single statement couldn't possibly turn us off any more
to the whole idea. Plus, is this even going to be free? Probably not.
