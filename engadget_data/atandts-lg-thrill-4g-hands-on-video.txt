The final device design and Android 2.2 software were not final -- so this could all change by the time it launches in the next couple months -- but it will ship with 2.2 and not the Gingerbread we're seeing so much of lately. With Sprint's launch of the EVO 3D just a couple hours ago, we're thinking 3D in handsets may not be a passing trend. The video samples seen during the demo -- which, sadly, you'll not be able to enjoy in all their three-dimensional glory -- are a pretty convincing argument for just how impressive this tech has gotten in such a short time. Enjoy the goods.
