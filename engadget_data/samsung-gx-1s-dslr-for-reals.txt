Not that there'sanything wrong with that, since the specs include a 6.1 megapixel imager, ISO levels up to 3200, 2.8 fps burst mode,2.5-inch LCD and an 18-55 Schneider D-XENON lens (of course, it's compatible with other Pentax lenses). No word onpricing yet, though the *ist DS2 goes for about $650, so we suspect a similar price in markets where this becomesavailable (which may not include the US, depending on Samsung's agreement with Pentax).
