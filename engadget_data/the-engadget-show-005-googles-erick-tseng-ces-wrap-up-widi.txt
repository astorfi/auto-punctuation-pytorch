 
Well it's been a wild couple of weeks here at Engadget. Between CES 2010 (our biggest show ever), the Nexus One launch, forthcoming Apple announcements (and loads of Apple rumors), it's unlikely we'll forget the start of our new decade anytime soon. Still, amidst all the craziness we had time to sit down for another Engadget Show -- and what a show it was. Grab a loved one and a tasty beverage of your choosing and settle in to watch our in-depth interview with Erick Tseng, a wrap-up of all things CES, plus fascinating demos of Intel's new Wireless Display, Parrot's crazy AR.Drone, the Plastic Logic QUE, Alienware's M11X, and so much more. Tune in now -- you'll kick yourself if you miss this.
