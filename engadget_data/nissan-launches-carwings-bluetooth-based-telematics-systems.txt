Nissan recently launched a Bluetooth-based telematics system for some of their cars, offering enhanced GPS and
entertainment features and 24 hour telephone operator assistance.  Nothing really special there, but the Bluetooth
connectivity means you'll be able to wirelessly sync up your Bluetooth-enabled cellphone with the unit, transferring
downloaded applications and personal information, and even using the phone's handsfree capability to control the
unit.  The system, dubbed "Carwings", is currently available in Nissan's Fuga luxury sedan, the Lafesta minivan,
the Tiida Latio compact sedan and the Tiida and Note compact hatchbacks.  No word yet on how much of a premium
it'll add on to the sticker price.
