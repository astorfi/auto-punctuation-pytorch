  A pretty light week in HD news, but the three of us put our heads together and with a little help from our Ustream chatroom, managed to talk for an hour. There's definitely great gear for HT enthusiasts, including Panasonic's new V10 NeoPDP panels and Paradigm's SUB 25 monster subwoofer; either (or both!) of which would be a great way to kick off TV's post-analog broadcast era this weekend. If the world doesn't explode into ones and zeros on Friday, we'll be back next week with more news.   Get the podcast  [iTunes] Subscribe to the Podcast directly in iTunes (MP3).
