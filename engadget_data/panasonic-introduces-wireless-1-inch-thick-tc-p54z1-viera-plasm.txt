 
Here at the Panasonic press conference at CES 2009, the company finally woke us up with a stunningly thin 1-inch thick plasma: the all new Z1, or the TC-P54Z1 VIERA, in particular. Little is being said about the panel for now, though we are told that it'll be wireless (via an undisclosed standard) right out of the box. In related news, we're also told that VIERA Cast-enabled sets will soon be able to suck down Amazon on Demand content, so it's good to see Panny keeping up with the Jones family in that regard as well.
