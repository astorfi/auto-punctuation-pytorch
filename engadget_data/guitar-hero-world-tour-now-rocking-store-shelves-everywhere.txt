Truth be told, the game (and requisite instruments) was sitting on a-many of store shelves yesterday, but there's nothing like a formal announcement to really push you to take a few hours from work and rock out this evening. There's a variety of bundles out there ranging from the game alone ($49.99 to $59.99), the game and a guitar ($89.99 to $99.99) and the full-on band kit ($179.99 to $189.99), so make sure you choose wisely when heading out to drop some dough.
