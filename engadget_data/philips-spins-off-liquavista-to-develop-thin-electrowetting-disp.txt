NewVenture Partners has joined with the Dutch electronics giant to spin off several companies based on technology firstdeveloped by Philips Research, with the first collaboration, Liquavista, being announced today. Based on a thin-displaytechnology called Electrowetting, Liquavista will attempt to integrate its products into DAPs, cellphones, watches, andother portable devices where high brightness and rapid refresh rates are valued (which is like, all of them).Electrowetting supposedly provides better brightness and response time than competing reflective display technologieswhile using essentially the same manufacturing techniques, and according to a handy comparison chart on MobileRead, isjust about the best thing ever. Skeptics will be able to peep the displays for themselves in early June, however, whenLiquavista will present some prototypes at the Society for Information Display's 2006 exhibition in San Francisco.[Warning: PDF link][Via MobileRead]
