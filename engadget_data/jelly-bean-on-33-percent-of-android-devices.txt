Google's pushed out its latest survey of the Android landscape, and Jelly Bean is finally creeping up on Gingerbread for the crown. While Gingerbread accounts for 36.5 percent of active devices sporting Mountain View's OS, versions 4.1 and 4.2 stand just behind with a total of 33 percent, up 4.6 percent since last month. Ice Cream Sandwich is helping itself to 25.6 percent of the statistic pie, while Froyo, Eclair and Donut each trail behind with less than five percent combined. Now that Jelly Bean is within a 3.5 percent striking distance of the top spot, this may be the last time we see Gingerbread in the lead.
