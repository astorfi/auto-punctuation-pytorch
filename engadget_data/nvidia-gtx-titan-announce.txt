 NVIDIA's GTX Titan is rumor no more, as the American computer hardware company unveiled the superpowerful graphics card this morning. With 2,688 CUDA cores, 6GB of GDDR5 RAM, and 7.1 billion transistors packed into the 10.5-inch frame, Titan's capable of pushing 4,500 Gigaflops of raw power -- NVIDIA's pitching Titan as the means to "power the world's first gaming supercomputers." The company even showed off the Titan in its mightiest form, bootstrapped to two others running together (three-way SLI), which powers graphics showcase Crysis 3 running at its highest settings: a whopping 5760x1080 resolution across three monitors. Of course, a setup like that would cost you quite a pretty penny; just one GTX Titan costs $1,000, not to mention three (nor all the other hardware required to support it).

 Should you prefer your gaming PCs to not be of the neon-lit, triple GPU, above-$10,000 variety, NVIDIA was also showing off the Titan in a Falcon Northwest boutique PC. The company's working with a variety of boutique PC makers to incorporate the Titan (see: Maingear), making NVIDIA's top of the line a teensy bit more accessible to your average joe.

 GTX Titan is the new top of the line for NVIDIA, effectively pushing aside the GTX 690 and setting a new benchmark for performance. Of course, with a $1,000 price tag and freedom -- nay, encouragement -- to tweak its nitty gritty settings, the Titan isn't really meant for your average anyone. The PC game-playing early adopters, however? Here's your next GPU. Hopefully you've got a big, empty space in your rig, as you'll need it. The GTX Titan arrives on February 25th for $999.
