For starters, the device is bound to be a delight to those who love the feel of physical QWERTY keys, with Sammy Hub also reporting that it's sporting an unpretentious QVGA, 320 x 240 screen and a bearable 850MHz processor -- all while being powered by a Samsung flavor of Ice Cream Sandwich. As is usually the case with these early appearances, though, mum's the word on when this GT-B5330 will make its official debut. That said, something tells us this won't be the last time we'll be seeing this guy show off its typing attributes.
