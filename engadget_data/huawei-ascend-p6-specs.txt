We've seen enough images of the Huawei Ascend P6 to know that the thing exists, but the speculation on its specs hasn't been confirmed by any stretch. Smartphone rumormeister @evleaks has a few specs to throw our way: the P6 will supposedly feature a 4.7-inch 720p display, a remarkably thin 6.18mm profile, 1.5GHz quad-core (likely in-house) processor and Emotion UI (seen above). Additionally, we're now expecting to see an 8MP BSI rear camera with a 4cm macro, accompanied by an impressive 5MP front-facing cam with a feature called Face Enhance. We're just a week away from having official confirmation of all these specs, but this is just enough to tie you over until then -- or, until the next leak appears online, at the very least.
