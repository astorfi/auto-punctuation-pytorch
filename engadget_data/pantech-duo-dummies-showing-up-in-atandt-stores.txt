We've caught wind that retail locations are starting to stock up on Pantech Duo dummies, suggesting that they'll be prepping for launch any day now. Between this, the Q9 Global, the Blackjack II, the Tilt, and the 5700, it looks like anyone complaining about a lack of Windows Mobile devices on AT&T by the end of the year... well, needs to find a real issue.[Thanks, Kal-El]
