 
It may not be reaching consumers until sometime this Fall, but Logitech's Google TV companion box, the Revue, has recently landed in a few important hands: the FCC's. Not much in the way of surprises with this one, but we do at least get a glimpse of the device's internals (check out a shot after the break), and the mystery of the FCC label has been solved at last. Of course, if it's information and excitement you're after, you can always check out our hands-on from Google IO.
