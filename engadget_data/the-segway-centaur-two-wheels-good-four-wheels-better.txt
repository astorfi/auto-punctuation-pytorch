The purists will argue that it defeats the whole purpose, but you gotta admit there's a certain inevitability to the
Centaur, a four-wheeled ATV which uses all the same gyroscopic balancing techno-stuff found in the original Segway HT
(and can even balance on its rear wheels), but goes way faster and is apparently aimed at that very small subset of
geeks who are also into off-roading. Just a prototype for the moment, but the Centaur could be weirding out mountain
bikers before the end of next year.
