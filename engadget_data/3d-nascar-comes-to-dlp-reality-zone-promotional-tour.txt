 Wanna peep the future of HDTV at a NASCAR race? Just show up at the Texas Motor Speedway in April and you'll be able to check out 3D HDTV footage filmed at the NASCAR Busch Series' Stater Brothers 300 at the California Speedway in Fontana. 2D is soooo 2006 and while we wish this new 3D tech included those rad' blue and red paper glasses, we're sure that it looks just a tad better. Car racing seems like a natural fit to show off a in-your-face 3D demo so if your in the area, you might want to check it out at the DLP Reality Zone trailer - got to have a trailer if you're going to a NASCAR race.[image via robert.to]
