That said, we wouldn't put it past the company to push out an oh-so-barely different version of the Aspire One netbook that has already proven remarkably popular. macles* has it that Acer is planning to release a slightly revamped version, possibly dubbed the D250, that'll sport a new motherboard, port layout and a larger hard drive. Outside of that, everything should remain the same, which basically means that it's pulling an ASUS. Awesome.[Via PortableMonkey]
