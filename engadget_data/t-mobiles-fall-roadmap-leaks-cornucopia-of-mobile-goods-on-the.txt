So, let's dive right in as there's a lot of two-year contracted bounty to cover. Starting things off on October 19th are a trio of high-end, 42Mbps-capable 4G handsets: the HTC "Ruby" or Amaze 4G at $259, Samsung Hercules (that would be this) at $229 and the Huawei Wayne at $99 (which comes pre-loaded with Spaghetti Westerns, we presume). Following just a week later, is Samsung's Arnold tablet -- a.k.a the Galaxy Tab 10.1 -- which'll run along the carrier's faux-G and retail for $399. But the real wireless bonanza takes place on the 2nd of November, when six new phones will bow. LG's Maxx QWERTY and Maxx Touch at $129 apiece are the sole 3G-only units in the bunch, leaving the HTC Omega (better known as the Radar) at $199, LG Flip II at $149, Huawei Tallsome slate at $199 and the low-end Samsung "Ancora" to surf along at 4G speeds. Making a late appearance to this Autumn party are the last two of the bunch: Samsung's Robin (which looks to be the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus) at $299 and RIM's Dumoine QWERTY slider. That enough options for you? We thought so.
