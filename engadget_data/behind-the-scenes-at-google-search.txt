This is footage of the Quality Launch Review, a meeting that takes place every week on Thursdays. Amit Singhal assembles a room full of engineers to delve into "losses," the company term for when a search query goes awry, and turn them into "wins." This week, the team examined error-correction in searches that are over ten words long, and how best to resolve it. It may not be the most exciting thing you'll ever see, but it's a fascinating insight into the effort that begins every time you don't find what you're looking for.
