Fujitsu's FLEPia color e-reader has been available in Japan since May, but this is the first time we've got our hands on the 260K color-sportin' beauty. Rocking Windows CE, this resistive touchscreen beauty sports WiFi, Bluetooth, and an 8-inch display, and is capable of about 40 hours of continuous use, according to the manufacturer. Still no plans to ship Stateside, as far as we know, but you can pick one up next time you're in Tokyo Town for Â¥99,750 (roughly $1000).
