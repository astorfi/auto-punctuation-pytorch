The folks behind Ouya got millions of dollars, courtesy of a slew of very kind folks on Kickstarter -- and now the hard part begins: actually bringing a product to market. Thankfully, it's not wasting any time. In a note posted to its Kickstarter page, the team let it be know that it's working with NVIDIA on the project, meeting with the chipmaker on Thursday to "maximize the performance" of the Tegra 3 it'll be packing. Ouya may also help game developers get a jumpstart on the action, noting that it "might consider" a reward to let devs get early access to the raw circuit board and software.
