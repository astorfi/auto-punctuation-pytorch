For that outlay, you'll be getting a 13.3-inch screen, an LED-backlit display with 400 nits of brightness, Intel Core i5-2537M dual-core processor running at 1.4GHz, 4GB of RAM, and one super-speedy 128GB SSD. It's an intriguing proposition, as both price and specs are decidedly high-end, but the decision as to which one wins out we'll leave up to you. Hit up Samsung's site below for a list of retailers -- the Series 9 is listed for pre-order at the moment, but we doubt it'll be long before delivery trucks start rolling out with ultrathin laptop boxes in tow.
