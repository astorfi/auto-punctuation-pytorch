Motorola's CLIQ 2 and its crazy honeycomb sliding keypad just stepped into the limelight at CES and surprise, surprise looks exactly like the pic we saw a couple weeks back. This set packs a 1GHz processor, 5MP shooter, WiFi calling, a hotspot for up to 5 devices, and a 3.7-inch FWVGA (854 x 480) display. The jury's out on exactly how that keyboard is going to behave while pounding your digits against it in a messaging frenzy, but a hands-on will sort that real quick. Look for this on T-Mobile shelves on January 19th and in the galleries below right now.
