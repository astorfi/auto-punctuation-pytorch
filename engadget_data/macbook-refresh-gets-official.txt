The 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo refresh with NVIDIA GeForce 320M graphics and longer 10-hour battery life (up from 7 hours) is sitting up, nice and pretty on Apple's very own store in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Germany, and a few other sites. It's still $999 making it a better deal for the moment than the similarly spec'd 13-inch MacBook Pro listing for $1,199. Expect it to go global shortly. A few more screengrabs after the break as Apple gets its house in order.

Update: It's live for purchase in the US, as well as the US education store (starts at $950). Ships within 24 hours, too.

[Thanks, Jose and Peter]
