Well, it looks like Sony could one day make the process a whole lot easier if an actual product ever results from these prototype glasses, which combine eye-tracking technology with an outward-facing camera. That, Sony says, allows the camera to detect and record objects (or people, for that matter) that you're looking at, and even recognize and copy text that you're reading. Sony apparently isn't quite done with the idea just yet, however, and says that it also plans to add some GPS capabilities and, of course, embed the device in the frame of the glasses. Despite appearances, Sony says that should be relatively easy -- the real problem is how to handle the power supply for the glasses.
