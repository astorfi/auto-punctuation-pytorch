 Shortly after the AMC-14 launch went awry, we received confirmation that DISH Network's Spring HD rollout was still on track. Apparently things are going better than expected, as the satellite provider is getting official with HD locals in four new markets today. As we'd heard already, both Orlando and West Palm Beach, Florida have already been admitted into the HD locals club, while Austin, Texas and Flint, Michigan are joining days ahead of the scheduled April rollout. Best of all, DISH affirms that we'll be seeing lots more where this came from over the course of 2008, so if you're market hasn't been touched just yet, hang tight.
