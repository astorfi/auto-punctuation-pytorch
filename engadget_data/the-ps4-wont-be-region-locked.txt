We know the pricing, a loose holiday release schedule, and now, that the PlayStation 4 won't be locked-down according to geography. That's according to Sony Computer Entertainment's Brad Douglas, who mentioned on Twitter that the company's new console has "no region locking", hopefully freeing up the opportunities for import gaming when it arrives later this year.


Update: SCE's Shuhei Yoshida has now also confirmed the PS4's global passport.
