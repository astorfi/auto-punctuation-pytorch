What's not clear is if this is exclusive to Canada (or, less likely, exclusive to Future Shop), but it seems like we should be hearing more about it soon enough, as it's apparently set to be released on August 20th (coinciding with the launch of Brain Age 2). While those in the states are out of luck for the time being, our Canadian friends can pre-order order the bundle now (which also includes a nifty carrying case) for $159.99 Canadian (or just over $150US).[Via RedFlagDeals]
