Apple's oft-rumored streaming TV service won't be the only thing going AWOL from the Worldwide Developer Conference next week, it seems. New York Times sources say that 1 Infinite Loop has scrapped plans to unveil revamped Apple TV hardware (along with a matching remote and app development kit) at the gathering. Reportedly, the new media hub just wasn't "ready for prime time" -- it's still coming, but you'll have to wait. There's no mention of when it'll show up. Assuming the leak is accurate in the first place, though, history suggests that Apple could wait until September (when it usually starts releasing its big products for the year) to debut its next-generation set-top box.
