Rocking a 1GHz Cortex A8 processor, 512MB of RAM, a 16GB flash drive, SD card slot, three USB 2.0 ports, headphone and mic jacks, Ethernet and HDMI ports, and WiFi, this is definitely something to keep an eye out for on your next trip to the gadget markets of Shenzhen. Just remember to grab one for us, okay?
