Xact ReGo, discussed
Sirius Video, mention Howard Stern 30 times in 30
minutes, and had the Dallas Cowgirls storm the stage.The press room was packed to capacity, and the excitement at
Sirius compared to XM is stunning. Sirius definitely wants you to think they're taking over the world, and that XM
dropped the ball. Click to read on.



 We asked Mel Karmazin (top), the new CEO of Sirius radio, if Howard Stern would be leveraging their newly annoucedvideo formats (peep the video for more onthis). Mel went on and on about Howard being a talent and entrepreneur, then basically admitted that he expected Howardto leverage it.  Karmazin seems like he is still getting upto speed on the company, though, but his focus makes it clear to us that he feels XM is, well, done for. Check out thecomplete video of Mel?s press conference. Mel wenton to claim that Sirius will double in its subscriber size, and that they are growing much faster than ?the othercompany.? He also said that he thinks this will be bigger than most analysts and investors think?of course none ofthese should be looked at as forward looking statements. We know one thing for sure: 2005 is going to be huge forsatellite radio, and the war has definitely begun.
