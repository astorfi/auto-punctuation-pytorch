The Taiwanese handset manufacturer is hitting back against Cupertino using newly obtained firepower: nine patents picked up from Google last week. The patents, which began life under Palm, Motorola and Openwave Systems, were transferred to HTC on September 1st. So much for the whole sitting down and not suing thing.
