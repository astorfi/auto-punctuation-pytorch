The five-megapixel A-HD 720P High Definition Camcorder promises to record 720p video at 30fps and offers up AC / USB charging options, a 4x digital zoom, red eye reduction, component output, a 2.4-inch swivel screen, 6-measly-megabytes of internal storage, an SD expansion slot, and the ability to take stills, too. Granted, we wouldn't have high hopes for the quality here, but it's hard to argue with a price tag that low.
