 Thanksto some quick-thinking bank employees, robber Thomas Fricks was quickly apprehended following a robbery Thursday at theWashington Trust Bank in Spokane. He had herded three employees into the bank vault and threatened to kill theirfamilies if they didn't cooperate, asking for $40,000 in "no bait bills." One employee, on the phone with herhusband, told him to call the police while another employee stuffed both the money and a GPS device into the duffel bag,enabling the police to track down the getaway minivan within minutes. The best part was the dude's response when thefuzz caught up with him: "You guys are good!"
