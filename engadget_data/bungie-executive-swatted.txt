Polygon reports that a fake 911 call informed police that someone had placed explosives in the executive's yard and was holding a family hostage with an assault rifle.

Law enforcement officials haven't traced the call's origin as of yet, but if caught the swatter could face a year in prison and a $5000 fine.
