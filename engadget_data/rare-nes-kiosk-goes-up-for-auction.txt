 Those looking for something slightly rarer than a Virtual Boy to add to their Nintendo collection may want to head over to eBay before it's too late, where this rare in-store NES kiosk is currently up for auction. While the stylin' TV set in the picture above unfortunately isn't included, the game console itself should be enough to impress any NIntendo fan that pays the lucky winner a visit, with twelve selectable cartridge slots available to load up with your choice of games (none are included). Just don't expect to bring this home on the cheap -- last we checked the bidding was topping $600 with two days left to go.[Via Crave]
