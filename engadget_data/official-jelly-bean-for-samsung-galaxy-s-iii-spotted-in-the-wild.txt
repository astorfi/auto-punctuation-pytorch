If you prefer the official software to the point where thoughts of TouchWiz keep you comfortable at night, you'll be glad to hear that a beta of a more official Android 4.1 upgrade has reportedly landed in the hands of AndroidMX.net. An extensive video look in Spanish (after the break) almost completely mirrors what you'd expect: clear advantages like the expanded notifications and Google Now make the cut, while Samsung's Nature UX vibe remains intact. Only a few minor surprises have snuck their way in, such a brightness slider in the notification bar that we'd previously seen in some firmware for the Galaxy Note. We're skeptical of claims that Jelly Bean for the Galaxy S III is just days away -- Samsung isn't exactly known for speedy Android updates. As long as the update we've seen here isn't just a clever hack, however, it's close enough to completion that it might tame the pessimists.
