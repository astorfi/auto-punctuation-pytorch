For this week's installment of Ask Engadget, no less a personage than Kevin Kelly,
co-founder of Wired magazine and current head honcho of one of our personal favorite websites,
Cool Tools, asks:



We've hardly gone to the movie theater in the last 5 years since we installed a do-it-yourself home theater in our
 bedroom using a computer projector, DVD player and surround sound. I've tried a number of low-end projectors. My last
 selection was an Epson Powerlite S1 which had a street price of $838, but I stopped shopping a couple of years ago,
 and in the meantime the S1 has been discontinued and the quality of new units has gone up. What's the best home
 projector that costs less than $1,000? I keeping thinking they should break the $500 barrier soon. I'm not interested
 in the many projectors that are better but cost more; that's no fun.



Any suggestions for a good projector for home use?
