It tallies with the magenta mobile network, packing AWS, GPRS 850 and 1900 radio bands. No disassembly shots this time, so you'll have to combine the above body outline with your imagination to make a stab at how the rest of the handset will look. As we saw earlier, the phone is set to pack a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, while a 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 and 720p display should ensure the rest of the hardware passes muster. A launch is rumored for next month, but until then, schematics and radiowave tests are yours to explore; hit up the source for the full filing.
