Reportedly, the network is hoping to have its new HD control room ready to roll for the Democratic National Convention in Denver next August and the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis the month after. Furthermore, CBS is also looking to beam out the Evening News with Katie Couric in glorious HD, which should become a very real possibility as soon as the aforementioned control room is fully overhauled.
