 Microsoft's troubled transition from XPto Vista has become something of a comedy of errors, with leaks, confusing hardwarerequirements, disappearing features, and habitual delays having plagued the next-gen OS since it was just a weeLonghorn. And now it seems that once again our hopes of running Vista before the end of the year have been dashed, withMicrosoft issuing a press release late Tuesday revealing that although a business rollout will begin in November,consumers will have to wait until January 2007 to upgrade. While we're certainly frustrated that we won't be able toget our Vista-on for the holidays, we're gonna try to put a positive spin on the situation and appreciate the fact thatwe now have a little longer to decide which of the eight six flavors of the newoperating system we'll be dual-booting on our Macs.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
