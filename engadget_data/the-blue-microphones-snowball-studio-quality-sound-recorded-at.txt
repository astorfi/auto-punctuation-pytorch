Blue Microphones is offering what they claim to be the "world's first professional" USB microphone giving you
"studio quality" sound from your Mac or PC desktop. This condenser mic is optimized for vocals with a 40 to 18,000Hz
frequency response providing maximum detail in the critical midrange bands and a "smooth and focused high end." For
$159 green, that 16-bit 44.1KHz audio better make us sound
damned-near the Rat Pack on our next Podcast.
