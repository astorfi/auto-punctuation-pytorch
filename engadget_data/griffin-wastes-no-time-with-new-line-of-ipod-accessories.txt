The company just announced a whole slew of cases for protecting your new iPod touch, classic or nano from the elements and your greasy fingerprints. Of course, no real surprises in the lineup, but we have to admit that "Reflect" case pictured above is a bit of a looker. Griffin should be shipping its new line, which ranges in price from $20 to $35, this October.[Via IGN]
