Hitachi claims to have made a major breakthrough in hard disk technology, saying that they're on track to squeeze in
as many as 230 gigabits per square inch using perpendicular recording (that means writing data vertically instead of
horizontally). They're anticipating having both 20GB Microdrives (the kind used in the iPod mini) and 1TB 3.5-inch PC
drives available within two years, but they're actually planning to have a 2.5-inch laptop drive that uses
perpendicular recording out before the end of this year.
