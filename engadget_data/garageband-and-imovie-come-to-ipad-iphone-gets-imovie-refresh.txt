  If you occupy the planet Earth, you're probably aware that last week saw the unveiling of the iPad 2. During said reveal, Steve Jobs made a couple of other, perhaps not as monumental, but no doubt notable announcements: specifically that the new slate will offer iMovie and GarageBand. Well, it looks like they've decided to let the cats, or apps, as it were, out of the bag a day early. That's right, Mac movie makers and rock star hopefuls can download them now for $5 a pop -- and, this just in, it looks like iMovie for iPhone's getting a simultaneous upgrade. If you've already started rockin' or docin', let us know what you think in the comments.
