 Wewere so into the HDR-HC1, Sony's portable consumer HD camcorder,that we included it in our 2005 HolidayGift Guide, and now it seems that Sony is on the verge of releasing another HD cam, the HDR-HC3, that appears tocomplement the HDR-HC1 as opposed to forcing its ouster. The main differences between the two models seem to be a lowergross pixel count on the the HC3, but higher resolution stills on the new model, along with a higher-res LCD andmulti-functional control ring. All of this info is based on a leaked document that is supposedly the user's guide forthis supposed-product, so keep that in mind when evaluating the validity of all this.
