 
We caught a sneak peak of this last year, but Sony and Stanford have officially announced their Folding@Home client for the PS3. (As you may or may not know, Folding@Home is a distributed computing project run by Stanford, which uses spare computer cycles in a massively parallelized computing environment to help find cures for diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and the like. Engadget has a Folding@Home team, currently ranked at 32 worldwide.) While Sony's claims that a PS3 can complete work units 10 - 30 times faster than a desktop PC may be fairly dubious, we're more than happy to have y'all put it to the test with Team Engadget. The free F@H update should be available by the end of this month, and can be set to run while your PS3 is idle -- even provide a little eye candy as it crunches the numbers that could save lives.Join Team Engadget here
