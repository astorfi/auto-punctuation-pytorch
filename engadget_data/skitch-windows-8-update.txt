Software version 2.0.1128 adds multiple bug fixes and portrait mode support for tablets with x86, x64 and ARM processors. In addition to these enhancements, the new Skitch app for Windows 8 features faster syncing and sharing options for image files up to 25MB, which should hopefully appease the appetite of photogs who crave hi-res imagery. Whether you're looking to label your vacation's next destination on a map, or draw silly mustaches on pictures of your friends and family, Windows 8 users now have a new weapon to add to their growing arsenal of applications.
