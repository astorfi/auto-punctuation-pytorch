Now that's totally official, with the DMP-BD60, DMP-BD80 and DMP-BD70V arriving with VIERA Cast support that provides access to Amazon Video on Demand. Quite honestly, the trio is pretty average at first glance, but we can't help but dish out a round of golf claps for the BD70V, which is the planet's first (and last, probably) VHS / Blu-ray combo player. Talk about going from one extreme to the other.
