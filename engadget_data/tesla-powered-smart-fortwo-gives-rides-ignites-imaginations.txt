Our best buds over at AutoblogGreen have hosted up a video and photo gallery of a Tesla-powered Smart Fortwo which was recently spotted at a heretofore unnamed automotive show. Amazingly, the vehicle was actually outfitted with the motor and gear box (version 1.0) from an original Roadster, though the incommodious nature of the show floor made it impossible to peel out and really cause a scene.
