 What's made by Samsung, runs Windows Mobile5.0 with AKU2, and looks like the lovechild of a Blackberry 7100 and a Motorola Q? That'd be Samsung's new SGH-I320,which features a QVGA display, Bluetooth, 1.3 megapixel camera, and MicroSD slot. We'll keep you posted on its expectedprice/release, this one's looking good.
