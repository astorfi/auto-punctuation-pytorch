Wondering what those banner ads that TiVo is inserting
while you fast-forward look like? The ads aren't covering as much of the screen as
some people made it sound a few days ago, but they're
definitely not as unintrusive as we would have hoped. Apparently they're still testing the new ads, so the average TiVo
user might be spared the annoyance for some time to come (though to be honest, we're not sure what TiVo's timetable for
this is). One slightly mitigating factor: apparently you're allowed to banish the ad by pressing the "Clear" button on
your remote.
