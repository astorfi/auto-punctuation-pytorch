 
After setting its LED pricing for the year to come, Panasonic has finally set its plasma HDTV info in stone. Again matching the information leaked from retailers, the MSRPs (before any retailer discounts) range from the 65-inch TC-P65VT30 sticking at $4,299 down to the $599 720p TC-P42X3. Also of note is the inclusion of not only the previously announced S30 series without 3D technology or the new Infinite Black 2 panel (unlike the step-up ST30 models) but there will also apparently be a V30 line without the 3D fittings, although there's no specs, prices or ship dates mentioned. Last year the only top of the line model available was the VT25, although there was a 2D only V20-series plasma available in Australia and other regions. 3D or no, things appear to be looking up for plasma TVs, with shipments jumping nine percent last year. Check the press release after the break for all the details, but we'll have to wait until the TVs to arrive to find out if Panasonic is going to be able to hold onto its crown again.

NPD also produced data showing a growth in Plasma sales.In a February 3, 2011 report – Quarterly Global TV Shipment and Forecast Report, Display Search reported:* Q4 '10 Plasma TV panel shipments grew 1% Q/Q (Quarter-Quarter) and 9% Y/Y* After falling from 15.1 million in 2008 to 14.8 million in 2009, Plasma TV panel shipments jumped to 19.1 million in 2010* Panasonic was a top panel supplier in 2010, with a 22% Y/Y (Year-Year) growth on a unit basisThe report further stated that "Plasma TVs were well-suited for consumer's purchasing habits in 2010, providing the most affordable large flat panel TVs for many consumers. In addition the strong industry push for 3D TV helped, as some reviewers and consumers concluded that Plasma TV had superior 3D performance compared to LCD TV, at least in terms of flicker."Ken Park, Display Search Senior Analyst for Korea TV Market Research added "With 3D functionality, Plasma can re-position itself as a lasting technology in the TV industry."The NPD Group also reported that Plasma sales were on the rise.
