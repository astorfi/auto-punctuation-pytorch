Sony's 35mm roadmap already had the industry atwitter, but news that the camera will be "affordable" is news indeed. Of course, affordable is a relative term: think in the $10k to $20k range, for a rough guess. What's great is that, with the addition of the Panasonic AF100 unveiled yesterday, it's clear that manufacturers are finally starting to glom onto this idea of taking these wonderful DSLR-style sensors and putting them into camcorder bodies. The 5D Mark II is great and all, but it was really just pointing to a bigger trend. The Sony camera is due to be released around this time next year, and you can check out a video of the unveil after the break.
