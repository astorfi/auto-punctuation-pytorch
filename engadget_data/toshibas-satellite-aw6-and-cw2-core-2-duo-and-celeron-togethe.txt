The AW6 offers the same 15.4-inch WXGA (1280 x 800) display but bests its predecessor by offering the 1.66GHz Intel T5500 Core 2 Duo proc, a 256MB GeForce Go 7600 GPU, up to 120GB disk, and dual-layer DVD mult-drive on top of the usual smattering of WiFi, ExpressCard, memory card, USB, and Firewire capabilities we've come to expect. Yet with all the bumps, the AW6 still maintains the price of ¥189,800 or about $1,700 US. The low-end, 14.1-inch CW2 comes configured with choice of Celeron M410 or T2300 Core Duo processors, Radeon Express 200M or Intel 945GM Express graphics, and up to 1.5GB of memory, 100GB of disk, and dual-layer multi-drive for prices ranging from ¥109,800 on upward to ¥149,800 (about $937 to $1,278). Both released today in Japan with a Stateside launch expected soon. You can check the CW2 after the break.
