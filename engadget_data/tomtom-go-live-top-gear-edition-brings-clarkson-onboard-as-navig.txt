We'd assume a sizable share of fans may consider themselves God's gift to road navigation, but that hasn't stopped TomTom launching a special edition Top Gear flavor of its GPS device. Navigation is narrated by the voice of Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson, directing clueless drivers "with the aid of 32 satellites... and me." The in-car navigation unit is priced at $269.95, including a one-year subscription to traffic updates and incident reports from TomTom. Alongside Clarkson's familiar tones are some extra Top Gear car icons and Stig mode, where the GPS will remain entirely silent. It'll also point out race tracks featured in the show, plus any nearby speed cameras. With its main man behind you, how could you possibly lose your way?
