Between releasing a new version of its desktop browser and then re-upping its search agreement with Google, we almost didn't notice a new version of Firefox for Android. Version 9 of the mobile browser marks the first time a tablet interface makes the jump from beta to the release channel, a scant four months after first seeing it in mockup form. For those unaware, that means a layout with tab previews when in landscape, which swap to a more traditional setup when rotated into portrait. Rounding out the update is a new action bar, quick access buttons and a faster start-up time, amongst other things. If that sounds like your beat, a video awaits after the break, while you get your download on at the source links below.
