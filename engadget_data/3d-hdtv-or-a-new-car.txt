Some lovely gents at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center seem to
think rendering super-high quality 3D images in HDTV is not only possible, but rather simple and cheap (if you think
$12,000 is cheap) with off the shelf components. Their system (called PSC-SAS) is partly based on the traditional
anaglyph technique (you know, like the red and blue crossover imagery from old monster flicks);
two visual channels are processed, each by their own PC, and then sent to their own HDTV projectors. The images are
overlaid upon each other, each with polarized light reflecting in 90° in opposite directions. By the time it passes
through your glasses (yes, you still have to wear glasses), the 3D image is clear, precise, and pure (and most notably,
headache-free). It'll be a bit before you'll be able to convert your home theater from stodgy old 2D to super
futuristic 3D—they're still trying to find someone to license the whole thing from them.
