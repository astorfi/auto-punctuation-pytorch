While this early version is reportedly working smoothly, with hardware-accelerated graphics already in place, a developer is still working on adding support for AudioFlinger, Android's native audio software. This Raspberry-flavored Ice Cream Sandwich apparently runs on both a kernel and VideoCore binary image that's currently not publicly available. The team is still looking into whether the two code lines can be wrapped into a single entity before it offers up the source to its users. See how the experimental pairing fares in a quick video runthrough after the break.
