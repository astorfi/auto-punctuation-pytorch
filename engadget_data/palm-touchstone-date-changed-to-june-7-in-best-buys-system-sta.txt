The latest evidence comes once again from our friends at Best Buy, where the recently-added Touchstone inventory stub has already been updated to reflect an "In Stock Date" of -- you guessed it -- June 7. As we've noted before, that's a Sunday, which is Sprint's traditional launch day; not to say there's anything traditional about the Pre or the hype surrounding its appearance, but it's something to chew on. Worst case, we figure you'll be able to swing by your favorite big box on the 7th and pick up a cool, pricey inductive dock even if you can't pick up a phone.  [Thanks, Mr. Caffoni]
