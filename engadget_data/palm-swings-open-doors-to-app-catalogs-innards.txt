Users will be able to visit third-party sites and download apps straight to their webOS-based devices -- possibly an interesting option for themed sites that want to give users quick access to a certain category of apps quickly. On a related note, Palm introduced its Hot Apps program that rewards devs for creating popular apps -- the nature of those "rewards" isn't yet clear, but we would imagine they're gonna make it rain on these cats.

Update: And make it rain they will. $100,000 each will go to the developer of the top free and paid apps through May 31, 40 will get $10,000, and another 400 will snag a cool grand.
