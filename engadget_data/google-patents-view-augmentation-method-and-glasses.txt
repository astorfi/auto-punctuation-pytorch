The patent outlines a system where a view-finder could identify what we're gawking at, adding in extra factual details and also outlining new points of interest -- including those that aren't necessarily within the view of our own eyes. The glasses would then be able to notify us with a medley of visual indicators and cues (including the slightly awkward notion of light-up frames), guiding our gaze to something we'd hopefully want to take a look at.

 There's more to Google's latest idea than simple tourist-centric finger-pointing though, also looking to augment how we read. The device would detect when someone is reading from a digital display and even feel out the rest of the information currently out of view. It would then direct readers to points of interest; possibly pictures, possibly those important factual nuggets -- the patent still plays loose with the specifics. But if you're into such vague and fanciful product description, you can take a look at the full filing at the source below.
