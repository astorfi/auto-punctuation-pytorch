   Dual-SIM phones are perfect for when the carriers are desperate for your business, keeping your work life separate, or to mask your philandering -- but what if two isn't enough? LG (stands for Lucky Goldstar, now you know) is producing a phone with a third SIM slot, only one less than the ridiculously equipped OTECH F1. The A290 candy-bar throwback sports a 176 x 220, 2.2-inch display, 1.3 megapixel camera, LED flashlight and a 1500 mAh battery. Russians (for it's exclusive to the nation) looking to swell their SIM collection can do so from next month at the cost of â‚¬75 ($100).
