 While the company wouldn't reveal specific plans, Dell did say it's interested in entering the server arena with an ARM-based product. Earlier this year HP debuted its first ARMv8-powered server, but Dell seems to think the launch was a tad rushed. As it said during the Q&A session of its earnings call today, CEO Michael Dell said the company had "been experimenting with making an ARM server for over a year ... but the software stack just isn't mature enough yet." It is, however, intrigued and sees "some interesting opportunities emerging."
