Here it is at number four on the GLBenchmark Pro 1.1 charts, where only one variant of Samsung's Galaxy S and a pair of Tegra 2 tablets managed to keep it from claiming the top spot. AlienBabelTech, who found the entry, believes this is evidence the device has one of the new Snapdragon dual-cores, and though we won't speculate that far, a series of coincidences point to a T-Mobile launch (and a bout of logic has us worrying about battery life) if or when it hits our shores.
