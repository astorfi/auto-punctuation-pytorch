 So it looks like HD DVD fans are not going to get Spielberg's blockbuster films as soon as expected. The PR group for the HD DVD forum has just posted an apology for placing E.T., Jaws, and Jurassic Park on their Coming Soon list before consulting with Spielberg first. Long time movie experts know that Spielberg does not embrace new home movie formats right off the bat, but rather waits for a bit - George Lucas is the same way with his films. So basically, these three movies are not going to be the saving grace of HD DVD anytime soon.
