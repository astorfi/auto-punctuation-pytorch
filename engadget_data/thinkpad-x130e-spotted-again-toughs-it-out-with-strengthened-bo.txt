Lenovo may have prematurely revealed its forthcoming ThinkPad refreshes, the X1 Hybrid and the X130e, but venture over to PCHome and you'll spot a few extra tidbits on the product pages there. Specifically, the toughened sequel to the X120e is purportedly packing a rough-and-tumble keyboard, strengthened hinges and a thicker plastic bezel. Behind its protective credentials, Lenovo is apparently promising eight-hour battery life, an 11.6-inch screen, AMD Radeon HD graphics plus HDMI and USB ports. The online store lists three different processor options, including an Intel Core i3-2367M and two AMD Fusion APUs -- the E-300 and E-450. No whispers just yet on HDD or RAM specs, but ThinkPad fans jonesing for something small shouldn't have to wait long -- it looks set to land by the end of the year.
