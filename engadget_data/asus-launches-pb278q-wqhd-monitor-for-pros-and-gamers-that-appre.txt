An LED-backlit IPS 27-inch widescreen display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440, it has HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.2, Dual-link DVI and built-in speakers. Similar to the VA278Q that was introduced at CES 2012, it will add pro-focused adjustments for more accurate color, plus ASUS QuickFit Virtual Scale and Splendid Video Intelligence tech when it ships in early September. There's no word on the price tag, but if you're interested in something with more pixels than your current 1080p setup, there's a video from ASUS Republic of Gamers Australia embedded after the break.
