 Android got a ~21 hour head start, but we doubt you'll find too many avid Gmailers bemoaning the fact that version 2.0 of their most needed app hit iOS a little bit late. Google has just pushed the latest major update of its Gmail app to iPad, iPhone and iPod touch users, and it's quite the update indeed. For starters, you'll get an entirely new look, plus a bunch of improvements like profile pictures in messages, numerous new animations from swivels to transitions and infinite scrolling in the message lists. You'll also notice that autocomplete predictions will appear as you type, and users can RSVP to Google Calendar invites as well as +1 and comment on Google+ posts directly from the app.

 Moreover, the company added a feature that many have been clamoring for -- multiple account support -- enabling users to login to up to five Google Accounts from the menu and switch between them with a couple taps. Hit up the iTunes link below for a download, or just update the new-fashioned way on the device itself. (Though, it looks like folks are hitting errors right out of the gate when attempting to download -- we're guessing it'll sort itself in the hours ahead.)
