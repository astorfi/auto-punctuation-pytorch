The fact that the beast is giant and in space makes it downright compulsive especially when given the opportunity to team up in combat with Max Planck over an 802.11n WiFi Direct connection... without an access point and without any lag. This isn't your father's Bluetooth connection, son. See the carnage go down after the break.
