Now, its brother HSTNH-F30CV is seeking federal approval to ride CDMA (850 / 1900 MHz), UMTS (900 / 2100 MHz), and GSM (850 / 900 / 1800 / 2100 MHz) wireless waves. With that "V" tagged on the end of the model moniker and its Verizon-friendly innards, it sure looks like the Pre 3 will be the next handset to wear a checkmark on its front. Additionally, those world wide bands tell us that a webOS device will soon be joining the Androids and Blackberrys in Big Red's rather limited lineup of global handsets.
