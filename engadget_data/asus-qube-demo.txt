Just as the name suggests, the device comes in the shape of a cube, with an IR receiver on the front side, a USB port on the right, and a bunch more on the back: HDMI-in, HDMI-out, another USB port, RJ-45 and IR-out. Internally the Qube packs a Marvell Armada 1500 chipset with 1GB of RAM and 4GB of flash storage. Like the chassis, the Qube's interface also features a rotating cube, but that's pretty much the only thing special about it so far.

 The Qube naturally comes with its very own remote control, and with the exception of the lack of a numpad it comes with all the standard buttons, and on the other side it has a QWERTY keyboard. It's worth pointing out that there's also a voice command button as well as motion-sensing, thus making the most out of Google TV ver.3. Not a fan of the remote control? Then you can simply download an app onto your Nexus 7 or any Android device to get the same functions.

 In terms of availability, ASUS plans to launch the Qube in the US in around March for around $150. For the mean time, grab yourself a beverage and check out the demo video after the break.
