       We already knew Rock Band VR was coming to the Oculus Rift, but now we have a bit more information about the project. In a gameplay demo at an Oculus Game Day event recently, we learned that the game will essentially require that you attach an Oculus Touch to a guitar controller via a clip adhesive (seen above), which confirms what we saw in the promo video that Oculus and Harmonix released a few months ago. That's essentially how the game will communicate your movements and controls to the computer. We also learned that all Bluetooth controllers should work with the VR version of the game, as would Xbox, PS3 and PS4 controllers.
      

 
I tried a brief demo of Rock Band in VR, but it was still mostly restricted to normal gameplay and not the full VR treatment. There was a tiny bit of immersion though: I was told by a disembodied voice to turn on the amp, check my audio levels and wait for a cue from my drummer and then there I was, in front of an eager crowd at a concert venue -- all of which adds to that stagefright feel. But then once the music started, there was that same ol' familiar note highway at the bottom and that was what I ended up staring at most of the time.


"That's definitely our biggest challenge" said Josh Harrison, Harmonix's social and community lead. "We want VR to get you fully immersed. We want you to live out that rock star fantasy."

According to Harrison, we'll see a more immersive version of VR gameplay at E3, where he says we would no longer be slave to the note highway and be able to rock out for real. Oh, and apologies to drum lovers -- it looks like, at least for now, Rock Band VR is just for lead guitars. And no bass guitars either. Only guitar god wannabes may apply.
