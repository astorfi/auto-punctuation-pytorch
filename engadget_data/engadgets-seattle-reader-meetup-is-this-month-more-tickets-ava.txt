 Yep, we sold out of tickets to our upcoming Seattle Interactive Conference meetup, but fear not: we've found a whole new stash. If you're out in the Emerald City on October 29th, you can join in on the fun, meet Engadget editors, interact with fellow readers and win some fabulous prizes. Get added to the list by signing up for tickets right here.

 Oh, and if you're interested in sponsoring the event, there's still time. Just drop us a line at sponsors [at] engadget [dot] com, and for more information on SIC, check out the source link below.
