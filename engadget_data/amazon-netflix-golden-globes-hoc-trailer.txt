Tonight's Golden Globe Awards were a triumph for internet TV services, as Amazon and Netflix scored wins for their original series -- all on a night when the big four broadcast networks didn't win any. Amazon had two awards to Netflix's one, and won their head to head battle as its hit Transparent triumphed in the "Best TV Series, Musical or Comedy" category that included Orange is the New Black, Silicon Valley, Jane the Virgin and Girls. Series star Jeffrey Tambor collected the other award for Best Actor in a TV Comedy. Netflix won a single award (Kevin Spacey, Best Actor in a TV Drama, House of Cards) but might have given us the best moment of the evening by releasing a trailer for House of Cards season three. It's embedded after the break if you need a taste of the Underwoods before the new season debuts worldwide on February 27th.



And the winner is... Amazon.
