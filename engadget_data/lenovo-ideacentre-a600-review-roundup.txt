There seems to be a consensus that this all-in-one's a really good bang for the buck, especially with the TV tuner and somewhat useful remote / gyroscope controller / VoIP handset. Performance-wise, the Intel Core 2 Duo / ATI Mobility Radio HD3650 powered device is good but nothing worth writing home about. Boing Boing Gadgets suggests it won't match the latest iMac at gaming. While the body's well built and sturdy, the jury's still out on the glossy screen and that front "bump" of sorts -- you should also be warned that there's a rather hefty power brick that comes along with the PC. As with all AIO's, if a 21.5-inch screen isn't large enough, there isn't much you can do about it. If, however, the specs and features are just what you're looking for, you'll be happy to hear the company's turned those bullet points into a well-oiled machine. But don't take our word for it, hit up the read links below for more in-depth critiques.
