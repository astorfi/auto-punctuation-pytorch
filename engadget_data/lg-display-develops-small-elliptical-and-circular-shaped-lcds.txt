Hailed as the "world's largest 6-inch elliptical and 1.4-inch circular-shaped LCDs," both units are capable of displaying up to 262,000 colors and have a near 160-degree viewing angle. We're told that the devices could eventually find homes in digital photo frames as well as a variety of household / automotive applications, but we won't be getting any further details 'til they're both showcased at SID next week. One more look is waiting after the jump.
