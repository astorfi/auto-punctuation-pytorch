Or so says Toshiba. Fortunately, Tosh didn't skimp on battery life (up to 12.5-hours when configured with an SSD) to achieve that 858-grams (1.89-pounds) weight. Shipping in late September, the SS RX2 features a semi-rugged frame, a 1.2GHz SU9300 ULV Core 2 Duo processor; up to 160GB of hard disk (or 128GB SSD); an LED backlit 12.1-inch 1,280 x 800 pixel display; up to 3GB of memory; Intel GS45 Express graphics chipset; 3x USB and 1x eSATA; 802.11a/b/g/n draft 2.0; integrated DVD super-multi drive; and built-in 3G data -- a road warrior's weapon of paradise.[Via Impress]
