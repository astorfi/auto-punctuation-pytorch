The biggest difference between the Mini 10v (aka, Inspiron 1011) and Mini 10 is the processor: the Mini 10v uses a netbook-standard N270 Diamondville-class Atom processor instead of the Z5xx Silverthorne-class processor found in the 10-inch original. What you give up in video processing performance (and perhaps battery life) you more than make for in price as the Mini 10v starts at $299, not $399 like the original.[Thanks, Willy N.]
