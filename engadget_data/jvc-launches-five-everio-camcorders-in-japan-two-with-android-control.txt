Five models are shipping in late December that include two with remote control: WiFi on the 16GB GZ-EX350 and 32GB GZ-EX370 lets a nearby Android phone or tablet steer the camera from a distance, and the camera itself can wirelessly back up its footage as well as share media through WiFi Direct. Springing for one of these or the strictly-offline GZ-E325 (8GB) and GZ-E345 (16GB) cameras will still net you a just-the-highlights playback mode that looks for smiles and tagged scenes. While the entry-level GZ-E320 misses out on the highlight mode, all five models share a 40X optical zoom, 1080p shooting from a BSI CMOS sensor, an SDXC card slot and a 3-inch touchscreen for previewing any would-be masterpieces. Although JVC hasn't mentioned any US plans, we wouldn't be surprised to see at least one or two of the new Everios cross the Pacific.
