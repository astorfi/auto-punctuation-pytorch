Come tomorrow, Dell will take the wraps off of its very first Chromebook, which has been dubbed the Dell Chromebook 11. Specifics are scant at the moment, but we do know that the laptop (which will likely have an 11-inch display) has been designed for use in schools. Fret not Chrome OS fans who no longer have recess to brighten your day, the company is expected to announce Chromebooks for businesses and the Average Joe next year.
