 Just as we expected, 4K TVs are all the rage here at CES 2013 and naturally Vizio won't be left out. Among its 2013 lineup of LCD HDTVs is a new top of the line XVT-Series of Ultra HDTVs at 55-, 65- and 70-inches. The XVT551d, 651d and 701D don't have much in the way of prices or release dates, but the company claims it will "bring the expensive new technology to mainstream consumers." In the more accessible realm however are its M-Series displays, which will for the first time this year offer a universal backlit remote connected by WiFi Direct. Thanks to its connected remote, Vizio claims it will be able to control the entire home theater without the usual nagging setup process.

 There are two M-Series lineups, the one with Theater 3D ranges in size from 50-inches to 80-inches, and in price from $849 to $4,499, while the models without max out at 47-inches and $699. Check below for a press release with all of the prices and specs plus a shot of that remote, although all we know about a release is that they'll be arriving "later this year."

  Three Product Lines Offer Consumers HDTVs Sized from 22" to 80", Featuring New Modern Industrial Design with Slim to Nearly Borderless Frames
   Irvine, CA and Las Vegas, NV - January 7, 2013 - VIZIO, America's #1 large size HDTV company1, revealed today its expanded 2013 HDTV collection, highlighted by an all-new line of M-Series Razor LED™ Smart TVs featuring an elegant, modern ultra-slim bezel and razor-thin profile. VIZIO's new HDTV line-up continues to demonstrate the brand's leadership in HDTV technology with advanced innovations like its first Ultra High Definition TVs (4K2K), part of the brand's flagship XVT-Series, as well as the all-new, all-LED2 E-Series line which features a sleek, slim-frame design and advanced Smart TV features and Theater 3D™ available on select models. Ranked "Highest in Customer Satisfaction with HDTVs" by J.D. Power and Associates3, VIZIO will showcase its new 22" to 80" sized collection at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, NV.

   VIZIO's new M-Series Razor LED Smart TVs are the must-have centerpieces for today's modern families. The all-new M-Series signature design in screen sizes of 32" (M321i), 40" (M401i), 47" (M471i), 50" (M501d), 55" (M551d), 60" (M601d), 65" (M651d), 70" (M701d) and 80" (M801d),pair superior picture quality with an ultra-slim frame for a more immersive viewing experience. The ultra-thin bezels of the M-Series virtually vanish next to the near edge-to-edge glass screen for a signature look that updates any room's appearance. Unique interior metal construction in the base and neck adds stability while a beautifully finished exterior complements the design and helps set the new standard for affordable HDTV luxury.

   "The M-Series family utilizes a blend of thoughtful design detailing, minimalist construction and premium materials to create a line of HDTVs consumers will be proud to showcase in their homes," said Scott McManigal, VIZIO VP of Design. "The sleek, near bezel-free design reduces distractions and enhances the rich picture quality allowing for a superior all-picture viewing experience."

   Building on its leadership as the #1 brand in the U.S. for WiFi flat-panel TVs4, VIZIO's new M-Series Razor LED Smart TVs feature a best-in-class connected TV experience with the latest picture quality technologies. Features like advanced local dimming, 240Hz refresh rate with Smooth Motion for the 50" and larger models and a brighter, flicker-free Theater 3D™ experience with lightweight, battery-free glasses, build on the M-Series franchise. All of the new M-Series units offer VIZIO Internet Apps® (V.I.A.) allowing consumers to enjoy their favorite apps like Amazon Instant Video, Crackle, Facebook®, HuluPlus, M-Go, Netflix®, Pandora®, VUDU, YouTube® and more. The award-winning Smart TV platform offers the industry's easiest out-of-box experience, designed to allow users of all experience levels to quickly breeze through set-up and start watching TV or browse their favorite apps. A new convenience feature for 2013, VIZIO's M-Series models will include Wi-Fi Direct universal remote controls with backlit keys, providing an intuitive way to control the entire home theater without nagging codes and programming.

   "The new VIZIO M-Series line-up offers consumers a better entertainment experience with a clean, industrial design that now matches the superior picture quality and great Smart TV experience we are known for," said Matt McRae, VIZIO Chief Technology Officer. "The M-Series line is the perfect combination of leading technologies, highlighted by the easiest out-of-the-box experience, most popular TV apps on the market and an immersive, all picture viewing experience."

   In addition to an enhanced line of M-Series Razor LED Smart HDTVs, VIZIO will also be unveiling its first Ultra HDTV offerings this year at CES. With four-times the resolution of Full HD 1080p, the premium XVT-Series Ultra HD Razor LED Smart TVs with Theater 3D offer the ultimate in resolution and picture quality. VIZIO will launch the 55" (XVT551d), 65" (XVT651d) and 70" (XVT701d) Ultra HD units later this year, making it one of the first technology innovators to bring the expensive new technology to mainstream consumers.

   Featuring the same sleek, industrial design of VIZIO's new M-Series line, the new XVT-Series screen size classes of 55", 65" and 70" Ultra HDTVs also boast an ultra-slim frame and Razor LED technology, packing brilliant clarity, color and richer detail into the most immersive, all-picture viewing experience possible. VIZIO's Theater 3D technology included in the new XVT-Series takes movies, sports and gaming into a new dimension while an effective refresh rate of 240 Hz keeps even the most fast-moving pictures smooth and stable.

   "As content creators continue to push the limits to produce ever-increasingly rich and intricate worlds for their stories, we're excited to be one of the first major brands to bring premium, Ultra HD resolution into the home," said Matt McRae, VIZIO Chief Technology Officer. "Ultra HD is the latest must-have upgrade for the home theater, giving discerning fans of our flagship XVT-Series access to cutting-edge technologies and an unprecedented high definition picture."

   While the M- and XVT-Series will be unveiled at CES and available later in the year, VIZIO's popular entry-level E-Series line-up is available now and offers consumers an all-LED2 collection made affordable for every household. Bringing superb picture quality to consumers at a great value, the E-Series HDTVs have already seen great success at retail with large screen sizes of 70" (E701i), 65" (E650i), 60" (E601i) and 55" (E551i), as well as smaller units in 50" (E500i and E500d), 42" (E420d), 39" (E390i), 29" (E291i), 24" (E241i) and 22" (E221) available to consumers. The sleek, slim-frame LED product line offers advanced local dimming technology on 42" screens and above, SRS StudioSound HD™, a DTS technology, for clear audio and more HDMI inputs when compared to competitive brands, allowing for expanded entertainment options.
