While there have been Google Glass apps for lock screens, the Tesla Model S and even The New York Times, we've been wondering when we'd see a traditional game. Today, the wondering stops. GlassBattle is a Battleship-style, voice controlled, turn-based affair using the wearable's Mirror API. Sadly it won't be available to the public until developer Brick Simple's API quota limitations are lifted, but that doesn't stop us from fantasizing about gaming while we do other stuff. Like, you know, playing video games. Yes, we hear you loud and clear Xzibit. To see people game while grocery shopping and walking around a pond, hit the video after the break.
