No sooner does Sony fess up to August price cuts than we start hearing tell of a response from the 360 camp, and now it sounds like Sony has even more goodies for the PS3 faithful. First off is a Circuit City memo that got forwarded to us showing those price cuts indeed happening today. It'll get advertised next week, but if those shelf jockeys are doing their jobs, you should supposedly be able to walk into a Circuit City right this minute and walk out with a brand new 60GB PS3 for $499. To add further drama to the situation, people are taking clues from the 80GB PS3 box as proof of the inclusion of a "Rumblaxis" (fancy new word courtesy of PS3 Fanboy) controller being included with the new system that's set to launch in August. People are conjecturing the red light on the Home button is a clue to such rumble functionality, and eagle-eyed readers have also noted that the "Contents" section of the box has more text describing the SIXAXIS item than can be found on the 60GB box. To be honest, we're not spotting the difference, but feel free to make up your own mind with the links provided below.
