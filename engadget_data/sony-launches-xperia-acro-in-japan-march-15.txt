There's been some additions to the US-bound device we handled back in January, including a built-in TV tuner and mobile wallet functionality. Last time we heard, the LTE-capable Ion was set for a summer world tour, but given this early spring unveiling on the other side of the world, it could pass AT&T's tests this side of 2012 -- hopefully with all four of these color options in tow. Take a tour through the aqua blue and sakura pink palette choices at the source below.
