The first model to get an official price, the TabletKiosk eo, is expected to sellfor about $900. And, now we get word that Samsung's Q1 can bepre-ordered from eXpansys for a mere £799.95 (about $1,400). While it's not unusual for specialty resellers suchas eXpansys to charge a markup over retail (and the price before VAT is somewhat cheaper -- £680, or about$1,180), the price makes the Q1 more expensive than many laptops, and not all that much cheaper than some full-featuredtablet PCs. US pricing, once announced, will almost certainly be lower -- if not at retail, then on eBay, where thesewill end up if they're priced too high for the market to bear.[Via Stuff]
