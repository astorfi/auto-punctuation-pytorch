According to the Boxee team, VUDU offerings should hit the platform as soon as next week, but Netflix won't be made available until the end of the month. The company claims that both services are up and running in its offices, but more time was needed to "test each application to make sure they are ready for launch." It's nice to know where we stand, though it would have been even nicer to get more frequent updates on the status of these apps, instead of a last-minute blog post on New Year's Eve.

Still, the post has equal touches of hopefulness for the bright future Boxee sees for home entertainment, and acknowledgment of the massive challenges the startup faces in the coming year. In their words: "As we get ready for the New Year tomorrow and CES next week, it's clear that in 2011 we will be competing with companies that spend more feeding their employees that we have to pay ours. We're confident though that our small team will continue to push the envelop of what people expect from their TVs." Here at Engadget, we're eager to see how it all plays out, but we're definitely rooting for underdogs like Boxee who have pioneered so much of what the world is just waking up to. 2011 is going to be a crazy year!
