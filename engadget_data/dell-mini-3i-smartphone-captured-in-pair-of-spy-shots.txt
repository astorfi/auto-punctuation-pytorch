 
Well, it's looking increasingly like those very first shots of a rumored Dell smartphone that cropped up way back in June were indeed the real deal, as two separate sets of purported spy pics have now turned up showing an identical-looking phone. Better still, they also show the device powered on, offering us our first look at Dell and China Mobile's customized Android interface for the thing. The Boy Genius Report also goes one step further with a complete list of the phone's purported specs, which includes quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE connectivity, a 3.5-inch 640 x 360 display, a 3-megapixel camera with a flash (and support for 30 fps video), Bluetooth, A-GPS, and a microSD card slot for expansion, to name a few features. Head on past the break for one more, equally blurry shot, and dive into the links below for a few pics and details.Read - Cloned in China, "Dell Mini 3i spy shots"Read - Boy Genius Report, "Dell's smartphone pictured again, spec'd, other Android details"[Thanks, xleung]
