Introduced today, the LH905 series steps things up a notch with the included Genessa Premium 36-bit video engine. Additionally, the 37-inch LT-37LH905, 42-inch LT-42LH905 and 47-inch LT-47LH905 will all feature a 1080p resolution, 500 nits of brightness, dual ten-watt speakers, 10-bit LCD IPS panel, a built-in analog / digital terrestrial tuner, DLNA support, three HDMI 1.3 ports, integrated SD slot and an Ethernet port for good measure. Unfortunately, these are all sporting the elusive open offer tag for now, but the trifecta should start floating onto shelves late next month for those interested.  [Via Impress]
