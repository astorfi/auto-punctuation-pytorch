 We're surprised that along withwriting a book and producing, directing, and starring in his own movie, video game modder extraordinaire Ben Heckendornstill has time to hone the craft that made him famous. Although Heckendorn's latest build -- a slick-looking Atari 2600portable -- definitely shows some signs of a busy man (unlike past projects, no step-by-step instructions or detailedphoto gallery is offered), the professional and innovative design proves that his skillz have never been tighter. Afterhaving stuffed almost every retro console imaginable into a portable package,Heckendorn has returned to the Atari classic for at least the third time, improving upon older versions like the Phoenix 2600 in cartridge placement,screen size, and overall build quality. Another great job, Ben -- just don't get all Hollywood on us and forget theadoring fans who made you the star of page and screen that you are today. Keep reading for a little more moddingmadness...[Thanks, Jeffler]
