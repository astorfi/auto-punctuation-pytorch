 HTPC enclosures with front-mounted LCD screens certainly aren't new, with firms such as VoodooPC and Okoro Media Systems (just to name a couple) have been pumpin' them out for quite some time, but OrigenAE's take on the LCD-equipped chassis involves quite a bit more distinction than the other ho hum attempts. The S21T is practically one-piece aluminum (black or silver) case that just oozes sleekness, and would probably become the instant standout in any AV rack. Gracing the front is a recessed 12.1-inch motorized LCD that touts an (admittedly tough on the eyes) 1,920 x 1,080 resolution, and just might beat out the actual TV sets this beast will end up connected to. Regardless, the enclosure also features a host of internal fans, matching optical drive bezel, removable motherboard tray, support for 10 internal hard drives, and a bevy of ports including USB 2.0, FireWire, audio in / out, and multi-card flash reader. Of course, it doesn't really matter how sensational the innards of this thing are, just click on through for a few more snapshots and see how great it looks completely empty.[Via MissingRemote]
