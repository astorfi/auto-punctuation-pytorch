This time, a simple press release will have to do the job as HP announces the $1,299 TouchSmart IQ504 (PC) and $1,499 TouchSmart IQ506 (PC with TV tuner). Arguably, the thinner, touchier, bigger, 22-inch all-in-ones deserve better. Inside the 2.6-inch thick chassis you'll find a 500GB disk, 256MB of NVIDIA GeForce 9300 M HS HD graphics, 802.11n WiFi, and 2.16GHz Intel Core Duo T5850 processor thumping through the cycles. Launching in 17 countries next month including the UK, Japan, and the US. Another shot after the break.Update: Video courtesy of CrunchGear posted after the break [Warning: obnoxiously loud soundtrack]
