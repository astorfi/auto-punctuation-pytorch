 As expected, TiVo has revised itspricing plans to include the purchase of the TiVo box as part of the monthly fee. New pricing schemes include aone-year plan at $19.95 per month, a two-year $18.95-per-month plan and a three-year $16.95 plan. All plans include an80GB Series 2 TiVo box, and discounts are available for customers who pre-pay (i.e., a prepaid three-year plan is $469,vs. $610.20 on the monthly plan). TiVo had earlier experimented with a similarall-in-one plan at a somewhat lower price: the one-year plan was $16.95 per month, including a 40-hour TiVo box. TiVohas also quietly dropped its $299 lifetime service plan, though current users who signed up for that plan won't beaffected. [Via PVRWire]
