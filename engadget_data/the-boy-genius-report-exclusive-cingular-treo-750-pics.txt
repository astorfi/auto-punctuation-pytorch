 Field report tidbits from Engadget's mobile insider, the Boy Genius.
We have to say, the Boy Genius is damned good. Ok, now that thats out of the way, Engadget Mobile would like present to you exclusive pictures of a Cingular-branded Treo 750. Yeah, that's right, that's the Treo Lennon, and as we found out before from BG, is coming to Cingy. Yes it has UMTS. Yes it has HSPDA. And no, it doesn't have a front facing camera for video calling -- sorry, we're gonna have to live with it. More pics after the break!
