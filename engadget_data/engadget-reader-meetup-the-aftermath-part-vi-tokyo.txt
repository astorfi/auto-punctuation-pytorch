 
Listen, we've just got to say thanks. We got shown some serious love at our Tokyo reader meetup this week, and we're not only really grateful for the 200+ readers who came out to hang out with Engadget (and who took a ton of photos and almost 100 videos), but for the variety of guests we had, including Mr. Yamamitsu (CEO of Thanko), who participated in a live interview, as well as the "lightning talks" round of hackers, homebrewers, modders, researchers, and all around Japanese Ã¼ber-geeks. So, much love to everyone who came out and helped make our Tokyo event pop off!P.S. -Oh, and check out some videos after the break. And stay tuned for further details on the SF Engadget reader meetup this week.
