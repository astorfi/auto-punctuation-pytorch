 While you're still dreaming of the day you can put on an Oculus VR headset and become a space accountant, devs have long been able to buy a starter kit for their projects. Any dev who doesn't have it yet might have a hard time getting one, though, because the company will soon stop selling its developer kits. According to a Reddit post by the startup's community manager, there's a shortage because some of the headset's components are no longer being manufactured. Although Oculus is looking for other sources, it can't quite tell when production can start again -- even worse, it's fast running out of stock. The firm has remaining units it intends to distribute in select locations, but anyone who misses out might just have to wait for the second developer kit to come out.
 
The last Oculus developer (DK1) units will be sold in the following countries:

 United States Canada Countries in the European Union Japan South Korea Australia Switzerland Norway
