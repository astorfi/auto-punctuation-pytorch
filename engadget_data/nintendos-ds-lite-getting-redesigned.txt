 Don't place your bets just yet, but rumors are beginning to swirl in the DS Lite arena about a possible redesign. Considering all the PSP2 whispering that has been going on of late, it wouldn't be too surprising for Nintendo to plunk down a bombshell of its own in the face of competition, but moreover, we know Nintendo has a history of keeping its handheld hardware fresh. Be it colors or miniaturization, we've seen the firm's handhelds shrink and don new hues for ages, and the most recent blurb suggests that a new iteration of the DS could "feature a larger screen and more readable fonts for users who may have a difficult time playing on the smaller machine." Hey, it's not like grandpa isn't already getting his game on with another Big N product, right?[Via DSFanboy]
