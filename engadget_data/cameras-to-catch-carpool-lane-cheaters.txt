 It seems that the Brits are, unsurprisingly trying to save money in
their quest to ticket carpool lane cheaters. Actually having police do enough monitoring to act as a real deterrent is
pretty costly, so they decided to let a camera do the work. In pursuit of that goal, Laser Optical Engineering has
developed an infrared camera that exploits a small range of the infrared spectrum that is absorbed by human skin but
reflected by all the non-organic parts of a car. This camera will be combined with an image recognition software to
help eliminate the identification of other body parts as a second occupant, as well as shore up shoddy performance in
lower light conditions (read: anything but bright sunlight; which is reputed to in short supply in England, isn't it?).
We see a problem here, since windshields absorb infrared light, a "highly sophisticated â€“ and vastly expensive" camera
would do the trick. And here we thought they were trying to save money.
