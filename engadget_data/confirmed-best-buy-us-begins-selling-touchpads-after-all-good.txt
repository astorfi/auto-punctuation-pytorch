The FAQ page in the retailer's forums has been updated to announce that it's reversed the decision to ship everything back to HP, and we've also received leaked screenshots confirming the news as well. Best Buy's online store currently shows the TouchPad as sold out and unavailable in stores, and company reps are hesitant to give official word on exactly how much inventory is left at this point. If the online status doesn't change between now and sunrise, we have a strong feeling you should expect a Black Friday-style line waiting for you at the brick-and-mortars.
