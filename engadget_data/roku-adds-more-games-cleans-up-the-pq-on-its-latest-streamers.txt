As promised, it has issued a firmware update enabling new gaming options including Pac Man:CE, Galaga, and Angry Birds Seasons. Even if you're committed to Roku's hockey pucks as purely video streamers, there's a new firmware update to correct, among other things, issues that caused a darker than normal image on some displays, WiFi performance, boot performance, readiness for HBO Go, and subtitles on Netflix. Check out Roku's blog for the full list of fixes or just hit the software update section in your settings menu to make sure you have the latest software.
