Still, it brings a tear of joy to the eye to see these pioneers of digital audio embrace convergence so thoroughly. Introducing the Denon D-F103 shelf-system with 40GB disk, CD, USB, and Ethernet jack. As you might have already surmised, you can plug-in and play music directly off your USB-equipped DAP, rip your CDs in PCM(WAV) or WMA files straight to disk, and even stream MP3/WAV/WMA audio from any DLNA or Windows Media Connect server on your home network. She'll also play vTuner Internet Radio and backup your PC music over USB to boot. And don't worry about ripping to untitled tracks when disconnected; that disk comes pre-installed with about 350,000 Gracenote CDDB titles. Expected to drop in Japan in late August for Â¥161,700 or $1,389 in that cool, cool green. Come 'ere Denon, it's noogie time.[Via Impress]
