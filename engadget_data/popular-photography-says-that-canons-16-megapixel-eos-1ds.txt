It's all over for film. Well, it's not really all over, but it's the beginning of the end now that Popular
Photography, which isn't exactly an apologist for digital, has conceded that in tests Canon's new 16 megapixel EOS 1Ds
Mark II took better pictures than a regular SLR camera (Canon's EOS 3) shooting high quality ISO 100 film. They'd
predicted a few years ago that digital cameras would have to get up to at least 24 or 30 megapixels before they'd start
to rival film cameras in quality, but now they're saying that the better color and lower noise of the EOS 1Ds Mark II
gives digital the edge.
