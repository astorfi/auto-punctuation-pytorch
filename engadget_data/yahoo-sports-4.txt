Yahoo has spent the past several months revamping its mobile apps, and it's shifting that attention to a Sportacular redesign just as playoff season reaches its peak. Now going under the more recognizable Yahoo Sports name, the remade Android and iOS apps tout a simpler interface; users can also sync their favorite teams across devices. Those running iOS get a few added upgrades with this release, including iPad support and a stream of Twitter posts from local writers and experts. No matter the platform, fans of all stripes can grab Yahoo's updates at the source links.
