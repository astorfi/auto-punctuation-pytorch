Now the company is taking things a step further, producing a series accessories for what Microsoft hopes will be the hottest accessory this fall: the Kinect. There is a trio of mounts, starting with the $15 Kinect wall mount, then the $30 floor stand, and finally the $40 TV mount, which will occupy the VESA holes on the back of flat-panels. Curiously, the most expensive thing is the extension cable: $50 for the privilege of moving your googly-eyed camera a further nine feet from your console. All should be available this November, and all are officially Microsoft licensed, so you can feel good about paying too much for them.
