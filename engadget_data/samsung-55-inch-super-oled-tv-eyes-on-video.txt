  After our introduction yesterday, we've been itching to get a closer look at Samsung's 55-inch Super OLED television. While this isn't a final production model, it's still pretty darn amazing to behold. Razor thin, the colors are as good as you'd hope from a TV with pixel-to-pixel control. Keep in mind, this bad boy will feature a dual-core processor and full 3D support. You'll have to wait until later in 2012 to snag yours and we're sure it'll cost you quite a bit. Go ahead and peek at our shots below and jump past the break for a quick eyes-on.
