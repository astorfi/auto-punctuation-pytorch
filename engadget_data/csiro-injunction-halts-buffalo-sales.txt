 As we reported back in November, Australian company CSIRO has been on the offensive in an attempt to establish their role in the creation of WiFi. Last Friday, CSRIO won another round in the battle by bringing an injunction against Buffalo, promptly halting sale of products in the US and making it very difficult for Buffalo to continue scoring tons of easy money from 802.11a/g-based gear. Buffalo is naturally expected to appeal, but this is pretty clearly a litmus test case for the long list of companies CSRIO has its sights set on -- so who knows what fates are in store for the likes of 3Com, Accton, ASUS, Belkin, D-Link, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Marvell, Microsoft, Netgear, Nintendo, SMC, and Toshiba, all of which have their own case pending with today's court victor.[Thanks, Macris A]
