So when can we get our hands on that new refreshed flavor of iOS? Well, it'll depend on your device of choice. Naturally, it will arrive on the very latest iPhone 5 and retina iPad, but it also will be supported on the iPhone 4 and later, iPad 2 and later, iPad mini and 5th-generation iPods. Developers will get a version for iPhones today, with an iPad iteration coming in the next few weeks. Regular Joes, however, can expect to see an iOS 7 release date sometime this fall.
