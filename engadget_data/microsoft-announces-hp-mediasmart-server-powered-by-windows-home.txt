The new OS version was developed to help consumers deal with managing media across multiple PCs and devices in the home, and will provide automagic backup functionality and remote access as well as central file storage and management. The HP MediaSmart Server itself is going to roll out later this year running the new OS (beyond that Microsoft was slim on other specs), and we hope it's a positive step towards untangling the distributed media madness that describes the current state of many multiple-machine households.
