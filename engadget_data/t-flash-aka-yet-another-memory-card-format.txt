Not that anyone seems to be demanding yet another Flash memory card format, but SanDisk just took the wraps off of T-Flash, which is meant to be used with cellphones. The new format is just 11mm by 15mm, or half the size of a SIM card (i.e. easily lost), and comes in 32MB, 64MB, and 128MB varieties. Motorola is the first cellphone manufacturer to get behind T-Flash, and conveniently, the cards will work in an SD card slot with the proper adapter.
