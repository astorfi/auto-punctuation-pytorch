Better, but the standard allows for less delay. Though it's not clear by looking at it, this handsetdoubles-up as a Linux-based phone we were told although we shudder to think about what that screen will look likepressed hand-to-cheek all day. Anyway, it's just a prototype still and won't hit production status for several monthsyet. For what it's worth, we also caught a peep of this under glass over at T-Mobile. More pics after the break.
