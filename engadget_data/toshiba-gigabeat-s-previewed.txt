 Looks like we aren't alone in our jones for the March release of the Toshiba Gigabeat S Series. CNET needs theirfix so bad that they published a preview of the new player sportin' Microsoft's Portable Media Center software. The praise comes in heaps forToshiba's ability to deliver the "brilliantly simple" PMC software in a compact form factor. They also dig onthe player's range of supported audio and video formats which includes DivX, its support for WMA subscription serviceslike MTV's upcoming Urge, andcompatibility with TivoToGo, Media Center recordings, and thatnew all-you-can-eat StarzVongo subscription movie download service. However, CNET feels the screen and controller are just"decent" and the small buttons along the side are "confusing" causing some practice to masternavigation. We share their hopes that the Gigabeat S might finally be a successful PMC device.
