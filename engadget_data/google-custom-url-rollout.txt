You no longer need to be a star athlete or a pop diva to get a vanity URL on Google+. Even if you're but an Average Joe, you can now get a custom link that's possible to memorize, so long as you meet a handful of (easy) requirements. If you have a profile photo, have 10 or more followers and an account that's at least 30 days old, simply visit your profile to bid the random string of characters on your URL farewell. Brands and businesses, however, need to link to their websites or be verified to enjoy the perk. In case you've yet to see the claim option on your page, sit tight -- Google's rolling the feature out to more accounts throughout the week.
