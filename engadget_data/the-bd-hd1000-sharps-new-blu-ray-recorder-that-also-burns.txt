Sharp's been hinting about making a move into Blu-ray, and the BD-HD1000, their first foray into the market, is a
ferocious beast of an A/V component. It's bad enough that it's a Blu-ray disc recorder with a 160GB hard drive and a
digital TV tuner (so you can record HDTV and then burn them to Blu-ray discs without a loss of quality), but apparently
it can also burn DVDs (it looks as if it has a second tray). But it gets worse. As if you couldn't guess by now, this
one is for Japan only.
