According to a statement received from the company by ComputerWorld, Microsoft had to put things on hold for some time in order to "add some infrastructure support to Microsoft.com properties." The spokeswoman continued by saying that the company "wanted to ensure that customers had the best possible experience when downloading the Beta." Now, however, we're receiving word that everything is back in action, so we'd suggest getting those bits and bytes a-flowin' before we end up in the very same position again. [Via Digg]
