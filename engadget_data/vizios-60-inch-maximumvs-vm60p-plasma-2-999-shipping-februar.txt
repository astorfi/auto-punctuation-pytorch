 Vizio is back at it again, this time promising a new 60-inch plasma HDTV with an MSRP of only $2,999. Of course, for a 60-inch plasma under $3k, you can't have everything, and this set features a native 720p (1366x768) resolution instead of the newer 1080p, but still compares well in terms of price to other sets in its class. The Panasonic TH-58PX60U, and Pioneer Pro-1540HD are a similar size and resolution, but carry MSRPs of $5,499 and $8,000, respectively. Vizio's Maximvs VM60P set pleases with four HDMI inputs, two component inputs, VGA jack and ATSC / QAM / NTSC tuners integrated into the set itself. The included Genesis Faroudja DCDi scaler can accept any signal from 480i to 1080p to display on the 7,000:1 contrast ratio screen with its 1,200 cd/m2 brightness. Like its popular Black Friday 42-inch plasma and 1080p 47-inch LCD, the company aims to bring HDTVs with attractive features at mass market prices. Comparing the price tags, it looks great next to the competition, but we'll see how the picture quality holds up when they start shipping next month.[Via Cnet]
