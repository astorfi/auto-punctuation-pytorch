Nothing here we didn't know or couldn't guess -- Acer's own list of changes from the 8.9-inch Aspire One consists of the screen size and a new Bluetooth module -- but it's nice to see Uncle Sam giving this bad boy the once over before it starts beaming its WiFi terror rays into our homes. Or, you know, running XP to browse Facebook, whatever.[Via mini-notebook-laptop]
