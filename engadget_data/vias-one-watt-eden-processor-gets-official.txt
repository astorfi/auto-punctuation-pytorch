Reportedly, the 500MHz Eden ULV boasts "an idle power of just 0.1-watt," and is targeting "a wide range of industrial, commercial, and ultra mobile applications." The fanless CPU resides within a 21- x 21-millimeter NanoBGA2 package, is manufactured using a 90-nanometer process, and should be on display (and in a number of wee devices) at the Embedded System Conference taking place right now in Taipei.
