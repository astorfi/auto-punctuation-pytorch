This WMC 2005 uber-expensive rack-mount unit is powered by Core 2 Duo Extreme processor, Nvidia's GeForce Series 7 Graphics with, of course, an HDMI output. The series can be configured up to 3TB of storage on a RAID 5 array along with up to 4GB of memory with the goal to provide the best possible media center experience. Niveus is thinking big with that setup along with a pending ISF certification that should scream high-end. The whole get'up is cooled by Niveus proprietary active and passive cooling system called appropriately, Glacier Passive Cooling; these products are in the Rainier lineup after all. The n7 and n9 (pictured) systems don't come cheap as they start out at $6,999 and ascend up to as high as $14,999.Press release photos including back panel shot after the jump
