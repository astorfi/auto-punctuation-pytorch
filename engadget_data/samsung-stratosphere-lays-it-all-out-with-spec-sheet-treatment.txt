 The upcoming Samsung Stratosphere for Verizon Wireless is hardly a secret, but other than a few rumored details, the specs for this LTE-equipped QWERTY slider have remained a bit of a mystery. Now, all that has changed, thanks in large part to its leaked spec sheet from Big Red -- just take a peek after the break. It'll be packing a 4-inch Super AMOLED display with WVGA resolution, a (presumably) single-core 1GHz processor, along with 512MB of RAM, 4GB of internal storage and a 4GB microSD card that's pre-installed. Curiously, it'll be the first of Verizon's LTE phones to incorporate a Micro SIM in place of the larger, traditional offering. Other than that, it looks as if the speculation of Android 2.3, along with its 5MP rear / 1.3MP front cams were dead on. There will also be an LED flash in tow, although video capture will be limited to a rather mundane 480p. That said, if you're thirsting for speed but are needing a keyboard, the Stratosphere is looking like your obvious (albeit only) choice.
