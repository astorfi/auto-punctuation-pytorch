 While it's not exactly a surprise that the Blu-ray folks are getting in yet another tussle with their counterparts in the HD DVD camp, the latest comments by the Blu-Ray Disc Association's European Chariman Frank Simonis do up the ante quite a bit, with some alleged misrepresentation of data on the HD DVD Group's part drawing most of his ire. More specifically, according to Tech.co.uk, Simonis is upset at the significantly higher "attach rate" that the European HD DVD Group recently touted, which Simonis now says was a "gross misrepresentation of data." Simonis goes on to claim that the HD DVD Group "manipulated" the data, adding that, "you can see this because they did not even supply access to the original source of their numbers." As if that wasn't enough, he then further slams the HD DVD folks by saying, "Honest to God, the Blu-ray Disc Association would never do this. We've seen so much rubbish come from the HD DVD Group it's unbelievable."[Thanks, Micheal]
