This here is allegedly the "Lizzy," successor to the M600i UIQ smartphone that's been kicking around overseas for a while now. We're digging the looks, but with HSDPA and a camera both still missing in action, the internals seem to be only marginally upgraded at best. If this is all legit -- and it looks legit enough for Sony Ericsson's latest round of offerings -- we can apparently expect it to drop later in '07.
