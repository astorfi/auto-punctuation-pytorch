Nokia may see a surge of Windows Phone apps on the horizon, but it's not waiting for that deluge before it offers further app advice to new Lumia owners. Its new App Social Beta improves on App Highlights by crowdsourcing suggestions. Users create and follow app lists whose popularity determines which titles rise to the top; there's also a news feed for those who only want to see recommendations from friends and favorite curators. There's no guarantee that Nokia will help you find that perfect Instagram substitute, but App Social Beta's immediate availability in 14 countries may keep the search time to a minimum.
