A handful of reviews have hit the interwebs, and the none too startling consensus is you'll be paying for the best here, especially with configuration options that can slot up to $5,000 -- CNET Australia suggests looking at the ASUS W90 if you want a better bang for your buck. The capacitive buttons above the keyboard aren't too responsive, there's no multitouch, and Hot Hardware noticed some flex in the center of the keyboard, but on the flip side, you'll be running full HD video and the most taxing games with little to no strain -- and if you like your keyboard to look like a light show, there's eight different sections to customize with different-colored LEDs.
