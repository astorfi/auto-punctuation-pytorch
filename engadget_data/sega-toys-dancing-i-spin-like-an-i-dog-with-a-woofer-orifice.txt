 
Move over Rolly, there's a cheaper, craplasticer bot ready to stomp out your game. Sega Toys just announced their Â¥5,250 ($51) I-Spin dancing robot. Apparently it responds to ambient sounds by rolling around and flipping its ears in time with the beat. After that novelty wears thin, you can directly attach the creature to any audio source where it will live out its remaining years as an external speaker.
