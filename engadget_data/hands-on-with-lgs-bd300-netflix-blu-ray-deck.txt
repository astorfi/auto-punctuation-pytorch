Not one to just roll over and accept a command, we casually walked over to the other BD300 kiosk, flashed the Engadget gang sign to the much kinder rep, and continued on to snap a few shots of the new box. The unit set up was fully functional and able to stream Netflix movies, and it even detected the network connection before playing in order to deliver the best quality without introducing skips and stutters. Feel free to get all up in your monitor when checking out the gallery below, we won't hassle ya. One love.
