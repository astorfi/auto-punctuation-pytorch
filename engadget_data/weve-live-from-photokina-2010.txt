       
KÃ¶ln. Home to some of the best pommes frites this world has ever seen, and this year, home to Photokina 2010. We're live on the ground in one of Germany's most charming cities, bringing you the latest from the photography world as it breaks. Fujifilm has already kicked things off with a relative bang, and a slew of press events are slated to happen over the next 48 hours. Sony, LaCie, Leica, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Hasselblad are all on deck (with Samsung and Casio already in the bag), and we're expecting plenty more surprises once the show floor opens in earnest tomorrow. Keep it locked on our Photokina 2010 tag page for all the latest -- it's good for the shutterbug's soul.
