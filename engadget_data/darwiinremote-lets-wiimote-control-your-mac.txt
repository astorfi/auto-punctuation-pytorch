Aside from sensor bar, um, mods, and tricky wrist strap fixes, a few engineering minds have even found the Wiimote (somewhat) useful on a PC. Per usual, the endearing Mac crowd is up to the challenge as well, as Hiroaki has unveiled an admittedly "unstable" piece of OS X-friendly software to allow Nintendo's Wiimote to mimic the Apple Remote. While the possibilities for a more fleshed-out version are certainly obvious, the current build sports a full key map to help you push aside that delayed Apple Remote purchase, and reportedly allows you to mouse around a bit (albeit shakily). While the exact details are a bit scant at this point, the DarwiinRemote will purportedly work with IR-equipped Macs, as well as ones with Bluetooth, so be sure and hit the read link to get your download on.[Via TUAW]
