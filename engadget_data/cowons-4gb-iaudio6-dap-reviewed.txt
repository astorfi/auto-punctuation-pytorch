Especially impressive is the1.3-inch OLED screen, which gets high marks for both color depth and clarity -- ABi calls it "simplybrilliant" -- and makes watching XviD-encoded movies almost bearable on such a small display. The iAudio6, whichwe first spotted at CES, can handleup to 4GB of MP3, WMA, OGG, FLAC, or WAV-encoded tracks on its .85-inch drive, but it's the drive that leads to one ofthe few knocks on this model, which is a noticeable lag time between operations. Other nice features include USB hostcapability for device-to-device file transfer with other UMS-enabled hardware, software that automatically tags certaintunes with the corresponding lyrics, line-in and voice recording, and surprisingly powerful output that can drive evenlarge headphones. If you don't mind a bit of a delay when recording or changing tracks, or a bit of eye strain whenwatching your flicks, then the iAudio6 sounds like it'll make for a solid purchase whenever it becomes availableStateside.[Thanks, James]
