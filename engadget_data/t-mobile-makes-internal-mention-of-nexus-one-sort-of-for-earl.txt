That would line up with information we'd previously received reporting to some sort of January 5 launch, and we can only assume they're talking about the Nexus One here -- though the name could still change by the time this hits retail channels. Interestingly, T-Mobile calls out that Google and HTC will be directly responsible for support on the handset, bypassing T-Mobile for everything other than wireless service -- the great "dumb pipe" dream, realized. Stay tuned, because it looks like this is all about to get real.
