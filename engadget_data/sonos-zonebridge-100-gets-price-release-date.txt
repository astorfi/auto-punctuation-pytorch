According to Automated Home, the BR100 "will be available from October 24th and will have a retail price in the UK of Â£69" (it'll be $99 here in the US). Furthermore, the box will reportedly enable Sonos users to "extend the range of their Sonos system without having to sacrifice a proper ZonePlayer," or it could be used "in between two zones that are too far apart to link currently."
