The budget (for photographers, at least) full-frame camera is expected to come with a 24.7-megapixel sensor, a 3.2-inch LCD display and a built-in autofocus motor. What makes us hopeful of its rapid arrival is today's earlier announcement concerning the FX-compatible Nikkor 24-85mm lens -- the pair combined would make a devastating duo if the company hits the mark on pricing. Those in the market for a gentle introduction to DSLRs can take a peak at another picture after the break.
