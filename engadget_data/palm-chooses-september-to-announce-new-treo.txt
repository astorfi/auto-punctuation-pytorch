 One might argue we've collected enough intelligence at this point to make an official announcement ourselves, but according to a Reuters report, Palm has committed to unveiling at least one of its next-gen Treos for reals (without our help) next month. From the way Palm is talking, it sounds like this debut will be for the Windows Mobile-based UMTS model first mentioned for Vodafone in July, though we're guessing Cingular's Treo 750 isn't far behind (right, Palm?). Other than that tidbit, Palm's asking us all to patiently wait for the September 12 when the press releases start flying -- but one thing we can say with near certainty is that there won't be a stub antenna anywhere in sight.[Thanks, Dave]
