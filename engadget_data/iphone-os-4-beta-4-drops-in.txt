That also means that you'll likely be interested to hear that beta 4 is now out and ready for you to download, install, and not brick your phone if everything goes according to plan, just as long as you've got access to an Apple iPhone Developer Program account. Go forth, intrepid readers -- and do report back on your exploits, won't you?
