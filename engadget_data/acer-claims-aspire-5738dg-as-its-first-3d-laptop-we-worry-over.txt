We're pretty sure the line was somewhere back there, and now it's been decidedly crossed. Acer's Aspire 5738DG (not to be confused with the two-dee Aspire 5738PG) is the company's first portable machine to utilize its 3D CineReal technology, which is little more than a "3D coating" on the display that gives off mind-bending effects when viewed with a pair of polarized eyeglasses. The 2D-to-3D conversion takes place thanks to the bundled TriDef 3D Experience software (meaning that no special GPU is needed), and while we are told that the rig will be based around a Centrino 2 platform with up to 4GB of RAM, the only other information we're given is a NZ$1,999 ($1,484) price tag. Now, if only we could decide if laughing or crying would be the appropriate reaction here...[Via Pocket-lint]
