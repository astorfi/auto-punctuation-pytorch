Just an innocuous boating photo, you say? Not quite. That's Microsoft's Joe Belfiore on the left, and his companions recently took both this snapshot and one other using a Nokia Lumia 1020 -- a phone that doesn't officially exist yet. While there aren't many clues to the 1020's camera performance in Belfiore's Flickr pages, the image metadata shows both a wide-aperture f/2.2 lens as well as cropped 3.7MP and 5MP image sizes. Whether or not the photo posts are accidents or deliberate teases, we're likely to learn more about the new Lumia on July 11th.
