There have been persistent rumors of an upgraded Acer Iconia W3 tablet with an IPS display and, quite possibly, a faster Bay Trail-based processor. Those rumors are now reality, as Bouweenpc.nl has just tried an unannounced Iconia W4 at an Intel event. True to expectations, the 8-inch device was carrying both the new 1.33GHz Atom Z3740 processor and a much improved "wide view angle" (read: IPS) screen. Not much else may change, however -- the pre-release slate still carried the W3's 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Given that the W4 is running Windows 8.1, we wouldn't be surprised if it reaches the market sometime around the Windows update's launch in October. Check out Bouweenpc.nl's hands-on video after the break.
