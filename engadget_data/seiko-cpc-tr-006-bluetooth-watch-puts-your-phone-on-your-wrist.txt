If youwant to go all Dick Tracy, check out Seiko's CPC TR-006, a Bluetooth watch that communicates with your cellphone.Currently just a prototype, the watch can receive text messages from your phone, capture Caller ID data so you knowwho's calling, and adjust ringtones. Pair it with a Bluetooth headset, stick your phone in your bag, and you've got acomplete hands-free interface that still gives you access to your phone's main functions.
