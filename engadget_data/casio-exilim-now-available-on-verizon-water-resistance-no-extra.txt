 
Long rumored as the C721, Casio's pivoting EXILIM clamshell is now available to all comers on Verizon. Though the camera goes way up to 5.1 megapixels with autofocus, image stabilization, and a 3x optical zoom, the phone doesn't stray too far from its G'zOne roots -- it's mil-spec 810F compliant for dust, shock, temperature, and water resistance. It also features expandability up to 8GB (something you'll likely need if you're taking advantage of that cam) and compatibility with Verizon's VZ Navigator service. If you really need to be taking pictures in the shower, the pleasure's going to cost you: expect to pay $279.99 on contract after rebate.
