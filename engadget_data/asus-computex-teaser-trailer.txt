Just like last year, ASUS is filling time before the Computex trade show by posting teaser trailers. Sporting a "We Transform" tag, its first one for 2013 features the spun metal casings, touchscreen laptops, convertibles, tablets and phones we've become accustomed to from the company. So what's next? The video doesn't appear to provide any hints -- other than an oddly blacked-out tablet with stylus about 30 seconds in -- however the press page linked below includes a countdown to ASUS' press conference June 3rd, and blank spaces for four more videos to come. We'll keep an eye out for anything else that fills in the blanks (US release info for the Transformer Book would do the trick), check the video after the break to "transform your expectations of technology."
