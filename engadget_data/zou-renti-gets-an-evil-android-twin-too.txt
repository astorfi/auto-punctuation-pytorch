The model, with a skin of silica gel which supposedly moves with lifelike movements, apparently doesn't have a name, but with looks like these we suppose it just passes itself off as Zou Renti when performing its nefarious deeds. In fact, we'd almost go so far as to suggest this bot has successfully navigated the uncanny valley, 'cause we're having a pretty dang hard time telling which of these guys is which here. Renti and his clone are currently hanging out at the 2006 China Robot Expo in Beijing -- tomorrow the world![Via The Raw Feed]
