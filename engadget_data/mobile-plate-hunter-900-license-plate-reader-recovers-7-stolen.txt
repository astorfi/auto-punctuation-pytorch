Out in the land where the automobile is King (you know we're talking about California, right?), the LA County
Sheriff's Department has begun field testing a license plate scanning device called the Mobile Plate Hunter 900.
Apparently in just one night of use (which is based on the Italian post office's character recognition systems) the
device was able to accurately scan over 12,000 license platesâ€”which resulted in seven stolen car recoveries, and helped
the po-po in making three arrests (including two parolees who showed up at a parole officer's joint in a stolen
hooptie). Car thieves privacy advocates, start your engines!
