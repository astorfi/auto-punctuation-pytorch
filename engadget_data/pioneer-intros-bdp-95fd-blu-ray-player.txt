As Pioneer is quick to boast, this is apparently the first such player to offer bitstream output of "all advanced audio formats" including Dolby    TrueHD, Dolby Digital+, DTS-HD    High Resolution, and DTS-HD Master Audio. Otherwise, the player will give you full 1080p24 video, along with HDMI 1.3 connectivity (including HDMI-CEC technology), and Pioneer's "exclusive" Home Media Gallery, which will let you network the player with your computer or other DLNA-compliant gear. Just don't expect to be able to do all that on the cheap, with the player set to pack a $1,000 price tag when it's released in October.
