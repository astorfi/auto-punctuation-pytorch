The full-frame shooter updates the original 5D introduced back in 2005 with a 24 x 36mm 21.1 megapixel CMOS sensor, DIGIC 4 processor with 14-bit analog-to-digital conversion, and the ability to capture Full HD 1,920 x 1,080 video -- take that Nikon D90 and your paltry 720p. We're talking expanded 50-25,600 ISO range,15-point autofocus with 9 selectable AF points, 3-inch Live View LCD offering 4x the pixels of the original 5D, and a 3.9fps burst for unlimited JPEGs or up to 14 RAW images when using a UDMA CF card.With regard to video leaked predicted by RED CEO last week, the EOS 5D Mark II captures Full HD video at 30fps as well as VGA / 30fps for the first time on any Canon SLR. Of course, it works with any of Canon's 60 EF lenses (and whatever Carl Zeiss cooks up) for ultra-wide-angle, fish-eye, macro, and super-telephoto videography. Video can be recorded at up to 4GB per clip which is equivalent to about 12 minutes of Full HD video or 24 minutes in VGA. Video clips are recorded in .MOV format using MPEG-4 video compression and linear PCM audio. You can even record with external stereo mics attached to an input terminal.At the end of November, Canon will sell the body-only for $2,699 or bundled with Canon's 24-105mm f/4L IS USM zoom lens for $3,499. Welcome back to the show Canon, we were starting to worry.
