The event invite goes on to say that they'll show "that the impossible is possible," which could very well mean the Epic 4G is getting Froyo. Burn! Also look for guest David Blaine to hold his breath in a tank of things that bite for 45 minutes or so, which will make for an awesome liveblog (yes, we'll be there).
