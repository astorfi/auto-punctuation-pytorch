The Aspire One D150 lineup hits the streets of France beginning in February with the D150-0B. This €329 ($425) netbook sports a 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270 processor, 1GB memory, 160GB hard drive, a 10.1-inch (1024 x 600) display, and a 3-cell battery. Then in March, the D150-1B makes its appearance. An enhanced version of the D150, this device is otherwise identical, save a 6-cell battery that should be good for up to 7 hours -- the battery upgrade will set you back a cool €349 ($450). Lastly, the D150-2BG will be rocking an Intel Atom 1.66GHz N280 processor and sports integrated 3G quadband UMTS/HSDPA mobile broadband, and the 6-cell battery. Also available in March, this one has a price tag of €449 ($575). No word on a domestic street date, but you'll know as soon as we do.
