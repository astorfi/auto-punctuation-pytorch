Looks like the officers in blue want to get in on that
RFID implant craze that is all the rage. Bergen County
Police Chief Jack Schmidig has volunteered to reprazent for the law enforcement sector by having the
VeriChip implantable ID injected in his arm. Now, if he
takes a bullet in the line of duty, all his medical records will be right with him â€” it's like these RFID chips are the
ultimate man-purse. Little. Invisible. Different. Of course, being invisible and all, how exactly is the hospital going
to know to look for the chip in the first place? Do U.S. hospitals happen to have RFID-scanning infrastructure lying
around just in case one of the 50-odd chipped individuals walks in, or does the implant actually leave the Mark of the
Beast so they can tell on sight?
