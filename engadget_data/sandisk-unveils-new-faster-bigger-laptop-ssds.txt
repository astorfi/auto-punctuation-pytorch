The company has announced a new line of 2.5-inch and 1.8-inch SSDs for laptops of various sizes. The three new models come in 60GB, 120GB, and 240GB flavors, priced at $149, $249, and $499 respectively. Great values, by the sounds, and with 200MB/sec read and 140MB/sec writes, great performance, too. We can't wait to do some evaluating of our own when these start appearing inside laptops sometime toward the middle of this year.
