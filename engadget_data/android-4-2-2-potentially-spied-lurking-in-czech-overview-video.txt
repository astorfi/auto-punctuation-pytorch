 There's still some doubt as to whether or not Android 4.2.2 is real, or just a figment of the imagination for Nexus 4 owners wanting the latest code. While we can't guarantee that last group's satisfaction just yet, SmartMania.cz may have provided the next best thing. As part of an overview of the Nexus 4, the Czech site ever-so-casually shows at the 6:30 mark that its device is running the unannounced OS. The 4.2.2 sighting is almost incidental to the rest of the clip, although the time given to the rest of the software suggests there's no major differences visible to the everyday observer. We've reached out to Google and will let you know if the firmware is authentic and coming to other devices. In the meantime, the latest batch of potential evidence is visible after the break.
