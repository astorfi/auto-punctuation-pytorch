Now, from here it's a little difficult to tell of these new shots of the ONE in the wild indicate that it's much closer to completion than it was a few months ago, but we hope they move fast and get this thing out because in a couple months the Zune and the MusicGremlin (and maybe even the wireless iPod) could make this device's big selling point, the Shareport USB file swapping system, a little shall we say, démodé.[Via DAPreview]
