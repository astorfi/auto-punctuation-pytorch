The OnePlus One has been sort of an underground hit, namely due to the fact you could only purchase the handset with an invite. Thankfully, if you've had your eyes on it for a while, OnePlus just revealed that its $300 Android smartphone is, more or less, ready to go mainstream next week, on October 27th. Pre-orders for the newly announced general availability are set to go live that day at 11AM ET, which is great news to people who haven't had a chance to jump on the invite-only wave. The bad news, however, is that this is going to be limited to a one-hour window. For now, OnePlus is continuing to take invites, so that's still an option to those with access to one. "While the pre-order system won't completely replace the current invites method, it is certainly a huge step towards expanding the reach of OnePlus," the company said in a blog post.



          
 
 
 It may not be the best solution to keep up with the high demand -- but, at the very least, it's a better option than to be hunting for an invite. Those interested need to keep this page here bookmarked -- that's where the pre-orders are expected to be taken in due time.
