 Apparently, the Big N has had just about enough of all this Vii / Wu nonsense, as it has recently announced plans to launch the real deal (that'd be the Wii) in China next year. According to company president Satoru Iwata, Nintendo is planning to bring its hotter-than-hot console to China and South Korea in 2008, just as soon as the whole "global shortage" thing gets worked out. Furthermore, he stated that its current priority was to "deliver as many consoles as it could to existing markets," but we're still betting that these things will be a coveted commodity this holiday season.
