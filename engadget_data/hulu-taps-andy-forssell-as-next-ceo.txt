 We've known since early January that Hulu CEO Jason Kilar will step down sometime in the first quarter, and now that we're well into March, the streaming service has additional news. Writing on the Hulu blog, Kilar said that when he departs "at the end of this quarter," senior vice president of content Andy Forssell will assume the role of CEO. In addition to praising Forssell's efforts in expanding Hulu's list of content partners, Kilar mentioned that Hulu part-owners Disney and News Corporation are finalizing "forward-looking plans" with the site. The exiting CEO isn't exactly leaving a company in a shambles; the 2012 financial results were none too shabby, and the paid Hulu Plus service has ballooned to a healthy 3 million users.
