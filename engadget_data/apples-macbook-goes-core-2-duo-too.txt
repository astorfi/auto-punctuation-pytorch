Previously maxing out with a 2GHz Core Duo proc, the 13.3-inch MacBook can now boast of a 2GHz Core 2 Duo processor under the hood. $1099 remains the entry fee, only now that buys a 1.83GHz C2D and same 512MB DDR2 SDRAM, 60GB 5400RPM SATA disk, combo optical drive, GMA950 graphics, and 802.11g WiFi -- though we wonder if they snuck in some 802.11n support as well. Optionally, a new 200GB 4200RPM SATA disk is available. Size and weight all remain the same as does the battery, apparently. The 2.33GHz C2D proc is still only available on the MacBook Pro. So besides the new processor, nothing else has really changed. Now hurry on over to the Apple Store kids for a 25 10ish percent performance bump (likely) of your very own.
