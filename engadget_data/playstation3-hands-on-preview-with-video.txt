We shot some video (yes, us) and have a some notes on the hardware after the break, so check it out!P.S. -Our flash video isn't the highest quality / res. If you want the best looking video of the PS3, check out the VGA h.264 file below.Download videoMOV (h.264) - VGA, QVGAAVI (DivX) - VGA, QVGAMusic: Christopher Willits - Colors Shifting (Ghostly International)
 

If nothing else, it's certainly something to behold.Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to video the slot loading drive in the PS3, but there isn't much to write about it. Anyone who's ever had a slot loading laptop knows the deal. It was a bit loud, but did the trick.The port config, as we all well know by now.That's a lot of logos.The thing about the PS3, it's definitely optimized for heat. Without looking too much like the Mac cheesegrater, this thing is really set up for unconstricted airflow -- a far cry from its original, smoother design. During our play time, the unit remained relatively cool -- as cool, if not cooler than the Xbox 360. The eject and power buttons aren't tactile, but they are touch sensitive.Here we've got the CF, SD / miniSD, and Memory Stick slots, as well as the four USB ports, hard drive indicator, and wireless indicator.We're not 100% sure, but we think this is where the hard drive's at. We understand it may be removable, more on that shortly.
