Version 2.0 adds two features that should make it easier for property managers to interact with guests efficiently, including the ability to update calendar availability and pre-approve users from any compatible Android handset -- that latter feature hit the iOS app in December. There are also quite a few bug fixes in tow, according to the release notes -- push notifications should now be working, for example. The focus here is on host usability, however. According to a TechCrunch report, only five percent of hosts current use the Android app, and while these additions should streamline operation, they're unlikely to account for a major shift from the web interface.
