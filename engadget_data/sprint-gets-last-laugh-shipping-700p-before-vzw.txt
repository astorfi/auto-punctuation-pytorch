Even though Verizon just "announced" 700p availability, their phones are shipping shipping in 3-4 weeks, while Sprint is still on track for the end of this month. These ship dates are from Palm itself, and we think they'd be in the know if anyone is, so we're going to put our necks out one more time and proclaim Sprint as the (probable) first to ship the 700p.[Thanks, Dave Z.]
