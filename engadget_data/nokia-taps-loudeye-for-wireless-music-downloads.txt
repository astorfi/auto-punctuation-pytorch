Not to be outdone by the recent tie-up between Apple and Motorola to get iTunes onto cellphones, Nokia has cut a
deal with Loudeye, a company which doesn't sell music downloads directly to consumers but helps other company set up
their own online music stores and distribution systems. This doesn't mean that Nokia is planning to set up an online
music store for cellphones of their own that might someday compete with Apple's iTunes Music Store, though. It's more
likely that Nokia is trying to lay the groundwork for the wireless carriers to do it themselves (who think they'll be
able to make money selling wireless music downloads to their subscribers), in order to induce the carriers to buy more
Nokia cellphones. Loudeye might not sit at the cool kid's table like Apple, but at least Nokia realizes that if the
carriers don't get their cut they won't let anyone
put iTunes (or any other music download software) on the handsets they're offering to their subscribers.
