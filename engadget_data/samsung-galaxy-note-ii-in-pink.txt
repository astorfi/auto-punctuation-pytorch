 To say that we've covered many, many rosey devices around here still wouldn't do the statement justice, so don't mind our slight excitement after seeing the Galaxy Note II show up wearing a very pink outfit on Samsung's Taiwanese site. Clearly, the phone tablet slab looks to follow in the footsteps of its other galactic siblings, the OG Note and GS3, and, in the process, looks to give an extra hue option to those who prefer something a little different than the more traditional colors, or even the newer amber brown and ruby wine. Since Samsung hasn't made an official announcement yet, however, availability details are still relatively unknown, so we'll have to wait to see whether or not this light pink Galaxy Note II ever makes it past the Taiwan page and onto others. In the meantime, perhaps you'd like to mosey past the break, where a rather glamorous press shot gallery awaits.
