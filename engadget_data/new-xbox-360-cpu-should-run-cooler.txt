 Even though we've been able tokeep our Xbox 360 from overheating by slapping on a Nyko Intercooler and dangling the power brick out a window,360-lovers who can't take the heat will be happy to learn of Microsoft's plans to release a cooler-running 'box nextyear. Although the CPU upgrade, which takes advantage of a 65-nanometer manufacturing technique, may not be a directresponse to what the company has said areonly sporadic reports of overheating, the end result will be less heat dissipation due to lower power consumption.Like the current chips manufactured using 90-nanometer technology, the new CPUs will be produced by both developer IBMand OEM Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, and are not expected to offer significantly improved performance, toensure compatibility with current titles.[Via Joystiq]
