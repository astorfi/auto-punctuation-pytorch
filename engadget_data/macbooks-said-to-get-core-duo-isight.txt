 
Information (ortotally baseless and unfounded rumors, depending on how you look at it) is starting to flow about Apple's upcomingconsumer laptops, which we previously learned would sport13.3-inch displays and would be manufactured for Apple by Taiwan's Asustek. According to AppleInsider, the new MacBooks(and, yes, it looks like that will almost certainly be the name, as Apple continues to consolidate all of its computersunder the "Mac" brand) will indeed have that 13.3-inch widescreen display, along with Core Duo processorsrunning at 1.67 GHz or higher. That should be good news to those who speculated that, like the entry-level Macmini, the MacBooks would be limited to Core Solo chips. Other specs are expected to include a built-in iSightcamera, magnetic latch and MagSafe power adapter. AppleInsider also says that the computers are due to be announcedsooner than the June timeframe claimed in earlier rumors. One thing we can confirm is that the new laptops won'tinclude Lenovo's patented armor andhoverjets, so be sure to keep them away from Hummers.("MacBook" design by William W from our WWJD 3contest.)
