As you may be able to glimpse in the picture above, this one is actually the U120H with built-in 3G, but the differences between the two apparently stop there, with each boasting otherwise identical specs and innards. There's not too many other surprises either, as you might expect, but modders will no doubt at least be pleased to see that the system seems to be about as accessible as its predecessor. Hit up the link below for a closer look.[Thanks, Johan]
