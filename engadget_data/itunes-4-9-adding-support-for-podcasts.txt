Hugeness: Steve Jobs just revealed at the D: All Things Digital Conference that iTunes 4.9 will add support for
podcasts. With one click you'll be able to subscribe to different feeds and have them automatically delivered to your
iPod without using a third-party app like iPodder. You'll be able to search through a directory of available podcasts
(producers will be able to register their podcasts with the iTunes Music Store), but users will have the option of
adding whatever feeds they want to iTunes. The other big news: Jobs says that he would consider selling podcasts
through the iTunes Music Store, something which should have Audible just a little worried.
