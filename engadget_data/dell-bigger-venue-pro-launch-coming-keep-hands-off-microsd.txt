Fear not, though: as Dell tells it, the company has production ramped up for a "timely" launch on T-Mobile's network. When? Won't say. Holiday season, at least? No release windows is given. And one more thing, too... Dell read our piece on the Windows Phone 7 microSD and wants you all to know that, no, you shouldn't mess with the Venue Pro's card, either. There's no eject mechanism, and that's supposed to be a not-so-subtle hint to stay back. Consider yourself warned, again.
