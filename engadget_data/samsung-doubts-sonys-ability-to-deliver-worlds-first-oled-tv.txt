Well S.Korea's consumer electronics giant Samsung, just threw down the gauntlet on Japan's CE giant by publicly doubting Sony's ability to deliver before 2008. Yoo Eui-jin, Samsung VP and head of Samsung SDI's OLED team, said "I hope Sony will really do it, but considering circumstances, I doubt they will be able to start selling it this year. Maybe it would be possible for them to make a hundred or a thousand units as artifacts, but no more than that." Bitter at the prospects of losing a "world's first _____" title are we Samsung? Oh man, game on.[Via Afterdawn]
