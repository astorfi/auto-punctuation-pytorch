 We knew that Redbox Instant would be coming to Xbox 360, it was specifically betrayed by a leak way back in November and the company has been pretty up front about the planned support. Now the app is available through Xbox Live, delivering its streaming library to millions of Microsoft gamers. The $8 a month service just became available to the public during the last week. If you're curious, but not quite ready to add another subscription to your life, Xbox Live Gold customers can enjoy a free trial of 4,600 unlimited streaming titles (though the 4,000-plus movies available for purchase or rent will still set you back a few more bucks). To try it out yourself hit up the Xbox Live Marketplace, where you'll also find the newly launched GameTrailers app.
