In the coming months, both Estée Lauder and Lancôme are planning to launch vibrating mascaras (stock image used), both of which require batteries and promise to cover way more ground than your unstable hand ever could. The former company will be introducing the TurboLash All Effects Motion Mascara, which will retail for $30 at Saks Fifth Avenue and buzz along at 125 micropulses-per-second; the latter will be churning out the cleverly named Ôscillation, which aims to provide "a 360-degree coat around each and every lash" when it launches this fall. We know -- we just got way too kit 'n kaboodle for most of y'all, but your lady friend(s) would appreciate the gesture.[Via CNET]
