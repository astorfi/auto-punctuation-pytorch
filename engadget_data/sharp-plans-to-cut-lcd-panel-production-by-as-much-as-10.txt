As with practically every other flat-panel manufacturer out there, Sharp is feeling the pinch of the worldwide economic crisis, and as demand weakens for LCD TVs / LCD monitors, it's looking like now is an opportune time to slow things down. Purportedly, the company is considering scaling back production by as much as 10% from mid-December, though it is still expecting to reach sales of 11 million LCD TVs in the year ending March 2009.
