If you really don't want to mess around and want to do this whole "digital home entertainment hub" thing right,
Niveus has a new A/V Storage Server with a proper terabyte of storage that you connect to your home network and that we
really, really hope will finally be enough space for all of your music, digital photos, and video files. It's fanless,
so it runs almost silently, and comes with their Personal Server software so you can remotely access your collection
from anywhere. You better be serious, though, because this thing'll set you back three large.
