The demand is obviously there for a laptop drive that, according toSamsung, would consume less than 5 percent of the juice of regular hard drives, and weigh less than half, not be nearlyas susceptible to shock or climate, or emit the same heat or noise. No, it won't be cheap (yet), but sooner or laterflash memory will be the only thing anyone uses, and Samsung really wants to get this show on the road already.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
