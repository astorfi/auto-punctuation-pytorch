There are a few other updates included as well, but for those who have TVs that support it, they can now enjoy movies with one less conversion than before. Of course the real question is, will you notice a difference?

If your player is connected to your network, just check for an update tomorrow and you'll be all set, otherwise follow the read link and download the iso image.[Via FormatWarCentral]
