The latest word on the street has the device possibly getting launched some time in the next 30 to 60 days. In case you don't remember, we'll jog your memory and run down some of the features: a dual band 800 / 1900 MHz CDMA radio for the States, GSM / GPRS support for international roaming, trackball navigation, OS 4.2, media player, and removable memory. Don't start bookin' those flights just yet, but things are definitely looking up, eh?[Thanks, HTC Kid]
