Ouch. The S-Class 3D UI drew particular scorn for being "cumbersome," and the browser was "sluggish" and "uncomfortable," taking some 30-40 seconds to render pages. There were some positives, though: the camera was solid, and the Dolby Mobile-enabled media player impressed, but overall the phone scored a 7 out of 10 on potential alone -- let's hope LG can improve things next time around.[Via Slashgear]
