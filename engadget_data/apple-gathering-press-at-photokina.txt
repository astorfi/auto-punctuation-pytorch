 In their first Photokina showing, well, ever, Apple is for whatever reason gathering press to make some kind of presentation on September 25th -- the day before the show begins. Before your fanciful self starts dreaming up gorgeous new video iPods or revamped Apple QuickTakes, do keep in mind that something having to do with the floundering Aperture and their software push into professional image production is a little more likely than, say, an iPhone announcement. Don't worry, you'll get your fall / winter Apple lineup soon enough, says we.[Thanks, Jay]
