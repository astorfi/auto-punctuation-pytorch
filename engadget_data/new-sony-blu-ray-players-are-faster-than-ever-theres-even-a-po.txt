 
Sony continues to push Blu-ray players forward with four new players for 2011 ranging from $150 to $250 and all ship in the first half of the year. The BDP-S780 begs the highest price of its brothers but for that you also get the ability to use a 720p camera to Skype with your friends and it even converts 2D content to 3D. The entire line supports the new Media Remote for iPhone and Android phones, and the Android version even has voice control. Also new this year is a 10.1-inch WSVGA portalbe Blu-ray player with a 5-hour battery which is set to ship in the Spring for $300. Lastly there are a slew of home theater systems sporting Blu-ray players, but if you are really interested in them, you'll have to read through press release after the break.
