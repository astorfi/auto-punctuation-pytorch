If you've long suspected that Grand Theft Auto V would reach next-gen consoles and the PC, you were on the mark -- Sony and Rockstar have confirmed that the open-world crime saga is coming to the PlayStation 4, PC and Xbox One this fall. Moreover, any progress you've made in Grand Theft Auto Online on the PS3 or Xbox 360 carries over to its next-gen equivalents. How nice is that? In a blog post, Rockstar says the upgraded versions will have "across-the-board graphical and technical improvements to deliver a stunning new level of detail. Increased draw distances, finer texture details, denser traffic, and enhanced resolutions." That's not all though, since the gameplay will have all the new features added since the originals released, and extra tweaks to things like weather, damage, wildlife and more. Check out a brief clip of the new version after the break (look at all that traffic!).
