 Remember how Singapore was going to provide WiFi for most of the island nation? Well, it looks like they're taking that one step further by taking the S$100 million ($63 million) cost to the government, eating it, and giving free access (for the next two to three years) to the laptop-toting public. Further, the government will provide subsidies on computer purchases for low-income families -- according to The Straits Times, families that earn less than S$200 ($125) a month can purchase a computer for S$285 ($179). Why can't we get such forward-thinking policies over on this side of the Pacific?[Via MuniWireless]
