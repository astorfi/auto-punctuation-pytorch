Freetalk's Everyman HD (Talk-7140) features on-board H.264 hardware encoding for up to 720p video at 22fps, with minimum system requirements of WIndows XP, 1GB RAM and a dual core 2GHz CPU. Apparently, Mac users (OS X 10.4 or better) can expect VGA quality at 30fps (sorry, guys). Available soon, pre-order now for $50.
