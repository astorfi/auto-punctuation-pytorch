 Come on Everex, first the CloudBook would be available on January 25th, then February 15th, now the 25th? And to think that you announced this before the Eee PC. How can we trust you? Here, take back your ring, this ol' girl can't wait forever. Update: Uh, Everex, please put down the Whiskey. Now your site says 1/25/2008 at Wal-mart.com. Definitely no CloudBook at Wallys.[Thanks, JAmerican]
