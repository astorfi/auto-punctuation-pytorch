That word comes from the folks at MacWorld, who ran some benchmarks and found that 2.13GHz white MacBook was about five percent faster than the 2GHz unibody MacBook on average. That's obviously largely attributable to the faster processor, but the speedier 800MHz DDR2 memory didn't hurt things either, even if it still lags a bit behind the unibody's 1,066MHz DDR3 RAM. For comparison's sake, Macworld also found that the 1.8GHz MacBook Air was a full 12 percent slower than the white MacBook, while the 2.4GHz MacBook Pro offered a 10.5 percent performance gain, and displayed an even bigger advantage when its higher-end graphics came into play.
