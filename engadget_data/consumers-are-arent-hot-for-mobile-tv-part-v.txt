 Like those Jupiter Research surveyresults we've seen before, Amberlight consultancy firm tells us that consumers do indeed want mobiletelevision. However, they are put-off by poorly designed devices and lackluster services associated with those 3Gstreaming TeeVee solutions. They found current offerings to suffer from patchy 3G reception, slow startup times rangingfrom 2 and 5 minutes, and overly complicated usage experiences lacking on-screen displays and EPGs. Certainly, much ofthis is already being addressed by next-generation handsets with integrated digital TV tunersfor accessing new broadcast, mobile TV solutions over DVB-H, T-DMB, andMediaFLOÂ  -- so we're not overly concerned.After-all, Amberlight says their research, uh, "proves" that there is consumer demand for mobile TV if onlyoperators can offer services which are "easy to use" and "competitively priced." Well, we're gladthat argument is settled.
