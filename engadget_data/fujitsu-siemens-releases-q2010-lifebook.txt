In fact, we're not even seeing the limited edition version listed at all on their product page, but there are three "low-priced" versions available if you're willing to sacrifice 3.5G wireless and a bit of street cred. Ranging from from $2,000 to $3,200, the laptops all feature 1.2GHz Core Solo ULV processors, 802.11a/b/g wireless, and the 3-cell 1.75-hour battery. For $3,200 you get an extra 7-hour battery, 1GB total of RAM, an 80GB HDD and Bluetooth 1.2, while the $2,400 mid-tier version gets you a supplemental 3.75 hour battery, Bluetooth 1.2, and a 40GB HDD. With a 30GB HDD, 512MB of RAM and no Bluetooth, the $2,000 version looks positively barebones. An incredibly sexy, slim, lightweight and desirable barebones.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
