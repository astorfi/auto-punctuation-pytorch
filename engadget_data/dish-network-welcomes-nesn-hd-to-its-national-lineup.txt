 We know, the DISH Network news is coming in hot and heavy today, but regardless of whether your neck of the woods is getting HD locals, you can certainly look forward to seeing one more high-def channel in your EPG. Announced today, the sat provider is serving up New England Sports Network (NESN) in SD and HD on channel 434 (HD), and it should be noted that said network is the first regional sports channel in the nation to "originate every game and studio show in HD." See, Boston sports aren't all that far away after all.
