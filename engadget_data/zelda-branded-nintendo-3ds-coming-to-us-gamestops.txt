Spotted by one of our eagle-eyed tipsters, this leaked Black Friday promo offers the gold-and-black, Hyrule-emblazoned console as part of a bundle deal that also features The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D. This can all be yours, apparently, for the price of $200 (or as little as $100, if you're willing to part with one of your older consoles). Nintendo has yet to issue an official word on Zelda's stateside arrival, but we'll be sure to let you know as soon as we hear more.
