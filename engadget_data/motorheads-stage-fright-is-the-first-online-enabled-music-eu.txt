 After releasing Europe's first HD DVD -- the HDi enhanced Elephant's Dream -- Imagion AG is again breaking new ground with the first music HD DVD (and first European HD DVD) to include online features. Due in August, Mot√∂rhead's "Stage Fright" also uses HDi for new interactive features, allowing viewers to create their own setlist from concert footage and to take "snapshots" of the concert and create personal picture gallery in their HD DVD player's storage. Fans can hook their HD DVD player to the internet to download news, tour dates, pictures and artwork that will update the disc's menus. We may not be die-hard followers of "the dirtiest heavy metal band in the world" yet, but with this kind of release look for our tattoos to join the gallery soon. Check after the break for screen shots.
