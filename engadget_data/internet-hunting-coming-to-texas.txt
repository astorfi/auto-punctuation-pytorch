Don't let anyone convince you that the Blue States have a monopoly on technologcal innovation. Case in point: a
rancher in Texas says he's going to start offering an Internet hunting service where visitors to his website can bag a
deer, antelope, and wild pigs using a remote controlled .22 caliber rifle with a webcam mounted on it (the gun is
already available for target practice right now, he's just waiting for a faster Internet connection that'll make the
gun easier to aim). But don't worry. Smokey, aka Texas Parks and Wildlife Department wildlife director Mike Berger, is
already trying to figure out how to shut this down, and has proposed a new rule that'll require anyone hunting animals
to actually be physically present at the site where they're shooting.
