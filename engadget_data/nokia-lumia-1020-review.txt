There was no shortage of stunned faces in the audience when Nokia CEO Stephen Elop announced the 808 PureView at Mobile World Congress 17 months ago. Who would have thought a Symbian-powered device would be a show-stealer -- in 2012? After all, Elop had all but declared the platform dead one year before, and the idea of a smartphone with a 41-megapixel camera was an industry first. Questions lingered immediately after: how is that actually going to work on a phone? Why Symbian? And when would it show up on Windows Phone, Nokia's OS of choice?

As it turns out, the 808 PureView was the culmination of five years' worth of imaging experts putting their heads together, and Nokia wanted to get the proof of concept out the door while getting the innovative tech ready for Windows Phone. A few months after the 808's release, we started seeing the first fruits of this effort in the Lumia 920, but there was work yet to be done. Finally, the time has come for the company to launch the 808's WP8 counterpart, the Lumia 1020, and it's launching on AT&T this Friday for $300 as a US exclusive. We were able to peel ourselves away from taking pictures long enough to jot down a few thoughts, so shoot below the break to take a closer look.




Hardware
Haven't immediately skipped down to the imaging section? We're happy to hear, because even though the camera is of crucial importance to the success of the 1020 -- which must have initially been named the 909, since that's what it's called on the About screen -- the experience you have using the rest of the phone is also vital to your overall enjoyment of the device. Take the hardware, for example: not unlike the vast majority of Nokia's high-end Lumia products, it's extremely well-built. It uses a unibody polycarbonate chassis, which gives us great confidence in its durability. The Gorilla Glass 3 on the front of the 1020 is flush with the edges, so you don't feel any interruption when running your fingers from one end of the phone to the other. Given its placement, the display likely stands a better chance of survival than most when the handset is dropped on its side. (We can't say the same about those times it gets dropped facedown, so be careful.)The Lumia 1020 comes in three colors (yellow, black and white), each with a matte finish and a coating that's both fingerprint- and dirt-resistant. We much prefer this over a glossy phone any day, and while we didn't give the handset a full nature facial to test that second feature, we can at least confirm that fingerprints barely made an appearance during our time with the device. Additionally, the sides and back of the 1020 are smooth and rounded, much like a well-polished pebble, and the top and bottom are flat, which is fantastic if you ever want to position the phone upright. In many respects, it looks like a cross between the Lumia 800 and 920. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it does have a drawback or two. Sadly, the matte finish wasn't enough texture to provide us with a better grip, so the phone's ability to slip out of my hands didn't go unnoticed -- especially when trying to remove it from my pocket.


The good news is that at 5.57 ounces (158g) the 1020 actually weighs significantly less than the 920 (6.53 ounces), whose heft was one of our biggest gripes when we reviewed it. It's also 10.4mm (0.41 inch) thick -- abysmal when compared to most other high-end devices currently on the market, but still 0.3mm thinner than the 920. Unfortunately, it's also 0.6mm wider. This may not sound like much, but it makes a big difference in terms of how it feels in-hand, especially when you factor in the large camera module that takes up so much space on the rear side. Yes, the two elements make for a rather awkward hand-held experience; when the smartphone rests normally in your palms, your fingers will drape uncomfortably across that module in the back.If you've used the Lumia 920, it won't take you long to figure out where everything is on the 1020. The micro-SIM tray and 3.5mm headphone jack sit atop the device, with the volume rocker, power button and hardware shutter key (all aluminum) situated on the right. Down below you'll find the micro-USB port and a speaker grille; what sets it apart from the 920 is the addition of a lanyard hole and a change in how the speakers are laid out. The front features a 4.5-inch WXGA display, with a 1.2-megapixel wide-angle front-facing camera in the top-right corner, an earpiece just to its left, and -- on our AT&T-branded review unit -- a globe logo sitting by itself in the top-left corner. (This is the extent of any exterior carrier branding, fortunately.) The standard suite of capacitive buttons (back, home and search keys) can be found below the screen, just as you'd expect.


Moving on to the back, it's hard not to notice the monstrous camera bump taking up tons of space. It's an aluminum circular module with the lens on top and two flashes -- LED for video and focus assist, and Xenon for stills -- lining the left side. The rest is taken up with Nokia's logo and lettering signifying its megapixel prowess. There's no mistaking the bump, to be sure, as it protrudes proudly from the phone's chassis; this means the 1020 won't be able to sit flat on its back when you want to place it on a table or other surface. Of course, it's still much thinner (albeit larger and flatter) than the 808 PureView's module, so we're hoping that future generations of the device will get progressively less awkward.The Lumia 1020 comes with 32GB of internal storage. This is normally plenty of space for most users, but be careful if you plan on taking full advantage of the phone's numerous camera features; after taking lots of pictures over the course of two days, we easily amassed a couple gigabytes of images. We'd love to see a 64GB option for the enthusiasts out there (there have been reports that it's heading to Telefonica in Europe and Latin America as an exclusive), but as this isn't likely to find its way stateside anytime soon, just make sure you're regularly backing up your prized shots.


The 4.5-inch WXGA (1,280 x 768) display has the same resolution as the Lumia 920 and 925, though the 1020 uses the same AMOLED "PureMotion HD+" panel as the latter (the 920's is LCD). And it's certainly every bit as beautiful to behold as before. Thanks to the fact that the blacks in the screen are nearly indistinguishable from the bezel, the display itself feels a bit more expansive than normal. You also have a few options at your disposal to adjust not just the master brightness setting, but also the sunlight readability, touch sensitivity and Lumia color profile (this involves tweaking the saturation and temperature of the color being shown on the screen). The viewing angles are incredibly wide; the screen is easy to see in direct sunlight; and the colors pop without overdoing it on the saturation.For radios, the AT&T version (RM-877) has quad-band LTE (bands 2, 4, 5 and 17, though you won't use most of them until AT&T enables them. It also features quad-band HSPA+ (850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100) capable of speeds up to 42 Mbps and quad-band GSM / EDGE (850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900). According to the FCC docs, this unit technically also features AWS HSPA+, but it appears to be disabled on the AT&T units. Additionally, the 1020 features NFC, Bluetooth 3.0 and USB 2.0. We've included the full spec sheet below.

Windows Phones require very little explanation on the firmware side, since Microsoft maintains a consistent user experience across the board. Because of this, there isn't much to surprise users who are already familiar with the Live Tile-smattered mobile OS; you already know what to expect, and we won't go into a lot of detail on the platform's features here.



With that said, the Lumia 1020, much like most of Nokia's Windows Phones, includes a full suite of OEM- and carrier-specific applications -- more than 20, in fact. This includes Nokia Care, Music, Pro Cam, Smart Cam, as well as a set of Here-based programs, such as City Lens, Drive+ Beta, Maps and Transit. On the AT&T side, you'll see Address Book, FamilyMap, Locker, Navigator, Radio, Mobile TV, myAT&T and YPMobile, all of which can be easily uninstalled if you don't find any use for them. There's also ESPN Hub, Wallet and a bunch of imaging-centric lenses, which we'll discuss in more detail in the next section. The 1020 also offers the same quick glance screen that we saw on the Lumia 925, which allows users to check the time while the screen is off; you can disable this feature or, if you prefer, add a night mode that dims the glance's brightness automatically during the hours of your choice.Of course, many of these observations are only potential problems when you're using auto mode. Most people interested in buying this phone are likely a bit more savvy in the imaging department and are willing to play around with the settings, and this is where the 1020 makes the biggest difference. ISO, shutter speed, white balance, EV and manual focus are easily tweakable, which means you have free creative reign in making the camera take whatever photos you want. It's amazing what just a few minor adjustments can do -- especially in low light. We'll continue to experiment with the camera's capabilities and report our findings in an upcoming feature; if you'd like to take a look at our high-resolution images, we'll have them available for your perusal shortly. Update: for high-res images, head here; we also added a set of 5MP shots here.
