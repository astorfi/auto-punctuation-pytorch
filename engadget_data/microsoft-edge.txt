After months of waiting, Microsoft finally has a proper name for Windows 10's brand-new web browser: Forget Project Spartan, and meet Microsoft Edge. It still has the same flat, minimalist look you saw at the start of the year, as well as clever features like Cortana voice commands and annotation for websites. You'll also get a new tab page that shows both other websites as well as handy info like weather, and Microsoft is now making it easier for developers to port extensions from other browsers (such as Chrome). Yes, the folks in Redmond are largely using the Edge name to distance their latest browser from Internet Explorer's less-than-stellar reputation, but you have to admit that the new branding is decidedly catchier.
