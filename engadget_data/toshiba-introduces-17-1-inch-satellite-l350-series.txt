The entire family packs a WXGA+ (1,440 x 900) resolution TruBrite panel, Vista Home, a dual-layer DVD writer, integrated WiFi and a built-in webcam with microphone. Based on model, you can also get up to 4GB of DDR2 RAM, a 200GB hard drive, GMA X3100 or ATI Radeon X1250 graphics set, three Sleep-and-Charge USB ports and your choice of an Intel Core 2 Duo T5550 or AMD Turion 64 X2 TL-60 CPU. If you haven't already pieced it together, it's not the specs list that's impressive here -- it's the $749.99 starting price tag. You get what you pay for, you know.
