Microsoft has confirmed what many saw as inevitable: the Xbox will have a Blu-ray drive. The company just announced the victor in the drive wars will be installed as a slot-loading front unit in each new Xbox One along with a 500GB HDD, a 360-degree switch from Redmond's last console, as it were. As we noted earlier, games purchased on Blu-ray disks will be ripped to the hard disk automatically to keep usage down. Microsoft heavily resisted the move to Blu-ray in the Xbox 360, but has caved to the inevitable, no doubt having come to an agreement with Sony, Panasonic and Philips (the owners of the tech), through gritted teeth.
