Bill Farmer, the voice actor who plays Goofy in Kingdom Hearts 3, has completed recording for the game and he says in a tweet that it's due out in 2015. Square Enix, however, doesn't agree â€“ about a week after Farmer's quiet bombshell, the company tweeted that there is no release date for Kingdom Hearts 3.



There was a Goof! The release date for @KINGDOMHEARTS III remains unannounced.

Why must you mess with our hearts this way, Farmer? Et tu, Square Enix? Reports have it that Kingdom Hearts 3 is being built in Unreal Engine 4, and series Director Tetsuya Nomura says, "The battles that the characters have been fighting for the past 10 years will come to a conclusion." Kingdom Hearts 3 is due out on PS4 and Xbox One ... eventually.
