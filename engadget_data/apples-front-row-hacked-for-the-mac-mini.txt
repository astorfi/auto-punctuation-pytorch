The new iMac G5 might be the only Mac that
officially runs Front Row, Apple's kind-of
sort-of Media Center competitor, but since when has officialdom stood in our way? That's right, never ever. TUAW has
all sorts of wonderful deets on running Front Row on various Macs, including video of a Mac mini in action â€” fulfilling
its long time media center destiny. Everything seems to run rather smoothly, so at least you can strike processor speed
from your list of reasons why Apple is holding back from releasing a legit version of Front Row into the wild.
