SmartSwipe Revolutionizes Online Shopping  World's first truly secure personal credit card reader keeps PC safe while shopping online  Regina, SK – July 14, 2009 – NetSecure Technologies is proud to offer US consumers the immediate availability of SmartSwipe, a personal credit card reader that keeps your credit card information and identity completely safe when you're shopping online. Plug the SmartSwipe into your computer's USB port, visit your favorite online stores, and swipe your credit card exactly like you would at a shop. SmartSwipe then scrambles and encrypts the user's credit card data before it reaches the user's computer or internet providing instant protection from malicious software attacks.  Traditional online security only protects your sensitive information once it has reached the internet, but not while it's sitting on your computer. Credit card companies, online retailers and security professionals spend millions every year to make the internet a safer place for credit card transactions. Despite these constant advances, credit card data is stolen every day due to the vulnerability of personal computers. Hackers and thieves make a living taking your credit card data and personal information right from the desktop.  "Until now, there hasn't been an affordable and effective solution for consumers to securely protect their credit card data while shopping online" said Daniel McCann, President of NetSecure Technologies. "Hackers have extremely sophisticated methods of circumventing traditional internet security to steal your personal information right from your computer. SmartSwipe facilitates transactions that leave no trace of credit card data, guaranteeing your information remains secure."  SmartSwipe features simple plug and play installation and also eliminates the need to manually enter credit card information saving time while you shop online. The SmartSwipe works with nearly every major credit card and credit/debit card combination including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. System requirements include Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Internet Explorer 6 or higher. It also features a 90 day no-hassle return policy should you not be 100% satisfied.  The SmartSwipe is available now from SmartSwipe.ca with a MSRP of $99.95.
