It's hard to believe that the word "phablet" has now been in our vocabulary for exactly a year. Perhaps even more difficult to believe is that it's still in our lexicon, but it doesn't look like the term is going anywhere anytime soon.

Head below with us as we take a closer look at how the two devices compare.


Note: We'll continue filling out the chart as details surface.
