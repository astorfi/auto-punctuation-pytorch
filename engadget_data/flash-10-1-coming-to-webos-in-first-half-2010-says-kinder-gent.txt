We don't know how long this message has been up there, but as far as both we and PreCentral can tell, it's fresh. It's certainly a date we haven't seen before -- last we heard a public beta was coming the end of this year, which may or may not still be the plan if the above message is referring to a final, non-beta release. Now you current Pre / future Pixi owners have something else to look forward to besides release 1.3.1.
