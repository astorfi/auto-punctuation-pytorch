 When it comes to video game-related mods, practicality is often the first casualty, as is fully evidenced by this latest bit of a workmanship from AcidMods member Neubit. Apparently, like so many others, the PSP's nub got the better of him, prompting him to enact his revenge by wiring up a PS2 steering wheel to the handheld's buttons and analog control. As the video after the break shows, the whole setup appears to work reasonably well -- or, at least as well as a full-size steering wheel hooked up to a PSP can be expected to work.[Via PSP Fanboy]
