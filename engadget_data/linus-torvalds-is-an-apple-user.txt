You know, normally we wouldn't get all up in this tech/celebrity tabloid material
(okay,
fine, so what?), but hey, whaddayaknow,
Linux creator Linus Torvalds—the man known far and wide for
spearheading the open-source and *nix movements—has made a move to an Apple. Apparently he's going through a
phase—Mac/PC biqueerious experimentation?—and right now a dual-G5 is his main squeeze because he "got the machine for
free" and because "[he's] really a technology whore." So Yellow Dog these days, eh Linus?
