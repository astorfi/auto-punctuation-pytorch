       It seems like only yesterday Apple unveiled iCloud to the world at WWDC, just a puff of vapor. Now look at it. The company has just confirmed the service has swelled to 85 million users as part of its Q1 2012 earnings call. That's more than twice as many iPhones as it sold in the same period, but of course it's worth noting that iCloud is, of course, free, so there's no penalty in people sticking their head in and seeing how things feel.
