 
By now you're probably familiar with the $58,000 RED EPIC-M and what it can do, but it's hard to properly admire its hand-machined beauty from a distance. We can't ship you a unit, of course, but we've got the next best thing: close-up footage of the compact 5K beast shot with another RED camera -- the original 4K RED ONE M-X. Lousiana post-production company Digital FX lovingly fondled EPIC-M #98 on camera, not to mention goodies like the Bomb EVF and 5-inch touchscreen LCD, and you can watch, drool and share your oh-so-envious thoughts with us right after the break.
