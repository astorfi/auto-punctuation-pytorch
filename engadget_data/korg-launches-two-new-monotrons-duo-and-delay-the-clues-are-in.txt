Well it's done it again, and this time with two analog boxes of badness to salivate over - the Duo and the Delay. Those aren't just cute names, either; both feature the same ribbon based sonic goodness as before, but the Delay packs a dub-tastic space delay, and the Duo rocks a second oscillator, for those juicy thick timbres. No word on price or availability just yet, but we're guessing they'll pop up for around the same as the original -- around $60 -- which is almost as pleasing to the ears as the Monotron's themselves. Check the videos after the jump to see / hear both in action.
