Behind all the confidentiality agreements and abstract descriptions that are standard fare for unannounced products these days, the official paperwork lists a highly suggestive model number: PTK-450. The smallest Intuos4 currently available is the PTK-440 and it's been around for a couple of years already, so perhaps we're due a refresh.

Update: Now the two bigger tablets have made an appearance: the PTK-650 and the PTK-850, which would hypothetically complete this updated Intuos4 range.
