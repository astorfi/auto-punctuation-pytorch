Why not throw in another device that we've heard so much about, such as the LG Intuition? Indeed, docs detailing the CDMA-clad Optimus Vu is now beginning to make the rounds in Verizon's internal system -- and its intended launch date is among the trove of treasures to be found within. According to the docs, we should expect to see the 5-inch device available online in time for the 6th, while all channels won't be ready to go until the 10th. We can't imagine that too many people will be upset over having to wait another four days, however.

 In terms of specs, here's what we can anticipate from the Intuition: Ice Cream Sandwich, a dual-core 1.5GHz Qualcomm MSM8660 (Snapdragon S3) processor paired with MDM9600 LTE modem and 1GB RAM, Gorilla Glass, a 5-inch IPS display with a resolution of 1024 x 768, 15 hours of talk time, 8MP rear camera with 1.3MP front-facing cam and no microSD expandable storage option. Ultimately, the Intuition is Verizon's variant of the Optimus Vu, and boasts that commonality right down to the components and design -- you won't find much difference in specs, weight or dimensions between the two. We've compiled a few images for your enjoyment, so head below to see. As before, we had to be creative in how we treated these images to protect the identity of everyone involved.
