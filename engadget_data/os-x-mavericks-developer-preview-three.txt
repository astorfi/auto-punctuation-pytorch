Cupertino's clearly in the mood to churn out beta releases today. Just a few hours after unleashing the third iOS 7 beta, Apple's dished out OS X Mavericks Developer Preview 3. The House that Jobs Built is remaining tight-lipped about what the update contains, but it's safe to say it packs a usual suspect: bug fixes. Devs raring to snap up the latest release can click the bordering source link for the download. However, if you're not of the (Apple-approved) programmer persuasion, you can experience the operating system vicariously through our preview.
