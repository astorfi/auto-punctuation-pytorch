If reports from Technobuffalo are to be believed, both Boost and Virgin Mobile will be renewing their vows with host provider Sprint and getting access to its 4G spread. Surprisingly, this apparently only extends to the existing WiMAX, not LTE infrastructure. While WiMAX isn't Sprint's favorite 4G flavor, it has at least committed to keeping it going for a while yet, enough time for you to upgrade once more at least.
