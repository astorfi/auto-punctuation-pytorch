 T-Mobile's not being shy in its selection of Windows Phone 8 offerings, so far announcing plans to release the HTC Windows Phone 8X, 8S and Nokia Lumia 810, but unfortunately it does have to be shy in actually showing them off. The carrier's booth at tonight's MobileCon 2012-related event had the latter device, but wasn't able to turn it on for us (a situation that we've sadly come to expect with virtually every public appearance by a WP8 device). Technically, the 810 is being dubbed a T-Mobile "exclusive" in the US, but that takes on very little meaning when given its use of a AWS-friendly HSPA+ 42Mbps radio. It bears some family resemblance in specs and looks to its cousin, the Lumia 820, but it still keeps to a distinct design; the 8MP rear camera panel is laid out vertically (see also: Lumia 800) rather than horizontally, the LED flash is off to its side, and the 1.2MP front-facing camera is on the opposite side of the earpiece. It's still a little thicker (10.9mm, 0.43 inches) and heavier (5.11 ounces, 145g) than we'd like to see on a midrange device, which is mainly a result of the 810's exchangeable wireless charging shells (it's available in cyan and black). The Lumia 810 also features a 4.3-inch OLED WVGA (800 x 480) ClearBlack display offering a pixel density of 217ppi. Naturally we'll need to put this to the test once we're allowed to turn it on, but we expect this to be roughly the same quality as the Lumia 900. We'll let you know when more specs come our way, but in the meantime take a look at our hands-on images below.
