In response to industry petitioners, the FCC is easing outdoor power restrictions on the unlicensed 60GHz spectrum, which could bring faster broadband to rural areas and cost-effective backhaul solutions in urban settings. This ruling change would permit outdoor devices to deliver high-speed data over greater distances -- around a mile at 7 Gbps, all told -- and "enhance" the unlicensed utility of the 57-64GHz spectrum. While this is the same frequency WiGig uses, indoor power restrictions haven't changed any. Because this spectrum is unlicensed, it means that basically anyone can use it as long as they follow the FCC's rules; no funny business, please.
