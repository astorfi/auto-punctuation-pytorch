 Earlier today, Evernote pulled the trigger on version 5.2 of its iOS application. The newfangled software introduces an updated PDF viewer that adds multi-page viewing, screen rotation lock, two-page display within landscape mode and the ability to search text inside a file. Other new app features include plain text note formatting and offline Notebook support for business accounts. iPad users now have access to Snippets list viewing, Business Notebook syncing and the ability to download third-party Trunk software from within the app. If your device is running iOS 5.0 or later and you'd like to sample this smorgasbord of new features, head on over to the App Store or visit the source link below.
