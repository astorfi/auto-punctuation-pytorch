Google Fiber is growing in Kansas City and, as recently reported, coming to Austin, and today Mountain View revealed a third city that will enjoy its high-speed internet: Provo, Utah. The news broke today on the official Fiber blog, Provo's website and the city mayor's personal blog -- what official wouldn't be happy to break that news? If the agreement is approved by the city council, Google will buy the city's existing iProvo network and upgrade it to Gigabit technology. The deal would bring free 5Mbps service to homes already on the iProvo network (for a $30 activation fee) and offer free connectivity for 25 public institutions. The council will vote next Tuesday -- but we can't imagine any verdict other than a resounding "yes."


[Thanks, all]
