Tipsters have told Android Police that they've already managed to connect to the 4G network around both Palo Alto and Mountain View, reaching speeds of over 13MBps down and 8MBps up. Coverage doesn't yet extend to San Francisco, but bodes well for a swift roll-out -- and for Sprint fulfilling its promise of voice over LTE by the end of next year.
