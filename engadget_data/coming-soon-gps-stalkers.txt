Jeez, it's people like this that ruin it for the rest of us, you know? Glendale, California resident Ara Gabrielyan
was charged Tuesday with stalking and threatening to kill his former girlfriend and himself over the course of six
months. Apparently he purchased a Nextel phone with a motion detector that turns the device on when moved, and planted
it in her car. Whenever she drove anywhere, it activated and transmitted GPS coordinates, which Gabrielyan used to
monitor her location. We're not sure how he got six months of battery life out of the thing, but that's pretty jacked
up any way you figure it, even despite all the cheap, readily available commercial services that are popping up and
doing this nowadays.
