It's really, really thin -- and the battery compartment is tucked under the curve, so from most angles it looks like it's not even there. Apart from that, it's just a really nice keyboard, albeit one with a webOS function key next to the space bar. No price or availability yet, unfortunately, but we'll keep digging.
