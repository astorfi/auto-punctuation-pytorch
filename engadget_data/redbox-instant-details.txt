 Details about the still-in-alpha Redbox Instant internet movie service have suddenly become more clear, as GigaOm dug up a link to support pages (apparently now password protected) that show off service prices and even screenshots of the website and apps. As noted there, any of this could change before it rolls out to the public, but they show off an unlimited subscription that goes for $6 per month, with a smaller catalog than what Netflix offers, but with recent flicks like Iron Man 2 and Thor. For $8 ($2 more) per month, customers add credits for four DVD rentals each month (no rollover), while video on-demand access to movies starts at $0.99 and goes up. In a disappointing move for Linux users, it appears Redbox and Verizon have selected Silverlight for the web player just like Netflix, instead of Flash like Amazon's Instant Video. Currently, Android, iOS, Xbox 360 and Samsung's Smart TV platform are on deck for apps (check out more screens at the source link) and the page suggests that public launch could come December 17th. Assuming these details hold up, is this enough to pull you away from Netflix / Amazon Prime / Hulu Plus, or maybe add-on another subscription to the pile?
