It's already the year 2004, dammit, so where are those personal jetpacks we were promised?
Apparently, they're in London, where a stuntman by the name of Eric Scott set a world record yesterday for the
highest human flight with a rocket belt when he soared a full 152 feet into the skies over north London. The
flight only lasted 26 seconds, or just long enough for him to develop a mean case of air rage. [Side note: doesn't that
photo of the big even look totally Photoshopped?]
