We couldn't easily tell from their early prototype images (like the one above), mockups, diagrams, or press release what it is that Jays headphones do differently than, say, some Shures or Etymotics, but according to Jays their phones won't have consumers paying "hundreds of dollars" for their isolated audio experience. Guess we'll all find out the deets come June 12th when Jens pulls the curtain on Jays.Update: Jens gave us a ring and sent over the above conceptual drawing of the squid-like q-JAYS (Quattro), which won't be what they're unveiling in June, but will supposedly be launched in 2007.
