 
Wemay still be getting over CES and Macworld, but the endless cycle of trade shows goes on, and ifyou're into appliances, the place to be this week is Orlando, where manufacturers are showing off their gear at theBuilders' Show (gee, and here we were looking for the fridges and dishwashers at CES). GE has a slick demo of a"kitchen of the future" that's heavy on voice-activated touchscreen OLED displays, sliding glass doors andintegrated appliances (including a slide-out, self-cleaning cooktop). Ask "what's for breakfast?" and thesystem will give you a list of your available ingredients. Unfortunately, the kitchen won't cook the food for youwithout at least some manual intervention â€” and won't shop for you either, which means the response when we ask"what's for breakfast?" is going to be along the lines of leftover pizza and flat diet soda.
