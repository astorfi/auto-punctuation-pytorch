It's nothing revolutionary, but now you can use WEP 128, WPA-PSK (TKIP), and WPA-PSK (AES) with AOSS (Buffalo) WiFi, but perhaps more interestingly you can finally use a picture avatar, and they've also added video chat for your USB camera. As usual it's a fairly big file, so get 'er now before everybody else clogs up Sony's tubes.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
