That's a bit less than the $200+ price we had heard Uruguay would be paying, but still well over the mythical $100 price the foundation has long been promising. According to Uruguay's El Pais newspaper, the decision (which has apparently yet to be finalized) follows an evaluation process in which the OLPC competed against Intel's Classmate PC. That ultimately ended with the OLPC narrowly beating out Intel's offering by a score of 56.84 to 53.06, with the OLPC's cheaper price apparently the determining factor.[Via OLPC News]
