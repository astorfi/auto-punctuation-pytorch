 Looks like it slipped throughyesterday but Cingular apparently wasn't dry when it came to announcing (though not necessarily launching) new 3G handsets totake advantage of their fresh new high speed data network. We can't imagine it came as any great surprise to anyonefollowing the saga, but they dropped in the Nokia 6282 as beingslated for launch, as well as a slightly more mysterious LG CU500, which we've yet to hear anything about. As perusual, we'll keep you up to the minute on these suckas.[Via Phone Scoop]
