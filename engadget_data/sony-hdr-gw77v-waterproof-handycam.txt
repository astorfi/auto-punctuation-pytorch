With that in mind, the Japanese outfit has taken the wraps off of its first waterproof (and dustproof) Handycam, which packs a mouthwatering 20.4-megapixel Exmor R CMOS sensor capable of 1080p video at 60fps. Staying true to its Handycam roots, the HDR-GW77V sports a 3-inch swivel screen while also offering 16GB of internal storage and a 10x optical zoom. Sony claims the camcorder can handle up to 16 feet of water as well as sustain a five-foot freefall. The HDR-GW77V will be hitting Japanese shelves late next month for 70,000 yen (around $860), and there's no word on when -- or if -- it'll make a trip outside its home turf.
