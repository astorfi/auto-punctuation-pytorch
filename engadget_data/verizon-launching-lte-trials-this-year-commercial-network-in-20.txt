 Verizon went a step beyond simply revealing its LTE infrastructure partners at MWC this week (they're Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson if you're curious), announcing that it'll actually have live networks in action by the end of the year. Two lucky to-be-named cities will be recipients of the 4G action -- which sounds suspiciously similar to Sprint and Clearwire's current WiMAX situation -- where the company will get a better sense of the data rates commercial users can expect. Speaking of commercial users, they'll be added into the mix come next year in 25 to 30 to markets. With a clear path for continued HSPA evolution up to double-digit Mbps under its belt, AT&T is pretending like it's not feeling the heat here -- but there've got to be a few beads of sweat forming on executive foreheads at this point.[Via Unwired View]
