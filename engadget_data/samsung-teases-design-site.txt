Samsung has gone to pains to try to explain the consideration and thought processes that go into its design -- especially with its Galaxy smartphones -- even if a lot of us still have beef with some of its material choices. Here's a renewed effort, then, with the electronics maker teasing a new design site for launch on March 27th next week. A YouTube teaser suggests there will be more tales of design from across its product family -- obviously thought-up, written and made by Samsung -- as well as eye-widening futuristic concepts of floating screens, properly bending smartphones and well, whatever else the company's wizards can imagine.
