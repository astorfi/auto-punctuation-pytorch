Right before Microsoft kicked off its E3 event, Graeme Boyd told us to expect games, games and... more games. True to his word, Redmond spent the full presentation talking about the new generation's latest games, including titles from the Call of Duty, Forza and Halo franchises. It was a massive list of announcements, and a huge day for any Xbox One owner. Did you miss all the fun? You can go back and read our liveblog right here, or simply read on for a full rundown of Microsoft's big E3 announcements.



Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare
Is Titanfall's world too far-flung into the future for you? Then pay attention to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, the long-running franchise's new future-looking series. Microsoft's E3 briefing didn't nail down a specific year for the title, but it has all the hallmarks of an imagined future war: holographic gun readouts, magic flying grenades, mech suits, future tanks and augmented soldier armor. 





Dragon Age: InquisitionGiant reptiles, spiders and fantasy landscapes are coming in Dragon Age: Inquisition. Microsoft showed off a gorgeous trailer teasing plenty of environments, tons of detail and, of course, dragons. Oh, and its DLC is hitting the Xbox first, naturally.


Sunset Overdrive
Looking for an action-packed cautionary tale about the contents of your favorite energy drink? That's Sunset Overdrive: Insomniac's brightly colored, free-running horde shooter with eight-player co-op support. This quirky action game is an attitude-heavy, completely silly, over-the-top monster romp, and we have to admit, it looks pretty fun. Oh, and it's an Xbox One exclusive.
