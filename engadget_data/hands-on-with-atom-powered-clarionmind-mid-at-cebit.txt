Over at Clarion's spacious CeBIT booth, we took the liberty of snapping a few shots of this here MID. After toying with it for a few minutes, we were less than impressed by the finicky screen response, and the noticeable lag between application changes got annoying pretty quickly. Still, the main home screen looked mighty slick, so we suppose there's nothing horribly wrong that a minor firmware update can't fix. Anywho, dive on into the gallery below should you find yourself intrigued.
