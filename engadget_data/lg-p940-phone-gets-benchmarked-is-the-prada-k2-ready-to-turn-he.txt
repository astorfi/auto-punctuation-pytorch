	LG and Prada may have already renewed their wedding vows, but it's been pretty quiet on the designer phone front. However, a stream of benchmark results have surfaced over at Antutu, revealing an LG phone with a 1GHz CPU running Android Gingerbread -- version 2.3.7 to be precise. The handset is labelled up as the P940, suggesting that this could well be the fruits of labor from the fashion-phonemaker collaboration -- aka the Prada K2. A device with the same codename has already paid a visit to the FCC, although it kept quiet on the hardware specifics, not revealing much more than a clutch of GPRS and HSPA radios. Rumors suggest the hardware will all be contained in an appropriately stylish 9mm frame, but we'll just have to wait and see. It may be just a sliver of a smartphone, but we hope LG considers feeding it some Ice Cream Sandwich before it makes its debut. Not too much though, it still needs to fit into that Prada outfit.
