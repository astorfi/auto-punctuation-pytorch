Thank goodness there's a hack to enable an extra 50MHz boost, bumping the Droid up to a full 600 and, according to at least one user, significantly decreasing stability in the process. We'll go ahead and skip that one, but on the more alluring side there's a new add-on to the (already rooted) Nexus One that enables wired or wireless tethering. It's not a full ROM but does entail a kernel update, and as always these things can go horribly wrong if you don't know what you're doing. Not sure if you know what you're doing? Chances are you have your answer.
