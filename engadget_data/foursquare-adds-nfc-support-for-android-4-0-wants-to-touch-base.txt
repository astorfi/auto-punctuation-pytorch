  We knew the folk at Foursquare had been trying NFC out for a while, and Symbian's had it since November, but now tap check-ins are available for Android 4.0. Okay, so that means it's pretty much limited to Galaxy Nexus owners at the minute, but the chosen few can now share their Venue, Lists, Me pages, initiate friend requests and, of course, check-in at the touch of a phone. Foursquare claims it'll save vital seconds when checking in, but we're just glad there's another way to use Android Beam.The update's available now, so if you're snacking on an Ice Cream Sandwich, head on down to the source link and get your download on.
