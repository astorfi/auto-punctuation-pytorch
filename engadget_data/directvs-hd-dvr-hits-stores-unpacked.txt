    The whole situation surrounding DirecTV's HR20-700 HD DVR launch is still a bit confusing, but apparently a few units have already made their way into stores, and Earl B. over at the DBSTalk forums has managed to get his very own to play around with. He's posted up some excruciatingly detailed hands-on info, so if that's your thing, be sure to check the read link. Or, if you're more like us, just soak up the pretty pictures. Tipster Eric managed to spot a couple of units at his local Best Buy, and snapped some pics which can be viewed after the break.[Thanks, Terry and Eric]
