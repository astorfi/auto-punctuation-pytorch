Shipments are arriving at Best Buy stores across the nation, and according to our sources, they'll be stocked and ready for purchase starting September 22nd. We're still waiting to hear back on a retail price, but those who'd like to hazard a guess can extrapolate from those UK figures. So, did your Tuesday plans just get made?

Update: Select stores may be ushering them out on the 22nd, while others will be force to wait until the 25th. As for pricing? It's "listed" at $399.99, but we've certainly seen Best Buy placeholders be wrong before.

Update 2: Samsung chimed in with official pricing. The 16GB model will sell for $469, with the 32GB flavor costing $100 more.
