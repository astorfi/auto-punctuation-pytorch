 
No big surprise here -- Microsoft just announced Windows Marketplace, a unified storefront for the over 20,000 Windows Mobile applications. As rumored, that means you'll be able to get apps directly from your phone, and Microsoft has also promised new and better tools for developers in the future. Also confirmed: My Phone, which will let you sync your phone to the cloud with access from the web. Sadly, we'll have to wait for all this stuff -- it's coming with Windows Mobile 6.5 which isn't due until later this year. We'll let you know more as soon as we find out, keep it locked!
