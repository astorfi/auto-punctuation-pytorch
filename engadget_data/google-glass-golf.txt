Google Glass may not be permanently available for sale to the general public, but Mountain View recently promised to find new ways to expand the Explorer program. The pricey gadget's first stop? The Player's Championship in Florida, a golf tournament where many participants can easily afford the device's $1,500 price tag. Despite the prime location, Google still bundled the eyewear with a free mini-camera that clamps onto a golf club to sweeten the deal. Sounds like the company's plan worked quite well: according to Twitter user Richard Ranick, a sales associate claimed sales were much better than expected. Since Google has vowed to make Explorers not just out of sports lovers, but also out of optometrists, cooks and travelers, we might see more Glass booths (after the break) at various events in the future.

Update (05/13/14): According to Paul Goldstein (creator of the GolfSight app you see on the Glass interface above), Google was actually handing out Swingbyte devices as freebies instead of mini cameras.
