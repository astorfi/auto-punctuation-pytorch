In addition to cramming all those gigabytes into a laptop-friendly package, the drive is also said to be "one of the quietest 5400 RPM, 2.5-inch drives available," with WD's trademark WhisperDrive and IntelliSeek technology promising to keep the noise down and the power consumption to a minimum. Those looking to swap out their old drive for this one can expect to pay an even $200, although you can be sure you'll be seeing it as a pre-installed option before too long as well.
