The deal doesn't cover big-screen manufacturing, only small and medium sizes that find their way into phones and tablets. The joint venture will command roughly 20-percent of the market according to TechCrunch when it finally becomes official, with a hefty investment from the semi-public Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, which will own a significant stake in the new company. It may be another day or two before the deal is announced, but consider this a serious shot across their Korean competitors' bows.
