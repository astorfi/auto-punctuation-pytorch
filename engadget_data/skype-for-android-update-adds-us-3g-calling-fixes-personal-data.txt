 
Verizon Android users have had 3G Skype calling since this time last year, but the latest app release -- v1.0.0.983 for those of you keeping tabs -- brings 3G calling to the masses, without the need for a VZW-sanctioned app. The update also patches a rather significant security hole discovered last week, which could let third-party apps get hold of your personal information. We're glad to see that's no longer the case, and who's going to object to free calling as part of the deal as well? Make sure your phone's running Android 2.1 (2.2 for Galaxy S devices) and head on over to the Android Market to get updated.
