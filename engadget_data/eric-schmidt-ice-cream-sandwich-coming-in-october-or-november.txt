We knew it was coming near the end of the year, but we now at least have a slightly more specific time frame straight from the horse's mouth. Google's own Eric Schmidt revealed in an interview with Salesforce.com's Marc Benioff that ICS -- the highly-anticipated update to Android that will merge elements of Honeycomb and Gingerbread into one universal OS -- can be expected to arrive in October or November. This matches up with rumors saying the Nexus Prime will be released in the tenth month, but it's the first time we've heard anything official from El Goog since I/O four months ago. Check out the video below to get Schmidt's full statement.
