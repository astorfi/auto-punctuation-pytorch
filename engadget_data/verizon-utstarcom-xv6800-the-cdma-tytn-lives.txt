Here we have UTStarcom XV6800 on Verizon, and this thing is seriously no slouch. It improves on the Hermes with more memory, Bluetooth 2, and, of course, features EV-DO with Rev A support. Here's the dirt:

WM5 AKU 3
256MB flash / 96MB RAM
Thumb wheel
802.11b/g
Bluetooth 2.0
BBAC -- BroadbandAccess Connect, i.e. tetherable EV-DO
microSD slot

We hear Roc's got more coming soon, watch out for it. Big ups to HTC Kid!
