 We'll admit, anyone paying even the slightest bit of attention should have seen this coming a mile away, but the latest financial news from Palm is far from peachy. The firm announced a whopping 43-percent dropoff in profits compared to this quarter just one year ago, and the stock subsequently slid four-percent as a result. Of course, the perpetual delays of its modern-day operating system cannot be helping the cause, and considering the innovation that has surfaced in the smartphone arena over the past 12 months, it was only a matter of time before this happened. Interestingly enough, rival RIM was able to find a way to keep on keepin' on all the while, as it simultaneously posted a staggering 76.5-percent increase in revenue from the same quarter a year ago -- talk about salting the wound.
