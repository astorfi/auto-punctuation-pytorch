Concept cars are getting weirder by the
minute, and Nissan has just raised the bar with their egg-shaped "Pivo" that will be on display at the Tokyo Motor
Show starting October 22nd. The car is based on "drive-by-wire" technology (much like fly-by-wire on an airplane),
meaning that all of the controls operate electronically (as opposed to manually), through the use of servo motors.
Besides having a super-tight turning radius, the Pivo is able to independantly rotate its cockpit 180 degrees with
respect to the wheels- effectively eliminating the need for driving in reverse. While we think that this is a great
idea, couldn't they have put this tech in a hotter looking ride, like say a Murcielago (or even a Daewoo, for that
matter)?
