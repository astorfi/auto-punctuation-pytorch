The Yepp player measures 0.43-inches thick, and weighs a mere 1.7 ounces, but Samsung still managed a few extras. Most notable is the Bluetooth support for using wireless headphones, but there's plenty of other stuff like FM radio, voice recording, MP3/WMA/OGG support, photo and text viewing, and two full color 3D games. You can also play back 15fps videos at a 208 x 176 resolution, be we think we'll pass, thanks. Samsung claims 30 hours of music playback and 7 hours for video, but of course we have no idea as to when Samsung is planning on releasing this thing. Keep reading for more FCC glamour shots.[Thanks, Tuolumne]
