Americans have been jonesing for BMW's i3 for awhile, but the automaker has yet to answer two of their bigger questions: when, and how much? Our colleagues at Autoblog may have the answers. They understand that the car's pure electric edition should reach US customers in January, with pricing starting around $34,500; Europeans should get theirs in November for €35,000. The range-extended version with a two-cylinder generator will reportedly add about $2,000 to the cost (€2,000 in Europe) and arrive two months later. BMW hasn't confirmed any of the details, so don't call your dealer -- but don't be surprised if the entry luxury EV is relatively affordable.
