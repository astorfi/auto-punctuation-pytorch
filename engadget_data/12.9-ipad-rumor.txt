If you're holding out hope for a super-sized iPad Pro, Bloomberg is still in your corner. The outlet previously reported 12.9-inch iPad production could start as early as Q1 of this year, but now says suppliers are gearing up to start production in September. Citing delays in the supply of display panels, Bloomberg claims Apple will turn around sliding tablet sales with the still-unannounced new variant. Whatever the folks in Cupertino are up to, we hope that next time around the iPad Mini gets more upgrades to match its higher price.
