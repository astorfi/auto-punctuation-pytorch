We were pretty sure it was the eventual resting place for a camera sensor, but now we've got mounting evidence with the discovery of a missing link. If you recall, there was an August-borne leak of an iPod touch with camera that showed said slot filled with a chip that, in hindsight, looks to match up well with the video camera sensor in the 5G iPod nano (check out step 17). This revelation doesn't get us any closer to snapping videos with the touchscreen PMP, but we do have a few more questions for Steve to dodge.
