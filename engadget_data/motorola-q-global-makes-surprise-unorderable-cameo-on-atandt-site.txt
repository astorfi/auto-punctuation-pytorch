The carrier has thrown up a teaser site to help hold over the throngs of impatient masses who hoped the darned thing would've launched by now -- particular considering it was announced long before Verizon's version -- though no mention of an actual launch date is made in the verbiage. With any luck the October rumor will stick, but for now, a submission of your email address into some AT&T database will have to do.[Via phoneArena]
