Facebook, Nokia, Samsung, Qualcomm and others created Internet.org in hopes of bringing web connectivity to underserved areas around the globe. Since the start of the collaboration between these tech companies, Internet.org has launched in Zambia and Tanzania, the latter being one of Africa's most populated countries. Next week, Internet.org's app, which provides free access to a variety of different services, is also becoming available in Kenya. As TechCrunch points out, Airtel customers in that area can start using AccuWeather, BBCNews, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Wikipedia, as well as other sites and communication tools, at no cost to them. And let's not forget Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia are only the first three countries to benefit from this initiative -- ultimately, Internet.org aims to blanket roughly 5 billion people altogether.
