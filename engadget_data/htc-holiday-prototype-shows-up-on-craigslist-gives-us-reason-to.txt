According to the XDA thread, the person responsible for the pictures noticed the device was being sold on the famous classified site, purchased it, and splattered the images online as evidence. Certainly, the resemblance to the render we saw in May is uncanny (minus the unfortunately cracked screen), and if the specs stay true to what was rumored at the time, we can expect to enjoy a 1.2GHz dual-core CPU with 1GB of RAM on a 4.5-inch qHD (960 x 540) display -- all confirmed by the screenshots -- as well as Android 2.3.4 and dual cameras consisting of an 8MP rear and 1.3MP front. The smartphone was rumored to be heading to AT&T's lineup, though no branding could be found. Either way, this particular dream machine is destined to turn more than a few heads. Check out the gallery below for a few more angles.

Update: The "myATT" logo in the bottom right of the Holiday's app menu is a pretty obvious indicator that it is, indeed, on its way to AT&T -- so at least it's going through the testing rounds right now, and we'll see if it gets the final approval to get pushed to stores.
