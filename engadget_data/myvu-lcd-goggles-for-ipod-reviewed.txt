 We know not everyone is down with the idea of wearing goggles like the myvu to watch a movie or video, but it seems there are some people that like them, as evidinced by this very positive review from Mobility Site. They found the myvu to pretty much deliver on what it promises, with a watchable video image, long battery life (over six hours), and a comfortable design. Of course, people's definition of acceptable video quality will no doubt vary; the myvu just gives you iPod-native 320x240 resolution. And, as you can probably guess, while it's marketed towards the iPod video, it'll work with just about any video source. You'll have to decide if the $270 price tag is worth it to rock it Geordi LaForge-style.
