After being announced without a firm release date, it then went up for pre-order in the UK with a promised April 20th ship date, only to be delayed until the second half of the year a month later -- possibly due to some Honeycomb compatibility issues. Now the device has finally hit the FCC, which could indicate that an eventual release will at least be closer to the beginning of the second half of the year than the end. Unfortunately, the FCC's still holding back on any actual pictures, so you'll have to get your gadget dissection fix another day.
