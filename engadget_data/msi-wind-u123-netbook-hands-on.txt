Take the Wind U123 for instance -- which was camped out with a Intel N280 processor, the incredibly aged GMA 950 graphics set, the old 945GSE chipset (as opposed to the GN40, which we were carelessly hoping for) and a SIM card slot for 3G WWAN. It didn't look all that different from U120, but then again, we never expected it to. Dive in below to see for yourself.
