Just a day after an accessory vendor seemingly outed the truth, PocketNow has stumbled upon what appears to be the first legitimate press images for the Gingerbread-based handset. It's going by SGH-I717 internally, and it'll purportedly boast a 5.3-inch display (1,280 x 800), a 1.4GHz Exynos processor and a promise to get its user all kinds of stares. As for a release date? Betters might place a few bills on Valentine's Day -- we'll let you peer some more and ponder why.
