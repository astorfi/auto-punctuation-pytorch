Verizon says that a recent Nielsen survey shows its network drops fewer calls than Sprint's, and for now the bureaucrats agree -- the board's asked Sprint to stop airing the ads. For its part, Sprint says one study doesn't tell the whole tale, and it's going to keep showing the ads while it appeals to the National Advertising Review Board. In other news, Verizon's lawyers were seen heading to the local BMW dealership late last night, following a run-in with Sprint's attorneys at the Mercedes-Benz showroom.
