 A year after its debut, Google TV is finally getting a fresh UI, its first taste of Market apps, and all-new Honeycomb underpinnings, so naturally that gets most of our attention this week. Of course, it seems like everyone is doing what they can to shake up the TV industry, putting Sony, Roku, Plex, Microsoft, DirecTV, and Redbox in the news as well. The one common thread joining these companies is that they can't do it without content, and it appears Warner Bros. and other studios may be locking the windowing gates tighter than ever. After all of that, we'll dig into what we have been and will be watching, so press play and see if you agree with our choices this week.Get the podcast[iTunes] Subscribe to the Podcast directly in iTunes (MP3).[RSS - AAC] Enhanced feed, subscribe to this with iTunes.[RSS - MP3] Add the Engadget HD Podcast feed to your RSS aggregator[Zune] Subscribe to the Podcast directly in the Zune Marketplace[MP3] Download the show (MP3).Hosts: Ben Drawbaugh (@bjdraw), Richard Lawler (@rjcc)Producer: Trent Wolbe07:20 - Google TV, take two, arrives next week with Honeycomb, Android Market18:43 - Sony to divide TV division into three-headed monster, looks to bounce back29:28 - Roku adds more games, cleans up the PQ on its latest streamers30:34 - myPlex makes streaming your media simple, gives you one queue to rule them all33:20 - Xbox Companion app for WP7 shown off at Nokia World, leaks Vudu integration (video)41:22 - DirecTV's iPad app updated with live TV streaming, as long as you stay at home44:08 - Redbox's $1 per night DVD rentals jump to $1.20 October 31st, Blu-ray and games stay the same47:08 - Warner pushes 28-day new release delay on Blockbuster, matches Redbox and Netflix58:55 - Must See HDTV (October 31st - November 6th)Hear the podcastLISTEN (MP3)LISTEN (AAC)
