 The Layered-X RAYERD-X may have raised some eyebrows and spurred some Transformer reminiscenceat the Ninth annual Robo-One competition in Tokyo this week, but according to Robots Dreams the title (at least in theTechnical Competition) went to OMNIZERO.2, with its dashing nuvo-like good looks and QRIO-like running, posing, object tracking, and even the ability tojump in place. Sure, this may seem a little rudimentary, but you won't be giggling so smugly when a gang of OMNIZERO.2stie you down in your sleep and start jumping on your chest. And they will, trust us -- we got a visit last night afterwe originally decided not to run this story.
