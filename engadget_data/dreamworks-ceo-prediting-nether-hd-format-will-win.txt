 We here at Engadget HD are currently engulfed in this latest format war, Blu-ray and HD DVD, but does the average consumer care either way? DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg is stating that neither format is going to become the next home video platform. We have heard naysayers before and even though he does have a decent point that there isn't that large of a "delta" between DVD and high-def disc, we still think one of these formats are going to stumble away beaten and bruised. DreamWorks has yet to release one of their animated films on either format and somehow we don't see that happening anytime soon.
