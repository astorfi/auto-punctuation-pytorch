We have some good news and some bad news for your data cap, folks. The Halo: The Master Chief Collection title update that adds multiplayer and a few other things is now available for download. It's smaller than expected, too! But it's still pretty sizable; 15GB to be exact. It's 5GB slimmer than what was initially promised, sure, but depending on your internet speed it could be a time-consuming roadblock standing between you and your first killtrocity on "Sidewinder" -- if you're buying a physical copy, of course. In case you've made a digital pre-order, you can grab the patch right now should you have auto-downloads turned on, according to 343 Industries executive producer Dan Ayoub. You have to wait until November 11th to play it, naturally. You still have plenty of Sunset Overdrive on Xbox One to keep you busy until then, right?



Good news gang! Day One TU for MCC is up! If you haven't enabled auto download, go get it now!! #HaloMCC
