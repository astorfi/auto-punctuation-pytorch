According to Gizmodo Brazil, we're looking at Android 2.1 with a dash of Motoblur thrown into the mix, a 2.8-inch display, full QWERTY keyboard, 700MHz processor, 512MB ROM / 256MB RAM, GPS, and a 3.1 megapixel camera. The HSPA phone is expected in the states this June in at least three different colors -- black, green, and pink. Backflip, Flipout... one can only hope Motorola keeps the trend alive with a Soundgarden-themed solar phone, the Outshined.
