 You may not expect a company like Ericsson to be making ways at Intel's Developer Forum, but that's exactly what's going down today in the City by the Bay. First up is the second generation F3307 mobile broadband module, which was designed to bring the goodness of 3G to upcoming Oak Trail tablets. It'll come pre-certified with the planet's largest HSPA networks, and we're told that it's engineered to sip (read: not gulp) energy while regaining connections just moments after a device snaps out of sleep mode. More interesting, however, is the October-bound F5521gw, which is hailed as the world's first embedded mobile broadband module "specifically designed for notebooks and other consumer electronics to support 21Mbps HSPA Evolution networks." The real kicker, however, is that it's interoperable with Intel Anti-Theft Technology, which enables an encrypted SMS to remotely disable the host machine... even when the OS isn't running. Hit the source links for all the nitty-gritty, or hop on past the break for the highlights.
