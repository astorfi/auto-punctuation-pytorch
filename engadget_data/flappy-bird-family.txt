A family that flaps together, stays together. As promised, the creator of Flappy Birds -- you know, the insanely viral and addictive game that enjoyed massive success before quickly being removed from the iOS and Android app stores -- is bringing a new version of his prized title to the Amazon Fire TV. Not only will you be able to relive the wonderful memory of topping your high score of 14, you can do so while pitted against other players in a multiplayer, dual-screen setup. There's no word on if the game will make its way to iOS or Android eventually. But in the meantime, get grandma, the kids and your cousins into the living room, power up the Fire TV and see which one is the best at navigating an 8-bit bird through a series of Mario pipes. (Our vote's on grandma.)
