Native 1080p panel (with HP's Visual Fidelity Engine)
500cd/m² brightness, 2000:1 contrast ratio, 176° viewing angle, 6ms response, 3:2 pulldown 
(3) HDMI, (2) component, (2) composite / S-Video, (1) VGA
Integrated 802.11a/b/g/n, Ethernet
Front speakers now NXT
Functions as a MCE, playing back DivX, XviD, H.264, MPEG-2, and WMV (also has HP's media interface)
Built-in ATSC and clear-QAM tuners

But wait, there's more: current MediaSmart HDTV owners will receive a software update that adds the latest Media Center Extender software, giving them access to these new updates and codecs. Of course, now you can forego the buying of the integrated, connected TV if you just want to snag a MediaSmart Receiver (or a 360). They should run $1,900 and $2,400, respectively, when released in the spring.
