The Scaleo will feature 4 internal drive bays, four USB 2 ports, two eSATA ports, "always-available" operation as opposed to being always-on, and silent operation. No word on that rumored two-drive RAID array or that 50W power consumption, but we'll know more when we get our hands on one at the conference.
