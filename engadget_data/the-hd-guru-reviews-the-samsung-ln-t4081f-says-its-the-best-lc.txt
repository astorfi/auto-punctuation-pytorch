Sure we do a fine job on our reviews, but it's not the same as an ISF certified technician with the right high end equipment to put a TVs through it's paces. Gary's latest review of the LN-T4081F and goes on to say that it has the most accurate colors and the best contrast of any LCD TV he's ever tested. He does bring things down to earth and remind us that the latest Kuro he's currently reviewing was able to best the black levels -- but that shouldn't come as much of a surprise. The other feature that really impressed him was "Motion Plus," which helped Samsung's top of the line HDTV, best any LCD TV in measured effective motion resolution. He was disappointed with the sets ability to upconvert 480i, but honestly who cares?
