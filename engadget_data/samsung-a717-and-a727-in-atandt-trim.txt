These here are the first "official" leaked shots of the newly AT&T-branded models, providing some comforting reassurance that the super-slim models are still destined for our 3G airwaves. As a refresher, the A717 does HSDPA, Video Share (presumably), an external OLED display, A2DP, microSD expansion, and a 2 megapixel cam all in a flip form factor, while the A727 packs a 1.3 megapixel camera, A2DP, microSD, HSDPA (at CES we were hearing UMTS only, but hey, who are we to complain?), and a 220 x 176 landscape display into a svelte 8.9mm candybar shell. No word on a release date, but we'll go with "not soon enough."
