Sorry, European gamers: the Wii U's TVii service won't reach your corner of the globe. Nintendo has dropped plans to bring the personalized streaming media guide to the region due to the "extremely complex" task of accommodating multiple services in numerous countries across the continent. The Euro crowd isn't coming away completely empty-handed, though. Nintendo is launching the Anime Channel, a 3DS-specific video service that lets you view Japanese animation (what else?) for free. The focus right now is unsurprisingly on Nintendo-related shows like Kirby and Pok√©mon, but more content is on the way -- you just need to grab an app from the eShop to start watching.
