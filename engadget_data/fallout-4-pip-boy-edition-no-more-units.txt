Understandably, the $120 bundle sold out almost as soon as it went on sale, but as much as the game's publisher wanted more of your cash, it's admitted that it simply can't make any more. Bethesda's Pete Hines has told GameSpot that the factories that produced the device were working at full-tilt, but simply couldn't fit more manufacturing runs into their production schedules.

 

Hines also moved to dispel the notion that the company only made a "few thousand" of the accessory in order to generate interest. As far as he's concerned, "we made a shitload of Pip-Boys, and we went back and made more," eventually producing "more of these things that we did for any collector's edition we've ever done, ever." That said, we'd like to think that the folks over at ThinkGeek are watching the demand for Pip-Boys with interest, since if there's any firm capable of giving fans what they want, it's them.
