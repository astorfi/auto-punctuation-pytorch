 If keeping up with those CyanogenMod 10 nightly builds was hard work, or just a little too bleeding-edge, then you might be interested to hear about the introduction of "M-Series" releases for CM10. Once a month, the team will release a more stable version for your downloading pleasure, though they are also keen to point out they will be available under the experimental tag. The list of handsets that will get the new builds includes variants of the Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy S, Galaxy SIII, Nexus S, Nexus 7, Galaxy Note and Sony Xperia S. Support for more phones is promised, but for now, head over to the official site for the comprehensive list and a link to the downloads.
