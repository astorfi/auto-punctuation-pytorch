Nokia has just released its interim report for Q3 2013 and, although its overall financial situation is still a bit muddy, it's clear the company is starting to see real success in the US. Thanks to a burgeoning range of Lumia devices and a big marketing push to go with them, the Finnish manufacturer saw smartphone sales in North America increase by almost 400 percent to 1.4 million units, up from just 0.3 million in the same quarter last year. This growth, alongside worldwide popularity of the budget Lumia 520, helped to push global Lumia sales up by almost a fifth, reaching 8.8 million units in the space of three months.


Nokia didn't fare so well in other regions, however, where overall device and service sales continued to fall, reflecting droopy demand for its older product lines. This caused a steep 22 percent drop in total revenue compared to last year, although the company still managed to scrape an operating profit of 118 million euros. Overall, it's clear that Lumia sales aren't yet sufficient to balance out problems in other areas, but they certainly seem to be enough to keep the company relevant until it can step under Microsoft's umbrella next year.
