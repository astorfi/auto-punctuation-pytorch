Only less than two weeks have gone by since Twitter debuted its app experiment on Android, but the little blue bird isn't letting any time go to waste. Available now to those willing to deal with some rough edges, the Twitter 5.0 beta for Android features a completely new look, the ability to view in-line images / videos and a redesigned bar for menu items (notifications, messages, etc.). Looks-wise, it's certainly slightly different than the current version. But does it perform better? We'll let you, the beta testers, be the judge of that.
