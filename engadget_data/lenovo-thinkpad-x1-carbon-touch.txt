 Announced quietly on its site today, Lenovo's pushing its Ultrabook legacy forward with the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch. Details on the 14-inch device are light at the moment, but from what we can glean, this Windows 8-based machine will feature an "HD+" display, which should translate to a 1,600 x 900 resolution, and come housed in a carbon fiber construction. And as its moniker points out, this particular Ultrabook one ups its keyboard-only predecessor with the addition of a touch screen. It's slated for launch sometime this December, so stay tuned for further details on pricing and availability.
