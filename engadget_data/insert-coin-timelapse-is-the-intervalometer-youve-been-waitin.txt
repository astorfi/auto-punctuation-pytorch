 In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line.



That timelapse masterpiece you've been planning just got a whole lot less daunting thanks to Elijah Parker over at Kickstarter. Go through a few niceties, like handing over at least $99 and helping him reach his $20,000 funding target, and you'll take proud ownership of a Timelapse+ (previously called the Timelapse Pro) -- a photographer's intervalometer that does a lot to deserve its name. It'll come with a choice of adapters to match the standard cable release on your DSLR (or even SLR, if that's how you roll), and once hooked up it'll let you configure everything from delayed starts to incremental exposures and even multiple exposures per interval for a much-needed dose of HDR. The firmware will be open source to leave scope for user mods, and there'll also be the option of a Bluetooth interface for wireless controls -- although that'll require an extra $40 and a smidgen of FCC approval. The video after the break reveals more, and the source link has more+.
      

 

 Previous project update: The last Insert Coin project we featured -- the Kapsule Lightstand Kindle accessory -- is currently languishing with just $1,556 raised out of a $40,000 target and only 17 days to. Hey, you win some, you lose some.
