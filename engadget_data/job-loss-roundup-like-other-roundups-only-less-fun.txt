Well, with this morning's coffee came the cold hard truth once more: the economy is seriously stinking up the joint, and it only seems to be getting worse. Logitech's announced their third-quarter earnings (down 70 percent) and simultaneously said it's going to shrug off 600 of its employees, while the folks over at Intel have said they're shutting down a manufacturing facility in the Philippines which houses 1,800 employees. Sony's vaguely announced a "restructuring" which is bound to result in misery and job loss, while Sega confirmed that "about 30" people have been vaporized from the pay sheet. So... everything's cool with this blogging job, right guys? Guys!?Read - Confirmed: Sega cuts staffRead - Sony announces restructuring planRead - Intel announces RP operation shutdownRead - Logitech third quarter profits fell 70 percent
