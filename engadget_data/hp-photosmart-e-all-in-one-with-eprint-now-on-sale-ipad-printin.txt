Indeed, it's the first of a new line of web-connected printers from HP to feature ePrint, the ability to email messages with attachments (Microsoft Office documents, PDFs and JPEG image files to name a few) to the printer from any device including smartphones and tablets -- no driver or app required. That's a pretty big deal. The $99 802.11n WiFi inkjet features a 2.36-inch touchscreen and prints at a rate of up to 29 ppm black (at up to 600 dpi) and up to 23 ppm color (at up to 4800 x 1200 dpi on photo paper). Scans are captured at resolutions up to 1,200 dpi (optical). It also prints directly off the web or via USB and SD / MemoryStick Duo cards if that's your thing. Sorry, no fax in this all-in-one but it is PC and Mac compatible and will work with Google's forthcoming Cloud Print service when Google sets it free in the fall. Expect to see higher-end printers from the e-All-in-One series launch in the next few months including the $149 Plus e-All-in-One with 3.5-inch display (worldwide in August), $199 Premium e-All-in-One with 4.3-inch display (worldwide in September), and $299 Premium Fax All-in-One (worldwide in September) with, you guessed it, integrated fax.
