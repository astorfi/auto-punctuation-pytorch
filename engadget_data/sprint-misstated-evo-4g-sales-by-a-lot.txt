"The total number of HTC EVO 4G devices sold on launch day was three times the number of Samsung Instinct and Palm Pre devices sold over their first three days on the market combined."
Nuh uh, it's wrong. Sprint just issued a correction in the wee hours stating that first day EVO 4G sales were, in reality, "in line with" the number of Instincts and Pres sold over their first three days on the market combined. Still pretty good if that translates to the 150,000 units sold as some analysts are touting; even better if Sprint can restock shelves.
