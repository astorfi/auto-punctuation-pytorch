Many players remain unable to reliably connect to multiplayer games, while developer 343 Industries notes that its team is working on imminent updates, "the next of which will specifically make improvements to the matchmaking system and flow." That update is expected to arrive later this week, and 343 promises more information on its changes will be available shortly.

Meanwhile, a number of those who purchased Halo: The Master Chief Collection at launch are now upset over a Microsoft promotion, according to fan site MP1st. The publisher recently kicked off a deal that grants a 15,000 credit bonus to any Xbox Live Rewards member who purchases Halo: The Master Chief Collection before December 31. That translates to $15 of Xbox Live Marketplace credit, which the early adopters argue is effectively a discount on Halo: The Master Chief Collection. This, they claim, is unfair, given the connectivity issues that have plagued the $60 game since its November 11 launch.

Neither 343 Industries nor Microsoft have responded to this outrage, instead leaving last week's comments from 343 head Bonnie Ross as the de facto official statement. "While our team works on continual improvements and towards solutions, my commitment to you is that we will take care of all owners of Halo: The Master Chief Collection," Ross said. "Our primary and continued focus is first on fixing the issues at hand. Once we've done that, we will detail how we will make this right with our fans."
