Though MetroPCS beat Verizon to become the first American carrier to launch the technology, it's been scraping by so far with nothing other than the Samsung Craft, a middling dumbphone without the chops to attract the powerusers that would normally want to be involved with a 4G network anyway. Looks like that's finally about to change, though, because BGR's scored a shot of a so-called SCH-R910 -- also from Samsung -- that's running Android 2.2. It'll allegedly have backward compatibility with MetroPCS' CDMA network (naturally) along with a 1GHz Hummingbird core and 5 megapixel camera -- not a blockbuster by any stretch, but still on a whole new plane than the Craft. Rumor has it we'll see this before the end of March for somewhere between $330 and $400 contract-free; question is, will it beat Big Red's first LTE phones to market?
