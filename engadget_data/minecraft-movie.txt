Prepare thyselves, Minecrafters. Earlier today, Deadline reported that Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to turn the indie phenomenon Minecraft "into a major motion picture." The popular franchise has apparently already drawn "huge interest" from writers and filmmakers, making it a hot property for Warner Bros. to add to its mighty portfolio. The studio giant is rumored to have chosen Roy Lee to take production charge of said Minecraft project; he recently produced The Lego Movie, which has been a complete hit at the box office.


Minecraft creator, Markus "Notch" Persson, isn't keeping quiet and recently tweeted about how he "wanted to be the leak," hinting that, perhaps, there is a movie in the works. Still, nothing's actually been confirmed yet -- but, as they say, where there's smoke, there's fire. Until then, maybe this documentary can control your high level of excitement.



Someone is trying leak the fact that we're working with Warner Brothers on a potential Minecraft Movie. I wanted to be the leak!
