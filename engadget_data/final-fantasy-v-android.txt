Ardent old school Final Fantasy fans know: the mobile versions of classic FF games can be rather costly. Square Enix, the franchise's publisher, is well aware of how much your nostalgia values the series, and Final Fantasy V is no different at $16. Perhaps you've already got the game on Super Nintendo and iOS, but needed another platform to try it out on? At very least, the mobile version has some fancy new graphics and a handful of added job types to help ease the pain of paying so, so much for a far from new game. Head below for a trailer of FFV for Android in action.
