Dammit, we knew that getting the palmOne logo tattooed on our asses was going to be a huge mistake:
palmOne officially changed its name (back) to Palm, Inc.
today, capping thirteen years of name changes, acquisitions, spinoffs, splinterings, and mergers for the Palm
brand. Since you can hardly be expected to keep track of all the twists and turns of the saga that is Palm, we've
thrown together this little timeline of events that should hopefully help you keep track of who is who now.
