Sporting an 11.6-inch display, a built-in 3G SIM card slot and Windows 7, this thing looks an awful lot like the Mini 311 (and for good reason). Granted, we're still waiting for it to ship here in North America, but if you're too impatient to just wait things out, an unboxing video is posted up just past the break for your enjoyment.
