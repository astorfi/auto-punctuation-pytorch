 So as we suspected, when Sony UK exec Ray Maguire recently labeled Americans as cheap (with massive land, at least) in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz, he didn't actually mean that we were tacky or spendthrifts -- according to a Sony rep who spoke with 1UP, Maguire was instead referring to the relatively low wages ($5.15/hour minimum wage versus ~$10/hour in the UK) when compared to other industrialized countries. So there you have it, not much to see here really -- though given Sony's almost complete dominance of our Ce-Oh no he didn't! series, it's not difficult to understand why this quote got pulled out of context and bandied about the interwebs like a pre-release iPhone.
