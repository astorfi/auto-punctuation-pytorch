 
And now,the question you've been dying to have answered after yesterday's big announcement: Is the Fujitsu Siemens LifebookQ2010 really the world's "most desirable laptop," as the company would have us believe? (What, did youthink we were talking about that otherannouncement?) Well, mmeier got to try out the svelte, sleek notebook at the Fujitsu Siemens press conference (andsnapped some great pics, as well), and came away impressed with its "crazy and awesome design and buildquality," which includes a magnesium case painted with jet-black piano lacquer. Connectivity was smooth, thanks tothe unit's HSDPA support, and the Q2010 proved to be incredibly thin and lightweight. Big downside? Well, in addition tothe price (about $5,000), there's the matter of battery life. While Fujitsu is reporting it as eight hours, the includedbattery will only give you two. For the full eight, you'll need a larger battery that sort of defeats the purpose of anultralight fashion laptop like this. Of course, if you can afford this, you can probably just buy a couple of extratwo-hour batteries and have your minions carry them around for you.
