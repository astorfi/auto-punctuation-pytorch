Taking power and signal from the same lead means one less wall port and less desk-spaghetti, which it claims makes it ideal for multi-screen computing. Spec-wise, we're looking at 20,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio (far less at native, no doubt), 1,920 x 1,080 resolution and a 5ms response time. The plug and play device should work on all your favorite operating systems, when it lands in February for $199. See the full PR after the break.
