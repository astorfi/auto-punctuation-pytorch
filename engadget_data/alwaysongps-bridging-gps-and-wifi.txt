One of the more common issues with using GPS is its line of sight requirements â€” if you're in an urban area with
substantial skyline, indoors or elsewhere without a good line to the sky, you could be out of luck in the accurate
coordinates department. The AlwaysOnGPS service is designed to bridge that gap in global positioning by automagically
switching your WiFi enabled PocketPC or PDA over to a WiFi Positioning System, obviating those line of sight
requirements. It's simply a piece of software and not a third-party service, so it's a one time licensing fee of $19.95
to purchase the application; 30-day trial available, as well.
