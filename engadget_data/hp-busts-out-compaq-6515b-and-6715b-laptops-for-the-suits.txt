HP seems to have hit all those main points with its new Compaq business laptops. The 6515b and 6715b sport AMD processors, 80-160GB HDDs, XP Pro on up to Vista Business, EV-DO or HSDPA 3G connectivity, ATI X1250 graphics and 802.11n WiFi. There's room for the up to 4GB of RAM, and the standard selection of optical drives, including a DVD+/-RW SuperMulti drive with LightScribe, if you want to get all fancy. The 6515b goes for a 14.1-inch 1280 x 800 display and weighs 5.6 pounds, while the 6715b sports 15.4-inches of screen, though we're unsure of further specifics. Both laptops are available now, and luckily the last part of the traditional biz laptop equation rings untrue here: both start at a budget friendly $649.
