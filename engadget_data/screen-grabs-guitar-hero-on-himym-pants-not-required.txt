Everybody knows us bloggers are a bunch of pantsless hooligans, but a lesser known fact is that Guitar Hero: Aerosmith comes with a new pants-free mode, as demonstrated in a lengthly sequence on this week's episode of How I Met Your Mother. Problem is, Jason Segel -- who we most fondly remember as Nick the drummer from Freaks and Geeks -- likely wouldn't be caught dead playing Aerosmith on the guitar, so stop trying to mess with our heads CBS. We know the truth.[Thanks, Jeff]
