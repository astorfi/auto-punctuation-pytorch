 T-Mobile may be playing catch-up in the 3G game, but it looks like they want to come rearing out of the gate on mobile TV. Hiwire, rife with nationwide spectrum in the 700MHz band, is gearing up to launch its DVB-H trial this December in the Las Vegas area; T-Mobile decided early on that it wanted in on the action, reportedly hooking up with Hiwire within 60 days of its formation. Ultimately, the carrier has not signed any agreements to join forces with Hiwire for a full-scale launch, but we can presume that a successful test in Vegas could lead to a long-term partnership. The trial looks to roll deep with as many as four handset models, thanks mainly to the availability of existing DVB-H phones that operate elsewhere on the same band.[Via Phone Scoop]
