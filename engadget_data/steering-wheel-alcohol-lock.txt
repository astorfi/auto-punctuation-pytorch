First the Alcolock, now Dennis Bellehumeur (inventor,
deli owner) has received a patent for an alcohol sensing device which can be installed in a steering wheel or "in
gloves." The device checks the driver's alcohol consumption via the skin and can prevent a vehicle from starting or
running (if roadtrippin') if the driver is over the legal limit. Testing of the device will likely be completed this
year, but due to its $600 price tag you won't see this as a standard option in your father's Oldsmobile anytime
soon.
