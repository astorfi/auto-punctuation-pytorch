Or maybe it's that the mention of Qriocity, the service that powers the offering, is still likely to leave a bad taste in the mouths of lots of folks, after the whole, well, you know. Whatever the case may be, the app is now available as a free download for those with Google's dessert-based operating system on their handsets, plus either the $4 a month basic or $10 a month premium plan.
