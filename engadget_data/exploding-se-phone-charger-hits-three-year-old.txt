Yeah, we suppose it is, but at least we're on the up about it, which ismore than we can say about Sony Ericsson and theirCST-20 charger. Turns out a UK man recently had a run-in with a rogue CST-20 unit, which after being plugged in for 45seconds blew up in his kitchen. The room was sprayed with shrapnel, and the man's three year-old son was nailed in thechest with the lid of the unit. Along with tripping the circuit breaker and filling the house with fumes, the explosionmanaged to get a vulgar yell out of the man's wife upstairs, which really seems to make it all worthwhile. The mandoesn't think so, and is of course looking into the matter legally. Sony Ericsson says the CST-20 is built by adifferent manufacturer than the one responsible for the infamous CST-13 of 2003.[Via textually.org]
