       
Microsoft's CES keynote has been marked by disaster: first the power went out, knocking the PCs on stage into recovery mode, and now the PR for Ballmer's speech has posted early. The big news is no news -- that HP slate device is a Windows 7 PC, not the rumored Courier tablet. We're sure HP and Microsoft will have some interesting things to say about it, but a lot of hearts are breaking out there. Other big items: Project Natal will launch around the holidays in 2010, the HTC HD2 will hit T-Mobile as expected, and the Mediaroom 2.0 IPTVs service will bring on-demand programming to PCs and phones. The full PR is after the break, but we'll post highlights here if we see anything else as we comb through.
