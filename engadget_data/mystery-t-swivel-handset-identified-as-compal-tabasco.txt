The images we saw were shot at Computex 2008 in June, and this is what Blog Times has to say about it: the non functioning prototype sports a rear facing 3.2 megapixel camera with 2x optical zoom and a flash, a front-facing webcam, and it measures about 6.3 x 3.3 x 1.3-inches with a 4.5 or 5-inch screen. It's impossible to determine the device's processor, OS or storage capacity at the this time -- so it seems that, after all this, the handheld is still something of a mystery. Of course, it could always turn out to be that fresh breath of Palm New-ness we've been warned of -- after all, it's been rumored that the company placed a significant order with Compal way back in August. Perhaps we'll find out at CES.[Via Pocketables]
