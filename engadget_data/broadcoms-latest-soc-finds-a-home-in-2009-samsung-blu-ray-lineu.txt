 Samsung and Broadcom have apparently come to the same conclusion as everyone else, deciding it is finally time to move on from the Broadcom 7440 chipset that powered Blu-ray players going back to the BD-UP5000. Expect the still-unnamed 2009 Blu-ray player line to continue to feature Netflix streaming plus enhanced video and audio features courtesy of the new 65nm BCM7601 decoder. Confirmed enhancements include full HDMI 1.3 support, motion adaptive de-interlacing to 1080p60 and a full 12-bit video pipeline all on one chip. Whether or not that's enough to make you hold off on a BD-P2500/BD-P2550, expect more info on Samsung's cheaper, faster, more powerful Blu-ray players at CES in January.
