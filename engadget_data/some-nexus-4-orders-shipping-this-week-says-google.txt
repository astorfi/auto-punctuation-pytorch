 Hordes of Nexus 4 hopefuls cringed after receiving an email stating that their order had been delayed due to the overwhelming demand for Google's latest purebred smartphone. While some folks opted to cancel their purchase in hopes of buying the handset elsewhere, those who chose to weather the storm are in for some good news. Google is now sending out emails advising customers that their order will go out sometime this week and that it will provide tracking details once a device officially ships out. If you're among those who hunkered down and exercised patience, you'll want to keep a close eye on your inbox, as there may be a precious gem in your junk mail folder resting somewhere between messages from a Nigerian Prince who desperately needs your help.
