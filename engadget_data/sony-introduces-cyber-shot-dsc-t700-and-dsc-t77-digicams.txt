Starting with the latter (which is Sony's thinnest model at less than 5/8 of an inch), you'll find a 10-megapixel sensor, ISO up to 3,200, eleven scene modes, in-camera image management, face detection and a 3-inch touchscreen to boot. Moving on, the brainy DSC-T700 does everything the T77 does but throws in 4GB of internal storage and a 3.5-inch LCD -- you know, so you can have a "photo album in your pocket." Both units sport a Carl Zeiss lens, 4x optical zoom, image stabilization and even an anti-blink function that snaps two successive shots if it notices anyone dozing during the capture. Also of note, the T700 packs a Picture Motion Browser application that "lets you downsize images from full-resolution to VGA and export them back to the camera's internal photo album." A bit gimmicky, sure, but a welcome addition nonetheless. Look for the T77 to land in brown, green, pink, black and silver in late September for about $300, while the T700 hits around the same time in red, champagne gold, pink, dark gray and silver for a Benjamin more.Update: Gallery added. Inexplicably, no pics of that biggie 3.5-inch backside LCD were provided by Sony.Update 2: Nabbed us a back-side photo of that hugeazz LCD. [Thanks, Sony Insider]
