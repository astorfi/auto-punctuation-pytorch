 We hear this new phase-change memory stuff is awful special, which is why we're hoping to get our hands on some now that Numonyx (the "pospective" company founded last year by Intel and STMicroelectronics to make the stuff), is apparently shipping "Alverstone"-codenamed prototypes. Of course, with progress comes hype: according to Ed Doller, Numonyx's "prospective" CTO, "This is the most significant non-volatile memory advancement in 40 years." Show us the memory!
