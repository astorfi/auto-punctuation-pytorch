Coming hot on the heels of news that the Kickflip is no more, the glossy black Drift appears to be more of a phone in the Hero vein on account of its slider form factor. It'll apparently come equipped with a 2-megapixel camera, Bluetooth (something the Kickflip sorely lacked) with A2DP, and a QVGA display, though we can't yet confirm that it'll be rocking the aforementioned Java platform from XCE. We'll pass on more Drift news as we get it, but expect the phone to launch fairly shortly.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
