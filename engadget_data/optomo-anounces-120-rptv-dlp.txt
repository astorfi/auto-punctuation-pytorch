 During CES every manufacture tries to trump the rest of their industry by announcing the one thing that everyone will say was the best thing they saw at the show. Optoma announces a 120" DLP rear projection HDTV, they are currently selling  80", 90" and 100" models, and plan to have the 120" during the second half of 2007. The line features 10,000:1 contrast, 1:1 scan conversion and the usual suspects of inputs. If you can't live without a 120" TV then it is going to set you back about $49,999, if that is too much for you, maybe the 80" is at your price point at $22,999.[Via Shiny Shiny]
