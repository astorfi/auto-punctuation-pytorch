You know when it's coming, for how much, and what you're gonna get, so it's really just a matter of asking yourself whether you're hardcore enough to drop almost five bills on an(other) Xbox 360. Well, that and whether you can sneak that cash out of the old joint checking account without your significant other noticing. (Side note: Circuit City lists all the accessories -- including the 120GB drive -- as being released early on the 25th, unlike the Elite, which is still set for the 29th.)[Thanks, Cosmin]Pre-order: Elite, 120GB drive, black controller, play and charge, black battery pack
