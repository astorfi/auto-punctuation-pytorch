  Microsoft has a big battle ahead to overcome the overwhelming popularity of the iPad on the tablet computing front, and its Intel-powered slates might be starting at a distinct disadvantage if a DigiTimes report is to be believed. The site indicates that neither Intel nor Microsoft are willing to cut their prices to help manufacturers, the former providing the Clover Trail hardware and the latter the Windows 8 software, which could see these machines starting at $599 and going way up from there. This could send manufacturers looking for lesser-expensive ARM-powered hardware, creating tablets incapable of executing the current gamut of x86 Windows software. Will users pay a premium for app compatibility as tablet prices on other platforms plummet? Just how attached are you to that copy of Wing Commander you've been hanging on to for decades?
