Until now, you needed to be a paying member of Sony's PlayStation Plus club to qualify, but that requirement has now finally been dropped. Check out our experience with Hulu Plus on the PS3 if you still need help deciding whether the $9.99 TV streaming service is worth your hard-earned greenbacks. Those of us unlucky enough to be living on another continent will just go drown our sorrows with another round of Black Ops mayhem.
