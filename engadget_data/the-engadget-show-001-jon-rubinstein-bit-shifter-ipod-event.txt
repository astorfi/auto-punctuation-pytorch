 

Well it's finally, really happened. The very first Engadget Show is done and ready for your viewing pleasure. First up, Josh sits down with Palm CEO Jon Rubinstein for an in-depth discussion, then Nilay and Paul join the fray for a dissection of recent news -- including the recent Apple iPod event, the Motorola CLIQ, and a hands-on look at an early version of the as-yet-unreleased Nokia N900!

We're still getting our T's crossed and I's dotted for the Zune and iTunes subscriptions, but you can download the full HD video below -- or just sit back and watch the streaming file up above.

Hosts: Joshua Topolsky, Paul Miller, Nilay Patel
