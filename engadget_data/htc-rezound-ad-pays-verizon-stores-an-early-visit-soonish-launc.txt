We're pretty sure these adverts aren't supposed to be displayed for our eyes to see since they feature the HTC Rezound, a forthcoming 4G device that hasn't even been announced yet. Oops. Additionally, the handset -- featured front and center on the ad -- shows off a pair of Beats headphones dangling out of its 3.5mm jack. Are there any naysayers that still think the Rezound won't get its official outing at HTC's event this week? Count us amongst the believers.
