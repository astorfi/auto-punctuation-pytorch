 Listen up boys and girls, if you've been cramming change into your piggy banks and patiently waiting, you'd better go get a hammer, because Target has got your PS3 for $100 cheaper. Hot on the heels of the Circuit City circular rumors, we've gotten word that certain (read: not all) Target stores are offering the Sony game system for $499.99, although it appears that the reduction is making its way through the company's computers. Either Sony is headed towards a price drop, or Target is just being real generous.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
