 We're still trying to clear our DVRs from last week's flood of fall premieres, but luckily there's only a few brand new shows arriving this week. On the other hand, there are a slew of Blu-ray releases and videogames debuting, so plan your time carefully. Find any new favorites among the shows making their debut last week? Let us know in the comments below and check out the highlights this week, followed after the break by our weekly listing of what to look out for in TV, Blu-ray and videogames.  NBA 2K13 With competitor NBA Live shelved (again) there's only one option for hoops on your console this year, luckily it's a pretty good one. NBA 2K13 has reworked its control scheme (again) and listed Jay-Z as its executive producer to promise some extra flair and a booming soundtrack. We can't wait for the annual rite of popping the game in, taking on our friends online and quickly getting disconnected as the servers get overloaded (again.) ($58.99 on Amazon for PS3 and Xbox 360)  30 Rock One of NBC's best comedies finally returns this week with Liz Lemon, Jack Donaghy, Tracy Jordan and all the rest trying to put together their sketch comedy series each week. We have no idea what this season has in store but Tina Fey and the rest of the writers rarely disappoint. Now, just bring back Community and we'll be happy NBC. (October 4th, 8PM, NBC)
