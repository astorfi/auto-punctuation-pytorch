Specifically, the leak we've got here calls out the blue version of the phone (probably the same blue on the Droid 2 of old); the white model isn't mentioned, so it's unclear whether Verizon's planning on holding that one back for a bit longer. We suppose it's possible that the white looks just a little too much like the pricey R2-D2 edition for Big Red's comfort, so they might want to give the spunky little astromech droid a bit more exclusivity before hauling in another white model (with better radios, no less). Seeing how the Droid Pro looks targeted for a week later on the 18th, this might be the very first CDMA / GSM dual-mode Android phone on the market -- so who's excited?
