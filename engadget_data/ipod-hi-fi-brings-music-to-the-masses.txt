Apple has decided to go after the boomboxcrowd, as well as home listeners, with the iPod Hi-Fi, a $349 speaker system with built-in iPod dock that runs on Dbatteries as well as AC power. A rear-mounted auxiliary input works with the iPod shuffle (and third-party audioplayers, though you won't hear Apple mention that). That sound you just heard, by the way, wasn't the iPod Hi-Fi. Itwas the sound of a hundred iPod accessory makers moaning in agony.
