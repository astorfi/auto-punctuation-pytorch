12, 13, 14, 15, 17-inches, nothing's good enough to satisfy you. Well, fine.
We promised there would be a
19-inch laptop, and here you freaking go. In fact, the
Samsung M70 is so damned huge they had to take that 1680 x 1050 19-inch LCD and make it fully detachable with a DVI
port. But it's not like you're going to get one here any time soon because of that American non-compete with Dell, so
not only do you have to save up for the machine, but also for the trip to Korea to fetch one. And for the inevitable
visits to the chiropractor.
