Then the following week The Hulk is finally seeing the light of day and Kevin Costner's Field of Dreams are going to be available on the format. Both of these discs are going to carry a price of $29.99 and the Miami Vice combo will hit at $39.99. At this rate, sooner or later Universal is going to run out of titles in their vast library -- well, maybe not, but they are sure releasing a bunch of HD DVDs lately.Read: Miami ViceRead: The Hulk and Field of Dreams
