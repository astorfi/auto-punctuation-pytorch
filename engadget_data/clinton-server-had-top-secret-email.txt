Those concerns that Hillary Clinton's private email server had classified intel? They're apparently well-founded. Sources for Fox News and Politico maintain that two of the messages sent to Clinton were labeled as "top secret" when fresh. One of them was eventually reduced to "secret," but critics say that's beside the point: they're worried that the email wasn't subject to tougher government security standards, and could have been compromised.



Whether or not the messages are a legal problem for Clinton and her presidential election campaign are another matter. The FBI is still investigating whether or not the politician violated the law by running her own server instead of funneling everything through official channels. Any findings of illegality may well derail Clinton's campaign, but a declaration of innocence could easily thwart further attacks.
