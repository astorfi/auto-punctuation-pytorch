While the 37- and 32-inch DT30 (pictured above) will both ship in April for $1,299 and $1,199, respectively and include the newly upgraded Viera Connect (now with Hulu Plus) smart TV platform, 3D features and more, some of the lower end lines like the E3 and X30 series will make do with a stripped-down Easy IPTV package featuring just the basics -- Netflix, Amazon VOD, Napster, Pandora, Facebook and CinemaNow. Check the full release after the break for all the details, we'll just be waiting around for the big boy VT and GT plasma TVs to make landfall in the coming weeks assuming the rest of the early info holds true.
