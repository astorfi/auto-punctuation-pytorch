The move is part of the Taiwanese manufacturer's efforts to "streamline operations" and focus on selling One-branded handsets in markets where it stands a better chance of success -- rather like Nokia's geographic retreat following its commitment to Windows Phone, but here on a much smaller scale. It's not yet clear how many jobs will be lost, but HTC says it regrets the "direct impact on people who have contributed to the growth HTC has experienced in the past several years." As it stands, analysts reckon that Korean manufacturers like Samsung, LG and Pantech rule a 90 percent share of their home market, leaving HTC with just one or two points that evidently weren't worth clinging onto.
