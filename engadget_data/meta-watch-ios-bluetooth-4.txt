 
 Can't wait for the Pebble E-Paper Watch to ship this fall? The Meta Watch developer system that we first saw last year just got a major upgrade, and could serve as an acceptable stand-in for now, with the arrival of both iOS support and Bluetooth 4.0 to the $199 connected wearable. The device includes a 96 x 96-pixel sunlight-viewable LCD, six programmable buttons, an accelerometer, vibrating motor, ambient light sensor and a black or white strap. The developer platform Meta Watch is available through Texas Instruments now for $199. Hit up the source link after the break to make it your own.
