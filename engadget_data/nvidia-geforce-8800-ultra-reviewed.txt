Not surprisingly, the card simply blew through all their benchmarks, which proved to be enough for bit-tech to declare the 8800 Ultra the "fastest graphics card on the planet." Less clear, however, is if that bump in performance is worth the hefty premium the card demands over the still-impressive GeForce 8800 GTX (especially an overclocked one). Those considering the card still have a bit more time to ponder that last point though, as it won't be available to the public 'till May 15th.
