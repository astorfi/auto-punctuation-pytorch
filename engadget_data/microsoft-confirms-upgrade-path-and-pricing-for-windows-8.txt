 We've just gotten a thorough look at the Windows 8 Release Preview, and Microsoft has now also finally confirmed what the upgrade path will look like for those buying PCs before the OS is officially released later this year. The company will be rolling out a Windows Upgrade Offer in no less than 131 markets starting June 2nd, which will let anyone who buys an eligible Windows 7-based PC also purchase a Windows 8 Pro upgrade for $14.99 -- that offer will be valid through January 31st, 2013. Upgrade offers for those who already own a Windows 7-based PC will also be announced in the "coming months," but that's unfortunately as much as Microsoft is saying about those at the moment.
