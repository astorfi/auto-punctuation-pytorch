Nothing we don't know about here: 12.1 megapixels, 3-inch Live View screen with HD video recording and a kit price of $1,299. Not bad -- and that HD video mode certainly sounds intriguing. At least detailed specs will still be a tiny surprise, eh?Update: Nikon press release makes it official. Read it here.
