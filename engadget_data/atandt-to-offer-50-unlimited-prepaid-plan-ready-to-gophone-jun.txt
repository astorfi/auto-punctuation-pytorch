 Boost and Verizon shouldn't have all the fun, right? The latest kid to do a cannonball into the low-cost prepaid pool is wearing a blue-and-orange swimsuit, as AT&T will be ready to start up $50 unlimited GoPhone plans June 26th. The new prepaid selection sheds $10 off its previous limitless talk and text offering, while tossing in web access for Quick Messaging Phones. In order to be fully competitive in the pay-as-you-go realm, the aforementioned plan will allow the same texting privileges across our borders; you'll be able to SMS or IM your buddies in Mexico, Canada, and 100 other countries. The unfortunate (albeit unsurprising) part is that heading the smartphone route will come at an additional monthly cost, ranging from $5 to $25. Even though it seems Big Blue is a little tardy for the party, a wireless giant is never late -- it arrives exactly when it means to. Full press release after the break.
