This screen shot was supposedly somehow captured at a T-Mobile conference detailing a so-named multimedia-friendly device manufactured by Motorola and sporting some RAZR co-branding, indicating that it would probably retain some of the RAZR's trademark looks (read: thin, sleek, metal). Frankly, we think the whole sitch is pretty believable; after all, no one said Sharp would be the only company manufacturing devices on Danger's platform, and customers have been crying for a more "adult, professional" rendition of the Sidekick pretty much since day one. We'll keep a close eye on this one and try to debunk it or validate it just as soon as we can.[Thanks, Ed]
