From Given Imaging, a new wireless version of their M2A swallowable pill camera with a low-power transmitter
built-in that can beam photos of your insides to a special receiver you wear on your belt. Normally with these sorts of
pill cameras you have to, um, evacuate them in order to get the photos, so having a wireless trasmitter
built-in means no more waiting!
