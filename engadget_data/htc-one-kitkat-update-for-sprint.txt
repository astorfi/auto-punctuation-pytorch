HTC must feel that it's best to underpromise and overdeliver. While the company told American One owners that they wouldn't get KitKat on time, the 535MB Android upgrade is already available on Sprint; eager subscribers just have to check for an update to start downloading. More patient types can wait until February 11th, when the carrier will begin pushing the OS to all users. There's no word of an accelerated launch on other US networks, so Sprint customers may be sitting pretty for the next couple of weeks.

HTC One Owners - Happy to share that Sprint is the 1st US carrier to launch #Android 4.4 on HTC One! Update available soon! #SprintRocks!
