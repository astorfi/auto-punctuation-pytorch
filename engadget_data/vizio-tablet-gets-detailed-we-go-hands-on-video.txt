The tablet runs Gingerbread at present, though Vizio has said that it's willing to make the leap over to the tablet-optimized Honeycomb, as soon as that operating system is deemed sufficiently stable by the company. The 1024 x 768 device is multimedia-minded, with an IR controller on the top that lets the whole thing double as a remote for your living room entertainment devices like TVs and VCRs. The tablet also features HDMI out and speakers on the top and side, so you can maintain stereo listening even when you switch its orientation.

	Blake Griffin's favorite touchscreen device will be hitting store shelves next month for a fairly reasonable $349 -- we wouldn't have expected anything less than an affordable price point from a company like Vizio. And we have to say, it's a pretty solid feeling piece of hardware for that price. The software doesn't seem quite perfect at the moment, but we're happy to hold off judgment until we get some hands-on time with the final version in the near future. Check out a video tour of the tablet below.
