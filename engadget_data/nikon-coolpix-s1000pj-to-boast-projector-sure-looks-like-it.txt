The rumor early this morning was that Nikon would be announcing a small digital camera with an LED projector in the very near future, with a shelf-date sometime in September -- the VP650. Well, now Photo Review has some shots of this supposed badboy. The Coolpix S1000pj will supposedly boast a projector capable of projecting an image up to up to 40 inches in size, with a remote control and projector stand as part of the package. The camera itself will be a 12.1 megapixel affair, with a 5x Zoom-Nikkor lens with 28mm wide-angle coverage -- with pricing at $699 AUD (that's about $587). Word is that VP650 was just a codename for the product, and we'd think we'll be hearing much, much more about this little dude in the very near future. There's one more shot to check out after the break.[Via Nikon Rumors]
