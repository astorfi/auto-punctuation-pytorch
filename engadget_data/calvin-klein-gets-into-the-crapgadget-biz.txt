Somehow, these sunglasses with a 4GB flash drive stuffed into the right stem are simultaneously uninteresting and horrifying to us... though we certainly enjoy the mental imagery of spotting someone sporting these while half a stem-piece is jammed into their laptop. If you're enough of a fashion victim to consider purchasing these bad boys, they'll be unleashed on the waiting world in October, and run you about $200. [Via Switched]
