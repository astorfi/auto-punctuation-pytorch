Many thousands of New Yorkers joined us over the weekend for the city's very first Engadget Expand. There's no question that our premier Manhattan show was a raging success, and if you didn't make it out, we have the pictures to prove it. During the two-day event we heard from LeVar Burton, Spike Lee, Reggie Watts, Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky, Cheezburger's Ben Huh, MIT's Joi Ito, and dozens of other brilliant speakers and industry leaders. We handed out $25,000 to Insert Coin winners DIWire Bender and GrowCubes, and sponsors like Lenovo, Sony and Chevrolet kept attendees entertained at the Javits Center with tons of new blockbuster gadgets (and even a few cars). We enlisted photographers Jenna Bascom and Craig Barritt to capture all of the Expand NY magic -- dig through dozens of killer pics in the galleries just below.
