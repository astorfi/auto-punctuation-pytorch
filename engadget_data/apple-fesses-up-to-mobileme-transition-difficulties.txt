Now, into the early hours of Friday, and almost a day after the iPhone 3G's launch in NZ, we've seen maybe a total of 30 minutes of scattered uptime for the service, and Apple is finally confessing that the transition is "taking longer than expected." The good news is that .Mac users should still be able to check their mail, sync their contacts and use their iDisks, but at the moment there's no telling when MobileMe's sexy new web apps will be available, or what to expect next as far as those other services.Update: For what it's worth, MobileMe is up again -- now with working email and new "Getting Started" tours which we haven't seen before. Looks promising but we'll need to give it a few hours to burn-in. Screenshot after the break.Update 2: And by "up" we meant "not up," of course. Get it right, people. [Thanks, Alec A]
