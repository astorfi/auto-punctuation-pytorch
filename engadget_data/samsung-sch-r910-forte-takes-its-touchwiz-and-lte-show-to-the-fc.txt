The SCH-R910 Forte, which we last saw courtesy of Mr. Blurrycam a few weeks ago, has just had its FCC test results posted for the world to see. If you've missed prior reports, we're told it will sport a 1GHz processor and five megapixel camera, but none of that is confirmed just yet. Sadly no test photos were released, so we'll have to keep waiting for glamour shots, but we do now know where the FCC label can be found: inside the battery cover. That's one less mystery to ponder today.
