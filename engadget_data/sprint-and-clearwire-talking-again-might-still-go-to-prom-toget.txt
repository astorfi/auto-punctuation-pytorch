Apparently all that interest in Clearwire from ICO, Amp'd, and DirecTV was enough to get Sprint back to the table, and Reuters is reporting that the new venture could see additional funding from Google and Best Buy to keep costs down. Still, we hate to see hearts break, and if this one doesn't work out, well, maybe it's time to set some boundaries, get some distance and seek out some new national telecom companies to partner with -- you two deserve better than this.
