The original model has now fallen to $149.99 on contract on Verizon's site, and evidence from the carrier's internal systems (see after the break for that) suggests it'll be hanging around at that price until at least the tail end of January. Meanwhile, that same internal screenshot is also showing the Droid X holding steady at $199.99 until December 30, so we wouldn't count on getting any sweet deals -- or a dual-mode version of the 4.3-inch beast -- at any point in 2010. Interestingly, the Droid 2 R2-D2 edition is holding steady at $250, so you'd better really want it. Go ahead and follow the break for the evidence.

Update: The Droid Incredible is now $150 direct from Verizon, too -- and considering how universally well-liked that thing is, the Droid 2 might still be a tough sell at the same price. Decisions!
