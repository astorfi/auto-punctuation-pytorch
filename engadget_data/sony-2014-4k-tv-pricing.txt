Sony has nailed down the final launch details for its newest 4K Bravia TVs, and surprise -- they just might be affordable this year. The "entry-level" XBR-X850B series will start at a relatively frugal $2,099 for a 49-inch model, with prices peaking at $5,499 for a 70-inch set. If you've got a bit more cash and want upgrades to both audio and wall mounting, the XBR-X900B line starts at $3,999 for a 55-inch set and scales up to $8,999 for a 79-inch variant. There's still a couple of models for the money-is-no-object crowd, of course. The improved LED lighting of the 65-inch XBR-X950B will set you back $7,999, while the display's 85-inch sibling costs an eye-watering $24,999. All of the 4K sets ship in June.



          
 
 
 The company also hasn't forgotten about those with earlier Bravia sets. It's releasing an updated version of its 4K media player, the FMP-X10, this summer. There's no pricing just yet, but it has 1TB of storage for downloaded Video Unlimited movies and supports the same 4K Netflix movies as newer Bravia TVs. The previous model sold for $699, although Sony has bundled it with sets for free or at a discount -- whatever the new one costs, you may not have to pay full price.
