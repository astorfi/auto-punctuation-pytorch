Expect to see some laser mice that aren't made by Logitech sometime in the very near future. Logitech's exclusive
deal with Agilent, the company which makes the more sensitive and accurate laser sensor used in
Logitech's MX1000 mouse (pictured at
right), expires this month, freeing Agilent to sell the sensors to whomever they please.
