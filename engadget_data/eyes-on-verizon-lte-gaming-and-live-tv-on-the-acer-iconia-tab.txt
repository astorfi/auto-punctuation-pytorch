Hosting a game of Dungeon Defenders on an Alienware M11x laptop (also connected to LTE), Verizon joined the party with an Acer Iconia Tab, and a pair of the slates were able to go head-to-head in a peer-to-peer Asphalt 5 6 race over LTE as well. What's more, the carrier showed us an experimental version of its FiOS DVR Manager app, which streamed live television to the Iconia over LTE -- similar to what we saw on the iPad. Unlike the games, it was choppy and took some time to cache, but we'll have to see what it's like when (or if) it's finalized. Of course, if you had just clicked the play button on the above video instead of reading these words, you'd already know all that.
