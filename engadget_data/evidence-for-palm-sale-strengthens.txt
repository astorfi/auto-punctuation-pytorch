 While sometimes a punching bag in the mobile industry, Palm has oft delivered the goods and have been innovators in the smartphone market -- but facing stiff competition from the likes of HTC, Motorola, and Samsung as of late, the tired Treo design is aguably in desperate need of an overhaul. The most recent news has Palm allegedly retaining an investment banker to explore opportunities to sell its soul to the highest bidder, and rumor has it the company could fetch $20 a share -- a fair deal higher than its current trading price. While we may pine the loss of Palm -- on the "cup is half full" side of things -- if speculation is correct about the sale, we may well end up with something better. The fact that this news has persisted since last month might lend some credibility, though whether it will be Nokia at the head of the line remains to be seen.
