  It's taken about eight months, but Sky Go is finally available on select Android handsets (HTC Desire, HTC Desire S, HTC Desire HD, HTC Incredible, HTC Sensation, Samsung Galaxy S, Samsung Galaxy S II) after launching on iOS last year. Beyond the limited hardware support, there's a few other caveats to be aware of -- the app is only supported on Android 2.2 and 2.3, so when Ice Cream Sandwich hits some of those phones soon, users will be forced to choose between upgrading or keeping Sky Go working. Another drawback is that due to DRM, the app is blocked from working on rooted devices. Once users have jumped through those hoops though, there will also be even more content available for viewing on all platforms including Sky Atlantic, Sky 1, Sky Living and Sky Arts 1, before F1 coverage launches in March. Speaking of F1 -- Sky also announced its new channel will bring 5.1 surround sound to UK and Ireland broadcasts for the first time this season.
