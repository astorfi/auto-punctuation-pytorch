Though Helio's entire lineup to date has been at least fashion-conscious (with the Hero arguably the notable exception), the A303 might stand to be Helio's first fashion-focused model on account of its magically disappearing touch-sensitive controls. Other features should include a decent 140MB of internal storage and a 1.3 megapixel cam. No word on release, but with all due respect to Samsung, this isn't really the unreleased Helio we're most looking forward to at the moment.
