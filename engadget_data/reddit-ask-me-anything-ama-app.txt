Reddit's Ask Me Anything (AMA) interviews with celebrities run the gamut from stellar to ugly, but they're usually entertaining -- and there's now a dedicated app. That means you won't have to wade through the site's copious content to find interviews with the likes of Aaron Paul (above) or Bill Gates. You can choose hot, recent or all-time popular AMAs, then see a description of the interviewee. From there, you can narrow it down to just questions that were answered, or see every question posed. Reddit told Variety that it's trying to be more proactive in marketing features like AMA, rather than solely relying its (formidable) organic growth. For instance, the AMA's recent explosion in popularity was due in large part to an impromptu session by President Obama. The AMA app is now available for iOS and should be hitting Android next week.
