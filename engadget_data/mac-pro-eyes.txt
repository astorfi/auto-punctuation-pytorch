It wasn't behind protective glass this time, so that's definitely a step in the right direction for the next-generation Mac Pro, which was first trotted out at WWDC back in June. Today it was beautifully sprawled out for all the world to see, in various states of deconstruction. The display certainly speaks to just how easy it is to take the pro desktop apart, so you can go in and rejigger the components as you see fit. As mentioned before, the $3,000 workstation is surprisingly compact for such a powerhouse -- you'll likely have no difficulty lifting it up with the handle at top.


We got a gallery below featuring a slew of different angles on the Pro, so you can get a close up view of the 3.7GHz quad-core Xeon CPU, 12GB of RAM and, of course, the Darth Vader mask vent. Hopefully that'll be enough to tide you over between now and the product's December launch date. And what about power? Thankfully, this time out there were a trio of Pros actually plugged in. The most impressive of the three demos was 4K video editing in Final Cut. Thanks in no small part to the dual-GPUs, our friendly Apple rep had the tower hooked up to two monitors (you can do up to three in Mavericks, mind), editing 16 angles in 4K with no discernible delay in rending occurring. An impressive feat, to say the least. The new Pro is likely to maintain Apple's spot as a darling amongst pro video editors -- and, naturally, we can't wait to get our hands on the thing for a little benchmarking action.
