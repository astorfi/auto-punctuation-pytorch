 As expected, Verizon has launched its MediaFLO-capable SCH-U620 slider from Samsung today, the first device to support its VCAST TV mobile television service (the arguably cooler LG VX9400 is still waiting in the wings). Besides the productivity-sapping teevee, the diminutive slider offers up Bluetooth, EV-DO (naturally), microSD expansion, 1.3 megapixel cam, and QVGA display (gotta have some clarity while you're watching MTV, right?). Launch markets (see the u620's product page for the full listing) can get their hands on the phone today for $150 after contract and discounts.
