 For almost a year, Belkin has been teasing followers of the Wireless USB hub by constantly pushing back the official release date. At the rate they're going, someone else might beat them to market, Icron hopes it's them. The WiRanger is a 4 port USB 2.0 hub that leverages the company's proprietary ExtremeUSB technology to connect devices to any PC or Mac via 802.11g within a 100-foot range. We're skeptical to say the least. Icron has set a Spring release date and considering Belkin's track record, it will likely be the first product out the door.
