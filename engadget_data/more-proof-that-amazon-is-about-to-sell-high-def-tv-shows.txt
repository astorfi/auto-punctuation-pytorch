Here recently, Amazon's Video On Demand service has been expanding onto just about every media playing console / box / etc. out there, but now that Apple has stepped up the game by offering HD movies for sale, it seems that Amazon's about to pop out some new functionality of its own. Long story short, the noodling crew over at NewTeeVee managed to poke around and find some pretty hard evidence that Amazon will soon be selling HD TV shows for $2.99 apiece, and while none of the links they stumbled upon were live, we reckon it's only a matter of time at this point.[Via Boy Genius Report]
