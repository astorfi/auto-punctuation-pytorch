 People love The Weather Channel. Some are addicted to it. But check this out. What if there was a high-def Weather Channel? Would you watch it? We would. Gorgeous high-def graphics coupled with breathtaking views of the weather across the globe. It's simply a great idea. Perhaps not all the location based cameras would be in high definition but all the studio shots and graphics could. They have been prepping for the transition for a few months now but there still is no sign of it.Wonder how long it will be till we see The Weather Channel go high-def?
