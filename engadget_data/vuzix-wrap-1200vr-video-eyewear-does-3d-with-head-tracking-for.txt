With the Wrap 1200VR, you'll again be viewing a simulated 75-inch, 3D (or 2D, if you'd prefer) 16:9 display at ten feet away. The shades feature a single 852 x 480 monitor per eye and support input resolutions of up to 1280 x 720. The VR bit comes from the included Wrap Tracker 6TC with compass, which enables head-tracking with three degrees of freedom. Better yet, its coupled drift control should maintain silky smooth visuals when you're tilting your noggin' to scope out the on-screen action. Out of box, these specs are said to play nice with most Windows machine's graphics cards and VGA connections, but adapters are required to rock them with your PS3 or Xbox 360. If your eyes are already tearing up with joy, you'll find full details in the PR just past the break.

Update: We initially reported the that the Vuzix Wrap 1200VR outputs video in simulated 720p, when it actually supports input resolutions up to 1280 x 720 -- both WVGA monitors have a resolution of 852 x 480. We've updated this post accordingly.
