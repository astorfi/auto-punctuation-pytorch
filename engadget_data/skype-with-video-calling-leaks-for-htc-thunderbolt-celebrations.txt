For those outside of The Loop, there was quite the back-and-forth going during the early days, with Verizon announcing at the 11th hour that its flagship LTE phone would be shipped sans Skype. It's still unavailable in the bona fide Android Market, but a build has appeared from the ether and seems to be humming along just fine here at Engadget HQ.

Update: So we just happened to have a Thunderbolt on hand, and gave Skype's mobile video chat a try. We came away quite impressed -- video is as good as can be expected from the handset's 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera, and the experience on WiFi and LTE is virtually indistinguishable. The app even worked on 3G, though that reduced the picture quality to the point of being almost unusable.
