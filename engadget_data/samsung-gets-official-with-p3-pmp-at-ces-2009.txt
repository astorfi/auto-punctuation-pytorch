As anticipated, the PMP arrives with its "evolutionary" EmoTure user interface, 4/8/16/32GB of internal storage, haptic feedback, a 3-inch WQVGA display, DNSe 3.0 sound enhancement technology and a Music Hot Touch Key that enables users to instantly access favorite music features / selections without having to wade through multiple menus. The device itself is just 0.39-inches thick, and it also boasts a voice recorder, FM radio and Bluetooth support. Check it sometime during the first half of this year in matte black / matte silver motifs.
