If you're shopping for a gadget freak this year, like some Engadget reader for instance, you might consider lending
them a hand in the old juice flow department; everyone needs a little extra power for their collection of cellphones,
media players, and other fine toys. So for this lucky person, the Voltaic solar-powered messenger bag just might do the
trick. It includes adapters for all sorts of devices and a Li-ion battery for powering that gadgety horde when the bag
ain't catchin' any rays. The $229 price isn't too bad for the tech in question, and the bag is a durable nylon with
waterproof solar panels. We like ours just fine, and we're sure your giftee will too.
