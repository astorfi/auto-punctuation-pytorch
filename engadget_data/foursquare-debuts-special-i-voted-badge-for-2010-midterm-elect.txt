And if you're the kind of person that needs a present for doing things you should or would probably do regardless, well, this one's for you. Foursquare's just announced a special badge just to show that you voted in tomorrow's election! You can grab the 2010 election badge anytime tomorrow by voting and then checking in at your local polling place. The company is teaming up with a host of other organizations for real-time voting analytics as well, so if you're a numbers junkie, be sure to check out the source link.
