At long last, Audiovox has begun shipping the audio-only DPF710K ($149.99), which sticks upside your fridge and provides a 7-inch display, a dry erase board, digital clock, Post-it pad and a LED message indicator for good measure. If you haven't pieced it together, this thing seeks to simplify your family's lives by providing a base for leaving photos and messages, and we'll admit, it does have a smidgen of a Jetsons vibe to it. Those holding out for the video-capable DPF711K can lay down their $199.99 later this month. Nice hair, kiddo.
