LaCie may be better known for its sleek n' shiny
Porsche hard drives, but the company has
apparently decided to go 180 with its latest drive and borrow a design from that ultimate accessory for geeks and kids
alike, Lego blocks. The LaCie Brick is available in
red, white and blue, in capacities from 160GB to 500GB, and prices from $120 to $400. And, yes, they stack just like
real Legos, making the idea of picking up several smaller drives rather than one big device very tempting.
