Because our Editor-in-chief, Joshua Topolsky, will be guesting on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and we're pretty sure you won't want to miss it... unless you hate awesome surprises (trust us, it's a doozy). If you need your memory jogged on the last time Josh and Jimmy met up (or just haven't seen it yet) check out the video above. Then, make sure to set your alarms -- you'll be sorry if you don't!Read - Late Night with Jimmy FallonRead - NBC schedule
