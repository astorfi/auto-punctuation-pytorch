This year's lineup is pretty exhaustive, featuring everything from the no-dock Duet 200 with two 10-watt speakers, to the On Stage 400ID (pictured), with four Odyssey drivers and a built-in sub. In between you've got the On Stage 200ID two-speaker unit and the On Stage IIIP with four Odyssey drivers but no sub. Road warriors will want to check out the On Stage Micro Color speaker dock in several new colors, with two Odyssey drivers, and the On Time clock series gets a new 200ID model and the HD Radio / HD Tagging-capable 400IHD units. Check 'em all out after the break!
