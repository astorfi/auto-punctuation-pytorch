You're going to have to do some serious kissing up to your boss to get one (unless you work in the defense sector),
but SGI's pleased as punch to debut their Intel-based Prism, one of the first Itanium 2 systems to be released in quite
awhile. The single or dual-CPU workstation can bust up to 24GB of RAM, runs Linux or Windows instead of Irix (which is
the SGI-kept Unix variant), and will run you about $8,500 to startâ€”a number a mite bit easier to swallow than the
Orion's tongue-swallowing pricetag.
