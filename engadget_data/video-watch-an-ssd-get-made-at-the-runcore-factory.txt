TweakTown's been on-site at the Runcore facility in Hangzhou, China as of late, and hot on the heels of testing its 1.8-inch Pro IV SSD line, they've taken a tour of the facility to see one of them being produced. During their tour, Runcore had the 128GB 1.8-inch ZIF Pro IV drive on the line, and it's a pretty interesting affair. The factory itself is not operated by Runcore, but you'll get to see the high speed SMT (Surface Mount Technology) machine in action, and also get a peek of the testing phase! Check the video after the break.
