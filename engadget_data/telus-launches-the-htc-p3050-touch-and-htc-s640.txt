A upgradeable (from left) HTC P3050 Touch (HTC Vogue) and the HTC S640 (HTC Iris) in the Canadian market this morning. The P3050 is the CDMA equivalent of the GSM Touch and packs the same goodies under the shell including Windows Mobile 6, The lovely TouchFLO UI, 320 x 240 display, Bluetooth, and sadly doesn't pack WiFi or the GPS we had hoped for. This fella is in the shops as of today from CAD $499 off contract to CAD $149 on a 3 year stint. The S640 is the CDMA flavor of the Cavalier and Excalibur, packs Windows Mobile 6, Bluetooth, WiFi, and eschews all that touchscreen goodness for a good ol' fashioned keypad. Pricing is set from CAD $449 off contract to CAD $149 on a 3 year contract. Things are rocking north of the border for the EV-DO crowd, so here's hoping they land here soon, and yes, we're looking at you Sprint and Verizon.Read - HTC P3050 "Touch"Read - HTC S640
