The natty looking snapper bears a strong family resemblance to the X-Pro1 model, but looks to be flaunting a pop-up flash, and lacks the optical viewfinder of the flagship model. The sneaked pics show black and silver-topped models, as well as a previously announced lens, the 18-55 f/2.8-4.0 OIS zoom that has yet to hit the market. No other details, such as price, are available yet, but the model will likely slot behind the X-Pro1 and ahead of the X100 to fill out the retro-look X-family.
