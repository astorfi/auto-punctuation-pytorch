 
LTE may only just be launching in countries like the US and Sweden, but NTT DoCoMo recently announced that it's starting to field test the better, faster, stronger LTE-Advanced. The Japanese carrier is experimenting with the new technology in the cities of Yokosuka and Sagamihara and gathering data to evaluate performance in indoor vs. outdoor environments. LTE-Advanced is backwards-compatible with NTT DoCoMo's existing LTE network, but reaches speeds up to 1Gbps down and 200Mbps up. No word on when the carrier plans to make the new technology available to its customers.

LTE-Advanced is backward compatible with LTE, which will enable a smooth migration from DOCOMO's existing LTE network.Standardization of LTE-Advanced is currently being finalized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). In October 2010, LTE-Advanced was accepted by the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) as a technology compliant with the requirements of IMT-Advanced.(Attachment) LTE-Advanced Key Technologies Implemented in DOCOMO's Experimental EquipmentAbout NTT DOCOMONTT DOCOMO is the world's leading mobile operator and provider of advanced mobile services.
