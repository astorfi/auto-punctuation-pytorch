       The recent sale on HD DVD players is going great for Toshiba; by keeping the price of a HD DVD players almost half of the cheapest standalone Blu-ray player they have continued to win the player race. Sure the PS3 is out there, -- with much higher quantities-- but the movie attach rate for a PS3 is nowhere near a regular player. With players sales up, and movie sales up, whats stopping HD DVD from taking this thing all the way? That's right, the PS3, as the BDA expected, people are buying them as Blu-ray players and gamers are buying movies. So where does this all end? We sure couldn't tell you, but in the meantime, we're enjoying the show.
