 Itwouldn't be a day without some craptastic leaked shots of a new product, now, would it? Here's a new offering from SonyEricsson that looks a bit like a mashup of the new W810i andthe K750i -- it's got the same keypad and coloring as the latter,with the three-in-one button controls and central nav element of the W810i. The pics also show a new UI rumoured to bein development at Sony Ericsson, and other rumoured specs include a 3.2 megapixel camera, EDGE, QVGA screen, and someother new goodies not yet seen in the W810i. Click on over for a few more pics. [Thanks, ixalon and Memzee]
