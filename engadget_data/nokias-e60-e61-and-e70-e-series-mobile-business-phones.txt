Looks like Nokia's announced their new E60, E61, and
E70 3G (WCDMA) phones with WiFi and mobile mail targeting
mobile business users (yes, it's got GoodLink, Nokia Business Center, Seven Always-On, Visto Mobile, and BlackBerry
Connect support). All the Series 60 Es run on Symbian OS 9.1 and will support advanced voice services such as
Push-To-Talk and SIP allowing companies to integrate these phones into their Avaya or Cisco IP PBX (think 4-digit
dialing and assisted call answering). The E60 candybar is optimized for voice and targets GSM 900 / 1800 / 1900 and
WCDMA2100 networks while the E61 takes a shot off the
Motorola Q's bow and includes all the IP telephony
functions but is optimized for mobile email and operates in quad-band GSM and WCDMA 2100 networks. The E70 is their enterprise all-in-one
messaging device and will
be released in two flavas: one for Europe and Asia and another for the Americas. Available in the first quarter of 2006
worldwide priced between €350 and €450. This is a big deal for Nokia—more pics after the jump.
