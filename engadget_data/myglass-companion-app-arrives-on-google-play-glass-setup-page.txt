Between word that Explorer Editions are being produced, a reveal of spec details and documentation for the Mirror API being published, it's been a busy night for Google Glass announcements. Now, Mountain View has pushed up the hardware's Android companion app, dubbed MyGlass, to Google Play. Sure, you can download it on any device toting Android 4.0.3 or higher, but Page and Co. say, "If you don't have Glass, then downloading this will be a waste of time." Launching the app takes users through a setup process for the eyewear, which the search behemoth has made available on a webpage as well. Google's also posted a "help" directory to give folks unfamiliar with the glasses a tour of the spectacles. Hit the source links below for the app, the setup experience and the newly added overview of the device.
