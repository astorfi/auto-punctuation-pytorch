It seems like one giant smartphone has been getting all the attention lately, but one of its biggest rivals (literally) is finally set to touch down stateside. Samsung confirmed today that the Galaxy Note 4 will hit the US on October 17, and you can lay claim to yours starting tomorrow from all the usual carrier suspects. We've enjoyed our brief time getting to know the Note 4 and all the little improvements it brings to the table (hello, Quad HD screen!), but here's the thing -- the jury's still out on whether Samsung has done enough with its newest S-Pen experiment to make it worth an immediate upgrade. As always, pricing will vary a bit depending on who you get your service though: a Note 4 with a bog-standard two year AT&T or Verizon contract will set you back $299, while T-Mobile wants nothing upfront and monthly payments of $31.24 for the next 24 months. Alas, our friends across the pond will get a bit of a headstart on us - Notes will drop onto their store shelves a full week earlier.
