The obviously conceptual F-CELL Roadster hearkens back to M-B vehicles of old, though the engine is far from retro. Controlled with drive-by-wire technology and utilizing a joystick rather than a conventional steering wheel, this whip is (theoretically, at least) powered by a 1.2kW emission-free fuel cell system located at the rear. We're told that it could reach an enviable top speed of 15.5mph, and the 217 mile operating range definitely has us salivating. Frankly, this one's all about the design, and we can't implore you enough to give the read link a visit for lots more high-res action.
