To that end, it makes sense that they'd want to release a second version sans camera -- and a new leak speaking of "the new Enterprise-focused DROID phone without a camera" suggests that's exactly what's happening. Our trusted source says they're "99 percent positive" that's what we're looking at here; not a product for everyone, of course, but if you work in the government lab where they keep all the alien corpses, you'll probably be thanking your lucky stars.
