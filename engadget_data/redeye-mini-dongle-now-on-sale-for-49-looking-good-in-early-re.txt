Thinkflood's RedEye Mini -- which simply plugs into the headphone jack of your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch -- can now be procured for $49, and when used with the gratis app in the App Store, can control anything in your home entertainment setup that accepts IR commands. ZDNet was fortunate enough to get a little hands-on time with the device, and their early impressions are quite positive. In fact, they recommend skipping the Harmony hoopla and heading right for this if you're already an iDevice owner (who doesn't use an imposing case or Bumper), and at a buck under a Grant, we certainly aren't in a position to argue.

ThinkFlood is a privately held company headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts.Software for RedEye mini (the RedEye application)RedEye is much more than a simple infrared adapter for your phone, and software plays a key role. At ThinkFlood we develop our software in-house and strive to provide regular updates and improvements. Here are some of the things that we feel set our software apart from the crowd:•  Activity-based approachWe believe your home theater should be organized around what you do, not what hardware manufacturers produce. One touch to play a movie, touch again to watch TV - no more trying to remember which audio and video inputs you need.•  Smart actionsMany other remotes have "macro" capability (the option to have one button send two or more signals). RedEye goes beyond macros with smart actions that actually keep track of things like whether a device is on or off. Smart actions are particularly useful when switching activities - when you transition from watching TV to playing a DVD, RedEye is smart enough to leave the TV on.•  Customizable button layoutsRedEye gives you a unique button layout for each activity you create, so the "remote" you use when listening to music is different from the one you use when watching TV. You can customize everything from button placement to size. We even have hundreds of channel logos built right into the application.•  Activity templatesCustomizable button layouts for each activity are great, but creating them from scratch can be a lot of work. When you create a new activity, RedEye starts you off with a well-designed template. And by template we don't mean a single, standard set of buttons. Instead, RedEye uses information like the activity type (Watch TV or Listen to Music?) and the devices you include in the activity (do you route your sound through an A/V receiver or your TV speakers?) to determine what buttons to include and how they should function.•  Macro and toggle buttonsIn addition to the usual tap or tap-and-hold functionality you expect, it is easy to make RedEye activity buttons perform more advanced functions. Macro buttons can send out multiple commands - for example, a smart mute button that turns on closed captioning when turning off the volume. Toggle buttons can switch between different functions each time you press them, like the classic play/pause button on a CD or MP3 player.•  Shortcut gesturesTouchscreens are great because they provide the ultimate flexibility - custom layouts for each activity being one example. However, they can make it harder to tap the right button when you are channel surfing or otherwise need to be looking elsewhere. RedEye uses the full functionality of the iPhone - multitouch and the accelerometer - to overcome this limitation. Choose from any of five motion gestures and eighteen multi-touch gestures for any button in your activity layout.•  Customizable delaysWhen executing a series of actions - for example during the launch of an activity - it is important to be able to fine-tune the delay between commands. RedEye allows you to insert delays of up to 20 seconds in 0.05 second increments.•  Quick launchYou want to be able to pick up your remote control and use it right away. If your remote is an app on your phone, then it has to launch fast and put you in the driver's seat right away. RedEye is optimized to launch quickly and to bring you right to the activity in progress. And now if you are using iOS 4 on a device that supports multi-tasking it's even faster than before.•  Online infrared code databaseSure, RedEye can learn commands from your existing remote controls, but who wants to do that? Our software is backed by an online database of more than 45,000 infrared codes covering over 1,200 device manufacturers, so there's a good chance we have what you need. And because the database is stored on a web server rather than on your phone or the RedEye hardware, you get updates to the database as soon as they are available - no need to wait for the next software release.•  Integrated channel guide (coming soon)Version 1.3.0 of the RedEye software will include an television channel guide covering cable, satellite, and over-the-air broadcasts in the United States and Canada. With the channel guide you no longer need to take up the space on your main screen while you decide what to watch next. It is also easy to filter the list based on your favorite channels so that you don't have to scroll through dozens of screens just to find what you want.•  Toolbar hidingThe iPhone screen is pretty big, but sometimes you want to get everything out of the way and focus on your remote control. RedEye gives you a few different options to remove clutter and take control.•  Disabling the sleep timerThe iPhone's built in sleep-timer helps you conserve battery, and so you want to leave it on in most cases. However, when you are sitting down within arm's reach of a charging cradle, you might prefer to keep the phone awake. A simple setting in the RedEye app allows you to disable the sleep timer while the application is running without disabling it for all applications.•  MultitaskingBeginning with version 1.2.0, RedEye fully supports iOS 4 multitasking, which means that you can get back to controlling your activities even faster than before.•  Retina display supportRedEye now provides high resolution button images so that everything looks crisp and clear on your new iPhone 4.
