 Last we heard from Aldebaran Robotics' Nao robot it didn't exactly have all that many skills to show off, simply waving to the camera and uttering a few words to prove that it was more than just an illustration. It looks like it's been spending the last few months learning some new tricks though, with it now able to stand on its own two feet and walk across the room. As you can see in the video linked below, however, it isn't all that graceful, and it certainly doesn't look like it'll be challenging PLEN to a skateboarding competition anytime soon.
