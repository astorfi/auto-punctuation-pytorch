 
 The year of 3D printers? It's sure looking like it from where we're sitting. There are more companies at CES 2013 promoting consumer versions of the technology than ever before. Of course, MakerBot's not going to sit idly by and watch this all go down. The Brooklyn-based company is set to show off its Replicator 2X Experimental 3D Printer -- the dual-extruding "big brother" to its recently released second-gen printer -- at a press conference tomorrow. Hopefully pricing and available will be arriving on with it.
