Disney hasn't mentioned if the concert will be in HD on its high definition network, so this may give fans (we know you're out there) a chance to check it out before the Blu-ray disc hits shelves in August. It looks like anaglyph (red/blue) technology is what's bringing the 3D, for the necessary goofy looking glasses, either pick them up in a Wal-mart while supplies last or make your own following instructions on the Starz website.
