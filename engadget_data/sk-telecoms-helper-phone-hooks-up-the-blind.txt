Korea's got 280,000 blind or otherwise visually handicapped people, and by god, they need cellphones too! So SK
Telekcom stepped up to the plate and served the Helper Phone. Basically a modded Samsung SGH-E580, the Helper Phone can
provide zoomed in menus, voice guidance and a voice helper mode, which can be activated simply by a long keypress of
the 5 key. Many common features can also be accessed by voice command, which is a big plus, tooâ€”maybe we'll all get
some of these so we can cut out some trivial reading from our workday day. But seriously, one wonders why they didn't
just forgo the screen entirely and just use that space to make the audio aspects of the phone 100% pro.
