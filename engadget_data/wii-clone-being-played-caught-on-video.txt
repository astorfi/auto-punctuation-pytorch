 
Been thinking about investing in a Vii -- the low-rent Chinese knock-off of Nintendo's Wii -- but you're just not sure you want to fork over the cash? Check out this footage of the infamous console in action, delivered by our friends at Engadget Chinese. Just imagine getting together with your whole family for a round of Happy Tennis, Free Craps or Alacrity Golf -- you, grandma and the kids all twitching spasmodically, desperately trying to control the on-screen "action" with the janky Viimote. With playability like this, you'll probably need anger management. Check the video after the break and see what we mean.[Via Joystiq]
