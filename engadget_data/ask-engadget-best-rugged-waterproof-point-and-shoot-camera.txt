       In the spirit of winter, we felt that Ben's recent question about a camera fit for the slopes was just perfect. And if you'd like to toss out a warm and fuzzy question of your own, just send one to ask at engadget dawt com and keep tuning in. "I'm going skiing over spring break, and I've been reading a lot on some of the newer waterproof, rugged cameras. There are just so many out there to choose from, I was wondering what you guys thought about some of the better ones." So, what camera should Mr. Ben procure in order to have worry-free shooting days at the slopes? He probably wouldn't mind one that withstands minor bumps and bangs either, 'cause we all know what inevitably happens the first time down a new double black.
