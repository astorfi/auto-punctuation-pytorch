Are you worried that you won't get to follow big league baseball from your Lumia 1020 this year? Don't be: MLB At Bat 13 has just launched for Windows Phone 8. The new release covers familiar ground in a fresher-looking package, letting sports aficionados watch both free and MLB.tv Premium-only live games, pin their favorite teams to the home screen and check Live Tiles for the day's games. At Bat 13 is free to download, although you'll have to pay for a Premium account ($25 monthly or $50 yearly) if you want to watch full access to MLB.tv's game broadcasts and archived footage.
