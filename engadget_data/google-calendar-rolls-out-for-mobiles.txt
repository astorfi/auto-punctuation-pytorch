 Google's rumored and real romp through mobile space continues with the announcement of its Google Calendar application's support for mobiles. The calendar seems to work perfectly, displaying a day by day view of your world and your plans for it, though, sadly, we couldn't find any way to remove events one they were added. Events can be added by typing a description of your appointment in the "Quick Add" box at the bottom of the screen. For example, typing "Pause for dinner today 16:00" (or 4 pm) adds that event to your calendar. This is a pretty handy tool if you rely heavily on your Google calendar or aren't into all that Windows Mobile Calendar syncin' business.
