They're not saying that cellphones are dangerous (or that they're not dangerous), but the International
Electrotechnical Commission has decided to lay down guidelines for measuring just how much radiation that new Nokia or
Samsung or whatever is bathing you in. The guidelines don't limit how much radiation a phone can emit (that actually
varies by country), it just sets a common measurement standard for everyone.
