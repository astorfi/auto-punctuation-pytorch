MSI's S262 is a slim Core Duo notebook with a 12.1 inch widescreen display, up to 2GB RAM, dual-layerburner and a carbon fiber shell, all wrapped up in a 4.3 pound package. From the pics we've seen, it looks a lot likethe S260, but with a lot more going on under the hood. No word yet on when -- or where -- this will be available.
