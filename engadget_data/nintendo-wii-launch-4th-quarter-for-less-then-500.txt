  We were really hoping for an official announcement of the Wii's launch date and price, but the company is continuing to withhold those key details. As Reggie Fils-Aime put it today, "we think it's best to keep those details quiet a little longer." The only hint of a launch date and pricing: Reggie's declaration that "Wii will give you more fun for less money and you will be playing Wii in the fourth quarter of 2006." By that, we can assume the Wii will certainly be less than the $500 price tag Sony's dangling for the Playstation 3. But that $250 price point we've been seeing lately will just have to remain in the rumor mill for now.
