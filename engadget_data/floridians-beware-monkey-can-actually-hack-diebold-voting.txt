All politics aside, we're 100% for throwing monkeys at gadgets (both literally and figuratively) to see what they
can (and can't) do with them. In this case, Black Box Voting is suggesting that the Diebold voting machines are so
flawed that even monkey can 0wn it. Apparently there's a a hidden black box-like record keeping program that resides on
Diebold's election softwareâ€”this is already pretty awful, as vote record keeping should always be paper-based.
This application is a "secret" feature enabled by a two-digit trigger (not a "bug" or an accidental oversight; it's a
feature), and apparently even an untrained monkey (the real kind) can get in there and manipulate records. So please
don't blame us if we're spending a little extra time in the booth trying figure this one out, we shouldn't be more than
a couple of minutes (assuming we're of comparable intelligence with Baxter the monkey who, if allowed into a voting
stall, might rule the free world with a simple hack).
