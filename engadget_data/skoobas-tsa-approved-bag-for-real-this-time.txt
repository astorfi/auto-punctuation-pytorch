Michael got in touch after our last post to say that the Checkthrough will indeed be a multi-pocketed bag and have several unique and patented features, including a special 3-1-1 liquids compartment and a see-through window for rapid ID of contents. There's also a number of minor changes coming to the design, but no matter what, you should be able to get through security without having to take your laptop out of your bag. That's much more like it -- although now we actually kind of miss that gigantic nasty "Checkthrough" logo after all.
