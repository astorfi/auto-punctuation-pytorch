The official Hulu Blog has just been updated with news that six phones -- Nexus One, Nexus S, HTC Inspire 4G, Motorola Droid II, Motorola Droid X, and the Motorola Atrix -- are on the compatible list with "additional device announcements" due later in the year. While there's some crossover with the list of Netflix-compatible devices, it's hardly complete and many flagship phones are still missing. Here's hoping the tweakers can work their magic on that apk and get it running for the rest of us, whether we're shelling out $7.99 a month or just want to leech some Chappelle's Show eps on a free one week trial. If you can't get it running yourself, check out a quick video demo embedded after the break.
