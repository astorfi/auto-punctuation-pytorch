In this latest complaint, Redbox claims that Warner and Fox have instructed retailers to only allow Redbox kiosk operators to buy three copies of any given title, thereby preventing Redbox from renting movies day and date with the disc's retail release. Besides the obvious fact that the studios are being jerks here, it really gets our legal thoughts running about one's right to buy as many of something as one wants. Now we're pretty sure all this is just a way for Redbox to gain leverage in inevitable kick-back negotiations, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining or interesting.
