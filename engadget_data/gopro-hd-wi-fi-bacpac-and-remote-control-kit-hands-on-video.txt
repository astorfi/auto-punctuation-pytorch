Here at CES's Digital Experience, we've got to get a glimpse at both the WiFi BacPac and Remote Control Kit. The WiFi Bacpac does what you'd expect it to do -- but with an extra twist. Alongside WiFi connectivity, it'll also play nice with both Android and iOS devices. The apps will display any captured content immediately, with a free-to-download app that will connect with the camera.

	The remote control kit, meanwhile, is capable of stringing together several different cams, with a largely dual-button setup that looks an awful lot like a heart-rate monitor. Check the hands-on after the break and expect to see these arrive later this year -- price to be confirmed.
