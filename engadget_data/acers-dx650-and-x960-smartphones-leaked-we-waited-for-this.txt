After teasing with the announcement of your entry into the marketplace, you can't expect us to believe that a Glofiish DX900 rebadge, and new DX650 (pictured above... twice) and X960 (after the break) makes up your A-game? The DX650 is a chubby dual-sided device: on one side we've got Windows Mobile pumping away beneath a 2.8-inch QVGA touchscreen, on the other a 1.27-inch OLED with full numeric keypad -- you know, because a software-based keypad and/or QWERTY is just crazy-talk. Inside you'll find HSDPA, GPS, microSD, 802.11b/g WiFi, and Bluetooth. Next up, the X960 looking very much a continuation of the Glofiish product line. It brings a 2.8-inch 640 x 480 pixel display riding a 533MHz Samsung S3C 6410 processor, HSDPA data, WiFi, SiRF Star III GPS, microSD, and a 3.2 megapixel camera with flash. Look Acer, if this is all you've got for Mobile World Congress, fine... just don't expect us to repeat the year 2007 along with you. [Via Sohoa] Read -- DX650 Read -- X960
