Besides that 13,000fps image processing of BlueTrack and a user-configurable 250 to 4,000 dpi, the mouse is a 2.4GHz wireless number with "virtually no latency" and it includes a play-and-charge cable for upping the juice without dropping the action. It even has a decent hands-on under its belt, so if you've been holding out for this one there's nothing really stopping your unemployed self from heading down to a local big box and plopping down $99 for the privilege.
