 The shady iPhone component news chatter is starting to heat up as WWDC inches closer -- today we've got China Times saying that Apple's already placed an order for four million new iPhones to be delivered by the end of Q2. That's a whisper that lines up nicely with those earlier reports suggesting Cupertino's trying to lock down 100 million 8Gb flash chips from Samsung and placing orders for other components in preparation for a June launch, but we're a little skeptical of this one, since it claims that a new EDGE model is in the works along with a 3G version and a China-only variant potentially running on TD-SCDMA. Not moves we'd ordinarily expect Apple to make, but anything's possible -- we'll be keeping our eyes peeled.[Via Slashphone]
