Hey, hey, guess what the mm stands for in mm28 and mm50. Give up? Well, we're not telling—sorry, we're under NDA—but
the mm50 is their new $150 li-ion battery powered iPod speaker set (meh), but we're kind of digging the glasses-case
styling of the mm28, which uses NXT flat-panel audio. It uses a standard 3.5mm jack, so you don't have to own Steve's
White Idol if you want to push it real good.
