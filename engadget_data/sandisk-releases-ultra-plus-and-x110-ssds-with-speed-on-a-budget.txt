The 2.5-inch drive musters 530MB/s peak read speeds and 445MB/s writes, like many higher-end SSDs, but promises to ditch some of the premium we commonly associate with that breakneck pace. The 64GB, 128GB and 256GB capacities on offer will cost just $75, $110 and $220 -- low enough that we could see them easily slotting in as a fast boot drive or a full-fledged replacement in a laptop. Anyone looking for a quick storage pick-me-up should already find the Ultra Plus waiting at Amazon, Microcenter and Newegg.

  Two New SSDs Launched
  SanDisk today announced two new SSD products – the SanDisk Ultra® Plus SSD for the retail channel and the SanDisk X110 SSD for OEM customers.
  The SanDisk Ultra Plus SSD is ideal for consumers who want to boost their notebook or desktop computer's boot, shutdown, data-transfer and application launch times. The low latency of the SATA 3.0 drive allows it to respond quickly, even with a heavy workload, and its consistently high read speed is ideal for read-intensive applications such as multimedia consumption.
  The drive delivers up to 530MB/sec sequential read and up to 445MB/sec sequential write speeds1, offering a fast, responsive computing experience. In addition, with no moving parts, the SSD is more durable than traditional hard disk drives and it consumes less power to help maximize battery life. The drive is available now at Amazon.com and Microcenter.com in 64GB, 128GB and 256GB2 capacities carrying suggested retail prices of $74.99, $109.99 and $219.99, respectively. In addition, the Ultra Plus is available at Newegg.com in 128GB and 256GB capacities.
  The SanDisk X110 SSD enables notebook and tablet OEM manufacturers to design fast, responsive systems with the sleek, thin form factors consumers' desire. The X110, successor to SanDisk's popular X100 SSD, delivers fast sequential and random read/write speeds and employs a low power architecture that significantly reduces the power consumed by the device in low power modes. The drive is available now in a 2.5" SATA form factor for easy integration into systems sold by OEMs.
  SanDisk is building both new SSDs using its industry-leading 19 nanometer (nm) technology, the world's smallest, most advanced manufacturing process node.
  New Distribution Channel to Offer SSDs to Broader Set of Customers
  SanDisk today also unveiled a new worldwide distribution channel, "SanDisk for Business," which offers OEM and enterprise-grade SSDs to value-added resellers (VARs), system integrators and direct market resellers (DMRs). SanDisk's new distribution channel addresses a wider portion of the market by delivering high-quality SanDisk SSD technology to small and medium-sized businesses, a growing market segment for SSDs. More information on SanDisk's distribution channel may be found at businesspartners.sandisk.com.
  ASUS Selects SanDisk SSD for New Convertible Notebook
  In addition to new products and a new distribution channel, SanDisk today also announced a key design win for its SSD technology. The company announced that the SanDisk U100 SSD is being used by ASUS in the ASUS Transformer Book, the world's first notebook with a detachable tablet. The ASUS Transformer Book uses a SanDisk U100 SSD for high-capacity, blazing-fast storage and a small footprint that allows it to fit neatly into the sleek, ultra-thin notebook. The highly-responsive SSD significantly improves the Transformer Book performance, allowing users to quickly boot and rapidly launch applications, and its mSATA mini form factor enables the notebook's innovative convertible form factor.
