To date, Chrome OS has only backed up photos to the cloud as long as you left the Google+ Photos app open; that's a hassle on the frequently limited screen real estate of a Chromebook. You won't have that headache if you grab the updated Photos app, however. The new version automatically uploads snapshots from your SD card in the background, even if the app is closed; you can move on to email knowing that all those vacation pictures will be safe. It's a simple addition, but it should make a big difference if you're planning to go on photo safaris this summer.
