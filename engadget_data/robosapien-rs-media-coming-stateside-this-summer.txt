According to a Wowwee representative at a media event this evening, the multimedia-focused humanoid (as you may recall, it rocks a digital video camera, chest-mounted LCD, and MP3 playback capabilities) will retail for a cool $300, but those three Benjamins do get you the most interactive and customizable Robosapien on the market. Sadly, despite the many petitions we've sent to Wowwee, that popular flamethrower accessory is not included.
