Given that the iOS 4.3 beta just brought hotspot support to the GSM iPhone, we're guessing that the holdup is more tactical than technical -- Verizon still hasn't announced its iPhone data plan pricing or hotspot tax, and we're assuming AT&T's just waiting for some numbers before announcing support sometime around, say, February 10th. We'll see.

P.S.- We're also thinking it would be sweet it AT&T supported WiFi hotspot with 3G iPad and its contract-free data plans, but we're just wishing one wish at a time here.
