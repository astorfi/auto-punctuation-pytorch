 
Rather than scraping the details off their Romanian flash pages, you can now take a more mature approach to your A700 fawning by reviewing Sony's official press release. Better yet, dpreview has a hands-on preview of the latest Konica Minolta Sony Alpha now packing a 12.1 megapixel APS-C "Exmor" CMOS sensor and all-new version of its Bionz image processor which combine for up to 5fps bursting. $1,400 for that sweet body starting in October. Now go read the multi-page preview in full after peeping all that hot, hot DSLR action in the gallery below.
