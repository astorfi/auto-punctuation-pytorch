The 2go convertible tablet Classmate PC we've been hearing about for nearly a year, and which we fully expected to make its official debut at CES has done just that. The 8.9-inch, 1024 x 600 screen-boasting tablet's got a 1.6GHz Atom 270 CPU, 1GB of RAM, a 60GB HDD and 802.11b/g/n WiFi. You can grab the Windows XP version now for $549 -- no word yet on Linux.
