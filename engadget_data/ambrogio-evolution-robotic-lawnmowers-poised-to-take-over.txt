Okay folks, the truth is out there — our
robotic
underlords have their cohorts lined up and waiting just
outside our front doors. Yes, the Ambrogio Evolution robotic lawn mower can sense your long grass, and will seek
incessantly to annihilate it. It can cover about three-quarters of an acre on lawns with slopes of up to about 27
degrees without losing power or speed and without tipping over — which is more than we can say for ourselves, quite
honestly. It also has a bonus Smart Spiral mode, always useful for hoodwinking the neighbors with some whacked out crop
circles. This tireless helper will not mow gently into that good night without a dear price: $2299.99 bags it, and no
reviews yet in on how it is with the kids.
