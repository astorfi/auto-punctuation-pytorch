The Portege M500 sports a sleek 4.1-pound enclosure, "white pearl" (and black, too) color scheme, and a 12.1-inch LCD. Beneath the hood of this sexy machine is Intel's 1.73GHz T2250 Core 2 Duo processor, 512MB of DDR2 RAM, 80GB SATA hard drive, dual-layer DVD burner, a 5-in-1 flash card reader, and a built-in microphone. It also boasts a fingerprint sensor, "spill-resistant" keyboard, and a "Quick Play" function that plays back DVDs without the OS being booted. The M500 can be snapped up now, provided that you're in South Korea and have 1,390,000KRW ($1,489) to spare.
