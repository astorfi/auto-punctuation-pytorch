In a move reminiscent of those annoying
Windows stickers affixed to most PCs with some kind of permanent glue, Apple has launched a "Made for iPod" program,
which will allow it to tag "authorized" accessories. Given the proliferation of
third-party iPod gear, it seems like a smart (and
obvious) move on Apple's part. Preferred vendors will get their stickers, Apple will get some extra cash (like they
really need it), and makers of uninspired or cheesy accessories will languish in well-deserved obscurity. (Of course,
Apple can also use the seal in less noble ways, like withholding it from vendors who also produce gear for competing
audio players, but they wouldn't do that, would they?)
