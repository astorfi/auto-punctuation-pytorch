 After a little legal scarewith the four major music labels, Sirius can finally market its S50 music player without fear oflegal consequences. The labels had argued that the player's recording capabilities were a violation of previousagreements, and had threatened to take Sirius to court to halt the sale of the player. EMI was the last to come around,just giving their blessing today, following Warner, Vivendi and Sony-BMG who agreed to the player last month.Unfortunately, things still sound tense between Sirius and the labels. No details of the agreement have been divulged,but it only applies to the S50 for now, and with XM and Sirius coming up for renewal of their music licenses, neitherare out of the woods yet.
