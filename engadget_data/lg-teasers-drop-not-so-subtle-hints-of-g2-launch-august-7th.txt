While LG initially gave no clues as to the focus of its August 7th event, the company isn't leaving much room for doubt now. It's sending both formal invitations and a teaser video (after the break) suggesting that it would be "Great 2 Have You" at the New York gathering -- a likely reference to the rumored G2 flagship. LG is still coy about showing the phone itself, although we already know that there's a speedy Snapdragon 800 under the hood. We just wish we didn't have to wait a month to see a lot more.
