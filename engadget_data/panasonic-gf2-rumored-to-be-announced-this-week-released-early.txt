What's more, those same sources say that the camera will be the smallest mirrorless camera to date, and that it will use the Panasonic G2 12-megapixel sensor. That rumor is further backed up by a new listing for a GF2 at the Korean Radio Research Agency, although that unfortunately doesn't provide any details beyond the name. You might not want to ditch your GF1 just yet, though -- while camera will supposedly be announced next week, it apparently won't actually be released until sometime early next year.
