 We're happy to finally be closing the loop on T-Mobile's Even More Plus situation -- and the story ends on a happy note, which is nice. As we said yesterday, the carrier's contract-free discounted plans aren't going away, but you'll no longer be able to select any of them from the website. Why? Well, the claim is that they want to "simplify and streamline our customers' online purchase experience," and to be fair, we can understand how the average potential subscriber coming to T-Mobile for the first time would have no clue how to differentiate between the two without some assistance. From here on out, if you want to avoid the contracts on postpaid, you'll need to call into telesales, visit a corporate-owned store, or head over to "select national retail partners and select dealers," though we don't know which ones have been green-lighted at this point. Follow the break for T-Mobile's full, official Q&A on the situation.
