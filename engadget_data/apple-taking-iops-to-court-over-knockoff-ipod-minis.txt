We were all kind of wondering how long it was gonna take Apple to make the first legal move against all those crazy
Asian iPod knockers off, but it looks like
the card most consistently at the top of that deck — Luxpro — dodged the bullet on the first real lawsuit, and a little
less expected firm, IOPS, is the one getting hauled
to court. Apparently Apple's bringing them in over the Jock (right) and
Z3 models, which, granted bear some resemblance to the
iPod mini but if you ask us it seems a bit
pious for Apple not only to demand IOPS stop selling the two players, but get comped for lost sales, and for IOPS to
take out an official apology in three (or more) South Korean newspapers. Especially since, you know, Apple hasn't sold
the mini for month. Give 'em hell, IOPS.
