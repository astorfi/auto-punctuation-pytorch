And while it's not the iPad app that many iOS music lovers have been clamoring for, Android users have a Spotify-related reason to rejoice this morning. The service's app is getting an overhaul for Google's mobile OS, a full redesign that includes, among other things, full support for Ice Cream Sandwich. Also on the Android docket are new navigation, added social features and hi-res artwork. The app is currently available as a preview. Spotify's promising even more features -- like Last.fm scrobbling -- before it hits the Google Play store. No word yet on exactly when that might be.

 Update: You can now give the preview a run for yourself, provided you're on Spotify Premium. Hit up the source link for the download.
