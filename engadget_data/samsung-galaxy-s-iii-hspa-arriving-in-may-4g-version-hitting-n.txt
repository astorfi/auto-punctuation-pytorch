Those of us in North America, Japan and Korea will have to wait a bit longer for speed -- the LTE version of the handset will be hitting those areas in the summer. Specifically, it'll be arriving in the US in June. In all, the phone will be available on some 296 mobile operators in 145 countries, according to the company.
