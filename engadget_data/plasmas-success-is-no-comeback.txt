But we won't complain about the success that PDPs are enjoying lately and the excitement that continues to be generated by the displays. It's obvious that LCDs have taken over as synonymous with FPD to most consumers, but there are a couple of things that play to plasma's strengths. First, the increasing demand for LCDs has created a supply shortage that PDPs are happy to fill. Second, and more exciting to us, is the movement of PDPs to the high end, premium market. It's a good time to be a plasma-aware HD-nut!
