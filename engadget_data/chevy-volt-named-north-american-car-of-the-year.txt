The Chevrolet Volt, the very car that helped us flee a soggy and cold Washington D.C. last year, was just named North American Car of the Year at the North American International Auto Show by an independent panel of judges representing major media outlets. It bested other finalists, the Nissan Leaf and the Hyundai Sonata. The Volt has won despite scoring low marks in the swimsuit portion of the competition, but in its acceptance speech the Volt thanked all the little people and indicated it would spend the next 12 months working toward world peace and alternative drivetrain configurations for all.
