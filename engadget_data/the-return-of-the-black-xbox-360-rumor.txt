 For the second time since the console's launch, rumors are circulating that Microsoft is working on a black Xbox 360 design, with the source this time being a banner advert from Best Buy depicting what appears to be a matte black console. The low resolution picture, coupled with the fact that the advert doesn't even mention the Xbox 360 -- let alone a black one -- means that this is about as good a confirmation as earlier Photoshop jobs. However, we doubt this is the last we'll see of the black Xbox 360: what with the home theater-matching PlayStation 3 just around the corner, we wouldn't be too surprised if Redmond ends up throwing fans the color-inverted Xbox 360 that they've always wanted.
