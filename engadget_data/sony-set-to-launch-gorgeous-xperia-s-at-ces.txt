While nothing is official until Sony tells us so, the newest -- and if looks alone count -- and nicest Xperia packs a 1280 x 720 4.3-inch display, MSM8260 dual-core thrumming away at 1.5Gz, and a 12 megapixel shooter that'll capture at 1080p. Sadly the word is that it'll launch in the second quarter running Android 2.3 and not our beloved Ice Cream Sandwich. Design-wise, the Xperia S looks like others in its family with the gentle curve in the back but what immediately caught our eye is the small translucent lit -- notification with this would look brilliant -- bar toward the bottom. Here's hoping this is the real deal, and if so we'll be back in a few hours with a load of vids and pics of it in action.
