The computer, which originally cost $666.66 to purchase new, was launched in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, and models were sold out of Jobs' own house (or you know... his parents house). The sale includes everything that was included with the original Apple-1 purchase: an Apple-1 motherboard (number 82), printed circuit board, three capacitors, a heatsink, cassette board connector, 8kb of RAM, and a keyboard interface. Along with the other printed material that comes with the computer is a typed letter from Steve Jobs which appears to be in answer to the original owner's questions. The letter simply says "yep." The Apple-1 is expected to fetch somewhere in the realm of $200,000 to $250,000 at auction.
