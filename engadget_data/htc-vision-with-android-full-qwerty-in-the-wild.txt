Anyhow, we caught wind last month of a possible entry in the form of the so-called "Vision," but we didn't have any visuals -- just a user agent profile that may or may not amount to anything. Well, that seems to be changing today with a couple blurry shots out of a Croatian site that allegedly shows the goods featuring a 3.7-inch display, a 1GHz processor (Snapdragon, we assume), and Android 2.1 with Sense (the launcher looks like stock Android in this photo, but the status bar is clearly HTC custom). At a glance, it doesn't seem to be the prettiest thing in the world -- but for a form factor traditionally associated with power users and suits, this might be just the ticket.
