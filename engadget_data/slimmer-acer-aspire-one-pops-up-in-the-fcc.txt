No hard specs on this mysterious stranger just yet except for the presence of the 3G SIM slot, but the model number Z68 AO530 strongly suggests that there's an Atom Z530 lurking in there instead of the usual N270. We'll let you know if we find out anything else -- hit the read link for some more pics and oodles of FCC test data.
