 
Seeing that Lucas & Co. already announced that the Star Wars series would be coming to Blu-ray we're not exactly sure what will be announced on Thursday at Panasonic's CES booth -- please, please, please don't say it's another Avatar-style two year pack-in exclusive -- but the invite promises it will be most impressive. Darth Vader and a number of Stormtroopers will be on hand and you know we'll be ready to pass all information revealed onto you (given the parties involved we're leaning towards some news about a home release of the 3D converted flicks), even if it's just that ol' George has decided to release the prequels ahead of the original trilogy.
