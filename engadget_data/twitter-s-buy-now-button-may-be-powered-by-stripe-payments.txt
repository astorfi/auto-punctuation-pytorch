Remember that illusive "Buy Now" button that briefly showed up on Twitter last month? Re/Code says it's still on the way -- and it's backed by Stripe, a mobile payments startup. According to sources close to the outlet, merchants that want to sell products through tweets will need to sign up with Stripe's payment platform to get started, suggesting that the startup will be the only way to pay for goods on the social network. In the past, Twitter has been rumored to be working with Fancy.com to create a "Twitter Commerce" platform, although its unclear when the company's retail ambitions will come to fruition. Still, something is clearly in the works.
