 So, you thought all those cable carriers out there were going to raise prices while DirecTV sat idly by, adding enough HD channels to push it well over the 100 mark and be totally content with its current revenue stream? Wrong. Word on the street has it that the satcaster will be pushing rates up on a number of packages starting March 4th. We've got to say -- if there's one operator out there that can justify marginal increases, it's DirecTV. We mean, it's the HD leader, after all. The list of changes is far too long to cover here, so tap the read link and start pinching those pennies.[Thanks, Vanbrothers]
