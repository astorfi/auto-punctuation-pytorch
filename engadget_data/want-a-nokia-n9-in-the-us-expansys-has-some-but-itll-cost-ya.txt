Even though Nokia won't be selling the N9 -- the company's one and only MeeGo device -- in the US through official channels, you can at least pick up one with relative ease courtesy of Expansys for a mere $690. From what we can tell, it only appears to be available in black for the moment. We'd love to see the myriad other colors come to the States as well, but when we do the math, one is still at least more than zero. Head to the source to see for yourself.
