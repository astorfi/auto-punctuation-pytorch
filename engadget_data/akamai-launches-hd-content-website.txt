 Akamai has launched a "proof of concept" portal for demonstrating online HD content. The site shows off their edge delivery technologies designed around HD streaming. Anyone can try out the site, but you'll need some healthy bandwidth to get the full experience. Recommended specs include 7.5Mbps for the 720 feeds, 13.5Mbps for the 1080; if your connection doesn't meet spec, expect hitches. It's a tantalizing view of the future, but those bandwidth requirements are steep! Still, we're on board with Akamai's reasons for putting this site up, especially "engage audiences with higher quality video experiences" and "show industry support and leadership around the move toward high-definition video." We've seen it and we want it, so the only question left is when will the industry players let us get it?
