We were hanging around the Motorola booth early this morning and while playing around with the new 4.3-inch phone we noticed a "Skype demo" application. One click on the application revealed that the video calling capability, which just became available for the iPhone, will be heading to Android soon. There wasn't a working app, but the video demo clearly showed how easy it will be to log into Skype, pull up your contact list, and make a video call over Verizon's next generation network. We've got a few pictures below and a short video is on the way. Now we just need Skype to make this official at its press conference in just a few hours... 




Update: Verizon just announced that Skype video calling will be coming to all the LTE smartphones -- aka Android handsets. Details in the liveblog...
