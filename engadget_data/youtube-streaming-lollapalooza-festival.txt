The service is running a free, two-channel webcast of Chicago's Lollapalooza music festival this weekend, which features big-name acts such as Jack White, The Black Keys and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. As you may recall, YouTube also offered a live broadcast of the event last year. Click through to the source link to see who's on stage. Hey, it's not the same as being at Grant Park, but it's probably a lot less sweaty.
