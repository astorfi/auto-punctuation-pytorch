Every preview that we've seen goes out of its way to somehow tease the 3D aspect, and it'll be interesting to see how well / horrible it does in theaters. For those even remotely interested in checking it out, you should also head past the break for a two-part interview with the film's director. Patrick Lussier sat down with Hollywood In Hi-Def in order to discuss the specific 3D elements of the film and how he felt these aspects served to draw the audience in deeper and produce a more riveting product. There's even a mention of a 3D Blu-ray release, which we're sure Panasonic is just drooling over. We won't spoil anything for you here -- head on past the jump and mash play (twice) for yourself.
