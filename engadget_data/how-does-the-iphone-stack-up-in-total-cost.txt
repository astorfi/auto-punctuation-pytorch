       It's no secret or surprise that Apple pushed AT&T into whipping up some new plans for the iPhone -- specialness aside, one look at AT&T and users can get lost in its myriad plans, 44 in all (including prepaid, data, etc.). Not exactly the streamlined customer Apple experience cherishes, so the iPhone just comes with just a few service options (and not a lot to configure) -- but is there really the "Apple premium" associated with buying an iPhone and using the iPhone plan with AT&T? Only one way to find out: let's look at the numbers.

(According to Apple, iPhone users can sign up for this, or any other data plan they choose.)The reality is a lot of in-store reps will just give smartphone users the MEdia Max 200 bundle, which their non-smartphone unlimited data + 200 SMS plan -- but costs $15 less per month (at $20) and is a lot closer to what you'd be paying for the iPhone. We know this isn't the "official" way of comparing AT&T's listed prices, but it's certainly the most fair real world scenario.

Adding an iPhone and smartphone with data and 200 SMS to your family plan costs the same, but the base service for that first line is where there's a price disparity -- $10 per month. It's not a lot, but it adds up over time.

It's just really hard to argue with a $75 BlackJack, you know?But to put this another way: those worried that your iPhone will cost you a lot more in service fees than you'd pay otherwise, worry not. You're (obviously) going to pay more for the device itself, but the iPhone plans are totally fair, based on AT&T's current pricing scheme.P.S. -We're sincerely hoping we didn't fudge any of those numbers, but please let us know if they don't quite add up!
