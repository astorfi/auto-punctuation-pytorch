 
We finally have at least one carrier for RIM's new flagship tablet. The BlackBerry 4G PlayBook, as it's being called here, is heading to Sprint's 4G network (presumably WiMAX, which we guess isn't as big a buzzword) this summer. To be specific, according to the press release, it'll be "available exclusively from Sprint this summer," which leaves plenty of wiggle room for non-4G PlayBooks and other release windows. It also says it'll be the first PlayBook model to include 4G, so an LTE at least will be a little while longer (and a 3G one maybe earlier). Full presser after the break.
