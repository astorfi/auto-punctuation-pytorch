  Remember Panasonic's Eluga? The phone with a name that sounded like you'd eaten too much popcorn before going on a roller coaster now has a bigger brother to protect the family insignia: the Eluga Power. It's a 5-inch (1280 x 720) display-toting premium version of the device running ICS on a 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 CPU. The 9.6mm thick device includes a 1,800mAh battery that can reportedly quick-charge to 50 percent in half an hour. It's packing NFC, an 8-megapixel camera as well as an unspecified front-facer for video calls, 8GB storage and a microSD slot -- giving you up to 32GB expandable storage. There's a gallery below and full PR after the break.
