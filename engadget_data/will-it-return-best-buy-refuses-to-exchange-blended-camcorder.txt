Luckily for us, Team Blendtec decided to secretly tape their exploits (video after the break), and while the salesdrones do seem slightly shocked at the product and ridiculous story that goes along with it, they certainly do Best Buy proud by keeping their cool during a clearly provocative encounter. There's also a lesson to be learned here: not only does the regular manufacturer's warranty (and the BB return policy) laugh in the face of such situations, if you thought that the flimsy "extended service contract" you bought covers gadgets in powdered form, well sir, you'd be out of luck.[Thanks, El_Capitan]
