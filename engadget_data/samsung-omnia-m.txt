Instead of the Focus 2, Samsung announced that the Omnia M will take its place in Europe and it's looking an awful lot like its predecessor -- although we're a bit concerned the build quality may not match its older brother. With a 4-inch Super AMOLED display, and 1GHz processor, the Omnia M should be more than up to the task of dealing with Windows Phone, alongside some Samsung-specific software additions, including AllShare and its own cross-platform ChatON messenger app. A front-facing VGA camera will also link up with Samsung's own video-call features, while a 5-megapixel sensor is in charge of primary camera functions. The company says the phone will roll out to other regions following its European launch, although it's keeping quiet on whether a visit to the US is on the cards.
