Froyo). True to Nexus One form, you'll be able to snag the phone off-contract for 699,600 won (or about $576), but you'll also be able to get it for just 150,000 won (or $125) on a two-year contract. Not many surprises beyond that, but it looks like supplies will be limited to just 4,000 units for the June 21st launch -- although KT promises it will be readily available at stores across the country in July.
