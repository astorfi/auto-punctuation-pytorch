Suddenly Google local (and maps, and video, and so on) makes so much more senseâ€”Business 2.0 reports that they've
learned from "telecom insiders" that Google is hard at work on a nation-wide high-capacity data network, buying up
unused fiber lines and cheap backbone access to really flesh out their capacity. B2 theorizes this could result in a
massive digital video db, on-demand television (IPTV) system, or free ad-based WiFi network, which in conjunction with
location-tracking hotspot firm Feeva, has already been pilot launched in San Francisco serving up Google Local-based
ads. Could Google really power not just Internet search, but a sizable portion of the Internet? Beats us, but if they
want to make it happen, they better get that AdSense click fraud thing sorted out asap.
