If you like the idea of a big old pen-equipped Samsung handset but don't want to spend a bundle on a Galaxy Note 3, you might soon be in luck. GSM Arena has unearthed a sales document that spells out the specs for an alleged Galaxy Note 3 Neo, which seems to recycle many aspects of last year's Note 2: a 5.55-inch 720p screen, 8-megapixel camera, 2GB of RAM and 3,100mAh battery. However, the new device would also pack an unannounced 1.7GHz dual + 1.3GHz quad "hexa" chip, which could be a new Exynos processor variant. It'll also sport the same design touches as its big brother Note 3, like the slimmer profile, faux leather back and Magazine UX seen on the new Galaxy Note Pro 12.2. That's assuming the document's for real, of course -- we'll believe it when we see the skeumorphic stitching for ourselves.
