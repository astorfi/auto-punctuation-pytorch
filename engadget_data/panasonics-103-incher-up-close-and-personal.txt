That'd be Panasonic's behemoth 103-inch plasma at CES this year, which we got in close enough to get some sweet shots of. The color was rich, theblacks were natural, but namely the device was big. Really freaking big. Even though it literally only inched 'em out,did it seem a whole lot bigger than Samsung's102-inch or LG's 102-inch setsfrom last year? Bet your ass it did.
