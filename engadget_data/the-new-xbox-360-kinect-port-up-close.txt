That means you'll only need one cord to set up a new Xbox + Kinect system, while Xbox 360 original owners will have to connect over USB and plug in a separate power cord for the Kinect unit. And now you know.

Update: We just spent some quality time with the Stealthbox in person, and the real port is a tiny little bit different -- it's got an orange line above it. Check it below.
