Not exactly the most unique device, to be sure, but at just $100 its new SLIDES 2 PC unit is a good deal cheaper than your average slide scanner, and its 5-megapixel resolution should be more than adequate for the average user that'll likely burn through their entire slide collection and never lay eyes on the thing again. It also promises to get the job done fairly quickly, with it scanning each slide in one or two seconds at the push of a button, and employing some automatic exposure and color balance measures to cut down on the tweaking required afterwards.
