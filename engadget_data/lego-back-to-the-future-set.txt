Back to the Future fans have waited with bated breath since Lego announced that it would soon rock their worlds with a fan-designed Cuusoo set, and now, we finally have a release date. On August 1st, Lego's Back to the Future Time Machine will go on sale for $34.99 from select retailers, but an extremely limited quantity can be found at San Diego Comic Con, going on right now. The set includes our favorite time travelers (complete with Marty McFly's cheeky grin and Doc Brown's gravity-defying mane) and a DeLorean that can be customized to resemble the three different models from the trilogy. We have to say . . . Legos are cool and all, but we're still holding out for a fully functional hoverboard.
