A judge in the UK handed a win to Samsung in an intellectual property dispute, calling the Galaxy Tab "not as cool" as the iPad, and therefore not likely to get confused with Apple's tablets. Adding insult to lawsuit win, Judge Colin Birss said that Samsung's slates "do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design." The Galaxy Tabs are distinct from the iPad given their thinner form factors and the "details" on the backs of the devices, according to the judge. If Apple's not happy with his too-cool-for-suit ruling, he also gave Cupertino 21 days to appeal.
