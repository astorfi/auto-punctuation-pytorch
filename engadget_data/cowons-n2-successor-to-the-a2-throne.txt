Now Windows CE 5-based, the Cowon N2 features a friggin' massive 7-inch 480 x 234 display (with a 500:1 contrast ratio, and 420cd/m² brightness), 500MHz AMD Alchemy processor, 128MB DDR2 SDRAM, 32MB Flash memory, built in SiRFStarIII GPS, DMB video, dual SD slots (à la the Tapwave Zodiac), USB On-The-Go, 4W stereo speakers, AV and camera ins, FM transmitter, IR, and the usual extensive codec support (MP3, WMA, Ogg, ASF, AVI, WMV, DivX 3/4/5, XviD, MPEG-4, video up to 720 x 480 / 30fps). You're not going to get all this without sacrificing space and weight, though; the N2 weighs in at a hefty 540 grams (1.2 pounds), and eats up 191 x 120 x 26mm (7.5 x 4.7 x 1 inches) -- nowhere near the smallest overachieving media player around. What's worse, it still doesn't appear to support raw MPEG-2 / VOB, nor H.264 -- which is a bummer, since if any media player should, it is this one -- but something tells us those brave enough to suffer the inevitable 2nd mortgage required to own one of these won't be left in the lurch.
