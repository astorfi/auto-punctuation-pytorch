You know the one -- a couple weeks back, when someone underestimated the glare of the HTC Flyer and dropped their seemingly harmless photos on Flickr? Yeah, that's the handset in question. Not much dirt on the specs, besides the familiar key layout cluing us into Google's obvious underpinnings.. and just maybe, we'll get some fresh baked Gingerbread goodness. Either way, more info should be on the way soon, but until then, careful to check your reflections, friends.
