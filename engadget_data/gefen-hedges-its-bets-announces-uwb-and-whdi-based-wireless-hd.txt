       For awhile now, ultra-wideband (UWB) has been on the way down in terms of popularity, and all the while, AMIMON's WHDI technology has been racking up an unprecedented amount of support. At this year's CEDIA conference, we've got adapter manufacturer Gefen backing both sides by introducing separate wireless HD solutions built around Tzero's UWB tech and the aforesaid WHDI. It's hard to say if both of these formats will continue to be supported (though if we had to guess, we'd say WHDI has the upper hand), but at least for now, Gefen's playing it safe rather than casting a vote. We've a term in Washington for your kind, Gefen, and that term is fencesitter.Read - Gefen supports WHDI!Read - But wait, Gefen supports UWB!
