 
The first Sunday of the regular NFL season is almost here and some DirecTV Sunday Ticket subscribers (plus a few without the DirecTV part) are getting an extra treat. If you've dropped the additional $50 or so for the NFL Sunday Ticket To Go service, feel free to take advantage of the mobile apps that have been issued for Android, Blackberry (you'll want to uninstall the 2009 app first), Windows Mobile, webOS, iPhone and iPad platforms in the last day or so. Check the gallery for screens from the new iPad version plus the updated iPhone and Android apps -- isn't football season the best time of the year?
