When OUYA announced it was expanding its gaming platform beyond its own hardware, it also said it'd share its first deal with a hardware manufacturer within two weeks. Well, it turns out that we only had to wait a couple of days, after accessory maker Mad Catz confirmed it's signed a deal to bring OUYA's software to its M.O.J.O. Android game console. The company says it's already working to incorporate its new partner's content and expects to roll out an update "later this spring," giving die-hard Android gamers access to exclusive OUYA titles on top of regular Google Play and Amazon app store downloads. If this unexpected Android union leaves you pining for some dedicated console action, Mad Catz has slashed $50 off the price of the M.O.J.O. in the US, although the new $199.99 price tag is still pretty hard to swallow.
