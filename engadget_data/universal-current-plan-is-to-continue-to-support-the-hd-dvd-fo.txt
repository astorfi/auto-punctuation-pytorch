Ken Graffeo – veep of HD strategic marketing at Universal and also co-president of the HD DVD Promotional Group – said simply "Universal's current plan is to continue to support the HD DVD format." That Universal's response was almost verbatim to HD DVD ally Paramount's should come as little surprise. How about this, movie executive types: let us know about your future plans and we'll skirt this whole song and dance, okay?[Thanks to everyone who sent this in!]
