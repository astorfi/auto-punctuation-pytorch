 Has an evening with National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation become an annual holiday tradition? Or perhaps you enjoy a pre-present thrill, courtesy of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Whatever the flick, there's a good chance you won't be watching it on Netflix Instant Streaming tonight, reportedly due to an outage over at Amazon Web Services. Netflix cloud architect Adrian Cockroft is on the case, explaining on Twitter that the interruption will affect only certain devices -- while we're not quite sure which gadgets are currently down, we have received reports that gaming consoles and connected TVs have gone offline. Netflix, for its part, has also taken to Twitter to apologize for the outage, suggesting that you follow the as-yet-silent @Netflixhelps account for updates.

 Update: As of 11:45AM ET on 12/25, nearly 20 hours after Netflix began tweeting about a service interruption, the company has confirmed that streaming has been restored.
