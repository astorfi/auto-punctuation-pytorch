This just in from the "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"
department: Since die hard calculator users refuse to toss those relics and use their onscreen counterparts, Casio has
decided to take a traditional calculator, add some RF circuity and a USB dongle, and sell it as a combo calculator and
numeric keypad that can be used with or without a computer. Sure, there have been other calculator/keypad combos
before, but most have been wired, and none have so successfully simulated the look of a take-and-toss dollar-store
model. Of course, you'd better be careful not to take that look too literally, since prices on these range from $45 to
$63.
