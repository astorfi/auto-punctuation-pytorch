 XM lovers rejoice! The FCC has finally determined that three XM radios with FM transmitters are in the clear. XM had to cease production back in late May to give time to the Feds to check out its products. Specifically, the FCC approved the Audiovox Xpress, the Delphi RoadyXT and the XM Sportscaster. XM has notified its manufacturers to get those conveyor belts rolling again, just in time for the holidy shopping season, which, by the way, is due to start any day now. Now that XM is back on track, free Bob Dylan for everyone! Well, that's what we'd like for the holidays.
