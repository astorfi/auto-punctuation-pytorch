The new player includes theEZ-Sync HDAVI (AKA, Panny's VIERA Link) control function allowing users to control any HDMI connecteddevice from a single remote. The November release is meant to coincide with the US release of Panasonic's first 1080p plasmaTVs. Pricing has yet to be finalized but they tell us it should drop this September for "less than$1500." Well, we should hope so considering the Samsung and Sony players areexpected to come in at about a grand. [Via Akihabara News]
