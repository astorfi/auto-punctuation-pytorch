But if you're in the market for something to cover up your shiny new 13-, 15- or 17-inch machine, you owe it to yourself (and your fellow Earthlings) to check out what Hello Rewind is offering. Put simply, this company accepts your order for a new sleeve, sends you a pre-paid envelope, awaits the arrival of your used tee of choice, and then mails you a soft, personalized wrapping for your precious workhorse. During the process, the outfit uses the proceeds to fight sex trafficking and assist women that were formerly sex trafficked in New York City, which is just about as noble a mission as we can think of. Be sure to give the source link a visit if you're interested, where each sleeve can be procured for $49 with free shipping on both ends.
