Verizon customers have longgrumbled about the company's unwillingness to allow customers to use their cellphones to connect computers to theinternet, especially since there was never any technical reason not to do so, and many of the phones are capable ofconnecting over the company's high-speed EV-DO network. Verizon will begin charging $59.99 per month for the service,which initially extends to the LG VX9800 (pictured), Motorola RAZR V3c, Motorola E815 and LG VX8100. Verizon is,however, keeping at least one restriction: DUN via Bluetooth will still be officiallyoff-limits; the only way to legally connect will be via USB cables. Uh huh. But we're ok with that, right?
