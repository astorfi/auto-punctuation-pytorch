 Ok Treo fans, best get a-clickin' because Verizon is first from the gate with the launch of the Palm Treo 700p. Just don't freak when you see the VZW asking price of $399 $499, mkay? They'll be knockin' off an additional hundie once the total is tallied in hopes of making you feel special about your lack of WiFi support. Now hold tight if you're just gagging for Sprint's service -- we expect they'll be getting the lead-out any day now.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
