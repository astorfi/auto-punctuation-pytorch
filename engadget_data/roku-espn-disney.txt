Roku's streaming boxes will offer up live TV shows, events and video from ESPN and Disney later this month, providing you've got the appropriate subscriptions from the right "linear network". ESPN viewers will get ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPN3, ESPN Deportes and ESPNEWS through the WatchESPN channel. Both Goal Line and Buzzer Beater will also be coming to Roku... when it's the right season for 'em. At the same time, anyone who has a video subscription from "an affiliated provider' will be able to pick up Watch Disney, Watch Disney Junior and Watch Disney XD programming. In short, it's pretty similar to what Google Fiber subscribers picked up not too long ago.
