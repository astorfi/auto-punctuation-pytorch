Square Enix introduced Minette during a presentation for the 3DS RPG at Jump Festa 2015, though details focused more on the "Cat User" job class than Minette's background.

According to Gematsu's translation of a Dengeki Online report, Cat Users can sacrifice items to summon cats capable of strong attacks. In a demonstrated example, the "Death Spiral" move draws forth a pair of cats to strike enemies several times. Special attacks may burn one or more items, depending on their strength.

An example of the Astrologist class is also present in Minette's concept art, but details weren't offered for that character or class. Considering Contributing Editor Sinan Kubba noticed that there appear to be 30 job slots in Bravely Second footage shown three months ago, we're bound to hear of a few more new ways of life before the game launches in Japan in April 2015.
