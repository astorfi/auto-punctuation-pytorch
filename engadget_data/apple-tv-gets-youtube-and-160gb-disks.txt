 That's right, Google's YouTube is coming to Steve's little AppleTV "hobby" as he described it during his gig at D. The little treat Steve left out at the show is a new build-to-order 160GB disk; 4x the original capacity offered by Apple at launch. Of course both of these hacks were already available for you DIYers. Still, it's always good to get it via official channels, eh? The new AppleTV with beefier hard disk will be available tomorrow for $399 while the free YouTube update will be available in mid-June. [Thanks, Nick]
