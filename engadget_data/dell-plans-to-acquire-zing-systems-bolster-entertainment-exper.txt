Reportedly, Dell has just announced that it has "entered into an agreement to acquire privately-held Zing Systems, Inc.," and the move is said to be one that "reflects [Dell's] renewed interest and energy being directed at its consumer business." More specifically, it was stated that Dell would be using Zing and its capabilities to "continue improving the entertainment experiences it provides its customers," but unfortunately, that teaser is the last tidbit that was divulged for the time being.
