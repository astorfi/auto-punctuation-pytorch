 Just days after AT&T announced that its U-Verse rollout would be hitting a million fewer homes at the end of 2008 than it originally planned, we now know that Austin, Texas won't be one of the locales affected. Starting right now, folks down in Austin, Pflugerville and Round Rock can place their orders for the service and can expect installations to start up on November 19th. 'Course, it's not too shocking to hear that more of the Lonestar state is getting blessed with U-Verse -- after all, it was the state that AT&T first deployed the service in. So, for those of you in and around Austin, is the urge to switch over too much to withstand, or will you be stickin' with your current provider?
