According to Phil Harvey from Light Reading, close to grand per home when you figure that are planning on investing $18 billion to bring 18 million homes into the fold by 2010. That's an impressive amount of cash to drop down on one house but if you figure that most subscribers monthly bill will be around $100, they will make up the loss within a year. But the moral here is that while they can still make up the cost, this FiOS stuff is expensive and Verizon must be looking to the future when copper has maxed out their available bandwidth and fiber is the only way to go.
