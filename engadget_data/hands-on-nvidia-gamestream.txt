NVIDIA Shield's PC streaming tech is impressive, but NVIDIA's Gamestream tech is even more impressive: employing the Shield's HDMI-out port, games can not only be streamed to the Shield, but also to your living room TV. The functionality goes live on October 28th and officially takes PC streaming on Shield from beta to final. It'll add "Console Mode" as well, which enables control of the Shield's entire OS on your TV screen via connected Bluetooth controller. Though gaming is, at launch, limited to 720p, NVIDIA says 1080p is on the way -- you'll of course need a pretty hefty GPU to make that happen.


After today's announce of Gamestream, we had a chance to sit down and try it out with a Falcon Northwest Tiki PC and a Nyko wireless controller, playing Borderlands 2. As you'll see in the video below the break, streaming and controlling the Shield via Bluetooth controller is a snap -- we're actually quite looking forward to using a DualShock 3 with the Shield for controlling our favorite PC games.
