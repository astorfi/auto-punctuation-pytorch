Here we were thinking that if you were laying out $85,000 for a robot, that it'd be at least smaller and cuter than
previous generations, but Tmsuk's totally showing
us up with the RIDC-01. What's it do? Well, we're still trying to figure that out, but apparently it's got an LCD
projector mounted in its head for watching movies or displaying information, which, frankly, is a feature that seems
worth close to a hundie grand to us. Once more, Tmsuk, we tip our hats to you.
