 Did you know Canada is one of the largest high-def markets in the world? Well, they are and Digital Home Canada has a very comprehensive chart displaying who has what. We think that many American high-def viewers are going to look at this with envious eyes too. There is a good amount of HD content available for our friends up north and this proves it. Most of these providers give subscribers more options then even DirecTV does.
