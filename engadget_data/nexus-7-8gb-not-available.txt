 Google seems to have run out of the 8GB version of its Nexus 7 tablet. Sometime today, the $200 slate went from "In Stock" to "Coming Soon", with the Play store giving would-be purchasers the option to sign up for an email notification when it becomes available once again. Might this be a case of demand exceeding supply, or could the least capacious Nexus 7 be on the outs -- making way for a forthcoming 32GB version? No one outside of Mountain View can say for sure, but odds are favorable we'll find out at next week's Android event. Stay tuned.  [Thanks, Jeffrey]
