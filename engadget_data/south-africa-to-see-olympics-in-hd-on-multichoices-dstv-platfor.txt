 We already knew that DStv would soon be launching its first HD channel in South Africa, but now details are finally coming out in regard to Olympics coverage. It's no surprise that said provider will be utilizing its new station to broadcast this summer's biggest television event in high-def, but we now know that locals can tune to slot 170 on August 8th from 14:00 to see the Opening Ceremony. From there, more than 70 hours of HD coverage will continue on through August 12th. If you haven't bothered snagging an HD PVR from the company, you should probably get on that -- wouldn't want to wait 'til the last minute, would you?[Image courtesy of Virtual Tourist]
