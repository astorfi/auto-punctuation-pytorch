We first got our hands on it at CES (along with the InfiniTV 6) in January and the company tweeted tonight that it is now CableLabs certified. There's still no word on details like ship date and pricing, but with regulatory hurdles cleared it should be shipping very soon. Check a few more hands-on shots in our gallery.
