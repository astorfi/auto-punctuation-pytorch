All you do, it seems, is dock the phone into a larger, 13.9mm thick chassis -- great for those times when nothing other than a big physical keyboard will do. We don't know how much it's going to cost on top of the phone itself, but something tells us it won't be a bundled accessory. More details as we have them.
