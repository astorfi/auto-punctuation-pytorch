 We've already gotten wind of Intel's not-so-surprising branding choice for its Montevina platform, but it looks like the company's just now gotten a whole lot more specific about things, with it laying out its roadmap for the newly-named Centrino 2 product line. As Daily Tech reports, the new platform will make its debut in June of this year, and will include separate "Performance" and "Small Form Factor" lines. On that former front, you can expect processors ranging form 2.26GHz to 2.8GHz, with a TDP rating of either 25W or 35W and prices from $209 to $530. The Small Form Factor line, on the other hand, is considerably more over the map, boasting processor speeds from 1.2GHz all the way up to 2.2GHz, and TDP ratings ranging from a mere 5.5W to 25W (prices will be between $262 to $316). Needless to say, this bit of news has also already set the latest MacBook rumor mill into full swing, with DailyTech reporting that "Apple insiders" say the company will refresh its laptop line alongside the platform's launch in June, not that you likely needed "insiders" to tell you that.[Via MacRumors]
