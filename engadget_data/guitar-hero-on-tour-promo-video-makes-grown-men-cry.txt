For the extreme in cringe-worthy videos, we present the Guitar Hero: On Tour promo, replete with some of the worst faux-rock music and singing your ears and eyes have ever been subjected to. If this doesn't make you want to impale yourself on the nearest sharp object, nothing will. We're not sure if they were going for irony here -- all we see is fail... oh, and the game looks pretty impossible to play too. Video after the break.[Via Digg]
