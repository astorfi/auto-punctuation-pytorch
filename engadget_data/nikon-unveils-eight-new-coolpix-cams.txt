 Coolpix S230 and S220: 10 megapixels with a touchscreen that lets you write and draw on your photos. Both have four-way VR image stabilization, blink detection, and are available in several colors; the $229 S230 bumps the screen to three inches from the $149 S220's two and a half and adds ISO 2000 sensitivity.
 Coolpix S630: 12 megapixels with a 7x optical zoom and an 11fps burst mode, a 2.7-inch LCD, four-way VR image stabilization, blink detection and ISO 6400 sensitivity. Available in five colors for $279.
 S620: 12.2 megapixels with a 4x zoom, 0.7-second startup time, subject tracking, four-way VR image stabilization, blink / motion detection and ISO 6400 sensitivity. Also available in five colors for $269.
 Coolpix P90: 12.1 megapixel zoomer with a 24x 26-624mm zoom and 15fps burst mode, 3-inch tilt screen, four-way VR image stabilization, blink / motion detection, distortion control and ISO 6400 sensitivity. $339 in March.
 Coolpix L100: 10 megapixel with a 15x 28-420mm zoom and a 13fps burst mode, 3-inch screen and four-way VR image stabilization. Only comes in Bright Red for $279 in March.
 Coolpix L20: 10 megapixels with a 3.6x zoom and a 3-inch display, motion detection and auto scene selection. AA-powered, will come in Deep Red for $129.
 Coolpix L19: 8 megapixels with a 3.6 zoom and a 2.7-inch display, motion detection and auto scene selection. AA-powered, will come in Bright Silver for $109.

Not bad at all, but you've got to wonder why all these companies insist on cranking out so many minior variations on the same theme -- the average consumer has no chance of keeping up. Pictures of all the new shooters in the gallery.
