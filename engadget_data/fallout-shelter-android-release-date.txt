Fallout Shelter is a nifty little mobile game that puts you in charge of your very own post-apocalyptic Vault in the Fallout universe. It's your job to make sure the Vault Dwellers are as happy, healthy and protected as possible -- which is sometimes trickier than it sounds. Fallout Shelter launched for iOS on June 14th directly after Bethesda's E3 2015 conference, and now we know when it's coming to Android devices: August 13th.



          
 
 
 Bethesda announced Fallout Shelter during a conference dominated by big, new games, most notably Doom and Fallout 4. As a free iOS game (with in-app purchases, of course), it was a pleasant surprise for many hungry Fallout fans. Fallout Shelter wasn't the only mobile-focused announcement to come out of that conference, either: The Pip-Boy Edition of Fallout 4 comes with a real-life Pip-Boy made to fit smartphones (well, most smartphones) loaded up with a new companion app.Very excited for Android users to begin playing #FalloutShelter on August 13th. pic.twitter.com/FYXvyIzaAj
