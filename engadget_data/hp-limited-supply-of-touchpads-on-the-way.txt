In an update to a blog post from yesterday, the company confirmed that it will manufacture an additional "limited quantity" of TouchPads in Q4 -- presumably to meet existing backorders. Those of you who've signed up for email notification will receive an update and one-time offer today (peep it after the break), and a followup when more details are known. For live updates peep the two Twitter accounts linked under more coverage, and to get the full rundown of HP's plans, hit the source link below.

[Thanks, OneLove]
