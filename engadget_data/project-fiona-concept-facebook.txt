 Gaming peripheral manufacturer Razer isn't backing down on its "Project Fiona" gaming tablet, despite keeping it locked away for the past nine months. The company is, however, assessing interest in the concept -- first revealed at CES 2012 -- by asking fans to "Like" its Facebook page. If the page exceeds 10,000 likes/shares within a week, CEO Min-Liang Tan says, "we'll work on making the concept a reality and launch the product." He also says Razer's whittled down concepts for the device, though he's open to "suggestions for specs, form factor, pricing, features," and even "etc." It doesn't sound like it'll make its previously planned "second half of 2012" launch window, but Razer says nothing's changed on that front just yet.

 As it stands, the device sports a 10.1-inch multitouch high def screen, an Intel Core i7 Ivy Bridge processor, an unknown (but allegedly beefy) GPU, and two nunchuck-esque controllers mounted to either side of the screen. It's also said to run Windows 8 -- make no mistake, this is a PC in the form of a tablet. But you still have the power to change it! Do us a favor and don't request rear touch capabilities.

 Update: That didn't take long -- Razer's week long campaign ended in just over a day, reaching its 10,000 like goal. What's next? Concepts, says Min-Liang Tan. The company's CEO will be sharing possible designs on his Facebook page starting next week, and will let popular opinion mold the firm's first gaming tablet. It looks like building products from community feedback is Razer's new modus operandi.
