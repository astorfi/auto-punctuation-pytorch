A device known as the Touch Lapdesk N600 has now turned up at the FCC, which apparently not only adds some "touch" to the equation, but some 2.4GHz wireless connectivity as well. Unfortunately, that's about all that the FCC's willing to share at the moment, but there's a handsome label after the break, and a couple of dozen pages of test reports at the source link below if you're looking for a bit more evidence that this thing actually exists.
