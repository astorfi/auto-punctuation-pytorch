Primarily a platform that's intended to drive consumer engagement with brands via a social medium, Meebo also provides advertisers a less-intrusive way to reach their target audiences. Meebo announced the acquisition on its blog, and hints that its team will work with Google to grow and improve the platform. It's unclear whether Google intends to integrate the Meebo Bar into its own online properties, or whether the Mountain View giant simply views it as a method to increase its advertising reach. Regardless, it seems a bit of a no-brainer that Google+ will soon find a new home in the Meebo Bar. While the final purchase price remains a bit of a mystery, AllThingsD sources peg the deal in the neighborhood of $100 million. Not a bad way to start a Monday.

 Update: TechCrunch has confirmed the purchase price to be "around $100 million," with most of the team to work on Google+. Unfortunately, it seems that not everyone will be making the jump, with layoffs aimed at "sales and marketing."
