Google is getting serious about 360-degree video content. And it's not only about supporting it through YouTube or, by extension, Cardboard. The search giant's also behind an app called Spotlight Stories, which it created with Motorola in 2013 and has been on Android since. As of today, that application is also available for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad -- as long as those devices are running a version of iOS 8. Google describes Spotlight Stories as a "mobile movie theater" that combines 3D and 2D animation with 360-degree spherical video, sphere audio and sensor-triggered interactions to create an immersive experience. Right now there are four stories you can watch: Buggy Night, Help, Duet and Windy Day, all of which are original and were created exclusively for Spotlight Stories.
