       
We're still a couple days away from the PlayStation Move's September 19 launch date, but hey -- who said Best Buy has to follow the rules? One of our readers picked up a Move at a Best Buy in Benton Harbor, Michigan today, and we'd expect the trickle to turn into a flood by the time the "official" launch finally arrives. So -- who's buying one?
