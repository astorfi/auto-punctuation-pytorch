 
 Well hello there again, Gigabyte X11. Hot on the heels of yesterday's leak, Gigabyte's just made its 11.6-inch X11 laptop (or is that an Ultrabook?) official. At 975g (2.15 pounds) it claims the title of "lightest notebook on earth" -- and weighs even less on Mars. Design-wise, you're looking at a 16.5mm (0.65 inches) to 3mm (0.19 inches) thin Macbook Air-like body made of real carbon fiber (!) with an aluminum hinge. Under the hood you'll find unspecified third generation Intel Core processors (read Ivy Bridge), 4GB of DDR3 RAM, Mobile Intel HM77 Express chipset with Intel HD Graphics 4000, a 128GB SSD, WiFi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0.

 Ports include power, USB 2.0 and mini DisplayPort on the left side plus microSD, combo audio and USB 3.0 on the right. While the specs also mention gigabit Ethernet, there's no sign of it anywhere in the press shots. The display is a 1366x768-pixel LED-backlit affair dotted with a 1.3 megapixel webcam. A chiclet keyboard, buttonless trackpad and 4730mAh 7.4V Li-ion polymer battery (likely sealed) complete the package. There's no word on availability, but prices will range from $999 to $1299 with Windows 7 Home Premium and Professional in tow. Expect more information when we get our hands on this sexy beast at Computex next week.

 Update: Our colleagues over at Engadget Chinese just got to spend some time with this svelte black slab. Take a look at the gallery below and hit the break for the hands-on video.

   GIGABYTE X11 Full Carbon Fiber Made- The Lightest Notebook on Earth

   GIGABYTE created the ultra thin form factor with high-tech carbon fiber with superior design capability and superb technique, making the 975g X11 the lightest 11.6'' notebook on earth. Carbon fiber is light yet tough; therefore X11 is exceptionally durable. The specific strength of carbon notebook is 6 times stronger than of an aluminum notebook; meanwhile it comes with higher elasticity coefficients. The design details of X11 are comprehensively calculated to make the thinnest part stand at only 0.3cm, the thickest part at 1.65cm. The streamline design makes the perfect interpretation of delicate notebook crafts.

   GIGABYTE X11 The Woven Diamond Technique

   X11 is made by unique diamond weaving technique with careful application of transparent or black paint coating, forming the amazing Woven Diamond and Black Diamond classics X11. The Woven Diamond exposes the beauty of the original glaze carbon black and diamond weaving patterns. The Black Diamond applies the lacquer on the cover to show the meticulous texture. All the carbon fiber covers need to be examined thoroughly and polished by the craftsmen to ensure the perfect chassis shape for X11. It is designed both externally and functionally by taking cues from the aggressive and sleek looks of a sports car presenting a special 3D arc design. The handmade X11 is definitely worth having as a collection. The elegantly hidden aluminum hinge looks just like the sleek silver wheels of a profound super sports car, adding a low-key luxurious and speedy look for the X11. Taking inspiration from the exhausts of super cars, the GIGABYTE R&D team has developed the dual air vent design that efficiently exports the heat of the laptop, and also makes cooling even more efficient with its application of aluminum materials. X11 therefore has a cool and smooth operation just like a sports car.
