In yet another disputable case of "is the Xbox 360 Core model on its way out," a certain Target employee apparently snapped a picture of horrific quality showing the "Xbox 360 Core Hardware Sys" with a "Discontinued" status. The shot was reportedly taken from one of the store's oh-so-knowledgeable PDAs, and while there's obviously no confirmation either way just yet, this tidbit does substantiate the questionable Best Buy slip. Ah well, it's not like we won't have yet another iteration coming up soon to ease the pain if this proves accurate.
