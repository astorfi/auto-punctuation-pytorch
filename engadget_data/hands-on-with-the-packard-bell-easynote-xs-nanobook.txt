Sure, it's hard to keep tabs on the various re-brands and name changes of this thing, but one thing is for sure -- it's got the potential to give the Eee a run for its money. The ultraportable feels pretty good -- if a bit plastic-y -- in your hand, and it seemed to handle XP with relative ease. We kind of wish we'd seen some gOS on this puppy -- but hey, you can't have it all. Check the gallery below and see it yourself.
