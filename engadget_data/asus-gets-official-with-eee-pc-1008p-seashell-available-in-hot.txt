It's the same machine we saw leaked a few weeks back, and thankfully for those who dig the whole "vivacious" scene, it'll be available in both hot pink and coffee brown. Designed by Karim Rashid, ASUS' latest netbook gets powered by Intel's new Atom N450 processor and features a 10.1-inch display, Windows 7 Home Premium, 1GB of DDR2 memory, a 250GB hard drive, 802.11n WiFi, gigabit Ethernet, Bluetooth 2.1, 1.3 megapixel camera, a 3-cell removable battery and a 2.5 pound chassis. We'll keep you posted on a price and release, but for now, have a gander at the press shots below. 

Update: We nabbed a quick hands-on and took a video of the new removable battery, check it below.
