That netbook is apparently mostly identical to the D260 in terms of specs, with the notable exception of a brand new dual-core Atom N550 processor -- a first for an Acer netbook. About the only other changes are some minor design tweaks that ditch the chrome accents and flake paint options found on the D260 -- but don't worry, that impossible to miss Aspire One logo on the lid is still there. No word on availability just yet, but we're working to get that information out of Acer.
