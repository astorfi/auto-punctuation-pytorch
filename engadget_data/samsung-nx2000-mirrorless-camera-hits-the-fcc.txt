 Samsung may not have shaken up its mirrorless camera line with the very evolutionary NX1100, but there are hints at the FCC of bigger things in store. A filing at the US agency has confirmed the existence of an unannounced NX2000. On the surface, it's similar to its ancestors: labeling and tests point to a 20.3-megapixel CMOS sensor, an overall familiar body design and the presence of 802.11n WiFi. However, there's talk that the real focus for the NX2000 may be the interface, not image quality. A purported photo making the rounds at Photo Rumors (after the break) lines up with the FCC listing while showing an unexpected back that includes both a touchscreen and a hardware home key -- although nothing is definite, it suggests Samsung could bring a smarter, possibly Android-based interface to its mirrorless series. We'll only know just how clever a camera the NX2000 is when it's more official than a mix of regulatory clearances and rumors.
