The latest from robo-startup Willow Garage is different, a bot called PR2 that's capable of maneuvering through a crowded office, opening (non-locked) doors, and pilfering a little taste of that good, good, alternating current juice. What's more, he's sensitive to your time constraints, so the demonstration video below has been thoughtfully edited to minimize footage of aimless wandering, spinning, and general confusion. Next step: learning to knock.[Via Robots.net]
