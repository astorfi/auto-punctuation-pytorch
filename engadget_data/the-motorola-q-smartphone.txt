We're not sure about how this thing be lookin' versus that
early render we had before, but news just
finally freaking broke on the Motorola Q, what we once knew as the
RAZRberry and Franklin. What's it got? 4.6 x
2.5 x 0.45-inches in your pocket for one, a QVGA (320 x 240) wide-format display, QWERTY keyboard (duh), Windows Mobile
5.0, thumbwheel, d-pad, 1.3 megapixel camera, MiniSD, and Bluetooth. Expect it in Q1 2006 for probably more money at
launch than we're ready to hear about yet.
