BGR says it'll be full Flash, not Flash Lite or the Open Screen Project's mobile Flash 10 implementation, but don't get too excited: it'll be next summer before RIM ships devices fast enough to handle it, and even then things may be delayed since they'll need HSPA or LTE data speeds to pull it off. Hey, maybe in the meantime all those engineers could maybe work on things like properly rendering a text page? Just an idea.
