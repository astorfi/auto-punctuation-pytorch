Browse to whatever web article / Google book / Wikipedia entry you want to enjoy, press the center button, and watch as Alex "prints" the page to the e-reader screen up top for a more comfortable reading experience. We'll admit we're a bit surprised to see a working model already -- hopefully this is a sign of good things to come sooner rather than later. Video after the break.
