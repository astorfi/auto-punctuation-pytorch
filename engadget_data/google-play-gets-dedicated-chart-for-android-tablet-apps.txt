Many have chastised Google for doing little to properly expose Android tablet apps, but it's addressing that in style: the Google Play Store now includes a dedicated section in the charts for the top tablet-native releases, all of which meet the company's design guidelines for bigger screens. The company is also bringing its recent Play Store mobile redesign to the web. It shares the same interface, but it takes advantage of the extra screen area with a sidebar that lets shoppers quickly switch between media types. Both updated portals should be accessible today.
