 In Japan, they've been coined the IXUS 255 HS and IXUS 132, but folks in the US will probably recognize them as the ELPH 330 HS and 115 IS. By any name, they're Canon's two mid-range point-and-shoots for CP+, and while they were joined by the A2500 during this week's announcements, that latter model didn't seem to make it to the company's booth here in Yokohama. In any case, if you've handled an ELPH model in recent years, you know what to expect here -- Canon's design hasn't changed much, but we're not complaining. The 330 HS includes a 12.1-megapixel CMOS sensor, compared to a 16-megapixel CCD in the slightly smaller 115 IS.

 Cosmetically, the biggest difference between the two is the powerful 10x optical zoom lens on the 330 HS, compared to a still-respectable 8x optic on the lower-end model. Both cameras offer the same familiar PowerShot UI, and they look nearly identical with the lens retracted. Zoomed in, however, it's clear which camera is the more capable of the bunch. Both performed very well during our hands-on at Canon's booth, though we'd definitely opt for the 330 HS, which offers a superior sensor and extended lens, not to mention built-in WiFi -- it's definitely worth spending an extra 60 bucks to snag the $230 HS model. Both cameras are set to ship beginning in March, but you can check them out in our walkthrough today, embedded just past the break.
