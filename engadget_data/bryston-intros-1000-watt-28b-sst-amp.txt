Even when the design goal is to make an amp that can drive any speaker in the world, this seems like overkill. Bryston assures us this beast isn't just brawn; it also gets the nuances right. And with specs like a -115dB noise floor, and total harmonic distortion below 0.001%, we'd believe them. Price is securely in the "if you have to ask..." realm, but you do get the standard 20 year Bryston warranty for your $7500.
