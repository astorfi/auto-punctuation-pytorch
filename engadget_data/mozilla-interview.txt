 Sure CES is primarily a hardware show, but that doesn't mean that some of the top software companies aren't getting in on the action. Mozilla will be on-hand to discuss the desktop and mobile browsing wars, and the company's VP of products, Jay Sullivan, will be paying a visit to our stage to discuss the latest Firefox goings-on.
