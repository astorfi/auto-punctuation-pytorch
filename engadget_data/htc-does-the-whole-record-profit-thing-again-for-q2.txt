The company happily announced this week an impressive second quarter net income of NT$17.5 billion ($608 million), more than double what it reported for the same time period the year prior. Overall revenue for the quarter hit NT$124.4 billion, thanks to the ever-present demand for Android handsets. And revenue from the company is expected to keep on growing in Q3 -- maybe boredom isn't so bad after all.
