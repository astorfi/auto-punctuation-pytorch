The Xbox One's 50GB Blu-ray discs will automatically rip to your 500GB hard drive, Microsoft tells us, and it looks like you won't have to wait til they're done to get going. That's according to the Xbox One landing page on Xbox.com, spotted by our friends at Joystiq, which says, "With Xbox One, you can start playing immediately as games install. And updates install seamlessly in the background, so your games and entertainment won't be interrupted."


And that's not all they've sussed out in details -- the Xbox One will also have a 1,000-person friend cap. How does that tie into the Skype integration? Good question! That's not clear just yet, but it stands to reason that they're independent of each other.
