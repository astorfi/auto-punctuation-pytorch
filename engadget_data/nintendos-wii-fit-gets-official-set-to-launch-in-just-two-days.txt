Today the big N has made the forthcoming release of the exercise / gaming sensation officially official in the States. The device is available exclusively at the Nintendo World store in New York City starting today, but will hit other shelves on May 21st, will run you a thrifty $89.99, and launches with software containing more than 40 activities. Of course, you'll never get to experience any of those activities, as there's already a run on stock, and if you haven't pre-ordered then you're pretty much left to the whim of eBay sellers and their inflated prices. Thanks Nintendo!
