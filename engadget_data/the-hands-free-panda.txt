We know that Jen is going to want one of these: a sort of stuffed toy panda
bear with a pouch for holding your cellphone that doubles as a hands free speakerphone and is supposed to move its lips
in time with whoever is calling (though we have no idea exactly how it does this). Shouldn't we get some sort of veto
over whether or not a stuffed bear mouths or words when we call someone?
