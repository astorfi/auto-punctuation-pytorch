 With 3G just getting a foothold in most of the world's wireless markets, China is preparing to leapfrog those efforts and get 4G pushed out to as many customers as it can. The China Ministry of Information Industry wants the 4G mobile standard it has developed adopted by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as early as 2008. China is pushing the homebrew TD-SCDMA as the foundation for its 4G proposal. Regardless of what the ITU decides, we get giddy when any global market envisions wireless data speeds to the tune of 80Mbps. The only issue is that TD-SCDMA still has bugs that Chinese telecom personnel are still trying to quash; if they don't, the ITU may be frowning when China comes calling next year.
