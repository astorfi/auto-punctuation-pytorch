  Android users who enjoy saving their reading for later will be happy to know that Pocket's been on the receiving end of a very pleasant update. The main addition in this new version is a text-to-speech feature which reads you any saved articles, and one that's missing from its iOS counterpart. Additionally, the "Manage Site Subscription" within the app's now fully functional on all flavors of Google's OS, while an enhanced full-screen animation in Reader and other undisclosed UI tweaks have also been stuffed inside v4.2. The refreshed Pocket application can be downloaded now from the Play shop, and be sure to pay the more coverage link below a visit to dive into some deeper details.
