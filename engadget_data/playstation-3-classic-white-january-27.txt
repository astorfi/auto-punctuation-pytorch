 That new, paler PlayStation 3 that turned up at Canadian retailers recently? Turns out that's launching US and Canada-wide, according to PR that Sony just let loose. The $299.99 console bundle is the latest version of the PlayStation 3 (with the unfortunate top-mount disc drive) and comes with the largest HDD capacity on any PS3: 500GB. The bundle also comes packed with one matching white DualShock 3 controller, and a full year membership to PlayStation Plus. There aren't any games included in the package, but then you're getting a whole mess of free content from that PS Plus subscription, now aren't you? Sony's even got a video detailing that mess of content, which we've dropped just below the break.
