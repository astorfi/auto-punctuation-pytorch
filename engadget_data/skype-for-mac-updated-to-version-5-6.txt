   We know you've had your fair share of troubles adjusting to the fifth iteration of Skype for Mac. Now, Microsoft is issuing yet another quick refresh to go along with the support for HD calls and Lion. This time, though, the desktop app is adding automatic updates -- which should come in handy for those who aren't fans of manual labor -- as well as the promise of an improved UI in group calls, the ability to delete convos and disable audio gain control. Additionally, you'll now be able to use full-screen mode if you're running Apple's King of the Jungle OS. Skype version 5.6 is up for grabs now at no cost, and you can upgrade via the source link below or directly from the application on your machine.
