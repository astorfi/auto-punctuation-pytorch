Despite running as an internet app on top of the existing Vizio hardware, we're told the service will support full 1080p resolution, stereoscopic 3D images, and OnLive's low-latency wireless gamepads too -- as Vizio's units will apparently support IEEE 802.15.4. While the jury's still out on when OnLive will actually be playable on touchscreens, CEO Steve Perlman says some games are being adapted to support touch right now, and that tablets that support external game controllers could also use OnLive normally. We've also got more good news for the home theater crowd, as OnLive's signed a deal with SRS, bringing 5.1 surround sound as a free update to all OnLive users early next year. Because there's nothing quite like having ears bombarded from all directions with digital explosions. PR after the break.

(NASDAQ: SRSL), officially recognized as one of America's Greatest Brands and the industry leader in surround sound, audio and voice technologies, today announced that it has partnered with cloud-gaming pioneer OnLive Inc. to deliver top-tier video games in rich 5.1 surround sound to any compatible consumer electronic device through the use of SRS 5.1™ Surround Sound, an advanced, format-agnostic, easy to deploy and manage end-to-end surround sound technology solution used for content creation, transmission and consumption. OnLive users will receive SRS 5.1 Surround as an automatic free update in early 2011."We are very excited that OnLive selected SRS 5.1 as its format of choice for encoding video games in 5.1 surround sound," said Chuck Cortright, Vice President of New Business Development for SRS Labs. "On-demand gaming communities and services like OnLive, which provide instant access to great content, are just one of many practical applications for our SRS 5.1 surround sound encoding and decoding solutions. Gamers will absolutely love the more immersive and lifelike experience of playing their favorite games in surround sound over standard stereo."SRS 5.1Surround system does not require a proprietary decoder for the receiving device and requires no extra bandwidth, as it piggybacks on normal stereo transmission. This provides OnLive with the right tool to create and deliver true, high-quality streamed surround sound encoded content across TVs, Mac® and PC computers, iPad®, Android and similar mobile devices that can tap into a broadband network. Because millions of TVs, A/V receivers, PCs and mobile devices today feature one or more SRS audio solutions such as Circle Surround®,TheaterSound™, StudioSound HD™, TruSurround®and Premium Sound™, every one of these CE devices are natively equipped with the capability to decode SRS 5.1 surround encoded content, resulting in a "surround everywhere" entertainment experience.Additionally, for devices unable to decode SRS 5.1, the encoded content will default back to stereo and can still be heard, which is not the case with traditional surround codecs that require the appropriate decoder for outputting sound."OnLive's state-of-the-art video games provide incredibly realistic experiences, and a core part of the user's immersion into these games is a rich surround sound environment," said Steve Perlman, Founder and CEO of OnLive. "SRS 5.1 not only achieves superb surround sound fidelity through OnLive, but it does so with simplicity and compatibility across all devices OnLive supports-from handheld mobile devices, to PC/Mac, to TVs with high-end home theater systems-achieving the best audio experience each device can deliver. We are delighted to partner with SRS to provide OnLive users an outstanding cross-platform compatible surround sound experience."SRS 5.1 Surround Sound features SRS' Circle Surround®, an advanced matrix surround sound processing engine. The Circle Surround engine is a highly versatile multichannel audio encode and decode system that's capable of supporting a wide range of surround sound creation and playback applications. With SRS 5.1, surround sound is made available without sacrificing the2-channel reach and experience. Some of the other major benefits SRS 5.1 include:* Produces surround sound from any audio material, including multichannel, stereo and mono audio sources* Delivers both multichannel and front-rendered surround sound, depending on playback configuration* Streams surround over bit rates as low as 96kbps* Ensures smooth steering and full bandwidth for a seamless and immersive surround environment* Is backwards compatible with legacy matrix decoders and stereoFor more information about SRS 5.1 Surround Sound, please download the technology brochure at http://bit.ly/ijRuLc.
