Three years. That's how long it's been since Nokia has offered a phone for the largest carrier in the US: a unique (and yet wholly forgettable) device known as the Twist. Needless to say, the arrival of the Lumia 822 at Verizon Wireless comes at a crucial time for Nokia, which must quickly establish itself in the United States if it hopes to remain a legitimate contender in the smartphone realm. That's a lot of weight to carry on one's shoulders -- even for a mighty Finn.


Fortunately, the Lumia 822 is well-suited to help establish a beachhead on Lady Liberty's shores. At just $100 on-contract, it's a good value and deserves genuine consideration from OS switchers and first-time smartphone buyers alike. Granted, it lacks the premium display and camera wizardry of the Lumia 920, but with greater built-in storage and a better front-facing camera, it narrowly bests the Lumia 820 for AT&T and the Lumia 810 for T-Mobile. Add to that Data Sense -- a new data monitoring and compression feature of Windows Phone 8, but currently exclusive to Verizon -- and the Lumia 822 easily becomes the most compelling of Nokia's mid-range Windows Phone lineup. Even if its design is a bit... bland.




Hardware
Have you ever lied and told somebody they looked good only to spare their feelings? That rationale may be fine for humans, but it's completely unnecessary with smartphones. Unlike the elegant Lumia 810 or the quirky Lumia 820, the design of the Lumia 822 lacks any semblance of style. For starters, in a change from its siblings, the phone's face isn't a clean sheet of glass, but rather features a plastic lip at the bottom that prominently displays the Verizon logo. What's more, the Lumia 822 is available only in black, white and gray, and it also lacks the unique removable shell that's characteristic of the Lumia 810 and 820. Instead, you'll find a run-of-the-mill plasticky rear cover that contains Carl Zeiss branding on the camera pod and a 4G LTE logo at the bottom. Put simply, if the Lumia 822 turns any heads, it's probably for all the wrong reasons.

The Lumia 822 is also quite thick, and we'd be tempted to suggest that it lose some weight -- if only it didn't feel so damn good in-hand. Each of the phone's controls are laid out on the right-hand side, which includes the volume rocker, power button and dual-stage camera button. While the Lumia 822 may not be much to look at, its design is partially redeemed by the excellent placement of the controls and ports. Whether you're left- or right-handed, you should have no issue cranking up the volume or waking the device, and even the camera button is well-positioned for landscape use. Up top, you'll find a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack and a secondary microphone. Along the bottom, a micro-USB port is situated between the loudspeaker and primary mic. If you pay close attention, you'll also discover ambient light and proximity sensors to the left of the front-facing camera. One thing you won't find, however, is a notification light, which is included in the more expensive HTC 8X.


Fortunately, if you're willing to look beyond the Lumia 822's ho-hum design, you'll find that its true beauty lies within. The phone includes a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4, which brings a speedy and efficient dual-core 1.5GHz CPU and an Adreno 225 GPU. Along with support for Verizon's domestic EV-DO and LTE networks, travelers will appreciate that the device is unlocked for global use. Here, you'll find quad-band support for GSM and WCDMA networks. The Lumia 822 also offers 802.11a/b/g/n (WiFi), Bluetooth 3.0, GPS, GLONASS and NFC. If you're considering both the Lumia 822 and HTC 8X, a couple factors that may tip the scale in Nokia's favor include a removable 1,800mAh battery and a microSD expansion slot -- two features that are completely absent from the high-end HTC 8X. Those willing to snag an optional backplate and Qi base station will also be able to wirelessly recharge the handset.


The Lumia 822 features a 4.3-inch ClearBlack AMOLED display, and although its 800 x 480 (WVGA) resolution can't match the pixel density of the 720p HTC 8X or the qHD Droid RAZR M, Nokia's mid-range contender offers plenty of real estate for content, vibrant colors, deep blacks and superb viewing angles.

Like Nokia's other Windows Phone 8 devices, the touchscreen is more sensitive than its competitors, which means that you'll have little trouble controlling the device with your fingernails or while wearing gloves. As another unique advantage, Nokia's ClearBlack technology incorporates a polarized filter that substantially improves the screen's readability in direct sunlight. We're also happy to report that the Lumia 822 offers a true RGB matrix display that renders text more crisply than WVGA counterparts that sport the PenTile (RGBG) matrix.

Despite the Lumia 822's positioning as a mid-range handset, it performs similarly to high-end selections such as the Nokia Lumia 920 and HTC 8X. Because all phones in the Windows Phone 8 roster currently include the Snapdragon S4 from Qualcomm, you're not going to find much differentiation on this front. On the plus side, you won't need to spend more to find a faster device.

Our interactions with the phone were generally zippy -- things like browsing the web, playing media and navigating menus all felt smooth. The Lumia 822 is also consistently quick to find its GPS positioning, which is helpful considering Nokia's emphasis on location-based apps. That said, there are still a few areas across the Lumia lineup that could use some improvement. One example is Nokia's home-brewed apps, which take a bit longer to load than core OS components such as the messaging and dialer apps. The camera is also a bit pokey -- it takes a couple seconds to properly focus and meter a scene. While it's not a huge issue, the Lumia 822 takes somewhere in the 40-second range to cold boot, which is about twice the time we've come to expect from modern smartphones.


Call quality on the Lumia 822 is serviceable, but it's not exactly a high point either. Even during calls to landlines, we consistently perceived other's voices as tinny, and our friends often remarked that we sounded distant and muted. While you'll have no trouble carrying on a conversation with the Lumia 822, if voice quality is particularly important to you, we recommend that you consider the Lumia 810 from T-Mobile.

The Lumia 822 provides battery life that's generally on par with what we've seen from other devices in the Windows Phone 8 lineup. In this sense, you should have no trouble using the handset for a day or even two with moderate to light usage. It's also worth pointing out that you can further extend battery life by disabling SkyDrive sync, and if you're ever truly in a pinch, Windows Phone 8 includes a battery-saving mode that disables background data tasks. Also in line with its peers, the Lumia 822 chugged along for 2.5 hours in the WPBench battery torture test. When it's time to juice up, you'll be able to recharge the device in just under two hours.

The Lumia 810 combines an 8-megapixel sensor with a Carl Zeiss 26mm f/2.2 lens, which is accompanied by a dual-LED flash and a two-stage shutter button. By default, the camera is set to capture images at 16:9, though we generally prefer the optional 4:3 aspect ratio, which makes full use of the camera's sensor.
