 While we doubt Huawei or LG were singing "I'm late, I'm late for a very important date..." at MWC this year, in hindsight they likely would have enjoyed sharing what arguably became the biggest deal of this show. Unfortunately the two handsets we caught up with at Telefonica's booth were behind glass and no amount of reason was going to see them sprung. Obviously the Huawei offering isn't close to ready as it is running on an Android set, though, the LG while powered off certainly looked like a complete housing featuring the requisite home button. So it would seem Firefox OS has become a waiting game as we sit and tally what other manufacturers feel it's safe to jump on board. Short gallery of the two devices under glass are just below.
