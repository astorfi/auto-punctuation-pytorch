 The AQUOS Phone Zeta SH-02E was first with Sharp's new IGZO LCD technology a few days ago and it's been followed quickly by another device, the AQUOS Pad SHT21. Scheduled to debut on Japanese carrier KDDI in mid-December, this 7-inch slate claims battery life of up to two and a half times greater than the previous model thanks to the low-power characteristics of its display, and weighs just 280g. It's powered by a 1.5GHz dual-core MSM8960 Snapdragon S4 CPU, and features a 1280x800 screen resolution, pen input, 1GB RAM, 16GB built-in storage, microSDXC slot, Bluetooth 4.0, MHL, NFC, 3,460mAh battery and 4G LTE capability.
