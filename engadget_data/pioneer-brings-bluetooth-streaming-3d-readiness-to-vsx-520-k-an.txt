In truth, we can only safely say that those beliefs are shared by Pioneer, who has today introduced a new pair of 5.1 AV receivers that offer Bluetooth streaming, HDMI 1.4 and an unmistakable "3D ready" label. There's also the obligatory Works with iPhone certification on the VSX-820-K, which enables it to transfer iPod navigation control and on-screen graphics from the remote back to the Apple device. Outside of that, most everything else is identical between the two, as they each offer five channels of 110 watts, at least 3 HDMI sockets and rather reasonable price tags. Speaking of, you'll be asked to pay $229 for the 520 and $299 for the 820 when they splash down later this month.
