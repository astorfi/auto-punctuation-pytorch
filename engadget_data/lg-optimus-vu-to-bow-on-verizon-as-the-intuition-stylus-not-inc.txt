Really though, that lady razor name's the purported new moniker for Big Red's rebranded Optimus Vu: the heretofore Korea-only phablet we recently reviewed. While we found the outsized handset's worth as a true S-Pen rival hampered by its lack of a digitizer and 4:3 aspect ratio, it could catch on with folks eager for a 7-inch tablet alternative. However this one eventually shakes down in the crowded Android marketplace, it appears subs are in store for a 4G LTE ride and the carrier's typical $199 on two-year contract pricing. Curiously, the leak makes no mention of an included stylus, so perhaps the operator's opting to spin this one as a more traditional smartphone release. Smart move, that.
