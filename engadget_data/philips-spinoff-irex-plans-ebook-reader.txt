The latest ebook reader that won't take the world by storm is apparently coming soon from a Philips spinoff called
iRex Technologies. The Dutch company showed off a prototype earlier this month, and plans a launch for early next year.
According to reports, the iRex will use
E-ink technology (not surprising, since Philips helped develop and fund E-ink), and has also been put together by
some of the same developers who worked on Sony's
mega-successful Librie. No info yet on pricing or specs. We like E-ink, and would certainly like to see ebooks take
off in a real way. But face it, until readers are cheap, easy to use, have color displays, and have a common platform
for software and DRM (not to mention a critical mass of available books), they're going to remain expensive novelty
items.
