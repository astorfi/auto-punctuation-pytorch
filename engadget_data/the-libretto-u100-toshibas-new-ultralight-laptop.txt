It's been on vacation for the past three years, but Toshiba's bringing back their much-loved line of ultralight
libretto laptops. They're claiming that they brought back the libretto to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the
introduction of their very first laptop, too bad the U100, the first model in the revived line, looks a bit like it was
inspired by boxy mid-Eighties laptop design. Snotty aesthetic concerns aside, they do manage to squeeze a lot into the
U100, which weighs 2.16 pounds and has a 1.2GHz Pentium M processor, 7.6-inch widescreen LCD with a resolution of 1280
x 768, built-in 802.11b/g WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0, 512MB of RAM, and a 60GB hard drive. Retail price: $1,999 (pictured at
