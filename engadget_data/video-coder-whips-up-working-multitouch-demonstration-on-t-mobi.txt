Put simply (or as simply as possible), he has figured out a way to demonstrate full working multitouch on a stock T-Mobile G1, and he even provides the video to prove it and a list of instructions for developers to follow suit. For those just casually interested, the vid after the break is apt to be enough to get your saliva flowing, but for the hardcore data snoopers in the crowd, the incredibly lengthy read link is where it's at. Go where you must -- it's like a choose-your-own-adventure book, but for nerds.[Via Phandroid, thanks Rob and Keyan]
