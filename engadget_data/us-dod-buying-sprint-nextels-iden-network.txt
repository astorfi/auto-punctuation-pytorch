Moto must be stoked on this one: after Sprint was slated to wipe
Nextel's iDEN network from the face of
the planet, PCS Intel has it that the United States Department of Defense will come in and scoop up the infrastructure
outright for a national encrypted iDEN network for government communications — one separate from civilian cellphone
networks. For those of you still worried about your service and/or Push-To-Talk, have no fear, we understand Sprint
intends to roll out dual-mode CDMA/iDEN handsets for use
in the years during the changeover, and they've already got limited support for Sprint PCS Ready Link (their CDMA PTT
service). So yes, it looks like iDEN will live to see another day — but eventually you'll just have to be on the
government payroll to use it.
