Yeah, yeah we know biometric door locks aren't exactly news, but MATA BioTech's M28 fingerprint recognition lock
seems to be one of the first semi-reasonably priced ones for home or, more conceivably, small business use.  It'll
run you $400 but you can install it yourself and kiss your keys goodbye cause you'll be kickin' it James Bond style
from now on.  It can store up to 10 fingerprints and is powered by two AA batteries which are supposed to last up
to a year (you really don't want these batteries to die on you, either).  They also have a $300 fingerprint drawer
lock if you need to hide, you know, sensitive documents.
