Let's face it: your thoughts and ideas are just way more important than everyone else's. Artist Stefhan Caddick
knows this, and that's why for three days he wants you to post all your deep and witty observations on a recommissioned
construction sign located in the UK's Hayes Island. From 10 AM to 11 PM on October 28th, 29th, and 30th, anyone in the
world can SMS 07929 461727 and have their 144-character-or-less message be queued up on a Leaderboard sports Variable
Message Sign for public consumption. The "Storyboard" display, co-designed by Caddick and programmer Chris Evans, is
part of the Cardiff Festival of Creative Technology, and will be moved to Gallery 39 afterwards for a December showing.
Oh, and for those of you who think it would be funny to use this display to cast your American Idol voteâ€”well it would
be.
