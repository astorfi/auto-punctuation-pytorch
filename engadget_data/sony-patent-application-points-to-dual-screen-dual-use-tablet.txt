Described specifically as an "electronic book with enhanced features," the device would sport two screens that could take on a different functionality depending on how the device is oriented -- functioning as an e-reader when in portrait mode, and displaying a keyboard on the lower screen when placed on a table, for instance. Now, this obviously has a few similarities to the Courier, and even more to Microsoft's earlier Codex project (with its "Battleship posture"), but Sony does seem to have put a slightly unique spin on things, and has even thrown in a few more ideas of its own -- even mentioning solar charging in its claims for the application.
