  If you're finding that the digital compass on your phone keeps leading you down the wrong path, then this patent application from Sony might get you back on track. The claims entail a wireless communication device (aka phone) configured to communicate with a headset. The novelty being, that using orientation information from the headset, the wireless device would determine which direction the user is looking. Based on this information (and your GPS coordinates), the device would then be able to "predict a destination location for the user." Is this hinting at a new navigation system / accessory, or some neat little tool for geocachers? One thing's for sure, if you point your head towards the source link below, you'll locate the full details.
