The projectedrelease date for this S60 phone is a bit more reasonable, stated as Q1 2007, but with the sweet specs listed we'rereally not sure we can wait that long. The phone supposedly has a 2.5-inch-ish 352 x 416 pixel screen, Bluetooth 2.0,microSD, 5 megapixel and VGA cameras, UMTS, 802.11b/g, 4GB HDD (alright, now it's just getting ridiculous), andmini-jack audio. While those specs read just like a fanboy wishlist, we can clearly see the dual cameras and some sortof slide up media controls from the pics, along with plenty of screen real estate. For the rest of it we'll just haveto spend a year on Santa's "nice" list and hope he has some sway with the Nokia elves.
