So far all we know is what we've seen of the shrunken cases and revamped IT remote, while upgraded processors within are bringing Angry Birds this summer. In the meantime, Zatz Not Funny has strung together an FCC filing for the new RF remote control and rumors indicating an impending launch at prices identical to current models. That puts the XD at $80 and the XS at $100, so if you were thinking about stopping off at Best Buy for a media streamer, you might want to hold off for a day or three.
