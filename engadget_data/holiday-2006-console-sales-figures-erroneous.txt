We thought that report sounded a bit dubious, and now according to NPD, CNBC mis-cited a not-yet-existent report. The numbers, which are now considered to be erroneous, don't really correlate to anything on NPD's end as their forthcoming console retail report (which will include compiled retailed sales figures) will not be released for another week or so. (We still don't really have any idea what report it was CNBC was actually citing.) Although it wouldn't really surprise us if Xbox-Wii-PS3 is the actual order the console sales took over the last couple of months, as far as we know there isn't yet any evidence to support that assertion, so we'll all have to wait and see exactly which group of fanboys is proved right or wrong in '06.
