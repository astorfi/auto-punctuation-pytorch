Using the Bluetooth button on the steering wheel, you can access the assistant. We got a demo from a GM rep, who showed us how to access messages, read back to you through the car stereo.

 If you're feeling vocal, you can also dictate responses and Siri'll shoot them back off, all without ever having to take your hands off the wheel. You can also ask for things like recommendations for local businesses, but those won't play through the display. Siri also won't answer your philosophic questions, as GM doesn't want to display Wikipedia pages on the screen while you're driving. From the demo, the whole thing seemed pretty straightforward for anyone who's ever used an in-car Bluetooth system, checking things like stock prices and sports scores, if you're so inclined.

 We also received a quick demo of TuneIn, an iPhone app that pulls in radio stations around the world, featuring recommendation features like a Favorites button, local trending and a Jump button, which uses an algorithm to pull songs and the like based on your listening habits.
