From Solid Alliance and Pretec, the world's smallest 512MB USB Flash drive. Unfortunately that photo of a 500 yen
coin does little to convey how small it is to anyone who isn't Japanese (or anyone else who isn't overly
familiar with Japanese currency). Anyway, the drive is just 18x40x9mm in size, so bust out your tape measure if you
wanna see how small that really is.
