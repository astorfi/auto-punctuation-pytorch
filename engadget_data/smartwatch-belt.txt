Have you ever wanted smartwatch notifications without the convenience of having something on your wrist? No? Apparently, no one told that to the design team at Suzi Roher. The fashion outfit's new Urban Tech Belt includes a "digital watch computer" that lets you check calls, play music and read messages without grabbing your smartphone... which is stored in a holster just a few inches away. Yes, you're supposed to avoid reaching for a pocket or bag by reaching for your belt. Not much of a time-saver, really. And did I mention that this will cost a steep $725 when it arrives in January? Fashion and technology produce some beautiful things together, but this time you're better off buying one of Roher's usual belts and rolling the savings into a stylish smartwatch that will actually make your life easier.
