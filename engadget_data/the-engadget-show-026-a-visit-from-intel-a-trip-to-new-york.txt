We get a behind the scenes tour of the technology that goes into running Manhattan's Nightmare haunted house. And we swing by New York Comic Con, to discuss the state of digital comics and shoot the breeze with geek legends Mark Hamill and Stan Lee.

		We also announce the winners of our Frankengadget contest and give away the clothes from Tim's back to the winner of our in-studio costume contest, courtesy of Halloweencostumes.com -- oh, did we mention that Tim and Brian and dressed as Darth Vader and a storm trooper this whole episode? Because they are.

		Intel's staff futurist Brian David Johnson stops by to talk about the near future of the chipmaker and the role science fiction plays in his daily work. We pay tribute to Steve Jobs with the help of some eager Apple fans. And we take a look at the iPhone 4S, Amazon Kindle and the ASUS Zenbook UX31.
