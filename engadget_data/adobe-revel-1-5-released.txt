 Adobe's cloud-based photo storage and editing app has been enjoying its new name since it hopped off the Carousel, and now it's appreciating a feature bump too. Version 1.5 has just hit the virtual shelves of the Mac and iTunes stores, complete with a new UI and the option to log in using Facebook or Google accounts. Functionality wise, the update adds text captioning for your snaps and the ability to create albums which auto-sync across your devices and can be shared with others via the web. Alright, so the update isn't revolutionizing the service, but we're sure those that currently subscribe are reveling in it.

   Adobe today announced the immediate availability of Adobe Revel 1.5.

With Revel users have one place for all their photos, which they can access using their iPad, iPhone, and Mac. And thanks to automatic syncing of everything a user does – importing and editing photos, creating albums – Revel is the only app that allows consumers to access and manage one photo library on virtually any iOS device or Mac computer.

   "My favorite things about Revel are having my whole photo library always with me and automated syncing," said Gayle Vehar, blogger at Mom and Camera. "I love being able to make adjustments and manage photos on-the-go without having to manually sync when I get home-Revel just handles all of that for me. Revel is the perfect photo app for families because we'll never miss a moment."

   New features available in Adobe Revel 1.5 include:

   · Albums to organize photos – Create an album on one device and it is automatically updated and accessible everywhere
