With the arrival of iOS 8, sharing amongst the family is about to get a lot easier. Once you set up all the members of your household (up to six total), you can automatically share photos, calendars, reminders, location and more. But that's not all. You know that catchy tune your son bought last week? Well, you'll be able spin it on your iPhone too. Sharing books, movies, apps and songs is also thrown in, and it can all be tied to a single credit card. Don't worry parents: You'll get a notification when your kids want to make a purchase.
