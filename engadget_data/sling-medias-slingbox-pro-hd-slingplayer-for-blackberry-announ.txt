The PRO HD has the full complement of built-in HD inputs, but will actually pass through and stream out video in HD (1080i, to be specific) in real time, unlike the Solo and PRO (which lack the PRO HD's more advanced hardware-accelerated encoding, and stream closer to VGA res). And, of course, the BlackBerry client does as it says -- you can finally use your strictly-business handheld to watch mobile video on the go. The PRO HD will run you $400 when launched in Q3; BlackBerry will be $30 when it comes out "this year," if that's not vague enough for you. Get in line, Sling fans.
