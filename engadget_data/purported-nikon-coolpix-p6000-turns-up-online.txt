That includes a 13.5-megapixel sensor, a boost to ISO 6400, RAW image support, a new GPS module and, well, everything else you see listed above. Notably absent from that list, however, is any word of a price or release date, though we'd expect those details to be turning up before too long if this rumor does, in fact, turn out to be legit.
