The Xperia tipo dual (and its single-SIM version, the tipo) keep things small and simple, with a 3.2-inch 480 x 320 TFT screen and 800MHz Snapdragon processor. Both, however, will be running Ice Cream Sandwich out of the gate -- embarrassing Sony's bigger (presumably pricier) smartphones. The sub-100g (3.5-ounce) frame houses 3.2-megapixel camera and 2.5GB of user-accessible memory, expandable by microSD. A dedicated hardware key will switch the tipo dual between those SIMs, while you can also automate the phone to swap between them at different times of the day. There's no launch date or pricing yet, but you can take a video tour of both phones below.
