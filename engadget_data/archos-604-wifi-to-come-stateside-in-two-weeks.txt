Well, we're here to give you some happy news -- according to TechWeb, this bundle of sexiness will be released in US in the next fortnight. To review, the Archos 604 WiFi is loaded up with a 4.3-inch 480 x 272 touchscreen, a version of the Opera browser, and Windows file sharing; so gather up your cash over the next two weeks, as this will likely drop for something in the neighborhood of $500.
