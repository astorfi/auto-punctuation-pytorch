Between Vista's coming out, to a format-unifying Blu-ray / HD DVD hybrid player, to a, um, humble cellphone, we were all up in CES's and Macworld's grill. Not only to bring you, our wonderful, loyal readers the very latest scoops though, it was partly because honestly we just couldn't stay away -- not even for a second. It was a long, amazing week for the ravenous tech obsessed (don't you worry, it's not over yet since we'll be continuing to roll out the last of our coverage over the next couple days), but we really hope you feel like we delivered the goods. Either way, we'll see you next year -- and every day in between.Number of posts to Engadget Classic: 525 and counting... Number of posts to all Engadgets (including crossposts): 765 Number of lost gadgets: 1 Number of people who got sick: 0 (seriously!) Average hours slept nightly: 4 Number of casinos visited: 7 Amount of money lost gambling: $5 Average number of laptops per person: 1.42 Number of laptops that died: 1 Average number of cellphones per person: 1.2 Pounds of shwag thrown away: at least 30Individuals enjoying In N Out for the first time: 3 Maximum bandwidth used: over 6Gbps (and 500k hits per minute) during the Jobsnote Number of people that wrote in to tell us how much they loved our coverage: a lot! Thanks!
