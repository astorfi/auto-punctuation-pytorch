Looks like this accidentally leaked out a bit early, but Canon is introducing the Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT, a new
8.0 megapixel digital SLR that is supposed to be lighter and smaller than the original Canon Digital Rebel, have an
improved CMOS sensor, and be able to write images to its memory card 3.5 times faster.
