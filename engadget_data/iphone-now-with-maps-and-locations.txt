The new iPhone firmware features Google maps with location, up to 9 total home screens, Webclips, the ability to SMS multiple recipients, and more. That more being lyrics, subtitles, languages, chapters, in your iPod media. To customize a screen you just touch and hold the icon for a couple of seconds and it begins to "shake." Right, just like we saw in the video. Flicking your finger across the screen moves to the next screen. iPod touch users, it's all yours (minus the phone related apps, naturally) for $20. No, we're not kidding.
