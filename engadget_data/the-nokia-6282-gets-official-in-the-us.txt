Nokiaofficially announced a handful of new 3G handsets today. The slickest one of the bunch is the 6282, a slider-stylephone with GSM/EDGE 850/1800/1900MHz and UMTS 1900 (but not HSDPA!), a 2.2-inch, QVGA display, onemegapixel digital camera, integrated FM tuner, Bluetooth, and an miniSD memory card slot. Should be available earlynext year, almost definitely from Cingular.
