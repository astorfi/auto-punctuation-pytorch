 Don't get us wrong, we're happy and all to see those 45nm Penryn-based desktop processors on the loose. But our jones will only be slaked when the mobile versions of those high-powered (yet low-power consuming) beasts start hitting sockets. If DailyTech has it right, then our wait ends on January 6th. That's the date when Intel will supposedly release their 2.8GHz X9000 ($851), 2.6GHz T9500 ($530), and 2.5GHz T9300 ($316) CPUs with 6MB of L2 cache. Additionally, DT expects a 2.4GHz T8300 ($241) and 2.1GHz T8100 ($209) to pop only with the cache rolled back to 3MB. We expect to see the first machines running these chips at CES with at least one other possible public release coming on January 15th. Wink wink, nudge nudge.
