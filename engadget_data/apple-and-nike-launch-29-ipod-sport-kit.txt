 Maybe the third time's the charm. After rolling out branded MP3 players with Rio and Philips, Nike has now partnered with Apple for its next music-on-the-go solution. But instead of launching another Nike-branded player, the sneaker company is focusing on athletics by working with Apple to roll out the iPod Sport Kit, a $29 device that includes a sneaker-based sensor that combines with another sensor attached to the iPod to allow users to enter and view workout data using the iPod's menus. The iPod Sport Kit will only work with certain compatible shoes, including the new Nike Air Zoom Moire. Audio prompts can also be configured to provide workout info such as distance and time, and workout data can be uploaded to a Nike web site for analysis and comparison with other runners. The iPod Sport Kit is expected to be available within 60 days and will work with the iPod nano.
