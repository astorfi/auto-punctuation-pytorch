Starz Play has had a home on iOS since October, but now it's made the jump to Android, and it's brought Encore Play and Movieplex Play along with it. By wielding the apps, users can stream video from the TV network over WiFi and 3G -- provided they have a cable subscription with AT&T U-verse, Cox, DirecTV or Verizon. Comcast customers aren't entirely left out in the cold, however, as they can already catch content licensed from the television channel through the Xfinity website and apps. If you're ready to get your fill of Starz flicks, hit the bordering source links for the downloads.
