normal-looking SD card, but flip it over, pop off the cover, and it slips into any USB port just like that. We're not
sure why Sandisk hopes to cannibalize their own USB card reader market by putting everything into one package, but we
are definitely, definitely not complaining. Think we can get them to do this with
TransFlash or
MiniSD? No? Well, click on to see some more
pics.



 Flipped open to reveal USB contacts (well, kind of).Â 

  Inserted in a USB port. We are just so in love.
