Well, maybe this will: new shots out of The BlackBerry Zone suggest that Verizon sales reps are being actively trained on the Bold 9650, adding to a trail of evidence over the past month from a variety of sites that the phone is coming shortly. It certainly should, considering the relative importance of BlackBerrys in Verizon's lineup and the fact that Sprint now has it at retail, and it's still possible that documentation on CrackBerry last month pointing to a May 27 release -- that's this Thursday, for the record -- is accurate. We'll know soon enough, but in the meantime, treat those old trackballs with care, alright?

[Thanks, Steve]
