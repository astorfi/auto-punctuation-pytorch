 Wow. Judge Denise Cote certainly knows how to put a spring in the step of mega corporations. Mere days have passed since she ordered HarperCollins to let retailers to set their own e-book prices, and yet already Kindle bestsellers from that publisher are selling for around $9.99 -- in some cases that's $15 off the list price. Under the same settlement, Hachette Book Group and Simon & Schuster must also give retailers like Amazon greater flexibility over prices, so we may well see more lowered prices soon. The one place you won't find such discounts, however, is the iBookstore, since Apple has opted to fight the Justice Department and go to trial alongside Penguin and MacMillan next year.
