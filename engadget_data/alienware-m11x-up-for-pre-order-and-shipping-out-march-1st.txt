 Far be it for Japan to steal the Dell store's thunder, but the pre-order page for Alienware's M11x. The "not a netbook, not yet a gaming rig" is retaining its previously-heard $799 price tag, and with it comes a 1.3GHz Pentium SU4100, 1GB NVIDIA GeForce GT335M, 2GB of memory, and 160GB HDD. Wanting to customize? Turn that processor into a 1.3GHz Core 2 Duo SU7300 for $100, up the RAM to 8GB for $350, and swap the HDD with a 256GB SSD for $570. Mobile broadband is available via either Verizon or AT&T for another $125. It's all starting to add up mighty fast, but hey, at least it started small. Ship date is March 1st, which is just around the corner. You can be patient.
