Snapchat is reportedly one of the biggest media sharing services outside of Facebook, so it's only fitting that the service's iOS app just got an equally big update. The 5.0 revamp switches to a cleaner, swipe-driven control scheme that leaves more room for all those short-lived pictures. It's likewise possible to peek at profiles within the app, reply through a double-tap and send images to address book contacts. We don't know if the new Snapchat will be enough to make Facebook worry about its sharing supremacy -- again, that is -- but it's likely worth hitting the source link for the update.
