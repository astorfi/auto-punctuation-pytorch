The refreshed M17x can be augmented with the GeForce GTX 680M alongside an option for NVIDIA 3D Vision, while the M18x can sample the same Kepler delights in either single or dual-card SLI configurations. Both customization options are promised to arrive before the end of the month -- ready for all those games we've just seen at E3.
