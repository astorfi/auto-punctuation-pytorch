The folks who brought you the Androidify app have apparently enlisted a friend, his Android avatar, and a Kinect to bring you the above video. Not too shabby, but we'd be even more intrigued if he was rocking a black leotard and busting out Mexican Breakfast, Beyonce-style. Check out the not-so-Fosse video after the break.

[Thanks, John]
