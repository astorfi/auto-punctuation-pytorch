 Yahoo swallowed another company this morning, one toflesh out that Go TV home digital media effort of theirs. Just not the DVR company we'd all kind of hoped and idly thought it would be, TiVo. Nope, Yahoo now ownsMeedio, whose IP, technology, and staff are being folded into their Digital Home team. If you're a Meedio TV fan, steelyourself: according to Meedio, your EPG will be updated until July 1st, their support center is shuttering, anddownloading Meedio will no longer be possible. Which, we'd postulate, means it'll be a little while before you'll beable to get your Yahoo Go TV DVR ondownload. And since Yahoo bought the company and not the Meedio product line, what comes out the other end could windup looking, feeling, and working completely differently, totally ready and able to leverage all kinds of Yahoo mediafrom ten feet away. In the mean time, for those not wanting to run Windows (Media Center) or sign up for TiVo, you've still got options, like MythTV, BeyondTV, SageTV,ChrisTV, Freevo, ShowShifter, WinDVR, and so, so many others.[Via Zatz Not Funny, thanksRichard B]
