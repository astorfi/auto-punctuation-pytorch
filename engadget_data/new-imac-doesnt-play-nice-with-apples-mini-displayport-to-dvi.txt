That's because the system's exciting (but pricey) ability to be used as a standalone monitor only applies to devices equipped with their own Mini Display Port at the moment, which does limit your options quite a bit. Of course, it's almost certainly only a matter of time before Apple or a third-party manufacturer comes out with an adapter that does work, but we haven't heard anything firm on that front as of yet.
