ASUS was rather cryptic about this little peripheral with its "It'll move you" teaser, but now we get it. Dubbed the VivoMouse, ASUS claims this to be the world's first mouse-and-touchpad hybrid, and it's also wireless. One bonus feature here is that you can use it as a handheld remote with thumb control -- presumably the thumb stays on that circular trackpad with ASUS' iconic spin finish. We'll know more once we get our hands on this optical mouse in a moment, so keep an eye out for an update here.


Update: Hands-on gallery added below, and there's also a demo video after the break. The VivoMouse is actually slimmer than we expected, and when held in air, you can scroll pages by simply stroking along the lower edge of the circular trackpad. Other usual Windows 8 gestures are supported, including pinch-to-zoom, rotate, start menu toggle and sidebar toggle. The LED underneath the device uses blue light for better tracking as well. It's a pretty slick device, but hopefully it won't be too pricey, either.

Versatile VivoMouse works as a standalone touchpad and wireless remote, while the compact and elegant VivoPC integrates SonicMaster audio and 802.11ac Wi-Fi

Computex Taipei, Taiwan (3 June, 2013) â€“ ASUS today announced two new devices that bring innovative design to home entertainment - the VivoMouse wireless touchpad mouse and the ultra-compact VivoPC. VivoMouse is the world's first wireless mouse with an integrated multi-touch touchpad for full desktop and handheld control. VivoPC is a stylish and compact desktop PC that delivers high quality sound with exclusive SonicMaster audio and high-performance wireless networking thanks to 802.11ac Wi-Fi.

VivoMouse - new device category combines mouse, touchpad, and wireless remoteASUS VivoMouse is an entirely new kind of pointing device, thanks to its innovative combination of traditional desktop input and a wireless handheld remote for more casual PC control. VivoMouse can be used as a standard optical mouse that fits comfortably in the hand, but its top surface also incorporates a large circular touchpad with full support for Windows 8 multi-touch gestures.

The wide, flat design means VivoMouse can be used interchangeably as a mouse and desktop touchpad, making it ideal for Windows 8 PCs that lack a multi-touch display. However, its wireless PC connectionalso makes VivoMouse ideal for one-handed control away from the desktop, so it's also the perfect peripheral for a living room PC.

VivoPC - small and stylish home entertainmentVivoPC is a compact PC that's ideal for home productivity and entertainment applications. Just 56mm tall and with a footprint smaller than a sheet of A4 paper, VivoPC slips easily into the smallest of spaces, and has a stylish spun metal finish to complement both home offices and living rooms. VivoPC features ASUS SonicMaster audio technology for incredible sound quality with external speakers and high-performance 802.11ac Wi-Fi for smooth HD video streaming and seamless web browsing.

Despite its compact dimensions, VivoPC is also well-equipped when it comes to expandability. A sliding case cover gives quick access to the two internal memory slots and the drive bay can accommodate a 3.5-inch or 2.5-inch SATA 6Gbit/s hard drive.

AVAILABILITY & PRICINGASUS VivoMouse and VivoPC will be available in Q3 2013. Please contact your local ASUS representative for further information. Product images are available for download here.
