  It looks like AT&T is ready to uphold its end of the bargain. As promised, the GSM giant is poised to hand over spectrum to T-Mobile valued at $1 billion as a result of the proposed merger failing, and once again the FCC is the gatekeeper that holds the keys to the success of the transfer. According to the Wall Street Journal, the companies need permission from the Commission in order to make the handover work out according to plan, though we haven't seen a specific deadline set for the transition. We don't imagine the government will have quite the same concern with this particular transfer as it did with the entire merger itself, but we wonder if AT&T is secretly hoping -- for once -- that the FCC will say no.
