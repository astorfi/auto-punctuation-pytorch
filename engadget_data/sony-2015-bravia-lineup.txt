When visitors see your new Sony Bravia, the answer to their first question will be "4.9mm," because that's how thick these new TVs are at their thinnest point. If, however, your friends and lovers aren't impressed, then you might have to wheel out some other facts about your new home entertainment setup. The top-of-the-line XBR 900C 4K TVs come in 55-, 65- and 75-inch flavors, and gain a new X1 4K processor, which upgrades the picture quality of any 4K source and enhances the dynamic range and color.



          
 
 
 If your budget doesn't stretch that far, then you can grab one of the company's cheaper models, which also get a swanky 4K engine and a Triluminos display. All of the new TVs are equipped with PlayStation Now and run Android TV, enabling you to browse the internet and use voice search if you have a microphone-enabled remote control. These other models run from 43 all the way up to 75 inches, and will filter out into stores in the spring. There's no word on pricing, but we imagine that if you have to ask the price of a 75-inch 4K TV that's 4.9mm thick, you probably can't afford it.
