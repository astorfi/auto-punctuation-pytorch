 We don't know what all the issues are in getting Nokia and patent holding company Qualcomm to come to terms on a new CDMA / WCDMA licensing agreement to supersede the one expiring this April, but we'd like to see that go down soon so, you know, Nokia doesn't have to stop making phones or anything silly like that. The companies fortunately agree, suggesting that they may call in an independent third party to arbitrate their dispute. We suspect the impasse has something to do with Qualcomm's "give us more money" versus Nokia's "no," so the arbitrator should have the trivial job of working one up and one down a bit, right?
