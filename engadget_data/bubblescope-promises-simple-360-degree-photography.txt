Boasting a single megapixel sensor, the camera will let you capture 360x140 degree images at the press of a button, with 16MB of internal memory and an SD/MMC card slot at your disposal to store your panoramic creations. Otherwise, you'll get some standard camera features like a self-timer, tripod mount, and a six second voice recorder. Unfortunately, there's doesn't appear to be any word on what it'll cost, although it will apparently be available "soon."[Via Josh Spear]
