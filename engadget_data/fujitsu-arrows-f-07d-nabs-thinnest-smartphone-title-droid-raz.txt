No, this telephone is 6.7mm all the way along -- so svelte the brave boys at the FCC probably had to pop next door to borrow a ruler that measures things that small. The 109-gram device has a measly 4-inch 800 x 480 OLED display and a five megapixel camera, but you might have noticed that it's also quite thin. NTT DoCoMo's newest telephone also crams in a FOMA module, making it capable of HSPA-level 14Mb/s download speeds. Just be careful it doesn't blow away in the wind -- personally, we've always preferred smartphones that give us a little something to hold onto.
