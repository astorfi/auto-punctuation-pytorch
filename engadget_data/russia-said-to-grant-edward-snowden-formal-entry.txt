According to the Washington Post, Russia has decided to grant Edward Snowden permission to leave the Moscow airport. Though the NSA whistleblower has been offered asylum in Bolivia and Venezuela, he reportedly requested temporary asylum in the Eastern European country last week. While the Putin government didn't approve Snowden's application immediately, it's refused to hand him over to the U.S. since he arrived in Shremetyevo airport from Hong Kong on June 23rd. It's unclear if and when the country will approve the request, but Snowden's Russian lawyer said his client's unique legal situation would keep him in the transit zone for at least one more day. Stay tuned -- we'll be updating as more information becomes available.
