We got a chance to play with a pre-release unit today, and it works as advertised, serving simultaneous quadband GSM plus dualband UMTS (900 / 2100MHz HSPA) on the first SIM, and quadband GSM on the second. The 3.5-inch touchscreen was a little less responsive than we expected, probably on account of the prototype hardware. Otherwise, the device serves a decent mid-range Froyo experience in a friendly package. Sadly, Viewsonic was mum on pricing and availability. Take a look at our gallery and follow the break for a hands-on video.
