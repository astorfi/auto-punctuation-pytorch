"I don't know if they can't make up their mind or what the problem is over there, but the last time I checked, you don't need two client operating systems. It's good to have one." Snap. Of course, Microsoft is shipping six different Windows 7 SKUs, can't quite get rid of XP, and sells Windows Mobile, Windows CE, and Zune in the handheld space, but the man's got a point -- the real question is whether he's smiling or just baring his teeth in rage.
