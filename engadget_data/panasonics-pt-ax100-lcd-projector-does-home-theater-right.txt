For its $2,199 asking price you can get yourself a bit of 720p 16:9 action, with 2000 ANSI Lumens, and a 6000:1 contrast ratio. Those specs, especially the lumens, give the projector a good leg up for its price range, and the HDMI port keeps it real for HD home theater use. We should be seeing this one in October.[Via AboutProjectors]
