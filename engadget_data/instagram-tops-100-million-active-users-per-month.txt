 Instagram started reporting its active user base in what many saw as an attempt to quell talk of an exodus following its terms of service debacle. It has a better reason to post hard numbers today, however: there's now a neat, tidy 100 million active Instagram users every month. The milestone suggests that another 10 million mobile photographers got hooked on square-shaped photography in about five weeks, and it implies that the Facebook-owned company isn't about to slow down just yet. Not that everyone is in a position to join the party, mind you.
