We had a feeling Nintendo was going to announce something called "Mario Maker," a game that allows you to create your own levels in Super Mario Brothers -- after all, Nintendo Enthusiast found a poster for the damn thing in the company's E3 booth. Indeed, Nintendo just teased it in a press event, though it only provided a scant few details. In a series of screenshots, we saw someone creating custom levels, with the help of the Wii U's included stylus. Though you can design the level using old-school 8-bit graphics, as in the screenshot above, you can also go with the sort of modern look found in Mario's newer titles. No word on exact release date, except that it will hit North America and Europe sometime in 2015.
