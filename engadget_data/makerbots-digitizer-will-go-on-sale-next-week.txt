With UPS' incoming 3D printing service and the growing availability of consumer-ready kits, printing objects is easier than ever, assuming you actually have something ready to print. If not, don't fret --MakerBot is on the case, announcing today that its upcoming Digitizer will be available for sale next week. The company hasn't yet put a price on 3D scanning, but the device (seen above) is quite a bit cleaner than the prototype MakerBot trotted out at South by Southwest. "It's the easiest, fastest way for anyone to create 3D models," boasts the product's announcement email (seen after the break). "We optimized the whole process to work perfectly with MakerBot's Replicator Desktop 3D printers."


Scanned objects can be resized, edited and uploaded to Thingiverse, and will be saved as a standard 3D design file compatible with third-party modeling programs. Now, if you'll excuse us, we have some crew members to replicate.
