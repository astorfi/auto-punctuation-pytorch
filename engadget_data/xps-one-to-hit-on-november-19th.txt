More importantly, the video also features a launch date: November 19th. Of course, by then we'll have probably already purchased, hacked, upgraded and sold a half dozen of these things, but we promise to still pretend to be surprised.Update: Now that a couple commenters have mentioned it, the video's backing track does sound awfully familiar -- anyone know which exact GarageBand loop it is?Update 2: It's "Contemplative Synth 01." At least Dell bought a Jam Pack, eh?[Thanks, James]
