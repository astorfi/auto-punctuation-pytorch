This innocent-looking plushie seems like a nice
soft toy you could buy your newborn nephew. But oh, how wrong you are. Bring it home and a
creepy spy emerges, designed to harrass you out of bed when you sleep late. The Japanese Tomy Sleep
Watch Doll has six sensors, can say 1,200 sentences and after learning its owners sleeping habits, irritates the
crap out you when you change your sleeping times. Why anyone would inflict this pain upon
themselves, we'll never know, but we suggest sticking with your trusty old alarm clock.
