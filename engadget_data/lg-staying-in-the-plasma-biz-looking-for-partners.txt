       Just in case you were wondering, LG is planning to stay in the plasma business, although as is the trend, its looking for a partner to invest in the business. Despite losses last year, it sees the plasma business as profitable, and about to pick up ahead of the Olympics this summer. In LCD news, its not picking up the shares in LG Display recently shed by Philips. It's good to know the plasma business will continue to have healthy competition, in fact, if Pioneer still needs someone to share the secrets of its Kuro technology with, then LG might make a good partn...on second thought, maybe that's not such a good idea.
