       In Warner's press release stating they'd go Blu-ray exclusive, they also indicated that HD DVD titles would not be released day and date with Blu-ray titles. During the conference call after the release, someone asked what the delay would be and at the time Warner said they were still working out the details. Well, Format War Central noticed that Amazon is showing a three week delay for Warner's new title The Invasion. It doesn't seem like too much of a jump to assume that this will be the policy moving forward, but we've contacted Warner for confirmation, so stay tuned.**UPDATE** Warner has responded and says the delay might vary depending on the title and that it provides retailers a chance to educate consumers about Warner's decision to go Blu-ray exclusive.
