Fret not, as Missing Remote has spent some quality time with a trio of apps: MyNetflix, vmcNetFlix and NetflixMC. The entire trio brings Netflix "Watch Now" content to Media Center Extenders, and reviewers tested each one on performance / usability, features and overall impressions. We're not going to spoil anything, so give that read link some love and see which fits you best.
