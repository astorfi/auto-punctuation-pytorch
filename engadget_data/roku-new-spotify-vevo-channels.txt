 Roku's music cred increased twofold today. First up was news that a Vevo channel is coming to the set-top box, bringing video and music streaming along with its recommendations service. Users will be able to sync their Vevo accounts to access saved videos and playlists. The (extra-sweet) cherry on top: Spotify will be coming to Roku 2 players as well as the Roku Streaming Stick for users in the US, UK and Ireland, with support for the Roku LT and the new Roku HD coming in early 2013. Not enough new goodies for you? Roku's Android and iOS apps just received some minor yet nifty updates, including new controls (such as shuffle and repeat) for music in the Play on Roku feature.
