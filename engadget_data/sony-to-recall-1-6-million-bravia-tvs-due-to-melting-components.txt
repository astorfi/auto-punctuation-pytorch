	A vast number of Bravia LCD TVs dating from 2007 and 2008 will be recalled after components in some Japanese sets went into meltdown and started smoking. So far only eleven incidents have been reported and it looks like no one has been hurt or experienced any wider damage, but Sony says it wants to take back 1.6 million TVs that were sold in the US, Europe, Japan and elsewhere. No word on exactly which models are affected, but we're expecting further details from Sony imminently.

Update: Looks like this might not be a full recall after all. We can't access Sony's support site right now, but the BBC reports that UK owners of the following models can summon an engineer to inspect their set if they're worried: KDL-40D3400, KDL-40D3500, KDL-40D3550, KDL-40D3660, KDL-40V3000, KDL-40W3000, KDL-40X3000, KDL-40X3500.




Update 2: Check after the break for US recall information.
