Fast forward a few months, and here we have the formal (re)introduction of the ClarionMiND. Definitely dubbed a MID, this Atom-powered handheld is currently scheduled for release in US / Canada this November, while Europeans will have to wait until January 2009. Outside of the oh-so-fresh CPU, you'll find a 4.8-inch (800 x 480 resolution) display, 512MB of RAM, a 4GB SSD, 802.11b/g WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, a SiRFstarIII GPS module and a rechargeable Li-ion good for two hours (four hours with the optional extended cell). You'll also get a pair of USB 2.0 ports, a microSD card slot and optional real-time traffic support. The just described "standard" model will demand $649.99; the way-more-delicious Premium version doesn't yet have a price, but it should be out next Spring with integrated 3G.[Via Pocketables]
