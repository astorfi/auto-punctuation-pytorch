Real like packaging. Of course, while the box is nothing more than a black version of the existing Wii packaging, we have to agree with our pals at Joystiq and say that it only makes the system all that more intriguing. Unfortunately, there's still no word on a release 'round here, but we assume / hope that's only a matter of time considering the reception this thing has received.
