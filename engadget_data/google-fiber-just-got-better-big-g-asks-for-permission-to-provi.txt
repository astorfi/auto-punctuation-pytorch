Turns out, Google Fiber may be bringing more than just web access, as the company has asked the state of Missouri to allow it to deliver video services as well. We first heard about Big G's possible foray into pay-TV late last year, as the company was in talks with various content providers to see if it could make it happen. Given this official move towards becoming a video provider in America's heartland, we'd say those conversations must have gone fairly well. Either that, or the folks in Kansas City will be watching a whole lot of YouTube's new niche content.
