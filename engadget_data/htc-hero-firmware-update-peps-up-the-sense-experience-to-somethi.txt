Seeing as this was the number one gripe with the overall excellent UI, we're incredibly glad HTC has gotten work on this, and we'll be spending some more time with the device to return our newly tinted impressions. There's a video after the break demonstrating changes, and most actions seems quite a bit quicker and smoother, all the way down to opening and closing the apps menu, and sliding between home screens. The update doesn't really include much else in the way of features, but since it's addressing the main pain point of the phone, we sure don't mind -- and neither will Sprint users, who we suppose will be getting this newly improved interface right out of the gate.
