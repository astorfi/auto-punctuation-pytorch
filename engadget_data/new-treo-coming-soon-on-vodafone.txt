First, we know that Palm's done with the 650 in Europe. Second, we know that it won't be a CDMA 700w, it'll have to be GSM. Third, they're saying the device will be "using Vodafone's high-speed network." We'll let you draw your own conclusions, but we're thinking antenna-free UMTS version of the 700w.[Via CoolSmartPhone]
