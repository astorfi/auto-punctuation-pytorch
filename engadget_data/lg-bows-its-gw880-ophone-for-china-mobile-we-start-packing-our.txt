Rumors of an LG entry back in August have now come to fruition in the form of the GW880, a full touch handset launching this month featuring a solid 3.5-inch WVGA display, 5 megapixel camera, and support for a pair of pretty important homegrown standards -- TD-SCDMA for 3G and CMMB for mobile TV tuning. For comparison, LG's only other announced Android phone -- the GW620 Eve for global distribution -- steps down to a HVGA display, so yeah, if you'll excuse us, we've got a Mandarin lesson in a couple minutes.
