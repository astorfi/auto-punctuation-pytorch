Sony's HDR-HC1 — the company's smallest and most affordable HD camcorder — is about to hit the street (er, not
literally, we hope), and the lucky devils at Camcorderinfo.com got their mitts on a review unit. What did they think of
the $1,700 (street) camcorder? With specs that include 1080i recording, a 2.7-inch touchscreen LCD, image stabilization
and a Zeiss lens, Camcorderinfo.com declared that "the HDR-HC1 is poised to be a big seller, not only because it is the
most affordable HDV personal video device yet to hit the market. Behind its HDV logo is a camcorder with an amazingly
crisp image and performance in many conditions that lives up to this new technology's name." Guess that means they
liked it.
