  Pioneer's much anticipated 50-inch Elite PureVision PRO-FHD1 1080p plasma is now shipping to retailers, they announced yesterday. Complete with 2,073,600 .576 mm-sized pixels and a high quality scaler this is the first 50-inch 1080p plasma screen on the market. The MSRP of $10,000 (retail around $8,000) comes in at around twice the price of the merely 1080p-compatible PDP-5070HD 1366x768 HDTV. Also unlike its value-priced cousin, this doesn't come with any tuners, just the (beautiful) screen with 3000:1 contrast ratio, and 1000cd/m2 peak brightness as well as two HDMI rear inputs, one DVI and one component input. They're touting the effect of all that pixel density as creating a near-3D effect that you just can't get with other TVs, and even without one here to view, we're almost inclined to believe them.Do you think all those extra pixels and true-1080p display for your Blu-ray (or HD DVD) and other high definition content are worth the extra cost?
