Digital Storm's mostly known for its many desktop gaming rigs, but it dabbles in laptops, too. Its latest portable offering, the VELOCE, comes packing a 13.3-inch, 1920 x 1080 display, a quad-core Haswell Core i7 4800MQ CPU and NVIDIA GTX 765M graphics. It's also got 8GB of RAM and 2GB of graphics memory along with three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, VGA out, and Bluetooth 4.0. Storage comes in the form of a hybrid drive comprised of a 7,200RPM 750GB HDD and an 8GB SATA SSD. All that hardware tips the scales at 4.6 pounds and is 1.26 inches thick -- sizing right in line with its 14-inch competition from MSI, but roughly twice the girth and a half-pound heavier than a Razer Blade. Regardless, those yearning for a VELOCE of their own can grab one at Digital Storm's website should they be willing to part with $1,535 come July 17th.
