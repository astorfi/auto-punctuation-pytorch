When BT purchased nearly Â£200 million worth of 4G spectrum, the prevailing opinion was that it would remain a behind-the-scenes player. CEO Ian Livingston, however, might have grander aspirations for his company's 2.6GHz property. In an interview with The Telegraph, he said that it was "highly possible" that we'd see BT-branded 4G SIM cards next year, bundled along with the company's TV and broadband services. He also spoke of upgrading existing BT WiFi hotspots to provide 4G access, which would reduce the cost of 4G compared to its premium-priced rivals.
