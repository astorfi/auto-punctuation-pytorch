Let's get started: the Droid RAZR M 4G LTE, as Big Red is planning to call it, will sport a 4.3-inch qHD (960 x 540) Super AMOLED Advanced display -- this will likely be the same ColorBoost panel we recently saw on Sprint's Photon Q -- as well as a dual-core Qualcomm MSM8960 Snapdragon S4 processor, 1GB RAM, 8MP rear camera capable of taking 1080p video, a 3MP (yes, three) front-facing shooter, full GSM / UMTS / HSPA+ global roaming and 8GB internal storage with microSD support. Additionally, the RAZR M will offer NFC, Android 4.0 with a virtual row of navigation keys (much like the Atrix HD and Photon Q) and will weigh 4.44 ounces. Gorilla Glass 2 protects the display from scratches, while the back offers the same kind of Kevlar seen on the Droid RAZR and RAZR Maxx. At 8.38mm deep, its thickness appears to be right in between the two aforementioned phones. So that takes care of the mystery behind this particular smartphone, and it's quite likely we'll be getting some quality hands-on time with it alongside the RAZR HD at Moto's September 5th event. Check out the goods in the gallery below.

 Note: Several commenters have observed that a watermark is blurred out on the image above (as well as one of the gallery shots). These marks reveal personal employee information and have been blurred to protect the identity of the tipster. Several of our gallery shots, however, do not feature these marks.
