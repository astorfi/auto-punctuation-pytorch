While the original BlackJack could be seen as a revolutionary device for the carrier (it was AT&T's answer to the Q, after all), its successor is clearly destined to be an evolutionary upgrade; yeah, the GPS is great, but Windows Mobile 6 and 3G are both totally mandatory in new smartphones hitting the market at this point. From our brief impression, the new keyboard seems like a key improvement over the BlackJack's testy pad, there's a larger battery in store (no more high capacity kit needed for a full day of use), and the jog wheel, glossy shell, and choice of colors all give it a softer, more consumer-friendly look. Samsung tells us we can expect it for about $150 in time for the holidays. Click on for more shots!
