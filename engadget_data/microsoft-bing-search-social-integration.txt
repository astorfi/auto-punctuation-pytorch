Adding to the Linked tweaks we'd previously seen, Microsoft's now making Bing more social -- at least in the US of A. The most recent changes bring a Metro-driven interface to the homepage, which boasts that Microsoft "three column design" we laid eyes on earlier this month. Naturally, the revamp will open the doors to improved search results, but this, of course, will depend heavily on if you're up to linking your Facebook, Twitter or other social network accounts with Bing. That said, something tells us you're definitely up to it.
