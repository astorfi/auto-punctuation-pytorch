Unfortunate name for this portable device, but some of the specs are interesting â€” particularly the TV tuner and the
ability to record video from it. Other features of this do-it-all device include a built-in speaker, SD slots, built-in
antenna, jack for hooking in a more powerful antenna to improve reception, and support for MP3, MPEG4 and JPG. Video
can also be recorded from other sources, as well, using the AV-inputs on the unit. Codec support is generally weak, and
there's really no other information yet about this device, but the TV reception bit still sounds at least iOK.
