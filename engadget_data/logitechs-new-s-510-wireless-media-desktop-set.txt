The crew at Logitech aren't amateurs when it comes to
wireless desktop sets
andÂ media remotes, areas of
expertise they've combined into a single bundle with their new S 510 wireless desktop. No Bluetooth here (sorry, 27MHz
proprietary wireless), but the remote has the same WinAmp, Windows Media Player, iTunes, and Musicmatch playback
control as you've come to expect, and the usual slew of multimedia-centric keys. Expect it to set you back a hundred if
you get the full set, or eighty for the version without the remote (and receiver).
