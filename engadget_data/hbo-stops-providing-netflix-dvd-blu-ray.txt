 Netflix has made no bones about the fact that it's competing (hard) with HBO, and it seems that the sentiment is the same on the other side. According to CNET, HBO has stopped providing Netflix with DVDs of its shows. Of course, the freedom to purchase from other legitimate resellers has enabled Netflix to keep the discs flying, but it's no longer able to source 'em directly from the Box Office's warehouse. The deal supposedly went into effect at the start of this year, but it's unlikely that you'll ever notice; as the story goes, Netflix will have to pay slightly more to procure them elsewhere, but it's mostly a symbolic move by HBO to ruffle the feathers of Reed Hastings and co. Oh, and if you thought the same luxuries found in HBO Go would ever find its way to Netflix's streaming department, we'd ask that you share a little of your optimism with the rest of the world.
