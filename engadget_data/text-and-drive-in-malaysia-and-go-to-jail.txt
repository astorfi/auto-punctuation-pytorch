 If you're in Malaysia and youplan on spending any time behind the wheel, you'd better curb any temptation to read or send text messages while on theroad. Declaring that "using the SMS while driving is more dangerous than talking on the handphone," governmentofficials have mandated jail time for DWT. Having seen more than our share of distracted drivers, we'd have to agree --even if we have a soft sport for our fans inMalaysia.
