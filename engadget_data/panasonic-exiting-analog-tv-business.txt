  This may not be as a big a deal as KonicaMinolta completely exiting the camerabusiness, but Matsushita Electric (aka Panasonic) has apparently decided that it's ready to completely transitionits TV business to digital, and has decided to get out of the analog TV space this year. What makes the timingparticularly interesting is the fact that Panasonic still has a somewhat thriving analog business; according toreports, 30% of the company's TV sales in its home market are analog. However, margins are likely much lower on thosesets than on digital ones, and it looks like Panny has decided to call it quits before that percentage declines evenfurther. (Besides, if you had to choose between making old-school CRTs and 103-inchplasmas, which would you pick?)
