Twitter has always been a great place to discuss hard-hitting news (like Miley Cyrus' puzzling evolution), but following conversations can feel a bit like a mining expedition. The company has taken note, and a new update to the website, iOS and Android apps -- available today -- makes engaging in conversations on Twitter a much more intuitive process. Now, the first tweet in a chain will show up on your timeline above the replies, allowing you to read the conversation in chronological order. Up to two subsequent related tweets will be connected to the first by a vertical blue line; for lengthy conversations, you can continue reading with a simple tap. To learn more, check out Twitter's video after the break.
