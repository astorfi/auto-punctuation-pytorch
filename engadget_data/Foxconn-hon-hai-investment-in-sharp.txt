 Foxconn's parent, Hon Hai Precision Industry, partnered up with Sharp earlier this year, taking a stake in Sharp's Sakai LCD manufacturing plant and investing another $850 million in the company. Unfortunately, that latter investment deal is in danger of dissolving due to Sharp's financial troubles. The Wall Street Journal reports that Sharp's shares have fallen enough in the months since the aforementioned agreement was consummated in March -- due to flagging sales and excess inventory -- that Sharp's given Hon Hai the option to back out of the deal. However, Hon Hai's still interested in buying ten percent of the Japanese company, and has expressed an interest in renegotiating the terms of the investment. So, it seems we'll have to wait and see if Sharp accepts Hon Hai's continued advances, but you can read more about the company's financial woes right now at the source below.
