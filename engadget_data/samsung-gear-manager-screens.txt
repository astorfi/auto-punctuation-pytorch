Samsung already said that its Galaxy Gear smartwatch would launch on September 4th, but that doesn't mean the leaks are over. Far from it -- @evleaks just posted screenshots of Gear Manager, the smartphone app that will oversee Samsung's wristwear. The images mostly corroborate details from past rumors, such as the SM-V700 model number, app support and NFC pairing. There are a couple of surprises, however. One shot mentions a "find my watch" tool, and another shows an abstracted representation of the Galaxy Gear itself -- don't read too much into that last picture, though. While we'd rather see the real smartwatch, this new leak may tide us over until the official Galaxy Gear unveiling next week.
