The version offered up to Uncle Sam carries a 850 / 1900 GSM radio, 3G connectivity through 850 / 1900 WCDMA frequencies and support for LTE Band 5. Since AT&T's main LTE squeeze is Band 17, what we're seeing here is an international version of Samsung's flagship that can roam portions of Ma Bell's and Magenta's network when it sets foot in the US. Folks waiting for a GS4 outfitted for an American carrier will have to wait 'till at least the end of April, but we'll keep our eyes peeled for such a device visiting the FCC.
