 When glancing through last year's HD NFL schedule, there were still quite a few games that sadly didn't get the HD treatment it rightfully deserved, but in news that's sure to make those who just endured the painstaking NFL Draft a bit more jovial, that won't be the case in 2007 (or beyond). According to a snippet at SignOnSanDiego, CBS will reportedly be offering up "five or six games per week this season in high-definition, up from three a year ago." Additionally, the NFL has also declared that "all games must be shown in HD starting in 2008," which means that you can finally stop biting your nails about whether your team's matchup will be shot in HD. Four months and counting, folks.
