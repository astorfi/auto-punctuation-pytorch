 Now that the PlayStation 3 will be BD-Live capable, Sony Pictures also announced this morning it's releasing its first two Blu-ray discs with the technology. On April 8, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story and The 6th Day will both be released with exclusive downloadable content that will not be available on disc. According to the press release, this is just a preview of what's possible with Blu-ray technology, although any non-PS3 Blu-ray owners might wonder what's so good it couldn't fit on the 2-disc Dewey Cox set.
