What exactly this rebadged Nokia C7 is supposed to astound us with, we're not really sure. We've seen its Clear Black Display already, which is very nice, but we've also seen the dead OS walking that is its Symbian installation. Still, for $80 on contract, it doesn't necessarily have to compete with the cr√®me de la Gingerbread to be an appealing option. Look out for it early next month, waving the Magenta flag with pride.
