Well to save you the hassle of quitting your job in order to wait by the mailbox every day, we're here to let you know that the feds will begin mailing 'em out starting on February 17th -- exactly one year prior to the scheduled analog shutoff. Just remember, as Engadget HD noted yesterday, those of you with early, tuner-less HDTVs looking for a few bucks off a digital receiver will be out of luck, making your seven-year wait for these coupons seem a little silly now, eh?
