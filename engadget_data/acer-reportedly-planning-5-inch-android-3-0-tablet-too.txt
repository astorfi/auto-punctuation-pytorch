DigiTimes is now reporting that the company is also prepping a 5-inch tablet which, like the others, will be based on Android 3.0 and will roll out sometime in the first quarter of 2011. Of particular note here is that the 5-inch model will reportedly boast both "handset and tablet PC functionality," which would pit it up against the likes of the Dell Streak. Details otherwise still seem to be pretty up in the air for all three, though -- in fact, DigiTimes says that Acer is still deciding between Qualcomm's Snapdragon and NVIDIA's Tegra 2, and that it will even release an Intel-based Windows 7 model before the Android tablets in order to "test the water in the market."
