 Canon's been known to leak an upcoming model or five in website descriptions, UPC codes, certification lists, and driver downloads, so pardon us if we're not too shocked that references to a "Rebel XS / 1000D" have popped up in the latest version of the company's RAW conversion utility. Of course, there aren't any specs or pictures, but based on Canon's naming scheme, we'd hazard that it'll be a lower-end version of the Rebel XSi, replacing the now somewhat-outdated Rebel XT. Of course, that's purely conjecture, but based on Canon's track record with these leaks, we'll know for sure soon enough.[Via 1000 Noisy Cameras]
