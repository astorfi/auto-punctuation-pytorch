The tablet-and-voice-controlled unit can open your curtains, fetch items and even pick up after you, thanks to its single telescopic arm that stretches up to 2.5 feet. A tablet slot on top of its head lets you use the hardware as a telepresence device, although we're more interested in teaching it some attitude so we can live out our "sassy housekeeper" sitcom fantasies in peace.
