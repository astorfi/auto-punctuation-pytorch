 So, you probably didn't even get the cellophane off your Xperia Tablet S yet (for those in the UK at least), but Sony has already beaten the likes of iFixit to the strip-down post. It's one of the firm's own engineers, Takuya Inaba, who takes a knife to the minty-fresh tablet -- revealing its NVIDIA innards for all to see. Of course, we could tell you all about how he opened up the tablet, removing 10 screws, and breaking the splash-proof internal seal, but we gather you'd probably rather see the deed for yourselves. Full gory video after the break, but just remember, don't try this at home or you might as well tear up that warranty, too.
