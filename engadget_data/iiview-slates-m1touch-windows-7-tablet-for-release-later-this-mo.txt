Teased here beside two of Apple's most well-known cash cows, the M1Touch packs a rather delicious list of specifications. Behind the 10.1 multitouch display (1,024 x 600) is a 1.66GHz Atom N450 processor, 2GB of RAM, a 250GB hard drive, integrated webcam, USB socket, 4-in-1 card reader and an inbuilt accelerometer. She's running Windows 7 Home Premium and should last around three hours (sad, we know) on a full charge, with pricing set for just over $500 when converted to Greenbacks. Further details are few and far between, but given that it's expected to ship by the end of May, we suspect we'll know more as Computex kicks off in Taiwan.
