Seiko Epson has been promising they'd be rocking the
e-paper, and they've finally put out. It isn't exactly the foldable, electronic newspaper of the future, but it's at
least something unique in the arena of timepieces. They partnered with the Seiko Watch corporate division to develop a
wristwatch whose display, made of e-paper, shows a constantly changing mosaic pattern along with the conventional time
display. Seiko Epson hooked up with the E Ink corporation in the US to develop the display, which combines E Ink's
electrophoretic paper with Seiko's driver interface to produce a monochrome display with a contrast ratio of 10:1. Look
for units to roll out to the public in Japan sometime this year.
