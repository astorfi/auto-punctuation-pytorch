Not only is that true, but it's also going to be in 26 more thin and light systems. Frankly, we're not all that surprised, particularly since it's been no huge secret that AMD's had a bunch of new processors floating about -- some of which have been finding homes in new HP, Lenovo, Acer, and Dell laptops. Thankfully, the silicon heavyweight is finally revealing the source of all this mojo by sharing details about these mighty, yet energy efficient slabs of silicon. Up first is the Ultrathin platform (codenamed "Nile"), which now includes the new 23w Turion II Neo dual-core, Athlon II Neo dual-core, and Athlon II Neo processors -- there's clock speed and TDP specifics of each in the gallery, if that's your sort of thing. To be found in 11- to 13- inch laptops like HP's dm1 and Acer's Aspire One 721, the CPUs can be coupled with ATI Radeon HD 5400 or Radeon 4200 integrated graphics options, not to mention DDR3 and Direct X 10.1 support. The biggest change? Apparently, the line up has been improved in terms of battery life and thermals, and AMD's promising over eight hours of usage when fully charged. Given that battery life and heat were our biggest issues with the previous Neo processors, we're happy to see those problem areas being addressed, but we'll believe it when we really test some of these bad boys in the near future. 

On the mainstream side of things, AMD continues to cram desktop power into its Athlon II dual-core, Athlon Turion II dual-core, Phenom II dual-, triple- and quad-core processors. There's 12 new chips in all, but the top of the line 2.3GHz quad-core Phenom II Black Edition X920 is definitely the most juicy, and should give some Core i7 rigs a run for their money. Obviously those powerful CPUs can all be paired with ATI's Radeon HD 4500 or higher discrete graphics (which will support Direct X11) or a lower-end Radeon 4200 integrated graphics option. Because AMD now likes to use simple terms with its Vision branding, it didn't provide any hard benchmark numbers, but it promises 80 percent smoother gaming performance than comparable competitive mainstream systems, and 30 percent longer battery life than AMD's previous generation of processors. Hit the break for the full presser, and click on through the gallery for a closer look at the technical details.

Ahead of the biggest buying cycle of the year, the new notebook platforms offer up to eight hours of battery life while delivering an outstanding visual experience at a great price for the mainstream and ultrathin markets.[iii]"With VISION Technology from AMD, we are finally connecting how people use their PCs with the way people purchase them," said Nigel Dessau, senior vice president and chief marketing officer of AMD. "Today, after little more than 200 days in market, our partners are introducing more VISION-based PCs than ever before; a testament to both the competitiveness of AMD platform technology and the simplified marketing approach."Introduced in October 2009, VISION Technology from AMD simplifies the PC buying process at the point of sale by focusing on how consumers use PCs, rather than relying upon the confusing "speeds and feeds" technical specifications that many people find difficult to understand. VISION also denotes the powerful visual experience AMD systems enable; an important feature as more consumers use their computers as entertainment hubs for sharing photos, music and videos with friends and family, watching TV and HD videos, and playing games.AMD 2010 Mainstream and Ultrathin Notebook PlatformsIn 2009, 96 million people worldwide bought PCs for entertainment purposes.[iv] The AMD 2010 Mainstream Notebook Platform lets consumers enjoy their movies, music and games in stunning color and clarity, seamlessly connect with friends on social networks, and edit videos and photos. The 2010 Ultrathin Notebook Platform makes it possible for consumers to enjoy a full-featured PC experience, including HD playback, in sleek and affordable notebooks that can deliver up to eight hours of battery life. Examples of the benefits the platforms provide to consumers include the following: In testing with HQV 2.0, a VISION-based system with AMD integrated graphics achieved a video experience score almost 2x that of a comparable Intel-based system. Additionally, a VISION-based system with AMD discrete graphics scored 50% better than a comparable Intel-based system with Nvidia discrete graphics.
