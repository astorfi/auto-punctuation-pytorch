Reader Jesse King got his hands on the new Cingular
version of the Audiovox SMT 5600, and was kind enough to send us a few pics of his new baby. Not surprisingly, it
looks almost exactly like the old AT&T Wireless version of the SMT 5600, even down to the lack of carrier branding
on the phone itself (even though the handset depicted on the SMT 5600's box does sport a Cingular logo on its casing).
Not that we mind a phone coming with less branding on it or anythingâ€¦
