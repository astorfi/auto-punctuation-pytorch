Americans no longer have to splurge on the high-end Galaxy Tab Pro or Note Pro if they want a modern Samsung tablet -- the more affordable Galaxy Tab 4 range is headed to the US. WiFi versions of the Tab 4 7.0, 8.0 and 10.1 should hit shelves on May 1st at respective prices of $200, $270 and $350. Travelers craving cellular data can expect LTE variants from AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon sometime this summer. Pricing hasn't surfaced for these 4G models, but it's safe to presume that they'll carry a premium over their WiFi-only counterparts.



          
 
 
 The devices don't carry the biggest bang for the buck. The Nexus 7 offers a sharper display and overall faster performance, for example. However, the two largest Tab 4 WiFi models cost significantly less than their Tab 3 equivalents did when new -- they're potentially good bargains if you're not concerned about raw performance.
