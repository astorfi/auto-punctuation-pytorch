CBS is giving football fans that won't be six hot wings deep and glued to a couch this Sunday a few more ways to catch its AFC coverage of the NFL playoffs. Starting January 5th, the broadcaster's online portal, CBSSports.com, will begin streaming the AFC wildcard game between the San Diego Chargers and Cincinnati Bengals. It's the first of four AFC games CBS plans to make available online, a lineup that includes two divisional games and the conference championship. So those of you that need to catch the playoffs on the go now have even more flexibility with how you watch --- and even more screens to cover in hot sauce and grease.
