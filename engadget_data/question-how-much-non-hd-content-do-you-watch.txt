 One of our writers, Ben Drawbaugh, has been gone on record numerous times during our weekly podcast saying he doesn't watch something if it isn't in HD. (period) Now we were wondering about how much non-HD content you watch. Sure there are some great show in HD but there are also some amazing shows that are not. Scrubs (up until the last episode), any F/X show (Nip/Tuck, The Shield, Rescue Me), The Simpsons, Myth Busters and Survivor. Are you as vain as Ben? Or do you sit back and enjoy the show (Surviver is a bad example for that one) even though it is only 480i/p. I know I sure do.
