music gear that's coming out these days. Last Saturday it was
Astrasound's Polyvox duophonic synth and ESCO-100
tape-delay unit, this week it's Jazz Mutant's Lemur:

It has a pungent whiff of vaporware hanging around it, but the most interesting thing I've seen this week is the
appallingly named 'Lemur', from the really appallingly named French startup
'Jazz Mutant'. It's a 12-inch touchscreen monitor with an embedded CPU
/ graphics chip and an ethernet port. Plug the screen into a laptop and it becomes a control panel displaying movable
faders, buttons and keyboards for live tweaking of music software. So far, so much like any design student's final year
project. Then, you watch the video
clips on the site. They're tiny and dark,
and you can't hear the music that's being tweaked, but they're amazing. The interface looks great and seems really
responsive. We can dream, right? Click to read on.



  So who are ?Mutant Jazz?? They?re three music geeks from Bordeaux, who work withScrime, a music research lab attached to the University. TheFrench can?t get enough of experimental music. Underneath the Pompidou Centre in Paris isIRCAM, a huge government-funded music research lab that?s been theresince 1977. That?s where MAX/MSP, the musicultra-geek?s programming language of choice, was developed (it?s now used by Aphex Twin and Autechre). So, the Lemurlooks interesting, but we?ll probably have to wait for Roland or Korg to steal the idea before it gets anywhere nearGuitar Center.  [Thanks to Tommy Walker III for the tip]
