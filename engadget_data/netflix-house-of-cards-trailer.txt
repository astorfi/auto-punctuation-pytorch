 We're still a few months away from the debut of Netflix's new series House of Cards, but the streaming company has posted a trailer on its service and on YouTube giving us an early peek. You can check it out after the break, or head to the Netflix site and see the new page it's whipped up to promote the show that's accessible whether or not you subscribe to the service. That's also where it plans to add behind the scenes content, reviews and other promo material as the February 1st launch approaches. The trailer is brief, but the style and everything we can see of star Kevin Spacey as Congressman Francis Underwood has the feel of a high quality production. This path is already well worn by AMC, HBO, Showtime and others trying pump up value by adding exclusive new shows (Lilyhammer also aired on Norwegian TV) on top of existing catalog movie offerings. We'll see if the critics and subscribers put it on a par with shows like Game of Thrones, Mad Men, Dexter or Breaking Bad, and how viewers react to Netflix's strategy of making all the episodes available at once.
