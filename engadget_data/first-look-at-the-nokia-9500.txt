MobileBurn got to play with a prototype of Nokia's 9500 smartphone, a slab of a handset with built-in WiFi and
Bluetooth that unfolds to reveal a QWERTY keyboard and a large color LCD screen. Let's hope they do something about the
keyboard before this actually comes out, because it sounds like it isn't so great.
