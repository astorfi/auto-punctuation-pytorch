 Sergey Brin spends a lot of time wafting around town with his Project Glass(es) on, and he's never complained about the pain of carrying a computer on his nose. Perhaps now, we've learned why. Google's latest patent reveals that the company is considering a malleable nose bridge that hardens and softens, thanks to an electrically-controlled fluid with a changeable viscosity. All you'd have to do is tap the touchpad and tweak it to save you getting dents in your skin. There's no evidence to suggest we'll see the tech in the Explorer Edition of the headgear, but perhaps Mountain View have just solved a problem that us nerds suffer from.
