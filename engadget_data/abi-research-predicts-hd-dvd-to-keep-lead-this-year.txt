       The latest format war is really starting to heat up with the release of HD-DVD this week. Things are just getting moreand more interesting and everyone is taking sides. Well almost everyone some aretrying to stay neutral. Now a Consumer Electronics Research Service provider; ABI Research is predictingthat HD-DVD will atleastÂ  win this year. They are predicting that by the end of the year 70% of the HighDefinition DVD market will belong to HD-DVD because it was the first to market and because it is less expensive.However they also explain that HD-DVD may not be able to keep the lead because of many factors including Blu-Ray'sMovie Studio support as well as the PS3. The studio support could shift easily if the studios believe in HD-DVD in thelong run.
