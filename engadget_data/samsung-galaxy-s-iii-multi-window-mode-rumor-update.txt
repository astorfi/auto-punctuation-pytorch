 While the productivity-boosting wiles of the Galaxy Note II's multi-window feature have been promised to the original Note, these screenshots suggest that its slightly smaller brother might also add them to its repertoire in its next software update. According to TGSpot, these screens show how dual-browsing would look on the Galaxy S III's slightly smaller 4.8-inch screen -- we reckon Samsung's floating keyboard might shrink a little too much here. SamMobile made a similar claim just last month and posits that users could see the update before the end of the year. Nothing quite like the holidays to bring out the multi-tasker in all of us.
