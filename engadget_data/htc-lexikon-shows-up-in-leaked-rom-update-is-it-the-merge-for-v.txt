 
You might remember some discussion of the Lexikon about this time last month, a rumored Android piece from HTC sporting an 800MHz MSM7630 core, a 5 megapixel camera, 3.8-inch WVGA display, 4GB of onboard storage, Froyo with Sense, and a QWERTY keyboard. Sounds a little bit like the G2 / Desire Z, doesn't it? Indeed, those other models use Qualcomm's MSM7230 processor, the GSM version of the 7630 that'd be required for action on Verizon. Well, fast forward to a new ROM update leak, showing a rendered device with Verizon branding up top and a face that looks suspiciously similar to that dual-mode GSM / CDMA slider we've been tracking for a couple months (pay particular attention to the creases below the touch buttons). Separately, one of our time-tested tipsters has let us know that the Lexikon is the same phone as the so-called Merge; we hope you haven't grown attached to the flaming red keyboard, because more recent hardware revisions don't have it. Hey, maybe you'll be able to accessorize like you can with the Droid Incredible, eh?
