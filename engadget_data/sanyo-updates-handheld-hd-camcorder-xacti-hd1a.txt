Sanyo is yet again offering 720p quality in an extra-small package; their new Xacti HD1a handheld camcorder records in HD and pulls double-duty as a camera if you so desire. Sanyo kept the same 5.1 megapixel sensor from the HD1 and added some forgettable features in the refresh including a 16:9 still picture mode and in-camera editing capability, but did manage to up the ante by providing a 320 x 240 MPEG-4 recording mode ready-made to play on your iPod. The secret to keeping it compact is the usage of SD storage in favor of more traditional miniDV tapes; you can squeeze about 21 minutes of beautiful HD footage on a GB, or about an hour in SD quality if time becomes an issue. Weighing in at just 8.3 ounces, keeping the HD1a handy shouldn't be much of a burden, but there just isn't much new here to get excited about. For those who prefer form over function, you can pick this up for $699.99 in September.
