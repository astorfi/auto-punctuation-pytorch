  Good times this week as the oldest editor for Engadget HD finally joins your old favorites, unfortunately this new addition also introduced some technical difficulties so we had to work extra hard to clean up the audio. But despite our hard work we're afraid you're still going to be able to notice things didn't turn out quite right. We also continue to try out broadcasting the show on uStream and honestly think we've almost figured it out. When we do have it down, we'll be posting a link and letting you know the time and place in advanced. This week did have a really good slate of topics and the three of us didn't have any problems finding lots to talk about, so get ready for plenty of HD talk.
