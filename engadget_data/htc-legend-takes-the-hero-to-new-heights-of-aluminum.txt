The rumored and leaked device becomes a proper successor for HTC's time-tested Hero by upgrading the LCD to a 3.2-inch AMOLED display (while still carrying over the old HVGA resolution) and moving up from a trackball to one of those newfangled optical trackpads, though this one's got a bit of a twist: it's surrounded by a clickable button. The phone runs Android 2.1 with a series of brand new Sense enhancements, most notably the addition of a "Friend Stream" widget that aggregates friends' status updates across services (a trend we've been seeing a lot of lately). We're not hearing about North American availability at this point, but it'll hit Vodafone and direct sales channels in Europe in "early" second quarter.
