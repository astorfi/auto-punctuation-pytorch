Though we've read more than a few rumors about the company's forthcoming Ivy Bridge chips, Intel has yet to fully detail the new platform, and has controlled the flow of information so tightly that laptop makers won't even use the words Ivy Bridge when talking about upcoming systems. (It's always "next-generation Intel Core processors," but we digress.) So it's a pleasant surprise, then, to see a review of an Ivy Bridge system before Intel even makes its official announcement. Laptop Reviews has apparently been testing a yet-to-be-announced HP EliteBook 8470p with an unspecified Core i7 processor, integrated Intel HD 4000 graphics, 8GB of RAM and an Intel 320 solid-state drive.

 Though the testing team doesn't have much to say about battery life, the raw performance scores are quite impressive, surpassing those belonging to heavy hitters like the HP Envy 17 and Lenovo ThinkPad W520 workstation. Then again, Laptop Reviews is quick to admit that that SSD may have helped boost scores beyond what you'd see in an Ivy Bridge system with a good old-fashioned hard drive. On the graphics side, too, the spankin' new HD 4000 provides a nice (read: several-thousand-point) boost over systems running HD 3000, though we'll have to wait a little longer for real-world gaming tests, it seems. That's the abridged version, but we encourage you to hit up the source link for some more detailed remarks, along with comparisons to other systems.
