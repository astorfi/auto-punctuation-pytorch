Without any fanfare whatsoever, Amazon has quietly fired up its MP3 store over in the UK, marking the first time the e-tailer has sold jams outside of the United States of America. The page doesn't look all that dissimilar to the one we Americans have grown used to, and of course, every one of the three million 256kbps MP3 files are DRM-free. At first glance, we're already seeing some tasty singles for £0.59 ($0.86) and whole albums for £3 ($4.39). Looks like it's about time to open that digital wallet, UKers.[Via Pocket-lint]
