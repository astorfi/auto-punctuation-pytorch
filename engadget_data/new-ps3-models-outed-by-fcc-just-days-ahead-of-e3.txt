PlayStation 3 models CECH-2501A and CECH-2501B are both certified for 802.11b/g WiFi and Bluetooth 2.0+EDR differing only in hard disk drive configurations. We're also seeing a pair of PS3 DECH-2500A and DECH-S2500A debugging stations -- interesting since a debug unit is typically only required when there's been a change in the chips on the motherboard. Feel free to speculate as we prepare for E3 to kick off on June 15th.
