Lets say you're already burned out on Destiny and are looking for something a bit, well, different than what the Xbox One currently has on offer. That might just mean that D4 (short for Dark Dreams Don't Die), the latest game from the creator of cult-hit Deadly Premonition, could be the relief you didn't even know you were looking for. It's one of the scant few Kinect-enabled games releasing soon, too. The episodic title was first teased during Microsoft's E3 event last year and has gone largely unheard from since. That's recently changed, as Xbox Wire has an interview with its developer Hidetaka Suehiro, better known as Swery65, ahead of the first installment hitting the Xbox Marketplace today.


Update: D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die is now available for $15 right here.



What're you in for? A sort of noir murder-mystery where you can interact with the cel-shaded surroundings either with a controller or Microsoft's do-all sensor. The latter of which apparently has you "grabbing" one of the characters by her shoulders and pulling her off a kitchen table. If you've sold off your old consoles, this'll have to do for your adventure fix until Telltale's The Wolf Among Us hits Xbox One.
