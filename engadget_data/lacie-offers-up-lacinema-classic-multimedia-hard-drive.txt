Available in capacities as large as 1TB, the multimedia hard drive weighs in at 33 ounces and promises to upscale your digital media to 1080p over HDMI. Of note, the unit is DivX certified and features a S/PDIF audio output, though it might have trouble handling some of the more exotic formats. It's up for grabs as we speak starting at $159 for a 500GB version.
