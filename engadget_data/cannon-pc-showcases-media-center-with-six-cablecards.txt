Not even a month after we heard that Cannon PC would be offering up dual- and quad-CableCARD rigs, in flies word that said company is demonstrating a machine capable of handling half a dozen CableCARDs. Yeah, six cards controlled simultaneously by one computer. For those curious, the devices in question were ATI's Digital Cable tuners, and while gloating about something is one thing, it's another to host a video up on the 'net for all to see. Six high-definition programs get recorded at once in the video just after the break -- c'mon, you know can't resist checking out such a feat out.
