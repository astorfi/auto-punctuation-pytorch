If you thought that 8-bit Mario Amiibo from E3 was huge, you ain't seen nothing yet: Mega Yarn Yoshi is coming to take the "biggest Amiibo" crown. The beautiful toy you see above is an officially licensed, super-sized version of the popular Yarn Yoshi Amiibo. It's a fully-functional NFC figurine, so you'll be able to use its foot to interact with various Wii U titles. It'll activate the "Double Yoshi" feature in Yoshi's Woolly World, create an AI fighter in Super Smash Bros. or get a sweet Mii costume in Mario Kart 8. Priced at $39.99 and scheduled for release this November 15th, it's likely to sell very quickly. You'll want to keep a close eye on pre-orders as this green giant is going to cost a bomb on eBay once stocks run out.
