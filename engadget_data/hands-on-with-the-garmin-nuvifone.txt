Check the gallery below for some close-up action with a non-working model, and comparison shots of the device with the iPhone. The phone feels light and lean in your hands, we should note, and we're told that the model we were handling was close to what the final weight will be -- it's a pretty impressive and clean design once you see it up close. Enjoy some pictures you can actually see.
