As of early this morning, the D11 satellite made contact with a ground station in Hartebeesthoek, South Africa, signaling that it was "healthy and operating normally." Of course, there's no way to tell exactly what day the sat will begin dishing out more HD to more subscribers, but we reckon the conjecturing can officially begin. Psst... it took 81 days before DirecTV 10 began serving up HD.[Thanks, K Shoup and syphix]
