With today's announcement of the SGH-A727, though, we're delighted to be proven wrong. The handset takes pages from the aforementioned Z370's and the X820's book, offering decent functionality in an impossibly thin package. Granted, 8.9 millimeters is (almost literally) a hair thicker than the X820's 6.9, but we'll gladly take the 3G data in return. Besides UMTS and quadband GSM, other notable features include a 1.3 megapixel shooter, Bluetooth with A2DP, and a 220 x 176 landscape display. We're crossing our fingers that the UMTS radio hits all the requisite North American bands -- more on that as CES soldiers on -- but if nothing else, we're golden in the GSM department.[Via phoneArena]
