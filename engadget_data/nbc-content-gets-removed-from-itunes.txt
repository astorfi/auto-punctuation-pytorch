In accordance with the company's contract (which expired this month), all the shows you know and love have disappeared and been trucked over to the network's own content portal, NBC Direct. So, those of you hoping to make that one last 30 Rock purchase before the big N cleaned house can put the dream to rest, as well as hopes of grabbing anything from Bravo, mun2, NBC, NBC News, CNBC, NBC Sports, Sci Fi, Sleuth, Telemundo and the USA Network. Hey, at least you can get them at the network's site... what's that? You only get to watch shows for 48 hours, and there's no Mac support? Oh well.[Via TUAW]
