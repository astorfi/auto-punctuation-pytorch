While Dish seem to have the best thing going for "TV Anywhere" with its Sling integration and AT&T has made some strides with U-Verse Mobile, others like Cablevision and Time Warner have only extended the live TV string as far as the bathroom, kitchen or other rooms within your home. TV Everywhere efforts have so far mostly allowed viewing of video on-demand wherever you are like Comcast's Xfinity and HBO Go so we're wondering if true placeshifting is actually a key feature for you right now, or something you can live without.
