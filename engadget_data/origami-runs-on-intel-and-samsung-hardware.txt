 According to the IDG NewsService, Microsoft has not designed any new hardware for the Origami project. Instead, as stated byMicrosoft's CeBIT trade show spokesperson, MS will discuss Origami for oh, about "30 seconds" come March 9th,with the thunder to be unleashed instead by Intel and Samsung. Remember, Intel is set to unveil their UMPC platformon the 7th at the start of the Intel Developer Forum, presumably setting the stage for actual product announcementon the 9th. So for all the teasers, Origami is unfolding into an XP Tablet PC edition UMPC handtopcomputer manufactured by Samsung -- looking something like that pic to the right. But 'round and 'round the hypemachine goes and where she stops only Intel Samsung Microsoft knows.
