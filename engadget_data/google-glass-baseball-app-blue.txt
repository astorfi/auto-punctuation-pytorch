The boys of summer are about to come home, but that doesn't make developer Aaron Draczynski's Google Glass baseball app any less rad. Blue uses geolocation to determine what park you're at and feeds all manner of ball diamond-data directly into your eye. Whether it's displaying play-by-play descriptions, who's on the mound or how fast and what type his last pitch was, sitting in the stands no longer means missing out on the info you'd get from a TV broadcast. While this might seem like it'd be a better tablet or phone app, wearing Glass to a ballgame does have a distinct advantage: it lets you hold more than two $15 beers at a time.
