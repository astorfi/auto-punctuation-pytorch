 The crew over SlySoft isn't messing around, as just days after the v6.4.1.1 update hit the web, along comes yet another version to run laps around Big Content's best efforts. Posted yesterday, AnyDVD HD 6.4.5.0 adds in support for "a new version" of BD+ that's apparently included on films such as Jumper and a new flavor of AACS. This update also fixes a few minor problems with CSS logging and key retrieval, not to mention quirks found when removing ALPHA-DVD protection. You know the drill, head on down and stay current.[Via CDFreaks]
