The latest episode of HBO's Entourage (if that's the kind of thing you're into) might have been a bit of an eye opener if you're also the kind of person who keeps an eye open for gadgets. Ari Gold's legal adviser (seen in around the 4th minute of the episode if you need the proof) has an iPad set up, keyboard and all. Now, we know Ari's character pretty well. He's the BlackBerry Bold type -- and while his wife uses an iPhone, we have a hard time believing Ari's going to put up with the iPad in the office nonsense for very long. You, young man, are on very thin ice. There's one more shot after the break.
