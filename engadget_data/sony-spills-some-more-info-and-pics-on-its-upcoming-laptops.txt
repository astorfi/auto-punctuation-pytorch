The FZ info we had for the most part, but it's nice to get a bit of confirmation that Sony is actually going with 2GB of RAM and Santa Rosa across the board for the Vista laptops, along with Blu-ray in the FZ11Z. The other goodness we've got here are the first pics of the 11.1-inch TZ series (shown above), some downright sexy ultraportables that are replacing the comparatively frumpy TX laptops. Sony is touting up to 9 hours of battery life, with 1GB of RAM and a 80GB hard drive in the TZ11MN/M, and 2GB / 100GB in the TZ11XN/B. Both laptops feature integrated cameras and microphones, just like the FZ series, and are running Vista Business on Core 2 Duo U7500 processors. Still no word on price, but the info we have has these hitting at least the UK in July.
