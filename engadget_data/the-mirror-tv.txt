Either they beat Philips to the punch or this is a knock-off of their idea (well, it could be both), but Smarthome
is selling a bathrooom mirror with a 15-inch LCD TV embedded into it. From the pic it looks like it's just a TV with a
mirror around it, but when you turn the TV off all you see is a regular mirror. So good, because you really wouldn't
want to miss a second of Good Morning America. Oh wait, that's what TiVo is for. Forget it.
