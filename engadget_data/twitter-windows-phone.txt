 Twitter has finally given some love to its Windows Phone app, a change the company promises will put it "in line with other Twitter apps." On the docket are changes to the UI and a slew of new features. The app now offers tabs for Home, Connect, Discover and Me, making it easier to keep up with your feed and mentions around the Twittersphere. Also new are Tweet and Search icons, which let you perform those activities from anywhere in the app. And those who hate going to the trouble of opening the app the old fashioned way can pin searches and lists to their phone's start screen now, thanks to a new Live Tile update.
