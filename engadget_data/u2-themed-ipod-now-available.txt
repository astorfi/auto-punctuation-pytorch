signature laser etching, also comes with an exclusive U2 poster. Why is it that after years of waiting for a black
iPod, they screw it up by making the scroll wheel red? Also, there is no mention of free U2 content pre-loaded on the
iPod as was previously speculated.  However, the U2 iPod does come with a $50 off coupon for The Complete U2, a
digital box set including more than 400 U2 tracks (all the albums plus 25 B-sides).
