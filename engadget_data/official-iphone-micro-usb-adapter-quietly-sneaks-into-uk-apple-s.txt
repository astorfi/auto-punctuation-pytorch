	It looks like Apple's making good on its promise to standardize its charger port for EU territories. Behind all the big hitters announced by Apple today, an official micro-USB adapter has shuffled into the UK's online store in a very typically English way. Sure, there have been third-party options for a while, but this one's the real deal and looks set to go on sale on October 14th, alongside the newly crowned iPhone 4S. We hope and expect that this will come packaged with Apple's latest phone in Euroland -- but on the off-chance that it doesn't, we'd question whether charging an extra Â£8 obeys the spirit of the regulation.
