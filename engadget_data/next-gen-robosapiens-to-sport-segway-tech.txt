If you're a parent who's always getting hassled by those
Robosapien toys, prepare for things to get a
lot worse.Â  As if the little guys weren't mobile enough, next generation products from WowWee will incorporate
Segway's Smart Motion gyroscopic technology, allowing youngsters to pilot their
Roboraptors into almost every nook and cranny of the
house. WowWee is the first company to license Segway's tech, which was previously limited to their own
Human Transporter and
Centaur concept vehicle. Better start robo-proofing all
your stuff soon; new models in the Robonetics line will begin to appear next year.
