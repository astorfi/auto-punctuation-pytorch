The hack which exposed millions of TalkTalk customer account details may have been orchestrated by more than one individual. Following the arrest of a 15-year-old boy on Monday, Metropolitan Police today confirmed that a second individual has been apprehended in connection with the case. A 16-year-old boy was cuffed on Thursday at an address in Feltham, London, by detectives from the Metropolitan Police Cyber Crime Unit. The property was searched and the teenager has since been released on bail. In a statement, officers confirmed that a second property in Liverpool has also been examined, although it's unclear how this relates to the overall investigation.



The high-profile TalkTalk hack covered a wealth of personal data, including customer names, addresses, account information and credit card/bank card data. The company quickly took the account sections of its website offline, and CEO Dido Harding later confirmed that it had been sent a digital ransom note. Once the dust had settled, the UK provider said the amount of stolen data was fortunately smaller than it first feared. Regardless, this is the third data breach against the company in the last year, and Harding now faces tough questions about TalkTalk's internal security capabilities and practices.
