 Normally we don't go in for the whole "listening to what surveys say" thing, but when it comes to the cause of questioning the logic behind endless lines of pink gadgets designed to appeal to the female "market," we'll gladly pass on the criticism. There's a clear British slant to the story -- the survey was commissioned by Saatchi and Saatchi after all -- and it would be ludicrous to say that all women find pink / diamond encrusted gadgets and the atmosphere in gadget retail stores patronizing, but it's clear that the technology industry is tipped towards satisfying male buyers. To prevent this post from collapsing into a psychoanalysis of the gender associations with the color pink, we'll open this up to the floor. Gadgets + pink = perfectly ok, or totally patronizing?
