 If you've been toying with the idea of ordering up one of Dell's XPS 420s, now wouldn't be a bad time to pull the trigger -- particularly if you're into CableCARD. Effectively immediately, users can configure their XPS 420 with single or dual ATI TV Wonder Digital Cable Tuners, and each one will only add $180 to the bottom line. Reportedly, the option will become a mainstay on the model, and if you're cool with the basics, you can snag a CableCARD-equipped tower for just $1,079 right now. Decisions, decisions.
