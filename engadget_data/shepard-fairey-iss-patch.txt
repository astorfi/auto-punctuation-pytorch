 Remember those old-school NASA mission patches that spacefarers would proudly wear upon their shoulders as they bounced around the great beyond? CASIS, the agency's newly-minted non-profit wanted to commemorate its first experiment being put on the International Space Station, and so enlisted the talents of Shepard Fairey, the graphic designer behind the Obama "Hope" campaign and those Obey T-shirts. We've snagged one of the patches for our own homemade astronaut jacket, but if you aren't here at Fort Mason, you can watch the design process in the video after the break.
