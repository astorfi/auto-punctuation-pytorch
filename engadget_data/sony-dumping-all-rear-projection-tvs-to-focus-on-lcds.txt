We've been tipped on it twice today and now This Week In Consumer Electronics is reporting that a Sony spokesperson has told them that "We are moving our resources more toward LCD TV, because that's what people really want." It looks like all backorders for the KDSZ70XBR5 are being canceled, as the unit will never be manufactured, and Sony's making a "no promises" effort to fill backorders for the KDF46E3000 and KDS60A3000. The move isn't exactly unprecedented or even all that surprising -- Toshiba, Philips and Hitachi have all stopped producing rear-projection sets, but Sony's SXRDs were still extremely popular and it's strange to see them get dropped just like that. Check the full leaked email we got after the break.
      

 

From: [redacted] Sent: Tuesday, December 18, 2007 10:01 PM To: [redacted] Subject: FW: Sony #-LCD and SXRD Announcment  To All- I've spoken to some of you regarding Sony's announcement yesterday re: the discontinuation of all MDPJ sets including E-series 3-LCD, A and XBR-series SXRD. Here's an unofficial statement from our internal news:  Sony to Stop MDPJ Production Dec. 17 - Due to the high consumer demand for BRAVIA flat-panel LCD televisions combined with the accelerating industry trend toward flat-panel displays, Sony Electronics will discontinue producing rear-projection televisions based on 3LCD and Silicon X-tal Reflective Display technologies. - All backorders for KDSZ70XBR5 are now cancelled as this set will not be produced. - We do expect to fill existing backorders for KDF46E3000 and KDS60A3000 – if you need either of these models, LAST CHANCE, ORDER NOW and we will do our best to fill your orders – no promises!!!
