The company is reportedly seeking out WebKit engineers to work on the project at Samsung's Silicon Valley R&D center -- where work is already underway on the Chrome mobile rival. The open-source WebKit engine already underpins not only Google's own browser, but also its pre-ICS Android web browser -- and Apple's Safari. We've got in touch with Samsung who politely told us that it "doesn't comment on rumor or speculation."
