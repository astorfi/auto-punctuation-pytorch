Not only will it let you output full 1080p video instead of just mirroring the iPad 2's display (and aspect ratio) on your TV, but it will even let you use your iPad 2 as a secondary display -- in this case, to display a map of the track. Unfortunately, there's no word on a release date for the update, but you can get a pretty good taste of what's in store in the video above.
