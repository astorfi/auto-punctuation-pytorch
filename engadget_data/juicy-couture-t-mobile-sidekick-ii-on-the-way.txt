We already knew all about that special limited-edition Mister Cartoon T-Mobile Sidekick II (pictured above), but now
we have it on good authority that T-Mobile is getting ready to cater to velour-clad women everywhere with a new
limited-edition Juicy Couture Sidekick II. Haven't been able to find any pics, but we're guessing it'll cost $399 just
like the Mister Cartoon version.
