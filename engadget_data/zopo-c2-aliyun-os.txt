 Despite the aborted launch of Acer's Aliyun-powered phone last September, the cheeky Android-based OS is now back with a handful of new devices courtesy of some local friends, with the most notable device coming from Zopo, a notorious cloner of Samsung, HTC and LG phones. That said, it looks like the company's making a change with this seemingly good-looking C2, and for the launch price of Â¥1,399 or about $230 unsubsidized, the specs will probably make Xiaomi tremble: there's a 5-inch 1080p gapless LTPS display, a MediaTek MT6589 chip (1.2GHz quad-core Cortex-A7 processor with 1GB RAM and PowerVR SGX544 graphics), 4GB internal storage with microSD expansion, Yamaha audio chip, a removable 2,000mAh battery and WCDMA 850/2100 radio with HSPA+. 
 Furthermore, not only is there a 13-megapixel f/2.2 main camera, but there's also a staggering 5-megapixel front-facing camera on the other side -- just like the one on Oppo's Ulike 2. Oh, and these all come in an 8.5mm-thick body, too. Zopo's now accepting pre-orders for the first 5,000 C2s and will be shipping before the end of the month, so if you have an account on Tmall and don't mind being a guinea pig then go for it.
