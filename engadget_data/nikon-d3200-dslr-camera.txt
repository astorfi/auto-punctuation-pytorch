The price gap between these two low-end DSLRs is significant -- around $150 based on current D3100 prices, with the black D3200 and regular 18-55mm kit lens expected to hit shelves at the end of April for $700. What does that extra outlay get you? Quite a lot, actually: a hefty resolution upgrade to 24-megapixels with an Expeed 3 processing engine, versus 14-megapixels mustered by D3100; an extra ISO notch of 6400, providing more flexibility in low-light situations; and also a much higher-res LCD display for cleaner live-viewing and playback, with around four times as many pixels as the D3100's grainy window. Read on for some initial impressions and a hands-on video, and you'll see that there are a couple of subtler selling points too.





  Nikon makes a really big deal out of Guide Mode, which has been expanded on the D3200 to offer even more tuition to DSLR newcomers. It might sound gimmicky, but actually the interface is well intentioned: you twist the mode wheel to Guide and the camera asks if you want a desired effect, such as a blurred background in a portrait, or more red in a sunset, and then it efficiently guides you through the steps needed to make it happen -- in this case, opening up the aperture or shifting the white balance respectively. Of course, if you actually digest what Guide Mode tells you, or if you simply read up on the basics of photography online, then this feature will quickly become irrelevant, so it probably shouldn't be regarded as a determining factor in any buying decision, even if it is a nice thing for newcomers to have.

 
 In terms of the hardware itself, it's outwardly very much like the D3100, and that's a good thing: the camera feels equally well built, well laid out (especially if you like your Nikons, which we do), small and lightweight.

 
 In another sense these similarities are also bad, because they leave you with a tough buying decision. Are the better resolution, image processing, LCD and ISO worth the money? Alas, we can't make that call without seeing actual images from the D3200, and Nikon won't let us do that without final hardware.

 
 In the meantime, however, there's one other factor to consider: the $60 WU-1A WiFi dongle that will let you beam your photos straight to your Android smartphone or tablet, and later in the year to your iOS device too.

 We weren't able to try out the device, but we do know that it's meant to do more than just file transfer, also allowing you to use your Android device as a remote viewer and shutter release. And yes, if that functionality appeals, then the D3200 is currently your only option within the Nikon range. Your decision after that will be whether to go for traditional black or funky red. Hmmm...

   Effortless Operation  \  Beginner photographers as well as those looking to expand their repertoire of shooting techniques will appreciate the Nikon D3200's Guide Mode which provides step-by-step photo instructions to capture amazing images. Easily accessible through the Mode Dial found on top of the camera body, the Guide Mode walks beginning D-SLR users through the process of set-up, shooting, viewing and deleting images. Because it asks the user what kind of creative photo technique they would like to learn, the Guide Mode has been widely acclaimed for its ability to build confidence and give users the tools to create amazing images. As more people discover the benefits of replacing their camcorder with a D-SLR, the Guide Mode also walks users through the best video settings to create home movies with blockbuster flair.
