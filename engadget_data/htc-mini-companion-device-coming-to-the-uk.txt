When the HTC Butterfly (better known as the Droid DNA here in the US) launched in China several months ago, it was soon followed by a companion device called the HTC Mini. This accessory -- not to be confused with HTC's One mini -- is basically designed to be a Bluetooth handset and remote control for the larger smartphone. It features NFC for pairing, plus a numeric keypad and monochrome LCD. What's more intriguing, however, is that UK retailer Clove recently outed an update to the product -- the HTC Mini+ -- which gains an IR blaster and the ability to remote control a variety of TVs, along with HTC's Media Link HD. The companion device is expected to be available soon fort Â£54.16 (about $83) before taxes.
