But Huawei claims it's developed prototype DSL technology that can deliver 1Gb/s downstream and upstream over common twisted pair copper telephone cable for distances of up to 100 meters. This could provide a "cost effective option for telecom operators building ultra-broadband access networks," but will it be enough to overcome America's anxiety towards Chinese-made telecoms infrastructure? In any case, some lucky people have had fiber-to-the-home Gigabit broadband for months already.
