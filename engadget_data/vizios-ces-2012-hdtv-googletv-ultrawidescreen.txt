Among its more conventional sets, the E3D series has been bringing value priced passive 3D since last year, but it will be joined by the M3D series in a 47- and 55-inch model, the latter of which includes a Bluetooth QWERTY remote. If that's not enough, users can step up to the R3D series which come in the same sizes and have better backlighting.




The more interesting news however, is that the 65-inch versions of both M- and R- lines feature VIA Plus, which is Vizio's customized spin on Google TV. We first got a peek at it last year, however the delayed introduction of Honeycomb and adoption of ARM processors likely doomed any chance of a release. In another blast from the past, Vizio has also queued up three 21:9 "CinemaWide" ultrawidescreen WFHD (2560x1080) models (above), in sizes of 50-, 58- and 71-inches with 3D and Yahoo! Widgets. We were heartbroken when we never saw these come home in 2011, although in all fairness no one else brought an ultrawidescreen flat-panel to us either so there's still an extremely rectangular space on our wall that needs filling. Prices and ship dates for all the new TVs are still TBD, and those without Google TV include Yahoo TV widgets. Check the press release after the break for the available details, before we check out the new models and try to find out if they'll actually arrive this time around.

VIZIO will demonstrate the new lineup at their private		showcase at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas during the Consumer Electronics Show,		January 10 – 13, 2012. 		"With expanded entertainment options from TV apps and 3D movies, sports and games,		consumers expect more from their TV than just great picture quality," stated John		Schindler, VIZIO VP of Product Management. "That's why we've worked tirelessly with		our suppliers and partners to create a full lineup for 2012 that gives our customers the		best in class smart TV experience with VIZIO Internet Apps®, along with our award-		winning Theater 3D™ technology at an unmatched value for every household." 		Recent recognition for VIZIO Theater 3D™ includes the prestigious "Best of What's		New" award from Popular Science Magazine as well as from entertainment industry		leaders that are driving 3D content creation. Director James Cameron, speaking to		the National Association of Broadcasters, recently projected the next big "threshold"		in home 3D adaption will be marked when passive 3D sets become the dominant 3D		product, in place of active 3D TVs. 		Cameron said: "Instead of having a few-hundred-dollars-a-pair of active glasses, making		sure they're all charged up and are they working and are they switched on, there'll be		a bowl of disposable - we like to say recyclable - cheap plastic glasses that work very		well in decoding the image to the left and to the right eyes. If you're having a Super		Bowl party, you'll have a bowl on the coffee table, and if the kids sit on a pair of glasses		there's no major scold, just a minor scold. And that's going to accelerate adoption of 3D		into the home." 		The award-winning, revolutionary new technology of VIZIO Theater 3D™ delivers		crystal-clear, flicker-free 3D that's up to two times brighter than current active shutter		LCD TVs, with significantly less crosstalk, a wider horizontal viewing angle, and much less		blurring with fast motion. Theater 3D™ eyewear produces less eyestrain and headaches		than active glasses, and is battery-free, lightweight and comfortable. Up to four pairs		of Theater 3D™ glasses are included with each TV set, and they are also available in a		rapidly growing range of styles and colors from brand name designers. They even work		in most 3D movie theaters. 		"While active 3D had an initial advantage of being the first 3D technology to come		to market in the United States, passive 3D, such as VIZIO's Theater 3D™, is definitely		gaining traction," said Lisa Hatamiya, research associate at IHS. "Consumers are		becoming more knowledgeable about the benefits of passive 3D viewing technology.		IHS research reveals a strong consumer preference for passive 3D over active 3-D in the		U.S. television market. In a market driven by pricing, the lower premiums of passive 3D		TVs not only will bring more value to the consumer, but also will make the technology		better positioned for mass adoption." 		VIZIO's Theater 3D™ utilizes circular polarization to produce superior performance and		a better viewing experience. And because the technology is built right into the display,		3D audiences can use battery-free, lighter and more stylish glasses in place of the bulky,		uncomfortable powered active shutter glasses required for conventional 3DTVs. VIZIO's		technology team was one of the first to develop products using this approach, which 		helped drive VIZIO to become a market leader and major influence in the adaptation of		3D technology for the home. 		"3D TV shipments in North America totaled about 300k units in the 3rd quarter of		2011, and about 30% of those were based on passive glasses technology, also known		as Theater 3D™ ," noted Paul Gagnon, Director of North America TV Research for		DisplaySearch." The Theater 3D™ segment should see further share growth in late 2011		and 2012." 		Each model being introduced also features VIZIO Internet Apps® (V.I.A.), delivering		unprecedented choice and control of web-based content directly to the TV without the		need for a PC or set-top box.** 		The V.I.A. experience makes top online content and services available at the touch of		a button, including: Hulu Plus™, Facebook®, Flickr®, Netflix®, Rhapsody®, Pandora®,		Twitter™, VUDU®, and Yahoo!® TV Widgets. 		Also the Yahoo! Connected TV store makes its debut today on V.I.A. enabled HDTVs.		Yahoo! Connected TV Store provides consumers easy access to more than 180 free		and paid TV apps from leading brands including Amazon®, CBS, Showtime®, Pandora®,		USA Today, Wall Street Journal®, AT&T, iHeart Radio®, Fandago®, and QVC®. TV apps		provide engaging content designed to complement TV viewing and include news,		entertainment, finance, sports, games, social networking, music, photo sharing,		shopping, and more.
