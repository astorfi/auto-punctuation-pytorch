The spritual successor to the Chocolate (and its many, many variants) will make its international debut at CES form next week, apparently rocking the same mirrored surface, checkerboard keypad, and 2 megapixel cam as its Korean cousin -- though the radio will change from CDMA to GSM for European and (hopefully) American launches later this year. Likely missing from CES, though, will be the just-announced Shine Designer's Edition for LG's home turf, but let's just be thankful for the scraps we're thrown, shall we?[Via Phone Scoop and I4U News]
