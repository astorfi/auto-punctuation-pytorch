 According to a report, the next iteration of PS3 packages has been all but confirmed during a GameStop conference call recently. Apparently, the 80GB version of the console is dead, and is due to be replaced by a 120GB model bundled with the Dual Shock 3 controller -- just like we mentioned a few days go. There's no set price or release date, though speculation is that it will turn up by GDC. Instead of a denial, Sony has gone for a "no comment" in regards to this news, though it certainly looks like this is the direction they're heading in, regardless of what they say.[Thanks, Khattab]
