Here in Vegas, the company just announced its BlackArmor PS110, which is its first USB 3.0 portable HDD. What makes this one a touch different than the rest is the "performance kit" that it ships in, which is comprised of a 500GB USB 3.0 HDD (a 2.5-incher with a 7200RPM spindle speed), a power cable and an ExpressCard USB 3.0 adapter. 'Course, your shiny new MacBook won't take too kindly to this type of gesture -- but hey, at least you can read SD cards without breaking a sweat! The kit is up for purchase right now for $179.99, and if you're looking to take a closer look before pulling the trigger, you'll find our hands-on below along with a glance at a for-demonstration-only 7mm 2.5-inch drive that was first announced last month.
