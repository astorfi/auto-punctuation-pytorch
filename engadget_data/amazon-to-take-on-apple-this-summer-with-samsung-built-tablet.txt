		It's something of an open secret that Amazon is working on an Android tablet and I am 99 percent certain they are having Samsung build one for them.

The gdgt piece goes on to present a very reasoned argument that paints Amazon, not Samsung or the rest of the traditional consumer electronics industry, as Apple's chief competition in the near-term tablet space. An idea that'll be tough to argue against if Amazon -- with its combined music (downloadable and streaming), video, book, and app ecosystem -- can actually launch a dirt-cheap, highly-customized, 7-inch Android tablet this summer as Pete predicts. Oh, and the fact that Amazon already has our credit card details will certainly make for easy adoption.
