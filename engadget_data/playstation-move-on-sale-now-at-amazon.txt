Now Amazon's jumped the gun and put the PlayStation Move $99.99 Starter Bundle up for sale a few days early. And with local express delivery, you can even get it shipped today if you qualify. Worse case, use one-day shipping and you'll still get it before the Joneses.

Update: Oh, and we just found the $399.99 PlayStation 3 320GB with Move Bundle, $49.99 Move Controller, and $29.96 Move Navigation Controller ready for purchase too. Full press release detailing all the items after the break.
