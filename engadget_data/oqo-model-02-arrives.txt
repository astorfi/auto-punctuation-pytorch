This time they've improved pretty much everything, from the sleek, new black casing and backlit keyboard (with actual keys!), to the brighter LCD screen and integrated EV-DO. Specs have gotten a much needed bump across the board, with the most expensive model they're offering sporting a 1.5GHz VIA processor, 60GB hard drive, 1GB of DDR2 RAM, a 5-inch, 800x480 pixel display (with active digitizer for pen-based input), Bluetooth 2.0, 802.11a/b/g WiFi, integrated EV-DO (courtesy of Sprint), and even an HDMI-out port. The Model 02 also has a few other slick features, like the ability to zoom to 1000x600 and 1200x720 interpolated modes, a sensor that automatically protects the hard drive in case of a drop, and an optional docking station with a DVD+-RW drive, HDMI and VGA video out, three USB 2.0 ports, and a 3.5mm audio jack. There are a couple of disappointment -- namely that battery life is a paltry three hours unless you pick up an extended life battery, it's only Vista-capable, not shipping with Vista (at least not initially), and there's no longer a slot for the stylus -- but overall this is the upgrade we've been waiting for. Click on for some more pics, as well as a shot of the OQO in the docking station.
