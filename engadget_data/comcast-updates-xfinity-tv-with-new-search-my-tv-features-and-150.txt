 
Looks like Comcast has dropped the Fancast tag entirely, showing off a reworked Xfinity TV portal that ties content available for streaming to the PC a little more tightly alongside remote DVR scheduling and social media tie-ins with Facebook. Now claiming up to 150,000 titles are available for streaming online, it has an all new search function to better determine what's available and promises customized recommendations (think Netflix, TiVo) are on the way soon. Check out XfinityTV.com to see the new features, or just check out the press release after the break.
