It wasn't until this week, however, that ASUS finally came clean with a full specifications list for the swivel-screen netvertible. The 3G-equipped machine also packs a GPS module, Bluetooth, WiFi, an 8.9-inch LED-backlit touch panel, Intel's Atom Z520 CPU, Ethernet, a multicard reader, VGA output, twin USB 2.0 sockets and audio in / out ports. Sadly, there's still no definite US release date, but we suspect it can't be too far off now. In related news, this very machine was caught showcasing its elite multitouch skills with Windows 7, and if you're interested in seeing exactly how that went down, hop on past the break and mash play.Read - Official Eee PC T91 specificationsRead - T91 multitouch on Windows 7
