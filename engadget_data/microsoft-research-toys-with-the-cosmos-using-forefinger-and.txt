Though the cardboard-and-paper-clip structure isn't all that (unless you're the arts and crafts type), the inside houses a projectiondesign DLP unit with a custom infrared camera system that can turn simple hand gestures into virtual interstellar travel, 360-degree video teleconferencing and more. You'll find a pair of videos demonstrating the concept after the break, but try not to get too attached -- if you're anything like us, your poor heart can't handle another Courier axing.
