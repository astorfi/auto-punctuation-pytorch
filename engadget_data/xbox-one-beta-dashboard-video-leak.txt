In a move that reminds us of the kid that leaked the first in the wild shots of the Xbox 360, YouTuber Jackson Carter has posted a two minute video claiming to show a working Xbox One. After flashing the console itself and a controller as proof, he focuses mostly on the UI, displaying its Windows 8-style tile layout. You can check out our detailed impressions of the console's UI right here, but this will be the first opportunity most have had to see the system's default menu -- multitasking, Ryse beta, Kinect 2.0 and all -- in motion. There's no info on exactly where this console came from, but our friendly narrator mentions he can't access other beta games just yet. While conspiracy theorists debate if this legitimate and/or intentional, everyone else can just take a peek at it embedded after the break.


Update: The original video has been pulled from YouTube, we've embedded a working version after the break.
