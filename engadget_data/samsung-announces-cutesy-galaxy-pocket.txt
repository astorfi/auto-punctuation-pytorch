  Space will always have room for another galaxy, and your pocket should equally have room for this little piece of Android 2.3 TouchWizadry. The Galaxy Pocket has just been announced in London and will arrive in the UK "later this year," bearing a 2.8-inch screen with a 240 x 320 (QVGA) resolution, an 800MHz processor, 3GB of expandable storage. That's an even smaller display than last year's crop of budget Androids, so hopefully this one will be priced accordingly. Full spec table and PR after the break.
