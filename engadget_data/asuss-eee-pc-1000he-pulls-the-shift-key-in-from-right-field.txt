Welcome, then, to the 1000HE, or "extended." It features a chiclet-style keyboard that slightly increases the size of each key, but more importantly has a slightly revised layout, moving that shift key to the left. New too is a six-cell pack full of 2.9 amp batteries (versus 2.7 amps in the 1000H), said to add another hour to the Eee's life, up to a total of 8.7 according to Asus. Finally, the company announced an "HAE" model that sports lacks 802.11n, Bluetooth, and presumably a higher lower price tag. No word on what that price will be on either model, though, or when you might be able to get your fingertips on them.Update: Whoops, fopkins commented to point out that the HAE actually is the one without Bluetooth and 802.11n, making it the cheaper of the pair.
