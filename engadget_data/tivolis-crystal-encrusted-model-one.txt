For the extremely affordable price of 39,000 SEK (or about $5,866), you can buy one of these limited edition little radios covered in handcrafted crystal. Of course, the Model One normally sells for $119, but it's not like you're investing in just any old tuner -- this one gets AM and FM stations.[Via technabob]
