The moment was captured after the unveiling of the Mini-ITX 2.0 spec at Computex last week. Why? We're not exactly sure, but we imagine things can get a bit emotional when old enemies join forces against a foe as formidable as Intel. Now give eachother a firm slap on the back, punch to the shoulder, and possibly, if it feels right... a noogie. There's much to do if NVIDIA's Tegra and VIA's Nano are to supplant Intel's Silverthorne and Diamondville in future MIDs and netbooks, respectively.
