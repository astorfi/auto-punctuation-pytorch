 If your fresh new laptop has an ExpressCard slot that's not already preoccupied with a TV tuner, external SATA adapter, or EV-DO card, you might be interested in a little something that maximizes your ability to become the ultimate couch potato. Interlink Electronics has released its Bluetooth-enabled Media Remote that just so happens to fit snuggly inside your machine's ExpressCard slot for storage and recharging. The device works with pretty much every media suite out there, including Windows Media Center, Dell Media Experience, Windows Media Player, iTunes, RealPlayer and presumably anything else with track / volume controls. Sporting a 30 foot range, a full week of battery life, and weighing only 1.1 ounces, this $49.95 media controller should make good use of that open ExpressCard slot -- unless, of course, it's reserved for more critical tasks.[Via MobileWhack]
