Facebook knows you don't just want to keep tabs on the latest updates -- sometimes, you want to wax nostalgic as well. Appropriately, the social network is rolling out a previously tested On This Day feature that shows posts you shared (or were tagged in) on the same date in previous years. You'll be the only one taking this trip down memory lane by default, but you can always share the old posts if you want to remind friends of that big backpacking trip or college party. The feature is already making its way to mobile and web users worldwide, so don't be surprised if you soon have a good excuse to relive special moments in your life.
