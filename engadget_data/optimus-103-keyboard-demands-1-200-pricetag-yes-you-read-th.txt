That's twelve hundies, for those keeping track at home, ten times the current price of the Optimus mini three 1.5. Sure, nobody expected this thing to be cheap, but $1,200 might be asking a bit much. Luckily, prices will be dropping to a "mere" sub-grand in September of 2007, and at that rate we'll be able to afford one of these things right around the time that thought-based typing becomes the input method of choice. Well, at least our dreams of keyboard heaven were fun while they lasted. If you're just crazy enough to try it, you can pre-order the keyboard on December 12th.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
