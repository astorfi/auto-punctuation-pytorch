Where workers once made 900 yuan (about $132) per month, Reuters reports that should workers pass a three-month review, they could pull in 2,000 yuan ($293) in the same period. However, Foxconn's not saying what would qualify an individual for the review. Even should they not pass, wages will be 30 percent higher than before the company's labor scandals were brought to light, and before a string of twelve laborers reportedly committed suicide.
