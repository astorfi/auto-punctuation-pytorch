While the outfit (understandably) couldn't showcase the BlackBerry Torch 9850 at its London launch event this morning, the CDMA sibling to the Torch 9860 is making its official debut in the US of A. Destined for US Cellular and Sprint here in the States, the 9850 (shown right) will ship with a 3.7-inch WVGA (800 x 480) touchpanel, BlackBerry 7 OS, a "waterfall" screen design that tickles the edges ever-so-slightly, and not one inkling of a physical keyboard. As with the 9860 -- which is destined for AT&T, Rogers, Telus and Bell -- you'll get a five megapixel "zero-shutter lag" camera, 720p movie mode, inbuilt GPS and a 1.2GHz processor. There's no mention yet of a price or release for the SIM-less duo, but you can bet that we'll keep you posted as we hear more.

Update: Sprint's just pushed out a full presser of its own (embedded after the break), which also confirms that the Bold 9930 -- shown above on the left -- will also be making its way onto The Now Network. We're told to expect "fall" availability for both BB 7 OS phones, but specific pricing isn't expected until that already-ambiguous time frame draws nearer. As for the 9930, it's boasting an all-too-familiar design, with a 10.5mm-thick chassis, 2.8-inch capacitive touchpanel, the "widest QWERTY keyboard available on a BlackBerry smartphone" and a trackpad to boot. Moreover, NFC support is thrown in, as is a magnetometer for AR apps.

Update 2: A trusted source just informed us that the Torch 9850 will soon go for $199 on contract (and after rebate) at US Cellular, or $549 with no strings attached.
