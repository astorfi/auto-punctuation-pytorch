 So much for the idea that Blu-ray has better studio support. As if the race wasn't close enough to begin with, now that Paramount has gone HD DVD exclusive, we don't see how Blu-ray will keep up. Of course when Fox, Disney and MGM get in the game the way Warner, Universal and Sony have this could change. Fox does have a few titles on track for next week, so we'll keep a close eye out for BD+. Either way, HD DVD has hit the 300 title mark and regain the lead from Blu-ray -- who only held it for seven months. There are a few big titles for both camps this week, as Universal brings us Knocked Up and Sony has another hit with subtitles in Black Book. Warner continues to deliver cult classics like Gothika, and they continue to try to make up their loses on Gods and Generals and Wyatt Earp.
