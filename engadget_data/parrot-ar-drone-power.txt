We'll say this about the AR.Drone's battery life up to now: it always seemed perfectly suited to our short attention spans. For those able to focus on flying objects a bit longer, however, there's the AR.Drone 2.0 Power Edition. The quadricopter's already gotten some love abroad and is set to hit our shores this month, priced at $370 over at that fine purveyor of massage chairs, Brookstone. This time out, the limited edition phone-controlled device brings 36 minutes of flight time (not the first boost we've seen from the company), thanks to two 1,500mAh lithium-polymers. Also new are sets of color blades (including black for when you're feeling a bit stealthier).
