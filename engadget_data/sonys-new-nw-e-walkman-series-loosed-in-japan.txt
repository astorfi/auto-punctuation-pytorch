Now they've made their rightful debut in Japan where the 4GB (NW-E016), 2GB (NW-E015), and 1GB (NW-E013) flash players will hit on April 21st for ¥20,000 ($168), ¥14,000 ($117), and ¥11,000 ($92), respectively. However, at least in Japan they'll also be hitting in a flourish of springtime colors supporting uncompressed Linear PCM audio and AAC support to get your DRM-free EMI on. Otherwise, these appear to be the euro-equivalent of what we've already seen: three-line OLED display with album art, a slight 29-grams, and up to 30-hours of audio playback... you know, when listening to all those ATRAC3 files you don't have.[Via Impress]
