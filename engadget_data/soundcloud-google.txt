Hear some amazing new song you've just got to share with your Circles? After introducing a Google+ sign-in, way, way back in May, SoundCloud and Mountain View have teamed up to offer music embedding on the social network. Now you can share a song that's playable directly in Google+, with no need to open a new tab. Click the share button, add some optional text and voila, the widget will appear on your page -- that is, if the song's original poster is cool with it. Sharing only works on songs when the functionality is enabled. More info in the source link below.
