Whatever plans a company may have to keep its crown jewels a secret, the FCC's always here to spill the beans. LG's the latest to have its future intentions scuppered after documents revealed that the company is working on the V500, a 9.8-inch (or thereabouts) tablet. The news is a bit of a surprise, given that the Korean giant had previously stated an intention to concentrate on smartphones over tablet devices. Unfortunately, the only specs we found in our trawl were related to the dual-band 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 LE -- but given what hardware LG managed to cram into the G2, we're hopeful that there will be a similarly impressive engine under this hood.
