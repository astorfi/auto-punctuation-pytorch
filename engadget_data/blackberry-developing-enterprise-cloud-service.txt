BlackBerry is in dire straits, but a freshly announced enterprise cloud service could be something of a Lazarus Pit. A post to Inside BlackBerry for Business Blog states that the service will allow admins to keep an eye on employee smartphones and tablets as well as distribute apps. This apparently won't require any IT experience or servers, and will cost "less than a cup of coffee" per user per month. The as yet unnamed service will operate across Android and iOS as well as BlackBerry, which could make it attractive as a BYOD tool and potentially keep it relevant regardless of the Canadian firm's manufacturing future.
