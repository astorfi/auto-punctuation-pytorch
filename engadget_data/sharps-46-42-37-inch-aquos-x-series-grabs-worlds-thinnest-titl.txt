These lookers aren't just skinny though, they're dense as a product waif too. Each comes stuffed with a 120MHz panel offering a 15,000:1 dynamic contrast, 450 cd/m2 brightness, and 12-bit BDE color value rendering for smooth image quality. Add to it a 1-bit digital amplifier, 3-way 8-speaker system, and a vast suite of jacks including 3x 1080p HDMI 1.3a inputs, DVI for your PC, Ethernet, and Firewire and you'll seriously consider setting aside the dough for a new set when these hit Japan in March. How much? Nothing announced... but does it matter?
