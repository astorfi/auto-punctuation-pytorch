We're still ironing out some bugs and making a bunch of improvements, but it was getting really difficult not to
blurt out that we're launching Engadget China, a new Chinese language
version of Engadget. The site is edited by Jason Chiang and will feature translations of Engadget posts, as well as
original stuff specifically for the Chinese market, and will be the first of several foreign language editions of
Engadget that we'll be launching in the coming months.
