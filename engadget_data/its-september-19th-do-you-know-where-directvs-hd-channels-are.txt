       The 19th of September isn't over yet, but at this point, we're going to really take a leap and assume that DirecTV 10 isn't ready just yet. As disappointed as we are, the real kick in the head is that we still don't know when the big day is. Sure, DirecTV never said today was the day, but they did say mid September and most people really had their hopes set on the 15th. Either way, we'd feel a whole lot better if DirecTV would let us know what the deal was rather than telling us, it will be up when it's up and that will be some time this year.
