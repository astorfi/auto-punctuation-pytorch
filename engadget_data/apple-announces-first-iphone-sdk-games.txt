For starters, we've got Touch Fighter and Spore (!!!), the first of which was somehow thrown together in two weeks, the latter of which won't be available until September. Also, users can expect Super Monkey Ball, which was hailed being a notch above your average "cellphone game." For whatever it's worth, EA also affirmed that more iPhone titles were in the pipeline, and best of all, those elusive titles are already "in early stages of development." Simmer on that for a second, we'll keep updating as we get more in.
