Unsurprisingly surfacing on none other than eBay, the world's first Xbox 360 Elite bundle to leave Target's doors in a customer's hands has arrived, and if the small bevy of photos and actual receipt aren't enough to arraign some careless bullseye-sporting employee, we don't know what is. Of course, if you're still unwilling to shell out the above-MSRP asking price, you can always patiently place a pre-order, enjoy the hands-on photos, and envision yourself in the place of those Microsoft drones playing with it on video.[Via Joystiq]
