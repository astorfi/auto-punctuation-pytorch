 Remember how you were always supposed to have another light on
while you were watching TV? Or you'd go blind or something? We didn't either until we saw the Philips Ambilight flat
screen TV. It throws an "intelligent" light behind the TV that can change colors with the program you're watching, a
feature we've certainly never missed. Comes in 32', 37', 42 and 50' models starting at $5,500 and going up to $11,000,
which seems to be a bit pricey for what amounts to cheesy mood lighting. The speaker panels are actually the outer
surface of the TV, which is pretty cool. Maybe that's where your money's going.
