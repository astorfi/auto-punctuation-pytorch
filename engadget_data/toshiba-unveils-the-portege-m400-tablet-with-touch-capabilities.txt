Apart from that, the 4.4-pound machine also features a modular drive bay with dual-layer burner, spill-resistant keyboard, latchless lid, and a shock-absorbing magnesium frame. Nothing too exciting going on internally: the M700 is a pretty standard Santa Rosa-based machine, with processor choices ranging from a 1.8GHz T7100 Core 2 Duo to a 2.4GHz T7700, integrated X3100 graphics, memory expandable to 4GB, Bluetooth and WiFi. Available now in configurations priced from $1699 and going up from there.
