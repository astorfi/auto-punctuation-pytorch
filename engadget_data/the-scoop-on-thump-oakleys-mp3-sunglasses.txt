Those uglyÂ sunglasses with the built-in MP3
player we posted about this morning? They're for real, and you won't have to be Lance Armstrong to get a pair.
Oakley is going to sell "Thump", as they're calling the sunglasses, to the non-Tour-de-France-winning general public
beginning in December. Thump (which we're already finding annoying to write) will come in 128MB and 256MB versions,
have a battery life of six hours, support for both MP3 and WMA audio files, and sport volume and track controls on the
eyestem.
