It won't be officially announced until tomorrow, but we're very impressed that Motorola was able toÂ  keep their
new razorthin V3 cameraphone a secret for this long, since this is one of those phones that you just can't help
blabbing about. It's a mere 14mm thick, with a casing made mostly of titanium and pretty much everything else you hope
for in a handset this thin, like a built-in digital camera, Bluetooth, a 4,096 color external LCD, and a 262,000 color
main LCD. Due out in September with an expected price somewhere around $700.
