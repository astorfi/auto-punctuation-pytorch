Taiwan's First International Computer
(FIC) has upgraded its AquaPAD webpad; the AquaPAD+
now includes 802.11g WiFi, IrDA, PCMCIA, USB, VGA output and embedded Linux, powered by a Transmeta Crusoe running at
800 MHz to 1 GHz. The 2.6-pound unit has an 8.4-inch 800x600 touchscreen display, and can also run Windows XP, XP
Embedded or CE (it includes a CF/Microdrive slot as well). As is the case with most other small tablets, this is
designed for vertical markets such as health care and inventory control, not for kicking back on the couch and
browsing, though you could certainly use it for that if you're prepared to pay about $1,100 for the convenience.
