If you're Samsung, the answer apparently lies  somewhere south of the 5.9 millimeters put up by its latest fashion accessory, the appropriately  named "Ultra Edition 5.9." For the record, that's a solid millimeter less than the previous world's thinnest,  Samsung's own X820  -- the phone allegedly shown  snapping helplessly in two on video under fairly minimal pressure. Of course, the authenticity of  said video has been repeatedly called into question, but either way, we're hoping this new one has  been fabbed with some pretty crazy space-age resins and polymers that'll keep it from multiplying in  our pockets. Specs include a tri-band GSM radio (though recent  announcements have us encouraged that an American version could be down the pike), a 3.2  megapixel cam, Bluetooth, and 80MB of onboard storage. Look for the record-smashing Ultra Edition 5.9  to start gracing European pockets bulge-free some time in March.[Thanks, Tony]
