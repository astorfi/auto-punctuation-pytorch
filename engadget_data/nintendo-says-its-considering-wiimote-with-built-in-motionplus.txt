That word comes straight from Nintendo's Katsuya Eguchi, who told a developer round table that, "as to looking at whether or not it will be an attachment or built in - we're always looking at how hardware should evolve and where we should take it," and that, "it's something we'll be looking at." Katsuya also insisted that MotionPlus wasn't an acknowledgment that the original Wiimote was somehow lacking, saying that Nintendo is "very happy" with what it did, but that, "of course, you always want more."[Via Yahoo!
