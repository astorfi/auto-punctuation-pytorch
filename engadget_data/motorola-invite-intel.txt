Intel's co-signed the ticket, with the partnership offering to "take us to the edge" for an exciting announcement from the pair. We're kinda assuming it's got something to do with Santa Clara's mobile chip offerings, since the companies teamed up for a "multi-year, multi-device" partnership in January that promised fresh hardware from the pair arrive in the second half of 2012.
