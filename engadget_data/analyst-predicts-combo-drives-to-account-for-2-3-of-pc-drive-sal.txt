 The only thing better than one analyst's opinion on the format war is...yet another analyst's opinion on the format war! ABI Research chimes in, expecting the currently high-priced hybrid HD DVD / Blu-ray PC drives to match price with Blu-ray-only drive in 2009, and exceed their sales in 2010. Also seen as not for long on this mortal coil: dedicated high definition decoding chipsets. ABI expects Intel and AMD's integrated chipsets to have more than enough horsepower for HD codecs in upcoming PCs. ABI has previously brought us predictions including HD DVD leading the way in 2006 and HDTV to Media Center PC connections tripling this year, so we'll wait and see how this one works out.
