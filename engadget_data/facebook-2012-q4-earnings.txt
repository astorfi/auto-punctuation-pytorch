 Facebook's Q3 earnings left something to be desired, as the social network posted a net loss. Zuckerberg and company have ended 2012 on a financial high note, however, as Facebook raked in $1.585 billion in revenue -- an increase of 40 percent year-over-year -- and net income of $64 million. The number of folks on Facebook also continues to grow, with its monthly active user count burgeoning to 1.06 billion as of December 31, 2012.

 Of particular interest is the breakdown of daily mobile vs. web users -- more folks used Facebook on phones and tablets than on the web for the first time in the company's history. Revenue generated from mobile isn't commensurate with the usage stats, however. Mobile advertising accounted for just 23 percent of the 'book's total ad revenue, though that is an increase from 14 percent in Q3, so that imbalance may not remain much longer. We'll be listening in on the earnings call and updating things here as more details are revealed, so stay tuned.



 Update: On the call, Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg talked at length about the importance that mobile will play in Facebook's future, going so far as to declare that Facebook is now a mobile company. Naturally, they were referring to the growing mobile user base and ad revenue it generates. As for hardware, well, Zuck was emphatic that we won't be seeing a Facebook-made handset -- "we're not going to build a phone." Glad that's settled.
