Our favorite leaksters just let slip the latest RC creation from Wowwee, the FlyTech Dragonfly, which Wowwee bills as the "world's first radio-controlled flying insect." The Dragonfly flies by flapping its ultra-light wings, and can be used indoors and outdoors. Power is provided by an internal battery which can provide around 10 minutes of flying time, and can be recharged by perching the Dragonfly on the controller, which sports six AA batteries and can charge the RC insect in around 15 minutes. The wings and rear propellor (which is used to control "trim," all helicopter-style) are user-replaceable, but for the most part the bug is fairly crash resistant. There's around 150 feet of wireless range, along with "beginner" and "expert" control modes. In traditional Wowwee style, there are plenty of LEDs involved, informing the user of battery life, controller status and other fun things, but unfortunately there's not a whole lot of "robot" going on here. And of course, there's no word on price or availability yet, since this just hit the FCC. Wowwee at least has a few kinks to work out of its manual, since the FCC version of which still includes the line, "Note: When using the FlyTech Dragonfly, some adult supervision is required." Followed by the parenthetical: "Do we need this here? Is QC requiring it?" We're sure that once they figure out that whole "will it destroy children" sitch, this thing won't be far from retail shelves. Peep the controller and a features diagram after the break.Read - FCC: Wowwee's FlyTech DragonflyRead - FCC: Dragonfly controller
