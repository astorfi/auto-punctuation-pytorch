       You know times are good when we are surprised when it is more than a week between new HD channel announcements. This week we have a few more channels for you, but not as many of details as we would like on any of them. Discovery will be launching what they are calling four new channels, but one of them is an HD simulcast of the Discovery channel. We're not sure if this will replace the Discovery HD Theater that we have all come to love, or just add even more HD content, but they will also be launching HD simulcast versions of TLC, Animal Planet and The Science Channel. These new channels from Discovery will be carried at launch by at least DirecTV this September. Also mentioned in the press release as coming this year is CNBC and Chiller (who?). While it is still questionable if DirecTV will carry 100 HD National channel this year, -- at least without counting sports packages -- this will certainly be remember as a big year in the transition of cable TV channels to HD. A full list of the channels announced to date after the break.
