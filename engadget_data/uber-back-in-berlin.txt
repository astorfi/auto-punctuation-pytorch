Last week, regulators in the city of Berlin parked Uber's ride-sharing service, citing the risk to passenger safety and the need to protect taxi operators. However, today a judge in the Berlin Administrative Court suspended the ban imposed by State Department of Civil and Regulatory Affairs just a few days ago. This means that the UberPOP and UberBlack are back in action until another decision says otherwise, because as you might expect, the local taxi industry won't be too pleased with the decision.
