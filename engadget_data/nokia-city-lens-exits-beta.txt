The wait has come to a welcome (if abrupt) end with the finished version quietly reaching the Windows Phone Marketplace for Lumia owners. From initial appearances, the augmented reality app is functionally the same as its test edition. Point the camera and you'll be shown points of interest in your field of view, with ratings and directions to get you on your way -- if you've seen Yelp's Monocle mode, you'll know the score. Don't be surprised if the source link doesn't initially work, as City Lens is slowly trickling out to Microsoft's servers, but do expect a quicker trip to the sushi bar when the app is in your hands.
