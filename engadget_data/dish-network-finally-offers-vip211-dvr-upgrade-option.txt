For the same one-time $39.99 activation fee that allows users to add space to ViP622 model DVRs, they can hook up 50GB - 750GB of HDD space via USB 2.0 and have a typical single tuner DVR experience, apparently without additional monthly service charges. While not exactly a game changing feature, it could be just what's needed to keep the DISH faithful hanging around a while longer when it's available by the end of the month.
