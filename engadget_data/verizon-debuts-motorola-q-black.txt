The new Q bears the same $199 pricetag of its silver counterpart, but features a $50 rebate instead of the $100 rebate of its sibling, giving Black a $50 premium over its drab companion. Instead of the original's holster, the Black features a carrying case, and there's that "MOL2" update to enjoy, but otherwise there isn't much new to see here. The black coloring apparently isn't only skin deep, so scratches shouldn't reveal anything embarrassing, so that's good news. While you can snag this thing right now online, it won't be showing up in retail until January 12th, according do our tipsters last week. We should also be seeing that MOL2 software update, which irons out a few kinks and improves battery life, rolled out to those gen 1 Qs shortly.[Via Qusers]
