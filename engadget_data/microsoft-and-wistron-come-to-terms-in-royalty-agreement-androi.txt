Wistron Corp, a spinoff of Acer, is the latest company to make an agreement with Microsoft in a string of lawsuits and royalty clashes that's spanned the course of two months. While we've seen Android suppliers such as Itronix and Velocity Micro come to agreements with the folks in Redmond, as well as others like Motorola and Barnes & Noble becoming courtroom fodder, this is the first time Chrome OS has been targeted. Wistron's an ODM (original design manufacturer) that supplies other companies with computers, tablets and e-readers using either Google OS, so it's not necessarily a surprise that it signed up for the Microsoft lawsuit prevention plan. Scant details are available aside from the fact that royalties will be collected as a result. Now that Chrome is involved, it not only shows that Team Ballmer isn't backing down, it appears to have even more companies in its crosshairs -- we just wonder who's next on the list. Full (albeit brief) PR after the break.
