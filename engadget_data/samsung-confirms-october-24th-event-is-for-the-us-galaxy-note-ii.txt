 Ever since Samsung issued invitations for its October 24th event, it's become increasingly clearer that the New York City gathering would center on the Galaxy Note II. After all, we've tried almost every US version so far, and nothing else has loomed on the horizon. Just in case there was any lingering uncertainty, though, Samsung sent us that promised formal invitation with exact details of what's going on: it's the US stop for the Galaxy Note II World Tour, with a press event that night followed by a "consumer celebration" later on that might bring a public side to the affair. Most American editions of the phablet have been announced or re-announced, which suggests to us that we'll primarily get firmer release dates and prices while we're busy hobnobbing.
