ASUS didn't bother sharing too many specifications, but that didn't stop us from hunting down a placard with the deets we were craving. Whenever the company decides to ship it, it'll be available with Core i3, Core i5 and Core i7 options, up to 16GB of DDR3 memory on the quad-core machines (8GB of DDR3 on the dual-core rigs), a LED-backlit "HD" display, NVIDIA "Enthusiast" graphics, room for a pair of hard drives (or an SSD / HDD combo system), an optional Blu-ray drive, USB 3.0 ports and an HDMI 1.4 port for piping those 3D signals to your 3D HDTV. Per usual, there's no mention of a price tag, but hopefully we'll be clued in sooner rather than later.

Update: Two other gaming lappies were slipped in today by ASUS: the 17.3-inch G73Jw and G51 3D, neither of which have their specs sheets in public view.
