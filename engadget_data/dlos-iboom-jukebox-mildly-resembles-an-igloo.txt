Unfortunately, this thing's ability to conjure up said memories is probably its standout feature -- well, aside from the RF remote that enables users to browse iPod content right on its screen (shown after the break). Outside of that, you'll find a totally average speaker setup consisting of twin one-inch tweeters and three-inch woofers along with a set of touch-sensitive controls atop the device itself. Reportedly, the iBoom JukeBox is slated to further saturate the iPod speaker system market this Spring for $199.99.[Via MacMinute]
