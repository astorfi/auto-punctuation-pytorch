In the latest development to this censorship saga, Reuters reports that a court in the Turkish capital has declared the YouTube situation a human rights violation, and instructed that the block be removed. Well, almost, as the court did state 15 specific videos could stay restricted, but that a blanket ban was unnecessary. The ruling tipped its hat to a similar decision from Turkey's Constitutional Court, which previously declared the Twitter lockdown a violation of free speech. Regardless of this official order, it's still up to the powers that be to do the unbanning, but we doubt they'll be up for bearing the pressure to do so much longer. If certain politically sensitive videos stay unavailable when that happens, though, then the Turkish Prime Minister and Co. have kind of won anyway, we'd say.
