 
We know you've all been waiting patiently to find out the winners of the Engadget commercial contest, and to whom the spoils (that Sony Vaio VGN-AR190G Blu-ray laptop, MSRP $3,400) went. We received nearly 100 commercials, which totally blew our mind, but today is all about the winner of the contest, as well as eight runners up we selected after a few grueling sessions. All these commercials were so good that we had to give a new iPod shuffle to the other eight who didn't take home the laptop. To everyone else who entered, thanks so much for your submissions! We'll be airing more commercials very soon, but for now click on for the top nine!
