Rather than staying one step ahead of its fiercest rival, it sounds like Advanced Micro Devices is perfectly content with being a few months behind. Based on words from CEO Dirk Meyer, the company is hoping to "ramp up" production of 32 nanometer processors -- which Intel has already demonstrated -- in the middle of next year, with volume production hopefully starting in Q4. Of course, these chips will be among the first not actually built by AMD; instead, they'll be fabricated by the newly spun Foundry Company, so we suppose the lag is little easier to understand. Oh, and there's also the fact that "AMD isn't in a race with Intel on all technologies," though the business bone inside of us thinks it should be.
