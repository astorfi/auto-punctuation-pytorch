 The U3 standard for mobile applications continues to gain steam, with Kingston being just one of the latest to add anotherU3-compatible flash drive to its lineup. The U3 Data Traveler, now in capacities of up to 2GB, comes bundled withmobile versions of the Pass2Go password manager, the ACDSee image browsing application and the Zinio e-reader. It wouldbe nice if Kingston could also throw in mobile versions of apps like Firefox and Thunderbird, but it's easy enough todownload them from the U3 site. Kingston's a little vague on whether the softwareon the drive consists of free "lite" versions, or trials of the full-featured programs, so don't be surprisedif you're hit with nags after using the drive for a while. The 1GB version has an MSRP of $47, while the 2GB goes for$75.
