Not so much. While it seems Sony has had its fill of offensive messages -- for now, at least -- they've managed to pull off one of the least convincing viral marketing campaigns in recent memory, sparking that special kind of public outcry that it seems we all keep pent up for Sony offenses. The controversy centers on these "all i want for xmas is a psp" fools you might've seen floating around YouTube. Bloggers "charlie" and "jeremy" have been posting up ridiculous rap videos, remarkably slick print-out ads and oh-so-indie t-shirt iron-ons in an effort to convince "j's parents that a psp would be teh perfect gift." Oh, and you all can feel free to use the material for your own ad campaign on the 'rents. Sounds harmless, and we're sure it would be if Sony just put its name on the proceedings from the get-go, but waiting for Something Awful forum members to point out Zipatoni (Sony's apparent viral marketing firm on this campaign) as the domain registrar, and everybody else to laugh at the sheer audacity of Sony for thinking they'd get away with this one, probably wasn't the best foresight on Sony's part. Feel free to peep a couple ridiculous YouTube vids after the break, but just make sure you don't get sucked in, it's all a scam we tell you! Oh well Sony, at least those Bravia ads are still pretty neat.[Via Wired]
