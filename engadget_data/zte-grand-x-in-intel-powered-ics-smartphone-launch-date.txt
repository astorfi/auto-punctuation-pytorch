 
 It was all getting a little quiet on Intel-powered smartphone front, but now ZTE's decided to refresh its not-so-elderly Grand X with a Medfield processor and Ice Cream Sandwich. Part of ZTE's showing here at IFA, it's the company's first Android 4.0 device, running on an Atom Z2460. Expect HSPA+ speeds up to 21Mbps, alongside some familiar Grand X specs. This includes a 4.3-inch 960 x 540 screen, while this model now packs an 8-megapixel camera and 1,650mAh battery. ZTE's latest redesign will arrive in Europe at the start of next month -- and we'll be tracking down a model in Berlin later today.
