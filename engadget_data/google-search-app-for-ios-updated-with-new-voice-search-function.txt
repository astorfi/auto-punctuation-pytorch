 Google just released an updated version of its Search app for Android devices yesterday, and it's now (as promised) also delivered a fairly big update to iOS users. That brings with it iPhone 5 compatibility, but the bigger news is the expanded voice search functionality, which promises "faster and significantly improved voice recognition," with spoken responses Ã  la Google Now provided alongside the search results. Those additions also extend to iPad users in addition to the iPhone and iPod touch -- hit the App Store or the link below to take it for a spin yourself.
