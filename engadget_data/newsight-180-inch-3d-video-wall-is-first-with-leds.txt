Each LED is arranged at a pitch of 6mm, similar to current LCD 3D technology, so it can display the same content that's been popping up as of late. The 180-inch 3D LED Video Wall is capable of combining with three others to form a 360-inch screen, with a 20,000 hour warranty period on its LEDs and NewSight's digital signage background, we can imagine watching a game or being hounded by eerily-realistic Black Friday ads very soon.
