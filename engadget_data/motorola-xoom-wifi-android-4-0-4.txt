   Tales of leaked Android 4.0.4 builds have been told for months, and we've even heard whispers of 4.0.5 coming to the Samsung Galaxy Nexus in the very near future. We still haven't seen any official firmware rollouts of either version, until now. Owners of the Motorola Xoom WiFi should be getting their hands on an update to 4.0.4 -- also known as build IMM76 -- any time now. According to an email from Moto announcing the update, the latest refresh offers improved stability, quicker screen rotation, better phone number recognition, camera and image quality improvements, enhancements to Microsoft Exchange and even a new setting that lets you choose whether you want the power button to lock the device immediately or not.  If you aren't seeing the update hit yet, Droid-Life has reported that the file is available for download thanks to XDA, but it appears that some users have experienced errors when attempting it. So if you're feeling adventurous and don't want to wait for the OTA download, feel free to give it a shot. You'll need to drag the file into a USB stick, plug it in using a USB host cable and boot your Xoom into stock recovery.
