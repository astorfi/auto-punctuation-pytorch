This time around, the Vietnamese site is claiming that Samsung's 7-inch Tab will be running Android 2.2 (Froyo) on an A8 processor clocked to a peppy 1.2GHz. It's all powered by a 4,000mAH battery that contributes to the tablet's 370-gram weight with 16GB of on-board storage and up to 32GB of microSD expansion. Oh, and the 7-inch panel is said to be of Samsung's Super AMOLED variety which should make it readable outdoors judging by its smaller sibs. Sounds hot, but we'll have to see how Samsung's TouchWiz UI holds up to being stretched across all that very expensive screen-estate.

P.S. We've also been told that it'll be called the "Galaxy Tape," not Tab or S-Tab as previously rumored.
