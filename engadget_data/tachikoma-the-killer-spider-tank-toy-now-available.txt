       While it's no Spidernaut robot, fans of the anime series Ghost in the Shell will surely appreciate this new robot creation of the Tachikoma. Although Wikipedia tells us that regular Tachikoma "are as large as an average sedan," this miniature version probably could fit in your desk drawer. From what we can tell based on the videos, it only speaks Japanese, except for a high-pitched "bye-bye!" that is accompanied by a really cute wave. Cute for an anime robot, anyway. If you can read Japanese, tell us what the rest of the page says in the comments, m'kay?[Via Robot Gossip]
