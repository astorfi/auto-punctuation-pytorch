The last time Samsung put on a show in Barcelona, it came bearing the Galaxy S5 and that love-it-or-hate-it bandage back. Not exactly a high point in the company's design history, you might say. Over the past year, though, the Korean juggernaut has come to the realization that it needs to pare down and push a few more envelopes, a philosophy that begat weird, arguably wonderful experiments like the Note Edge. So, Samsung, it's been a year -- how far have you come?


We have our answer. Meet the Galaxy S6 and the S6 edge.

The reason we're discussing both phones at the same time is simple: If you look closely enough, you'll find they're identical in almost every way that matters. Both sport bodies hewn of aluminum sandwiched between two layers of Gorilla Glass 4. Both sport 5.1-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED screens (more on them later). Both have Samsung's latest octa-core chipset thrumming away in them, chipsets that pair a quad-2.1GHz processor with a quad-1.5Ghz one. (Oh, and they've both got 3GB of RAM, just for good measure). Both support LTE cat. 6. Both are slated for a global launch on April 10th. You get where I'm going with this. Thing is, one is staggeringly prettier than the other.
