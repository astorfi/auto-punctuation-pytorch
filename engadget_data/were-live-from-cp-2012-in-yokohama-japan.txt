  As Macworld continues on its path towards irrelevance, another post-CES trade show is gaining heat on the other side of the Pacific. This is our first year at the CP+ Camera & Photo Imaging Show, taking place at Pacifico Yokohama, just a short from JR train ride away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. While the show itself is little known outside of Japan, it's prompted a barrage of camera announcements over the last few weeks. In addition to the dozens of new consumer models that are set to hit the market, CP+ also gives us another chance to fire off some flagship professional DSLRs, including the Canon 1D X, and the Nikon D4 and D800. We're also expecting to take a behind-the-scenes look at some new sensor tech -- and who knows, we may even find ourselves standing below an RC photo chopper or two -- so check back often to get your fill from what's shaping up to be one of the biggest photography trade shows of the year.
