No convertible form factors, just yet, but clamshells with multitouch screens -- you know, the kind of thing we marveled over when the TouchSmart tm2 came out two CES' ago. Sounds predictable enough, right? Well, get this: after he was done swiping the display, using pinch to zoom to magnify webpages, he launched a game, and used the accelerometer in the laptop to fly a plane into the horizon. That's right: you'll soon be able to game with your sub-three-pound laptop as you would with a smartphone or tablet. Let's just hope those Ultrabooks eventually stop ballooning back into straight-up notebook territory, eh?
