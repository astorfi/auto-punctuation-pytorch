 
We have to say it's a bit odd for HP to be announcing its own wireless streaming peripheral -- it seems like something more up IOGEAR or Belkin's alley -- but the $199 Wireless TV Connect is exactly what we've been waiting for in some respects. Sure, the box that you have to connect to your laptop via HDMI and USB for power is a bit on the large side, but it's capable of streaming 1080p content, including Blu-ray movies or protected content, to your TV and there's absolutely no lag when controlling the desktop on the big screen. We're not exactly sure what technology HP's using here -- we're thinking WHDI, though the company wouldn't confirm -- but the two box set can be used with any laptop on the market that has an HDMI port. Take that Intel WiDi! This is one we're absolutely planning to test out, but in the meantime check out the pics below.
