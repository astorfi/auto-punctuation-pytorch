There's not a lot to go on when looking at the teaser page for the simply-titled Drive, and aside from that delightfully green bow and a seductive "Coming soon" phrase, all we can make out is something akin to a scaled-down treadmill with a turgid windscreen. Okay, so maybe it's just an all-in-one PC of some sort (we can almost imagine a floating LCD behind that ribbon), but we'll leave the real guessing to you.[Thanks, Cheek]
