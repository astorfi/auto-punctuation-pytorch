Granted, Patakara's latest certainly isn't the first, but rather than just shaping your smile, this thing actually exercises the muscles around your mouth -- presumably to help you cheese more intensely for even longer periods of time (you superstar, you). Heck, there's even three models with different resistance levels for those totally committed. But let's be honest, you won't even give those fancy Body Trainer headphones a second glance -- are you really going to dedicate time each day for this? You are? Well, then by all means, hand over your Â¥5,250 ($52) and get to chompin'.[Via popgadget]
