 Sinclair Business Group, a Baltimore-area companythat owns several mid-western broadcast stations, has recently reached agreements with Insight Communications andWideOpenWest to allow them to provide their stations in high definition on their cable service. In Columbus however,Time Warner has most of the market and as yet has not reached a deal for their high definition services.Thechannels now broadcasting:

WICS/WICD (ABC 15/ABC 20) in Champaign/Springfield, IL 
WDKY (FOX 56) in Lexington, KY 
WYZZ (FOX 43) in Peoria, IL 
WSYX (ABC 6)and WTTE (FOX 28) in Columbus, OH (WideOpenWestalso)
WSTR (WB 64) in Cincinnati, OH 
WKEF (ABC 22) and 
WRGT (FOX 45) in Dayton, OH 
WZTV (FOX 17) and 
WUXP (UPN 30) in Nashville,TN and WMSN (FOX 47) in Madison, WI will also be available on a limited number of Insight cable systems in certainmarkets.

Sinclair indicates they will not reach deals without receiving "adequate consideration",so Time Warner subscribers, you may have those rabbit ears out for a while.
