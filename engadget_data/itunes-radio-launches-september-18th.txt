We heard rumblings a few weeks ago that Apple's streaming service was due to launch this month and now it seems those reports were true. The folks in Cupertino just announced that iTunes Radio will launch on September 18th in tandem with a redesigned iOS 7. The ability to create custom stations based on individual music tastes and personal iTunes libraries will hit Apple devices in a week's time. Of course, you'll need a $25-per-year iTunes Match subscription to keep listening to sessions ad-free, otherwise you'll be prone to regular interruptions of that Yacht Rock station every few minutes.
