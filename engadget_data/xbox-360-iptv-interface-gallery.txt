We kind of thought that Microsoft would be the content provider out of the gate but it looks like they might be partnering with established content delivery companies to supply your 360 with media. There are still a huge amount of unanswered questions we have regarding how it works, who's providing content, what kind of content we can expect (and at what quality / resolution), how much it will cost, etc. Yeah, basically we know nothing. Nothing except the fact that yet again we can't wait for the next generation of content consumption that will maybe finally allow us to ditch our horrid, unusable Motorola high def DVR.
