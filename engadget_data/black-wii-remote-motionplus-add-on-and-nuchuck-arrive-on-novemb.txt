The black Wii Remote comes bundled with a MotionPlus add-on -- obviously Nintendo doesn't want to risk too many more people picking up a controller without one -- and retails for $50, while the black Nunchuck (shown after the break) is all by its lonesome for $20. Unfortunately, still no word of a black Wii in the US to hang out with these finely tinted accessories.
