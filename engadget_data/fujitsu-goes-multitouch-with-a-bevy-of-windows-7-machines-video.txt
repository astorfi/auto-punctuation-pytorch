The headline F series (pictured) will be powered by an Intel Core 2 Duo P8700 processor, which represents 2.53GHz of ultra-efficient and plenty capable laptop hardware, and 4GB of RAM. Machines can be had in 23- or 20-inch varieties, with respective resolutions of 1920 x 1080 and 1600 x 900. There's also the MT series of 12.1-inch convertible tablets, which come with WACOM functionality and up to an SU9400 Intel CPU. Perhaps the most esoteric new offerings, however, are the NF/ER (laptops) and F/ER (desktops), which combine the hip new multitouch skills with specially designed keyboard and mouse inputs, as well as a support hotline, all in the name of getting the older generation in on the computing craze.
