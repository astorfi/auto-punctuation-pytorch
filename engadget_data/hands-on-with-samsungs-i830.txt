Just a refresher, this is the "updated" version of their QWERTY Pocket PC phone that (still) runsWindows Mobile 2003 SE, and has EV-DO, 64MB RAM and 128MB flash memory, a QVGA display, SDIO slot, and stereo speakers-- but this time the WiFi is out the door in favor of a GSM radio so you can get ya businessman on worldwide.
