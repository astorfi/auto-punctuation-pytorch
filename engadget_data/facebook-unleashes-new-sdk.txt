 At its Mobile DevCon in New York today, Facebook took the wraps off a new SDK for iOS. This marks version 3.5 of the development kit, with the biggest news being improvements to Open Graph. While devs have been able to leverage Facebook's Open Graph for mobile products before, new APIs being released should simplify the act of tapping into the vast repository of social data. One of the big improvements is the creation of an Object API, which removes the need to host a website with Open Graph-specific tags. There's also a new native dialog for sharing content to Facebook from any application. Perhaps less immediately important to users are the improvements to the login system, but it's a major initiative for Facebook. As the network moves to become a single sign-on platform for the web, streamlining the act of logging in to other properties using your Facebook account becomes increasingly important. The company's Douglas Purdy claims that the process is now 20-percent faster than the previous dialog. The biggest question still left hanging in the air is just when we can expect the SDK upgrades to be made available on Android. Purdy did promise that it would be coming "very quickly."
