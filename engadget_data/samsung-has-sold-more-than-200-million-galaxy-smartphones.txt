Want to know how big a player Samsung is in the smartphone market? The company now says that it's sold over 200 million Galaxy S phones since the line first went on the market in 2010. For reference, the Korean tech giant had notched up sales of 100 million Galaxy S devices as of slightly more than a year ago. Samsung isn't breaking down the sales by model, although it had sold over 40 million Galaxy S 4s as of last fall -- much of that 200 million clearly came from more recent customers. It's difficult to compare the data against other manufacturers, since few of them break out sales by range. Apple, for example, said that it shipped 700 million iOS devices of all kinds as of October. However, it's safe to say that Samsung remains a heavyweight at the high end of the smartphone market.
