Well, we're currently in the thick of that hot and hazy month with no clear sign of an incoming quad-core tablet, but certainly more release gossip. According to Fudzilla, multiple sources have confirmed ASUS' next Eee Pad Transformer will indeed be first in line to pack four cores, lending credence to Chairman Jonney Shih's claims the tab would be "impressive." Concrete launch details for the slate have yet to be announced, but if Shih's pre-CES timeline pans out, you'll only have four long months to wait for a Glow Ball hands-on.
