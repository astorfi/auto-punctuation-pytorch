Sprint's finally starting to roll out the device this week as the "Airave" in "select areas" of Denver and Indianapolis this week. Overall, the concept is very similar to T-Mobile's @Home service -- it connects through your ISP, racks up a monthly fee ($15 in this case, $30 for families), boosts your signal and doesn't deduct plan minutes -- but with the Airave, CDMA signals are served up instead of @Home's WiFi, which means any Sprint handset should work like a champ. The box itself runs $49.99, not a bad entry fee considering the healthy list of benefits it affords. Look for it in the rest of Denver and Indy along with Nashville later this year followed by a nationwide rollout in 2008.
