In short, they love the $8000 projector, which pumps out 1000 lumens, and sports a 10,000:1 contrast ratio. Iteven has a 3 year warranty to calm some of your longevity concerns, and is powered by Darkchip3 DLP from TI. They ended up purchasing the unit for their own use, soif you're looking for a rawkin' projector to tide you over until those 3-chip 1080p types come down in price, thismight just do the trick.[Via HDBeat]
