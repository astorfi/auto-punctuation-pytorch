Yes, we know video-over-broadband isn't as fabulous as it sounds; we've had long waits just downloading trailers via
DSL. This hasn't stopped companies like CinemaNow and Starz from offering thousands of
downloadable movies to users with ultra-fast connections, lots of patience, or no lives. So, it's not surprising to see
more companies — especially telcos and networks — trying to get in on the action. The latest entrants look to be
venerable British monoliths British Telecom and the British Broadcasting Corp. BT plans to offer programming over DSL,
and is even considering using their lines to offer high-definition programs, figuring it'll give them an edge of
broadcasters. Meanwhile, the Beeb is testing an Internet TV service called iMP, which they see as a way to expand their
audience; they haven't ruled out offering it to overseas viewers, which could be a cash cow, given the thousands of
British expats — not to mention Monty Python and EastEnders fans — scattered around the globe.
