The Hollywood Reporter mentions this applies to all forms of the Starz Play service, whether accessed through Netflix, Qwest, Verizon or otherwise, starting the premiere episode of its newest drama, Camelot, April 1st. If you enjoyed previous offerings like Party Down or Spartacus they'll still be available for streaming, but not with the same short delay watching you were used to in the old days.
