Just one day after the revamped nanos were announced at the "It's Showtime" event, some drool-worthy shots of the green and blue 2G nanos managed to surface, and now we're graced with a photoset containing the esteemed 8GB black-only model. Apparently following in the footsteps of the BlackBook, Apple is only offering the 8GB unit in a single color, so if black's your thing, be prepared to go high-end or bust in order to get one -- be sure to hit the read link for a luscious gallery of Tony Chang's presumably coveted 'Pod. Oh yeah, and PC Mag reviewed the 8GB unit, too, giving it a 4.5 / 5, and calling it the "finest flash player out there in terms of look and feel," and had only the usual nits with it: nonremovable battery, no FM tuner (oh, and something about buggy playback on longer tracks -- no way!). Still, looks for many to be a pretty solid investment; we'd suggest you wait until later today, however, to make any buying decisions on portable audio players, yeah?
