While we have no idea why someone would make a USB 2.0 hub in the shape of a button that could spark a civilization-ending nuclear war, we really can't fault them for creativity. We're also not sure why machine translation so consistently presents this as the "suicide bombing button," but take that as you will. There is no real functionality gained by the stylings, other than some blinky lights and blasting sound effect when you do activate the doomsday button, but it might just come in handy in light of a international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.[Via Impress]
