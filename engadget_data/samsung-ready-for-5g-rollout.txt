LTE might be all the rage right now, but next generation mobile technology is already in the works. According to Korea's Yonhap News Agency, Samsung has successfully tested its 5G platform, pulling down data at 1Gbps in recent tests. The company apparently needed 64 antenna elements to pull the trick off, but says the technology will be available to customers by 2020 -- matching the European Commission's goal quite nicely. It may not be the fastest 5G test we've seen in recent months, but we're not going to scoff at progress.
