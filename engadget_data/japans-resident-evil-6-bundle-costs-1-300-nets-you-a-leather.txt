  Engadget has seen plenty of limited edition items looking to lighten the wallets of oil barons and hedge fund managers alike. Now Capcom's readying its bundle for Resident Evil 6's Japan launch and it includes protagonist Leon's leather jacket -- available in sizes S, M, L and XL. A complete set of as-yet unrevealed "tablet cases", supposedly emblazoned with character designs will also arrive in the set, as those wealthy enough to afford the 104,000 yen ($1,300) set presumably have at least four devices to garnish with Resident Evil livery. Japanese one-percenters can hit up the preorder site -- with their choice of jacket size -- at the source below.
