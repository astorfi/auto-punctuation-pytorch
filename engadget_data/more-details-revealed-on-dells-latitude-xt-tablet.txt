Single or dual-core Intel ULV CPUs (with integrated graphics)
LED-backlit WXGA 1280 x 800 display option
Outdoor viewing WXGA 1280 x 800 display option
Pen and touch support (digitizer and touchscreen)
(3) USB 2.0 ports, Ethernet (duh), 1394, VGA out
WiFi options up to 802.11n, optional Bluetooth
Optional 3G (HSDPA, EV-DO Rev. A)
ExpressCard slot, optional Smart Card slot, fingerprint reader

Exact date of release has been hard for us to hammer down, but it looks like Dell's still on track for Q3. Obviously, we'll keep you posted.
