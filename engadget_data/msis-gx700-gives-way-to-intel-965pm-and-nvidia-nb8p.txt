 It's no secret that CES gave way to a smorgasbord of new kit for us all to drool over, but it seems that MSI showcased two forthcoming technologies that weren't exactly set for public unveiling. NotebookReview happened to take a gander at the innocent looking 17-inch GX700, and in the process of admiring its expansive WSXGA+ display and Core 2 Duo processor, they also noted the strange black line crossing out the Intel 965PM chipset feature, which is supposedly the yet-to-be-disclosed "Crestline" chipset that will support the Santa Rosa (er, Centrino Pro) processor platform. Additionally, the lappie sports a full-size keyboard, dual-layer DVD burner, 4-in-1 card reader, 802.11a/b/g, Bluetooth, an optional DVB-T tuner, ExpressCard slot, audio in / out, and curiously enough, an NVIDIA NB8P graphics card, which also lacks a formal announcement of its existence. Of course, both of these mysterious components could face naming changes or technical revisions before getting official, but it's fairly safe to assume that we'll be seeing a new chipset / graphics card finding homes in laptops here before too long.[Via Laptoping]
