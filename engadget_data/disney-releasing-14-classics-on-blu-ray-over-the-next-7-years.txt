 We've got good news and bad news. The good news is that our children won't have to suffer through SD versions of their favorite movies forever, the bad is that it's going to take another seven years. This might be really bad news for some of us, because we don't know about anyone else, but our kids like to watch the same movies over and over again and suffering through DVD versions of Disney classics is very painful on a 60-inch Kuro -- we swear the damage is permanent. This is especially true when the latest Disney titles are already available on Blu-ray so we know exactly what our poor kids are missing. Seven years isn't forever though and over the that time Disney will be releasing two of its 14 biggest classics each year. Pinochio and Sleeping Beauty were released already, and Beauty and the Beast and Fantasia come next. All of them will of course be fully restored and included Dolby TrueHD 7.1 surround sound.
