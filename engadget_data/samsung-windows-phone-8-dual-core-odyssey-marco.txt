According to the filing that's been unearthed by The Verge, both are running on a dual-core 1.5Ghz Qualcomm MSM8960 chipset -- which is currently Samsung's chip of choice for LTE regions. The Odyssey looks set to be Samsung's high-end Windows Phone, with a 4.65-inch high-definition Super AMOLED display and NFC ready for Microsoft's own mobile payment plans. Meanwhile, the Marco will apparently forego the near-field delights and house a humbler 4-inch WVGA Super AMOLED screen, for a presumably gentler price. According to the legal documents, both devices are gearing up to launch in Q4 of this year -- after we've seen Windows Phone 8 in its entirety.
