Not that we'd judge who ultimately wins the
HD-DVD vs.
Blu-ray battle by which of the two competitors
get their beige-box OEM drives to market first, but you've got to appreciate Pioneer's BRD-101A. The drive hits up
dual-layer DVD±R/RWs, and, of course, the next gen optical format—but not CDs, oddly. Guess that third laser was just
too much. Still, something tells us this thing's going to cost slightly more than most white-label devices.
