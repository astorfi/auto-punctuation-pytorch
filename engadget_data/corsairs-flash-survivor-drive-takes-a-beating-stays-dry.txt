They had us with the swashbuckling, buoy-like Voyager, but if you're less Baywatch and more Survivor, their new, um, Survivor drive may be more inclined to float your boat. The 4GB and 8GB sticks screw into their protective aluminum canisters with a rubber seal to prevent water from invading precious content. While we're not exactly sure when these adventurous drives will be ready for your credit card, we're hoping they'll at least be ready for your carelessness.[Via Crave]
