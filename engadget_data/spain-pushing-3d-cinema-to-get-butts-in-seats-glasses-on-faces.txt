Believe it or not, Spain is said to be Europe's "worst-performing large film market," and Spanish producers are hoping that forthcoming 3D films such as Goleor and Holy Night! will reinvigorate national interest in a night out at the movies. Europe as a whole seems to be embracing stereoscopic footage as well, with 64 3D-capable screens now open across the UK, Germany, Spain and France.[Image courtesy of YoungGalleryPhoto]
