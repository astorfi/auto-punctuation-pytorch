It seems that like so many
other
wireless standards pending these days,
Wireless USB is having a bit of a time
getting off the groundâ€”first they stated their 1.0 revision would be done by the
end of last month, but now they're claiming it's set for
May 15. We're all about some new broadly accepted Bluetooth replacement that would rock 480Mbps speeds wirelessly up to
10 meters and all, but give us a call when it's all sorted out, yeah?
