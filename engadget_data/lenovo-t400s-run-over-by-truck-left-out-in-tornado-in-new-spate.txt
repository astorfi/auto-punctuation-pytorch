Well, we've caught another several glimpses of the latest ThinkPad, but this time, it's actually in the wild. As in, dropped in the middle of the road to be run over by a giant truck, or left in the downpour of a tornado. Sounds fun, right? No, it doesn't expand our knowledge of price or availability for this puppy, but it is fun to watch in a sick, twisted sort of way. Check both videos after the break.
