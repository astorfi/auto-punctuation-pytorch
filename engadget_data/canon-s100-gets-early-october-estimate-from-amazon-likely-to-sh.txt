Now it looks like the S95 successor may slip out of the warehouse a month earlier than promised, with Amazon estimating ship dates as early as October 3rd. In an industry where delays are much more prevalent than quiet early releases, this is certainly welcome news for the highly anticipated pocket cam, which packs a 12.1 megapixel CMOS sensor and f/2.0 (variable) zoom lens. Shipping estimates are always subject to change, so don't count on any miracles until that FedEx tracking number hits your inbox.
