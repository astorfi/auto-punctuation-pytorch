Beyond the VIERA Cast support for Amazon VOD, YouTube and other Internet content, this year's decks also include improvements in power consumption, with the BD60 drawing 16% less juice than last year's DMP-BD35. The DMP-BD60 can be had for a suggested $299, while the BD80 and BD70V are both priced at $399, depending on whether you prefer VHS or 7.1 analog outputs. Check out the CES 2009 hands on for a better look before these show up at a retailer near you.
