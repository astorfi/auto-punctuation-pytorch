 Just ahead of T-Mobile's event in New York City, we've noticed that the carrier has already listed the BlackBerry Z10 on its website. It looks like the smartphone will be available for a $100 down payment with a $18 monthly installment for 24 months, though the UnCarrier also lists the BB Z10 for $532 up front. Notably, the handset's page says it supports 4G LTE -- and we imagine we'll hear a good deal more about T-Mobile's network plans when the event kicks off in just a bit.

 Update: The BB Z10's arrival on Big Magenta is official, with CEO John Legere announcing the previously mentioned smartphone pricing on stage.
