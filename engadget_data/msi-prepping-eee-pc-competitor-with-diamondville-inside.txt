Diamondville is pretty much built from the ground up for powering low-cost ultraportables of the Eee PC's ilk, so we're sure to be seeing it in all sorts of cheap computers in the coming year or so, but MSI is one of the first to announce a budget laptop built around the platform. The chip is due to be formally unveiled in April, and MSI says the "when Diamondville is ready, our project will be ready." That should be around July or August, and we can't wait to see those design chops (pictured above) put to good use.
