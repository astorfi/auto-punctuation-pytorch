 
And finally, the puzzle pieces are coming together. There's been a lot of confusion the past few weeks about these two new models for Verizon in Motorola's pipeline, but by all accounts, this seems to be the A955 Droid 2 in its entirety -- the true successor to the original Droid, of course, and a distinctly different product than the more slate-like Xtreme. It looks like Moto has killed off the Droid's major pain points, giving the new model a more tactile keyboard and eliminating the nearly useless d-pad; the shiny bezel around the top half is a matter of personal opinion, but we don't think we mind it from the blurry shots we've seen.

As specs go, we're looking at a faster 750MHz OMAP core -- probably similar to the 720MHz silicon quoted in the XT720's data -- along with a 3.7-inch display, 8GB of internal storage paired with an 8GB microSD card in the box, and a 5 megapixel camera. What's missing is an HDMI port and Froyo -- current test units are said to be running 2.1, so hopefully we'll see a 2.2 upgrade in the near term. So, Droid owners: is this the golden ticket to get you to shell out another couple hundred dollars? As a bonus, follow the break for alleged video of the Droid 2's boot sequence, which shows a reworked version of the scary red droid eye we're accustomed to.
