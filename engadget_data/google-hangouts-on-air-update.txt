Did helping granny set up that Netflix account cause you to be late to your friend's big On Air Hangout? What would've been a calamity last week is but a minor hitch now. Earlier today, Google updated its live video streaming service with a new set of "highly requested" features. In addition to restarting a broadcast at will, recordings are now available on YouTube immediately after an On Air Hangout ends. As for you hams, video quality has been improved for mobile devices, so you'll look your absolute best no matter which screen your adoring public is watching you from. As a caveat, Google notes that you may experience some delays when setting up a broadcast, but it feels like a small price to pay given the upsides.
