It's a noble mission, and a daunting task, to which end they've pored through the EXIF data of over 500,000 of their user profile pics and came to a number of conclusions, including:

Panasonic camera users are "hotties," while Nikon users are "notties"
iPhone users are "doin' it" around twice as often as Android users
Using a camera flash adds seven years to your picture

There's more to the survey, and we definitely have our doubts as to the veracity of its conclusions, but we think we can all agree on one thing: make sure you remove the EXIF data from your pics before you go looking for a mate in cyberspace.
