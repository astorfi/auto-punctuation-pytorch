Vernon and Hudson Valley to be precise), but Fox Sports Net New York is set to become MSG Plus in mid-March. As expected, FSN NY HD will also become MSG Plus HD, but channel slots on TWC aren't expected to change. Around the same time, YES HD in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island will be relocating from channel 730 to 753, while NY1 HD gets added to the Time Warner Cable lineup in Woodside and Staten Island (only, unfortunately) on slot 701. For subscribers on Staten Island, you can also look forward to seeing Discovery HD (766), Animal Planet HD (786), TLC HD (752) and Science Channel HD (755). Needless to say, Manhattan gets the proverbial shaft yet again, but we'll keep you posted if things change. [Disclosure: Engadget is part of the Time Warner family]
