It might not be the biggest blunder on earth -- he stated that "The UMD model wasn't brilliant for third parties," and it certainly hasn't been -- but with rumors all over about Sony dropping the format in the near future, it's not looking good for those little ill-fated discs. Maguire went on to add, "The downloads side of it will increasingly become a bigger part of its future," so it looks like either way we know where Sony's emphasis lies, and we won't be shedding too many tears if / when it comes to pass.[Via Joystiq]
