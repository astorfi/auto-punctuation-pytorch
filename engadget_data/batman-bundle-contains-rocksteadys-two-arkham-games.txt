The Game of the Year version of Arkham Asylum includes a Trioviz 3D mode (a post-processed 3D presentation compatible with any television) and some extra challenge maps. The Game of the Year version of Arkham City tosses in a smattering of DLC packs: Harley Quinn's Revenge, Catwoman Pack, Nightwing Bundle pack, Robin Bundle Pack, Challenge Map Pack and Arkham City Skins Pack. In total, this equates to an additional seven maps, three more playable characters, 12 skins and more.

The next installment in the Batman Arkham series, Batman: Arkham Origins, is due October 25 on PC, Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii U. The prequel is currently in development at WB Games Montreal and, for the first time, adds a multiplayer component to the series.
