Although technically still in the beta phase of development, anyone with the right wallet size can now buy Google Glass in the US. The UK has had little exposure to the eminent wearable outside of special projects, but Google's decided it's time to let Brits get in on the fun, too. Early adopters of the UK can hand now over a cool £1,000 ($1,700) in exchange for a pair of Big G's spectacles, in the first general sale program outside of the US. You can opt for the generic frame in one of five colors, or spring for one of the prescription Titanium collection for £175 extra. Whichever you choose, though, don't expect to escape funny looks from the vast majority of Brits that'll finally be seeing the mythical wearable in the flesh for the first time.
