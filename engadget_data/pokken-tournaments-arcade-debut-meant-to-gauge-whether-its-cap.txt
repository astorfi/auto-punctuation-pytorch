Since Pokken Tournament is meant to be a complex, competitive game, Harada said it's important to watch the game's reception in a harsh community, where a round of play is typically 100 yen (~93 cents). Harada added that boring or unengaging games are quickly abandoned in the arcade scene, and that having Pokken Tournament survive in the environment would be something the team could be proud of.

Harada is co-leading Pokken Tournament's development with SoulCalibur series producer Masaaki Hoshino, with the left-field fighter due to try capturing an arcade audience in 2015.
