This one leaked out a bit ahead of schedule along with the rest of Microsoft's big CES announcements, but Robbie Bach has now gotten fully official with Game Room for the Xbox 360, which promises to recreate the old school arcade experience for you (and your avatar). Set to launch "this Spring," it'll initially give you access to thirty classic arcade games, which you'll be able to buy once and play on both your Xbox 360 and your PC. The real action seems to be on the Xbox 360 though, as that's where you'll be able to challenge your friends to a "show down," although there unfortunately doesn't seem to be any betting of Microsoft points instead of quarters. Head on past the break for a quick promo video.
