Thankfully, YouTube user stayfly2407 has come through with a video that, for the first time, clearly shows the Pixi running webOS 1.3.1, which may or may not be the version the phone actually ships with -- it was only just recently seeded to developers. The video unfortunately doesn't show any new features associated with this version, however, but it does seem to be speedy enough even in spite of the Pixi's slower processor. Head on past the break to see for yourself.
