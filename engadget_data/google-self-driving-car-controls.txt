One of the unique features inside Google's self-driving car is that it doesn't sport a steering wheel or a set of pedals. That won't fly on public roads in California though, so the folks in Mountain View are faced with adding them or sticking to closed-course testing. New regulations that go into effect next month require autonomous vehicles to let the driver take "immediate physical control" should the need arise. Google says it'll adhere to the rule by installing a temporary steering wheel and pedals in its 100 prototype cars set to begin testing on private roads in September.
