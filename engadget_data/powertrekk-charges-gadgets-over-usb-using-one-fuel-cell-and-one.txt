 
Portable fuel cell chargers have been around for years, but each seems to have lasered in on a single important quality thus far, such as a reasonable price, an easy refilling scheme, and a decent amount of power -- but never all of the above. Well, it doesn't look like MyFC's Powertrekk is the full package either, but it does have a pretty sweet looking case, which holds not only a disposable sodium silicide container to generate the hydrogen gas (which then gets recombined with oxygen in a proton exchange membrane to produce 1000mAh of usable electricity) but also a 1600mAh lithium-ion battery which can provide up to one amp of juice. This way, you've got a backup battery if you misplace your cans of fairy dust, and a buffer for the fuel cell too, allowing you to keep those volts in powder or electrochemical form instead of carting around combustable hydrogen -- which is always a nice bonus when you think about it. Shame there's no word on price quite yet, but you can see how it all works in a video after the break.

Unlike Other Portable Chargers, PowerTrekk Provides Instant and Reliable Power Anywhere, Making it Ideal for Outdoor Enthusiasts and Business Users in Emerging Markets.PowerTrekk is a pocket size, lightweight charger for users who spend time away from the electricity grid. Providing instant power anywhere, PowerTrekk uses advanced fuel cell technology which cleanly and efficiently converts hydrogen into electricity. With its rugged, waterproof casing and robust technology on the inside, PowerTrekk is designed to match demanding requirements.PowerTrekk is a 2-in-1 solution that is both a portable battery pack and fuel cell. The portable battery pack can be operated on its own as a ready source of power or storage buffer for the fuel cell. The fuel cell enables instant charging from a depleted battery state without ever needing a wall charge. Users simply insert a fuel pack and add water. To charge portable devices - for example mobile phones, cameras and GPS devices - users connect a device to Power Trekk via a USB port."PowerTrekk has a competitive edge over traditional portable chargers. Fuel cell power is generated immediately and charging is not impacted by weather or the position of the sun, as for solar panels. Compared to battery powered travel chargers, PowerTrekk offers reliable charging as the fuel packs do not deplete as batteries do," said Bjorn Westerholm, CEO at myFC, the company behind PowerTrekk.myFC is a Swedish fuel cell technology company that develops solutions for powering portable electronics. Having secured numerous patents around proprietary shape-flexible fuel cell systems with record high power density, PowerTrekk is the first commercial portable charger using myFC technology. Since the hydrogen fuel can be supplied from several alternative sources, the system is "flexifuel". The chemistry process is safe and eco-friendly, and the only by-product from the fuel cell is a little water vapor.Further information/images: http://www.powertrekk.comWorldwide launch of PowerTrekk at Mobile World CongressSee PowerTrekk at MWC in Barcelona, Hall 2.0, Stand 2F13.
