 
Word on the street has it that the Samsung P3 will be getting its official launch at CES in January, and to whet your appetite we've got a video unboxing for you courtesy of those crazy kids at Generation MP3. Apparently the same form factor as the venerable P2 (but in an all aluminum enclosure), the PMP sports haptic touch, WQVGA 3-inch (480 x 272) display, Bluetooth, microphone, speaker, FM tuner, plays all the expected media formats, and will be available in 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, or 32GB. Also in the video, we get a pretty extensive look at those widgets everyone's been talking about. But don't take it from us -- you can see for yourself after the break.
