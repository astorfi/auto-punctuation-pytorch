Up first is four new Colorado models, which will likely look a whole lot like these. Moving onward, we're told to expect a widescreen version of the nüvi 260 along with the nüvi 780 (essentially a revamped nüvi 760 with MSN Direct 2). Last but certainly not least, we've received a laundry list of specifications for a nüvi 860, 880 (both of which boast "voice recognition," supposedly pictured above) and 5000, the latter of which will purportedly boast a 5.2-inch 800 x 480 resolution screen and no battery, suggesting that it'll likely remain seated within your vehicle. For even more specs and an alleged shot of the 5000, be sure to take a look beyond the break.
