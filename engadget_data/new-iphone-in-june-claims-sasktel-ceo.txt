       Saskatchewan-based SaskTel isn't the biggest Canadian carrier out there -- it's very regional, along the lines of Cincinnati Bell for the US, in terms of subscribers -- but it's definitely a legit company, and its CEO Robert Watson has casually divulged some potentially major news to the Leader-Post. In a discussion on its 3G network set to launch July 1st, he had this to say: "The good news is that (Apple) is coming out with a new version of the iPhone in the June time-frame and they're going to put us on that. So we're quite excited about that." A new version, you say? We wouldn't be that surprised, frankly, since new iPhones have launched every summer for the past three years, but there's still been nary a peep yet from the folks in Cupertino. Is Watson mistaken or speaking way out of turn? The man would be in a position to conceivably have the inside scoop. Guess we'll find out soon enough.

Update: Just to be clear, while SaskTel is currently CDMA, the 3G network it's rolling out is an iPhone-friendly HSPA.

Update 2: Seems SaskTel is now claiming that those comments were actually not confirmation of a forthcoming iPhone. See the full clarification after the break.
