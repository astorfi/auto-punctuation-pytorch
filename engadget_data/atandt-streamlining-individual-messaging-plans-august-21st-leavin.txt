Do not adjust your computer screen, because the screenshot you're seeing above is real. Confirmed by multiple sources, we've exclusively learned that AT&T -- the protagonist of choice -- is trimming its individual messaging packages from two to one on August 21st. The remaining survivor? The Messaging Unlimited plan for $20, which means the $10 bundle that offers 1000 messages is riding into the sunset. If you aren't keen to do much communicating within 160 characters, you'll be left with no other choice besides the pay-per-message option at twenty cents each (thirty cents for MMS). Fortunately, the Family Unlimited Messaging is left unscathed, continuing to offer all-you-can-eat texts for $30. Tend to do only an average bit of texting and looking to move to Ma Bell? Our friend, you'd best be making that transition before the end of this week.

Update: And just like that, AT&T has confirmed this report. A spokesperson for the carrier provided the following statement, while also affirming that "current customers can keep their texting plans even if switching handsets."


"We regularly evaluate our offers and are making some adjustments to our messaging lineup.

		Starting August 21, we're streamlining our text messaging plans for new customers and will offer an unlimited plan for individuals for $20 per month and an unlimited plan for families of up to five lines for $30 per month. The vast majority of our messaging customers prefer unlimited plans and with text messaging growth stronger than ever, that number continues to climb among new customers. Existing customers don't have to change any messaging plan they have today, even when changing handsets."
