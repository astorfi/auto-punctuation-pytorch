	Japan has typically had exclusive access to Sharp's skinny and big-screened smartphone series, but that could soon change. Details of the Aquos SH-01D have now appeared in the FCC's bulging mail box, a phone packing a dual-core 1GHz processor and a glasses-free 3D 4.5-inch screen. Add in water resistance and a whopping 12.1 megapixel camera, and you can see why it's piqued our interest. The phone is already booked to make an appearance in Japanese NTT DoCoMo stores later this month in blue, white and black options. Of course, despite Sharp's application for an FCC nod of approval, the company may have no intentions of selling it on US soil. We'll keep our phone-hungry fingers crossed that it gets okayed for overseas travel.
