Minor setbacks aside, the EV has performed phenomenally in many reviews and safety tests, and with Superchargers now available throughout the US, it's possible to take the Model S on a cross-country road trip without spending a cent on fuel.

As for this most recent win, Consumer Reports cites the vehicle's "blistering acceleration, razor-sharp handling, compliant ride, and versatile cabin," along with its "massive, easy-to-use 17-inch touch screen... totally keyless operation, full Internet access, and ultra-quiet, zero-emission driving experience." Overall, a very solid achievement for Mr. Musk.
