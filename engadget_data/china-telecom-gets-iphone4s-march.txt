  The last time the iPhone dallied into eager Chinese hands there was more than a spot of bother. Hopefully, China Telecom's announcement that it'll be getting the 4S on March 9th will give retail stores enough time to prepare. It'll be up for pre-order online from March 2nd, starting from free on contract, and available in the usual 16GB, 32GB and 64GB varieties. The news came via the China Telecom website yesterday, with CEO Wang Xiaochu confirming in a press release this morning (Chinese time). So if Nokia thought it would have the network's biggest release in March, it might have to think again.
