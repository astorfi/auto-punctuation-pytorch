All that 1920Â x1200 resolution, 6msresponse time, and 1000:1 contrast ratio still holds true, just this time the 24-incher is being described in gloriousEnglish (and we have larger pictures, of course. Which would mean that this model can't be too far from shipping in theUS -- at least that's what we mumble incoherently to ourselves as stare fixated at its beauty.[Thanks,Aaron]
