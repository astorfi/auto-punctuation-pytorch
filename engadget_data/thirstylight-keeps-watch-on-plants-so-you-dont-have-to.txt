That's handled by a "Drypoint Digital Circuit," which checks moisture levels once per second and is able to discern between five different levels of dryness (relayed to you by blinking patterns of increasing urgency). If that sounds like the solution to your plant problems, you can pick one up now for $10, or get 'em in bundles of three, six, or twelve at a discount.
