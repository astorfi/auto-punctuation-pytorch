They blamed it on an electronic component shortage due to the high demand for cellphones of all things. We weren't aware that RAZR of ours housed a blue laser and 1080p processing power, but we're going to give it a once over just to make sure. Because of this shortage, Sony stated that their Blu-ray players are "going to be expensive," since "it will take time to get component prices down." We really could've believed a more credible excuse for player shortages and high prices, but we're not sure if we buy this whole "blame the phones" thing. The good news is that the possibility of a hybrid HD DVD and Blu-ray player was mentioned, which could save a bit of blood loss in the format war that is upon us.[Via HD Beat]
