It sounds like everything's just fine and dandy from the initial impression -- it turns out you can't slide out both the numeric and QWERTY keyboards at the same time like you can with the dummy units, but we're not too sure why you'd want to do that anyway. Oh, and if the Duo isn't to your liking, hang tight; we're hearing that the Q9 Global has starting shipping to stores (the Samsung A737, too), so they should be showing up any day now.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
