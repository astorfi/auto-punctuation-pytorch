Panasonic is finally starting to get those sexy
AG-HVX200 HD cams of theirs out the door. They should be
arriving at resellers on December 29th, just in time for you to score some slow motion, 60fps 720p shots of drunken New
Years exploits, or in 24fps 1080p if you prefer. Along with supporting DV tapes, the camera, as you recall, can record
to Panasonic's proprietary flash P2 cards, which, while expensive, should make for some speedy offloading, and though
the $6,000 price point for the shooter without media might sound spendy, you're just not going to find this feature set
in any other cameras in that ballpark.
