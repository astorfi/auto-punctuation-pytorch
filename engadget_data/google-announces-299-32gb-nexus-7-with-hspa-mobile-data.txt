 Google's not only introduced some new devices today, it's also delivered a few updates to its flagship Nexus 7 tablet. That includes a new, unlocked 32GB model with HSPA+ mobile data that will set you back $299 -- and run the just-announced Android 4.2, naturally. Look for it to be available in the Google Play store in the US, UK, Australia, France, Germany, Spain and Canada (where it's priced slightly above par at $309) on November 13th. No word yet on retail availability beyond Google Play, but you can sign up to be notified when it's available to order there at the link below.
