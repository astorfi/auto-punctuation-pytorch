 Are you ready for Nintendo's Wii U console to arrive in a couple of weeks, packing not only a GamePad but also extensive online-enabled features like the Miiverse, Wii U Chat, TVii and eShop? Good, because as IGN mentions, the Wii U isn't. Not unlike many games shipping lately, the console will see a software update available at debut that downloads all of those features for the first time. That shouldn't be a problem for early adopting gamers as long as everything goes smoothly, but so far early-arriving review / preview units don't have the functionality, although it should be delivered in an update before the launch. It's been a few years since we had a new console launch (relive the PS3 fat, pre-RROD Xbox 360 and Wii here) and quickly-changing software is certainly the name of the game, we'll let you know as soon as we can how the Nintendo Network delivers.
