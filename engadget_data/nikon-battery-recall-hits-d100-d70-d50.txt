If you own a Nikon D50, D70 or D100, run, don't walk, to, um,
Nikon's web site and find out if you're eligible for a replacement battery under the company's recall program.
According to Nikon, some EN-EL3 Li-ion batteries can "experience a short circuit causing it to overheat and possibly
melt, posing a potential hazard to consumers" (which leads us to wonder whether the scare over exploding Nikon
batteries from a couple of months back is really just due
to cheap knockoffs, as was reported at the time). Nikon, of course, is quick to point out that only four incidents have
been reported worldwide, and nobody has been injured, but it looks like the company is trying to get out in front of
this one. Another word of warning: the defective battery packs are still being sold (nice going, Nikon), so make sure
to check out the info on Nikon's web site and take it with you if you're in the market for a new Nikon digicam or spare
battery.
