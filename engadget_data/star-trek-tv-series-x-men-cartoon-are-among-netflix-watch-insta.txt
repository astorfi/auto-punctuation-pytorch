While Deep Space 9 is due to arrive in October, TOS (only seasons 2 and 3 at the time of this posting), The Next Generation, Voyager and Enterprise are all present and accounted for. If you're looking for HD streaming, only the remastered original series and Enterprise will fit the bill, but judging by the sorry state of our TNG Betamax dubs we'll take what we can get. Also new today is Marvel's X-Men cartoon (in SD), although it appears many of the amazing season finale episodes (especially those dealing with the Phoenix saga) are still trapped on discs.
