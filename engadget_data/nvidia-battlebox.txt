Okay, okay, NVIDIA's "Battlebox" PCs won't quite power the Large Hadron Collider, but it will offer more power than you'll need to play basically any game available (or any game arriving in the coming holiday deluge). The initiative focuses on NVIDIA working with several boutique PC makers to provide 2-way SLI setups on its GTX 780 and Titan GPUs, capable of supporting gaming in 4K resolution. Providers vary between North America and Europe, but the usual players are on board: Falcon Northwest, Maingear, Cyberpower, etc.


Of course, with great power comes great cost -- Chillblast's Fusion Battlebox, for instance, starts at Â£2,999.00 (about $4,870), and Maingear's Shift starts at $2,300 -- so you'd better be ready to shell out some serious cash for 4K gaming.
