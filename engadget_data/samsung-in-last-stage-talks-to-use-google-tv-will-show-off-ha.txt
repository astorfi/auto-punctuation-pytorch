There's no word on when or where we might see hardware from other partners like LG, but at last year's show Vizio and Samsung (pictured above) were the only ones to display their efforts. TV division prez Yoon Boo-keun confirmed the company was working with Google on the rollout, and apparently indicated Samsung's service would "differ" from competitors. We'll have to find out what that means, but in the meantime what we can expect to see in Las Vegas are OLED TVs, which he said Samsung would have on display. After being teased by countless concepts, we'll be keeping our eyes peeled for price tags and shipping dates, but those details will likely remain under wraps until January.
