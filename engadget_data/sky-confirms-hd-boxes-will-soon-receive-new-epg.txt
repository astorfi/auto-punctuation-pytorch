 Rumors of a facelifted electronic programming guide to Sky's receivers / DVRs have been swirling for quite some time, and apparently, the satellite provider has finally come clean and doled out the skinny. According to Digital Spy, only Sky HD boxes will be receiving the upgrade, which will replace the current four top-level options with ten. Purportedly, "television, radio and interactive services will be listed separately," and it's also stated that a small box will be added to show content from channels as they are browsed through in the guide. As for when Brits can expect the new EPG? "Sometime during 2008" -- sadly, that'll have to do for now.
