Nice to see these AMD Turion notebooks really
hitting the streets (albeit a little quietly). Voodoo actually dropped their new Envy a:228 mini-laptop a couple of
weeks ago to little media fanfare (which we have a feeling has something to do with the fact that most probably didn't
realize you can get it in "powder pink"). Formed a bit like a Vaio S, the a:228 has a 12.1-inch 1280 x 800 display, a
4-pound, 1-inch thick body, and said Turion with up to 2GB of RAM. His n' hers models start at about two
thousand.
