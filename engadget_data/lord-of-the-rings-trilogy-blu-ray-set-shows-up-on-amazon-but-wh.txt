 Can you believe it? We're still waiting for the Lord of the Rings trilogy on Blu-ray, but news that the set has shown up for pre-order on Amazon.com. The only hook, as noted by TheHDRoom, is that the $99.98 MSRP / $69.99 priced package is listed as the theatrical editions, leaving room for the idea Warner plans to double dip with the extended versions later. Still, with on official announcement, no one knows quite what the deal is, so just peep the box art and hope for the best.[Thanks, Vipul]
