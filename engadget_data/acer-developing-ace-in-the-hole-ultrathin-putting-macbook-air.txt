We're talking Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs here, so performance should get a nice boost, but the best news is confirmation of something we'd heard earlier: the final product's profile will be an aggressively svelte 1.9cm (0.7 inches) in thickness, which will match the headline feature of Apple's MacBook Air. The plan is to launch "this year," and indications are that this hero machine will figure heavily in Acer's push to oust HP from the top spot in global laptop shipments. To say that we're looking forward to it might be an understatement.
