With the PlayStation 4 now on sale and the Xbox One hitting stores this week, news of Ouya's latest console refresh comes at a busy time for gamers. With holidays closing in, it's unveiled a new limited edition all-white case for its Android-powered console, also doubling the system's internal storage to 16GB to store more games and important media. Ouya has already opened pre-orders with a $129.99 price tag ($30 more than the 8GB model), and if you order before December 8th, you should have it by Christmas. While the white model, with its expanded storage, is only available in North America, all is not lost -- Ouya's latest software update will bring support for USB storage (and many other new features) to older consoles when it arrives later this month.
