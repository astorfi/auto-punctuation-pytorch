Sometime this month it looks like Samsung will be rolling out their successor to the
YP-T7 digital audio player that we
caught wind of back in March. The YP-T8 MP3 player (media
player, really) is unmistakably phone-like, and it's looking pretty packed with features. It's got a 1.8-inch TFT LCD,
FM radio, voice recorder, photo viewer, text viewer, game functionality, plays back MP3, WMA, Ogg, and Audio ASF and as
well is going to rock some MPEG4 video action. Battery life clocks in at 20 hours, and its 43.5 x 83 x 15.5mm frame
weighs in at 55g. Internal memory sizes will be available in 256MB, 512MB, 1G and 2G versions. Here's another crazy
feature on this unit: it's got USB host functionality, so you can connect up your digital camera and download photos to
it whilst out and about. We've just drooled all over the floor so we hope they don't break our hearts on the price with
this thing â€” that's the one spec they neglected to mention. More pics after the jump.
