Interestingly, according to AutoblogGreen, that delay apparently isn't due to any hang-ups with the vehicle itself (it's hitting roads in Japan this summer), but rather whether battery-maker GS Yuasa can scrounge up enough lithium-ion batteries to keep up with demand. It also looks like the car that eventually hits the U.S. won't be exactly the same as the model bound for Japan and Europe, with the i-MiEV name likely the first thing to go. Of course, there's no official word on a U.S. price just yet, but the car, which boasts a range of around 100 miles on a single charge, should be selling for the rough local equivalent of $30,000 when it hits Europe and Japan.
