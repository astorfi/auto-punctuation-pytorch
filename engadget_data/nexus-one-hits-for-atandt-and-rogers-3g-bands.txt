Show full PR textNexus One now compatible with the AT&T 3G network and shipping to CanadaIn early January, we announced the Nexus One, the first device sold through Google's web store. The Nexus One is unlocked, which means you can use it with a SIM card from most GSM operators worldwide. Currently the device is compatible with most 3G networks, including T-Mobile in the US. However, there are some carriers that have different 3G frequencies, such as AT&T in the US and Rogers Wireless in Canada, so users with these SIM cards can only access 2G or EDGE networks on their Nexus One.Starting today, an additional version of the Nexus One is available from the Google web store that is compatible with AT&T's 3G network. This new model can be purchased as an unlocked device without a service plan. In addition to AT&T's 3G network, this device will also run on Rogers Wireless in Canada. And like the first version of the Nexus One, it can be used with most GSM operators globally.Additionally, Nexus One devices can now be shipped to Canada from Google's web store, and will work with a SIM from Rogers Wireless.
