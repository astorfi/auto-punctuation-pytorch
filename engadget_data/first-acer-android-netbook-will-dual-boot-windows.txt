While your first reaction might be to call JT a Microsoft patsy, he's not, it's smart to hedge, actually, since Android is unproven as a netbook OS and Wal-mart consumers usually don't like being surprised by computers that don't work like the ol' home computer. Besides, these Android netbooks seem to be targeting carriers as resellers so you'll like get a big fat discount when you take one home on contract. Happy?
