  The latest twist in the on-going Apple / Samsung patent soap opera is a doozy, particularly for Android fans Down Under. Samsung will not be advertising or selling the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia, at least until the Korean company gets court approval to do so -- or until the suit is resolved. Due to differences between the US and Australian versions of the Android tablet, Samsung is required to present the device to Apple at least seven days before its planned launch. Apple claims that the US version of the tablet infringes on ten of the company's patents.
