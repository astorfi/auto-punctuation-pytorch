  Logitech's Q3 earnings for the 2012 fiscal year don't have many surprises since the company already revealed it was dropping out of the Google TV team. In prepared remarks, company management confirmed it is completely sold out of new units, closing the door on any users still trying to nab a $99 Revue (who shouldn't be too heartbroken, since Vizio is promising a second gen unit is on the way at the same price). There is promise however, if you're looking for a new Harmony remote model, while interim CEO Guerrino De Luca says the company is late in providing a successor to the best selling Harmony One and other models, resulting in a 30 percent drop in sales, it plans to strengthen the lineup "in the coming months." In other segments, it's seeing growth in those iPad accessory keyboards, for more details check the press release embedded after the break or in the PDFs linked below.
      

 

  Show full PR text  Logitech Announces Third Quarter Results for FY 2012  FREMONT, Calif. & MORGES, Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Logitech International (SIX:LOGN) (Nasdaq:LOGI) today announced financial results for the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2012.  "Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $153 million and we ended with $523 million in cash. We can repurchase up to $177 million of our shares under our existing share repurchase program, with all regulatory approvals in place to begin repurchases on our second trading line."  Sales for Q3 FY 2012 were $715 million, down 5 percent from $754 million in Q3 FY 2011. Changes in exchange rates did not have an impact on sales compared to the prior year. Operating income was $70 million, down 8 percent from $76 million in the same quarter a year ago. Net income for Q3 FY 2012 was $55 million ($0.32 per share) compared to net income of $65 million ($0.36 per share) in Q3 of FY 2011. Gross margin for the quarter was 36.2 percent compared to 36.0 percent one year ago.  Logitech's retail sales for Q3 FY 2012 decreased by 4 percent, with an increase in Asia of 13 percent, a decrease in EMEA of 5 percent and a decrease in the Americas of 8 percent. OEM sales decreased by 24 percent. Sales for the LifeSize division grew 6 percent.  "Our Q3 FY 2012 sales performance across most of our business is consistent with the findings from the assessment of our business that we completed earlier this fiscal year," said Guerrino De Luca, Logitech chairman and acting chief executive officer. "Large categories such as cordless mice and cordless keyboards, including those for tablets, achieved strong year-over-year sales growth, despite the product gaps that exist across many of our retail categories. I am pleased with our improved execution in EMEA and with the progress of our new product initiatives, both of which we expect to benefit from in Fiscal Year 2013.  "Since we last provided our outlook for Fiscal Year 2012 at the end of October, several factors have changed. Most significantly, the Euro has weakened considerably during the last three months. In addition, webcams and remotes continue to be impacted more than expected by product portfolio and market weakness. Consequently, we have lowered our outlook for FY 12 sales and operating income.  "I am very pleased with our strong cash generation in Q3," continued De Luca. "Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $153 million and we ended with $523 million in cash. We can repurchase up to $177 million of our shares under our existing share repurchase program, with all regulatory approvals in place to begin repurchases on our second trading line."  Outlook  For Fiscal Year 2012, ending March 31, 2012, the Company now expects sales of approximately $2.3 billion and operating income of approximately $60 million. The gross margin for the full year continues to be estimated to reach approximately 33 percent. Full-year outlook factors in the operating loss and very low gross margin previously reported for Q1.

The forward-looking statements in this release involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Logitech's actual results to differ materially from that anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: the demand of our customers and our consumers for our products and our ability to accurately forecast it; if our investment prioritization decisions do not result in the sales or profitability growth we expect, or when we expect it; the effect of pricing, product, marketing and other initiatives by our competitors, and our reaction to them, on our sales, gross margins and profitability; the sales mix among our lower- and higher-margin products and our geographic sales mix; if our product offerings and marketing activities do not result in the sales and profitability growth we expect, or when we expect it; if we fail to take advantage of trends in the consumer electronics and personal computers industries, including the growth of mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablets with touch interfaces, or if significant demand for peripherals to use with tablets and other mobile devices with touch interfaces does not develop; if there is a deterioration of business and economic conditions in one or more of our sales regions or operating segments, or significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates; if the sales growth in emerging markets for our PC peripherals and other products does not increase as much as we expect; if our operational changes in our EMEA sales region do not result in the sales improvement in EMEA we expect; in digital music, if we are not able to identify product development, marketing, and organizational skill gaps, and resolve them, or if we fail to introduce differentiated product and marketing strategies to separate ourselves from competitors; the adverse conclusion of one or more ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority that adversely affects our profitability; competition in the video conferencing and communications industry, including from companies with significantly greater resources, sales and marketing organizations, installed base and name recognition; as well as those additional factors set forth in Logitech's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2011 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q we intend to file for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011, available at www.sec.gov.

Constant dollar sales are a non-GAAP financial measure, which is information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures in its financial and operational decision-making, and believes these non-GAAP measures, when considered in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, facilitate a better understanding of changes in net sales. Constant dollar sales are calculated by translating prior period sales in each local currency at the current period's average exchange rate for that currency.
