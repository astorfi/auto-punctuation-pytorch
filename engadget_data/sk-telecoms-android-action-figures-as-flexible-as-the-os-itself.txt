Too bad he's only available from SK Telecom way off yonder in the Republic of Korea. Of course, this ain't the first Android toy we've seen in this space, but it's certainly the most athletic! See for yourself after the break.

Update: It looks like there's actually a variety of places to get the figures, not just SK Telecom -- there's also KT, LG U+ and some other names at the bottom of the website that we're not terribly familiar with.
