We have fond memories of VCRs here at Engadget since they finally allowed us to pause episodes of Maude helping us
through those pubescent rough spots. According to the WCF Courier in Waterloo, Iowa (and they should know) â€” today
marks the 30th anniversary of the introduction of the VCR. Huh? We guess they must be referring to Sony's Betamax since
JVC's rival VHS format wasn't released until 1976. But who cares, we loves a party! And according to their local Best
Buy, there are still humans buying those dedicated VCRs, usually as replacements for existing models. Oh boy, do we
have a phone for them.
