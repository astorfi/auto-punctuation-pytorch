Or games, which cost a small chunk of change. But at least it's nice to know what you're getting yourself into here, and that's a 5G iPod with a 60% brighter screen.
      

 

Pac Man! Haww yeah.Ok, so it was a little out of focus, but this is the new 30GB model. Unfortunately the 80GB wasn't around for size comparison, but we doubt it's any larger than yesterday's 60GB device.This one's a personal favorite of our spammers.
