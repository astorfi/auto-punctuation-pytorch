This year's CEATEC was a bit quieter than previous years, perhaps due to the lack of brand new consumer products. Fortunately, the show managed to substitute in plenty of future tech demos, while Nissan made more progress on the promise of a self-driving car and Japanese carrier DoCoMo offered up its vision for a wearable future through a handful of real-world demos. Dragon Quest smartphones, moon walking simulators and new solid-state hydrogen fuel cells rounded out the week's discoveries. Check out all the coverage after the break. Mata rainen!
