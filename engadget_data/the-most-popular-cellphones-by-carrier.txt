Nah, you shouldn't be too surprised if you don't recognize many
of the names on this list of the bestselling cellphones by carrier that Om Malik dug up. Usually the bestest and
baddest phones aren't the most popular ones, so you won't see the Treo or the MPx200 or the P900 anywhere on a list
like this since most people just take whichever handset they can get for free when they sign up for service. What is
surprising is seeing how big of a comeback Motorola has made lately,how Samsung is doing a lot better than anyone would
have predicted four years ago, and how LG seems to be gaining on just about everybody.

Cingular: Motorola v400, Samsung x427, Nokia 1100/3100, LG 1200/1210.
