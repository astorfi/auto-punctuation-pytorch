After a brief tease earlier this week, Incipio has officially unveiled its iPhone mobile payment case. The Cashwrap Mobile Wallet gives most iPhone users NFC payment support at any place that accepts Isis; beyond the case, all you need is a compatible account and a free app. If you're eager to stop paying with plastic cards, the Cashwrap should be available online for $70. AT&T is only due to launch the peripheral at retail on January 31st, although the recent in-store sighting hints that you might have a chance at scoring a retail unit ahead of schedule.
