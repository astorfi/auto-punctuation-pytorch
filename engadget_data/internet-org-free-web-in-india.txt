Less than a month after Facebook launched its Internet.org initiative to give folks in Colombia free web access, the company is expanding its efforts to India. Reliance Communications subscribers in six states (Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra', Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala and Telangana) can browse things like news, weather, government info and job listings with the Internet.org Android app. What's more, the bulk of the options are available in seven languages: English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Gujarati and Marathi. If you'll recall, the Internet.org app is also available in Kenya and Zambia, connecting users in those areas with basic services and local info, too.
