Ifyou're Samsung, you don't just announce that your Q35 is a Core Duo laptop; after all, other companies have beenannouncing their Core Duo rigs for months. You declare it the "world's smallest" Core Duo box, and trumpetthe fact that it weighs about 4 pounds, has a 12-inch widescreen display, and still manages to pack in a T2700processor, 512MB of RAM and an 80GB hard drive. There's also a DVD burner, WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet and Firewire. And,of course, since Samsung laptops aren't sold in the US, we assume that within a few days we'll hear an announcement fromsomeone else for the "world's smallest Core Duo laptop that you can actually buy."
