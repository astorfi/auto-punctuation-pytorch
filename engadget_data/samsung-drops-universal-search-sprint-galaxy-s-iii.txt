It now appears the update also nixes the universal search function, meaning the handy box now directs to the web upon entry. It's likely a response to recent legal hairpulling between Apple and the Samsung-made Galaxy Nexus -- a phone which has the very same search capabilities. As Android Central notes, those looking to return the search option can hit up a download of the previous version in their forums. Visit the source to grab it while you can.
