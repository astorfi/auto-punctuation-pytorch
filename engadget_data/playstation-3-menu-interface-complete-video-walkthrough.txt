No, sorry, no gameplay -- why bother when our video camera wouldn't show the graphic subtleties anyway? -- but we've got the A-Z on almost everything in the console, including the new and improved Sony browser, the Folding@Home client, and even a tiny preview of the PlayStation Network's friends and messaging features. Check it out!P.S. -Our flash video isn't the highest quality / res.
