That's less than seven months since the device first hit the market, which by Sammy's fuzzy math averages to about one unit for every two seconds it's been on sale. According to Samsung Tomorrow, North America contributed the most with 4 million in sales, followed by Europe at 2.5 million. Let there be cake, and once that's over, let there be progress on those Froyo updates.
