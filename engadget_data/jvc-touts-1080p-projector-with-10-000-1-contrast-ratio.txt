 JVC is out to please home theater aficionados, announcing a new display technology set to debut in its projectors next year. The system consists of three 0.7-inch D-ILA (LCOS) devices that pump out sweet 1,080p, 1,900 x 1,080 pixel resolution, with an aperture ratio of more than 90%, which JVC says delivers a smoother, more film-like image. The company's pairing that up with a new optical system in the projector, which promises a 10,000:1 contrast ratio and a brightness level of 800 lumens -- which seems like a bit of a disconnect to us, but JVC ensures us it'll provide "natural yet vivid color reproduction and high contrast." The first projector packing these new innards is set to launch early next year for "less than $7,000," though we're guessing not that much less.
