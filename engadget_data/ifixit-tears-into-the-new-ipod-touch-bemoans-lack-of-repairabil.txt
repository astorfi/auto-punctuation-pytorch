 The folks over at iFixit have gotten their tool-sporting hands all over the new iPod touch, giving Apple's latest music player the customary detailed teardown. The alien autopsy-esque dissection reveals the device's A5 processor, flash memory from Toshiba and a lot of parts secured firmly in place. The latter, naturally, has led to a pretty dismal repairability score for the touchscreen player -- a three out of 10 -- nothing new, really, for Cupertino products, though the company seemed to be moving in the other direction with the new iPhone. Check the source link below for all the gory details -- and yes, iFixit even goes so far as calling the device's home button "weak." Oh snap, guys.
