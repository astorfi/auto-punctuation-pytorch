Okay, okay, this seriously pushes the envelope on crappy leaked (and/or potentially 'shopped) photos for sure but,
you know, why the heck not? This is supposedly a camphone shot of the mysterious, the elusive, the
much-rumoured video iPod that may be announced as early
as next week (grain of salt, disclaimer, yadda yadda). Make of this what you will, folks. What do you think â€”
plausible?
