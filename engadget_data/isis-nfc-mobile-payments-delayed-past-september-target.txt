Isis must have spoken too soon. Just days after the alliance committed to launching its mobile payment system in September, its marketing lead Jaymee Johnson has warned FierceMobileContent that the rollout won't make the promised summer target. The delay is portrayed as a collection of minor hiccups, although we're not bracing ourselves for a short wait: Isis plans to update us on the situation in October, and that suggests we won't be making NFC-based purchases on Isis any sooner. It's another disappointment for the future-is-now crowd hoping to leave cash behind -- not that Apple and Google will object to a rival's misstep.
