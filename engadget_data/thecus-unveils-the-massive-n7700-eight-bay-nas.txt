Well, it appears the company upped the ante just a touch at this year's Computex with its new array -- an eight-bay monster known as the N7700. The massive storage appliance doesn't seem to deviate from the previous model much, utilizing a Celeron CPU to control the system, 1GB of DDR2 RAM, and a wide variety of RAID options (0, 1, 5, 6, 10 and JBOD). We don't have word on pricing or availability just yet, but hopefully the archiving of your of "films" and "music purchases" can wait.
