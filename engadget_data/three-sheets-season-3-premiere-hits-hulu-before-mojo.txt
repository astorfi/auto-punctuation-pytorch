Still, for those who can't (or just won't) wait for the April 10th launch of Three Sheet's third season on MOJO, the first episode can be viewed in its entirety right now via Hulu. You heard right -- the whole half hour show, which sees the always animated Zane Lamprey head down to Chile, can be seen right now by following the read link below. Are you still here? Maybe you missed the part about a new Three Sheets episode waiting for you right down there![Via NewTeeVee]
