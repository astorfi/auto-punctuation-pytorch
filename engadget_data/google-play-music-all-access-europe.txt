Three months after Google Play Music All Access debuted in the US and a month after it launched Down Under, the music subscription service has finally made its way across the globe to Europe. Well, to nine European countries at least. According to Google's support page, it's now available in Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and the UK. As with the other countries, there's a promotional offer to help you get started. If you sign up for the 30-day trial before September 15th, you'll only need to pay £7.99 or €7.99 a month after that. If you decide to wait however, the monthly subscription cost goes up to £9.99 or €9.99. No word yet on when the service will roll out to the rest of the world, but we're sure the folks in Mountain View are hard at work making sure it does. After all, it has quite a bit of catching up to do.
