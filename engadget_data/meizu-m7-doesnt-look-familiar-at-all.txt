 
Well, that didn't take long. Hot on the heels of the iPod touch starting to ship, spunky Chinese upstart Meizu has announce the M7, a curiously-familiar PMP featuring a 3-inch touchscreen. Meizu CEO Jack Wong announced the player on the company's forums, so details are a little sketchy, but it looks like the unit will feature a 16:9 480 x 288 screen and support H.264 playback. The picture is apparently a mockup, but we're hearing that the M7 will go on sale in late 2008 in 1GB, 2GB and 8GB versions for $100, $110, and $150. Of course, given how long it's taken the M8 to hit, that's all up in the air, but something tells us we'll be hearing a lot about this thing in the future.[Via PMP Today]
