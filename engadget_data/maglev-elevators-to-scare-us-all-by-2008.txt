 After having recentlybeen stuck in a dark elevator for over a half-hour (and requiring a fire department rescue; thank heavens our PPC-6700 was close at hand to summon help and Orb away thedowntime), we're not all that jazzed up about the idea of an elevator that relies on the principal of magneticlevitation. Maglev technology has been around for years as the propulsion method behind certain European and Asiantrains, and basically involves using the Physics 101 properties of magnetic attraction and repulsion to provide anobject with momentum. Well we're fine if that momentum is occuring parallel to the ground, but we're a little leery oftrusting some magnets to suspend us several hundred feet above terra firma (does power outage=free fall?). Seeminglyunconcerned with our hesitation, Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems Corp. has announced that we'll be seeing thesepotential deathtraps commercially installed within the next few years, hopefully with the Otis-type hacks still fully functional.
