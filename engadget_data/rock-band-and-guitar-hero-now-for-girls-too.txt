Thankfully, PDP has teamed up with Radio Disney mainstays Aly & AJ to create some seriously rockin' game controllers for the PS2 and Wii. Due out mid-October and priced at a rockin' $69.99, tweenage Guitar Hero and Rock Band fans can choose either the rockin' pink Tele-looking guitar with red skull and crossbones motif, or the totally rockin' pink heart-shaped guitar with purple zebra print. Check out the rockin' video after the break. And rock on!
