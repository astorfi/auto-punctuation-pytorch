But anyway, enjoy the chart above and lets move onto the release info.Fox has a ton action titles slotted for Blu-ray in '07. It is clear who they are targeting with these flicks but, we don't mind more action and less drama in our high definition library it's just that the proposed titles aren't anything great. In fact with the notable exception of Independence Day, the rest of the movies are just O.K, but what do we know because according to the above chart, these titles are gong to make the Blu-ray format simply explode with sales. Apparently, Planet of the Apes (2001) and Dude, Where's My Car is enough to send the format soaring. We kid, we kid - these are decent movies and most guys will enjoy any of 'em.
