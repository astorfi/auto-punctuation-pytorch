Boasting a petite, 1.26-inch display, these petite devices allows joggers to monitor and record their distance, pace and elevation, thanks to a sensitive GPS receiver that promises an accuracy range of between three and five meters. Its onboard ANT+ wireless technology, meanwhile, provides biometric and performance data culled from an optional heart rate monitor or a variety of other accessories, including bike sensors and power meters. Swimmers can take solace in the fact that the Switch is water resistant at depths of up to 50 meters, while truly hardcore Ironmen and women will be happy to know that they'll be able to store up to 60 hours' worth of data on the watch, which promises up to eight hours of battery life while in workout mode. The Switch Up, pictured above, offers many of the same benefits, but features a vibration-based alert system and ships with a multi-sport mount for bikers and triathletes. Magellan has yet to announce a release date for these watches, though the Switch will be priced at $250, or $300 with the heart rate monitor. As for the Switch Up, it'll cost you $300 (including the accompanying Multisport Mounting Kit) or $350, if bundled with the monitor. Head past the break for an extra image of the Switch.
