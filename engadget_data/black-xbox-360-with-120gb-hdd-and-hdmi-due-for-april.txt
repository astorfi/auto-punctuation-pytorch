But digging a little deeper, we discover a word from GamersReports that they've got an "inside source" saying Microsoft Australia tipped off retail store Myer about a Black Xbox 360 with a 120GB hard drive a couple of days ago. Now apparently more sources have confirmed the reports, even tossing HDMI into the mix (making it into a sort of black Zephyr), along with a $749 AU (about $584) pricetag and a supposed April launch date. The sources even say that Microsoft is hoping to beat projections and launch in March to disrupt Sony's March 23rd PS3 launch. GamersReports also claims that there are now pics of the Black 360 floating around on the internets, so we'll keep an eye out for those, and until we spot a few kangaroos slipping Premium Black packages into their pouches along with an extra controller and a copy of Rainbow Six, that's about all the cred we're going to give this rumor for now.[Via Xbox 360 Fanboy]
