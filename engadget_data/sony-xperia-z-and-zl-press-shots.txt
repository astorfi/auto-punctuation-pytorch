 Are you ready to welcome in 2013? It's sure to be another hot year for handsets, and if this pair of leaked Xperia smartphones is any indication, Sony is likely to be off to a solid start come CES. The svelte Xperia Z "Yuga" and slightly sleeker ZL "Odin" have made a premature debut on the Japanese tech giant's site, with a pair of straight-on press shots appearing overnight. The Xperia Z shot appears to be in line with earlier leaks, while the ZL is shaping up to be a slightly more compact variant, potentially squeezing identical hardware into a smaller shell. Both devices are rumored to include 5-inch 1080p LCDs, quad-core 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro processors with 2 gigs of RAM and Adreno 320 graphics, along with a 13-megapixel Exmor RS sensor on the rear -- oddly, the ZL's front-facing camera appears to be positioned on the bottom. Sony has yet to confirm either device's specifications, but with CES just around the corner, we don't have long to wait for either device to become official.
