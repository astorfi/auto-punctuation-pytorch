The VGF-CP1 packs a 7-inch 800 x 480 resolution panel, multicard reader / USB port, 100MB of free internal memory (85MB for pictures, 15MB for music), support for still images / MP3s / WAV files and built-in 802.11b/g WiFi. Aside from showing off your recent vacation snaps, the unit can also display the current time, check in with your favorite RSS feeds and keep you up to speed with the latest weather forecasts. No telling if this thing will ever see US soil, but those parked in Tokyo can grab it on May 17th for around Â¥30,000 ($258).
