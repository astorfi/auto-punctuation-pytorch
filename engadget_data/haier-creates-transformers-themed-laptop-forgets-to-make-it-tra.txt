The specs are relatively good too, with the G70 notebook running on Intel's PM965 chipset, and featuring a 1920 x 1200 pixel 17-inch display, 2GB of RAM, a 120GB Hard Disk, and a GeForce Go 7950GTX with 512MB of VRAM. Now all Haier needs to do is to get a shipment of these within life-giving distance of the Allspark: we can almost see the "Allspark contact" CTO option on our screen right now.
