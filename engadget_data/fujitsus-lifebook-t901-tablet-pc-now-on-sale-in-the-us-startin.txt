 



That machine looming large at the top of this page is Fujitsu's LifeBook T901 tablet PC and it's now for sale in the US of A. Powered by an Intel Core i5-2520M processor, the T901 features a 13.3-inch, 1280 x 768 LCD that supports NVIDIA's Optimus graphics. The display also rocks an active digitizer, though you'll have to pay an additional $100 for the dual digitizer that enables five-finger capacitive multitouch. For those in need of some extra life, there's a modular bay that allows you to swap in a second battery or hard drive, along with an integrated fingerprint sensor that'll keep your kids away from your precious TPS reports. Prices start at $1899, so hit the source link if you're interested in adding an yet another tactile dimension to your digital existence.
