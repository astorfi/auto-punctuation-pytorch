 Britain has had grand visions of supplying broadband to virtually every home through its Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK) initiative, but the lack of EU approval has put a large part of that plan on ice. Consider the European Commission's latest move a thaw, then. It just confirmed that BDUK is legal within EU rules on state aid through the measures to keep it honest, such as top-level advice to regional planners and Ofcom control over the costs and terms of any given rollout. The clearance lets a raft of projects get underway, and should ideally supply services like BT Infinity to 90 percent of the UK as well as a minimum 2Mbps for the rest; given that many BDUK providers have had to wait until now to get started, though, we wouldn't anticipate fast internet access in the boonies just yet.
