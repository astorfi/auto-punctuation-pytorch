One way Microsoft can stimulate Xbox One sales is to drop the price to match its better-selling rival, the PlayStation 4. After it confirmed exactly that by announcing a Kinectless Xbox One last month, the company has now opened sales -- hours before E3 2014 kicks off. You can pick one up for $399.99/Â£349.99 via Microsoft's online store, which lets you concentrate on gaming instead of repeating that frustrating "Xbox on" command. If you decide later that you do want the sensor-packed accessory, a standalone version will be available this fall. Microsoft will also continue to sell the "premium" bundle with Kinect. Today's launch is meant to be about gamers that "just like to play games with a controller in their hand," because, you know, everyone else totally wanted a Kinect to begin with.
