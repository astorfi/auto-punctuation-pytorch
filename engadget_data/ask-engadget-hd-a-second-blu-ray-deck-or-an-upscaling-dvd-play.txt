"I've got a PlayStation 3 in the living room, but I'm on the fence with what kind of player to get for our guest room. Should I spring for a second Blu-ray player of some kind, or should I just get an upscaling DVD deck? With prices of the entry-level BD machines just barely more than a decent upconverting DVD player, I'm leaning Blu. But, if I opt for another BD deck, which low-end one is the best choice?" We wouldn't hesitate to offer our recommendations of investing in a second BD deck -- after all, you never know when you'll need one for travel or loan -- but there's a whole heap to choose from in the entry-level sector. Any advice for our pal Gregory?Got a burning question that you'd love to toss out for Engadget HD (or its readers) to take a look at?
