The sources say that the new model -- which boasts a thickness of 0.6 or 0.7 inches, and will weigh less than 3 lbs -- will drop before the end of the year. Of course, MacScoop has been reporting on the "ultraportable" 12-inch Apple laptop since March of 2006, and we've heard this same rumor in one form or another over the past year, which should give anyone pause before they run screaming into their local Apple Store demanding to place a pre-order. However, the fact the this rumor persists does give the suggestion of some truth behind it, so if Apple suddenly makes the announcement, don't say we didn't warn you... repeatedly.[Via MacDailyNews]
