Worried that Tesla's all-electric SUV, the Model X, might face yet another delay? Don't be. Tesla is telling pre-order customers that their vehicles will roll off the line in early 2015, complete with the space-saving "falcon wing" doors from the 2012 concept. The options list should be relatively short, too, as both all-wheel drive and fold-flat seats will come standard. You will have to pony up for a third row of seats, however. Elon Musk and crew haven't shown off the final design, although late-stage prototypes are due in the fall -- if you're still on the fence about Tesla's upscale people carrier, you'll have at least one more chance to see it before sales begin.
