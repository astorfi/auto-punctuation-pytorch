 Massive TVs, check. Slim laptops, check. Hello Kitty gadgets galore, check. So goes the typical CES checklist, and 2013 isn't any different. Several of the feline-adorned paraphernalia we saw on the show floor were repeats from last year, but we did manage to find a few new Kitty-branded appliances and accessories that are sure to give you an insulin shock. From toasters to Bluetooth speakers, go ahead and peruse the gallery after the break for probably the most amount of pink you'll ever see at an electronics trade show.
