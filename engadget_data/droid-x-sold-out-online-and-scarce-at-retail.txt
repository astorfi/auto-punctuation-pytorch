Verizon confirmed the shortages in a communique to Android Central, saying the company was pleased with initial sales, and that though they were "successful at keeping up with early demand" supplies are presently "low or out." Tomorrow's just not going to work out, our anti-gravitational friend -- can we take a July 27th raincheck?
