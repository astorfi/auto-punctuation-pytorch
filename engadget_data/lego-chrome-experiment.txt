Let's be honest: You're never too old to play with Legos. Thanks to the latest Chrome experiment (and a little help from WebGL) you can build whatever your heart desires directly from your browser. Using Maps, you're able to choose a location-specific plot before starting to build, brick by brick. As you might expect, creations can be viewed across Google+ circles with categories for sorting, and tutorials will help hone those plastic contractor skills. If you really wanna get hands-on, use your phone or tablet's touchscreen for a more tactile feel. Itching to get started? You can begin construction right here.
