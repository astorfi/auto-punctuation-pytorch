New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin has announced an unprecedented project wherein the entire city will be blanketed by free
WiFi within a year. Due to the almost complete devastation of the city's infrastructure, the free Internet access is
one attempt to turn the city's stagnant economy into one of growth and independence. Like in most large-scale networks,
the New Orleans routers will be placed on top of street lights and provide citizens and businesses with 512 kbps
download speeds until the city's state of emergency has been lifted. In accordance with state laws that restrict
government-owned Internet providers, speeds will drop to a paltry 128 kbps once the city has returned to some level of
normalcy.
