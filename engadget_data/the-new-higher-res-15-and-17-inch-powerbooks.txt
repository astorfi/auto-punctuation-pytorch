Apple announced two spec bumps to their G4 PowerBooks at the
PhotoPlus Expo 2005 today. Expect the new machines to
have higher resolution displays; the 15-inch will hit 1440 x 960 (up from 1280 x 854), and the 17-inch will bound all
the way up to 1680 x 1050 (up from 1440 x 900). Both laptops' displays will actually have 46% increased brightness,
while supposedly managing a 22% increase in battery life. They'll also feature standard SuperDrives, built-in Cinema HD
support, and are available now with a new pricing scheme: the 12-inch will go for $1,499, the 15-inch for $1,999, and
the 17-inch for $2,499. Increments of $500 bonesâ€”easy enough, eh?
