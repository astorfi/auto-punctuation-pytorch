Once you've registered the newly minted handset, your current pre-loaded allocation will be topped up to a maximum of 50GB, not matching but doubling HTC's allowance. And just like Sense 4's offering, the free storage will remain valid for two years but there's no indication if there will be discounts for those who've become hooked on all that online real estate -- we hear it's very moreish.
