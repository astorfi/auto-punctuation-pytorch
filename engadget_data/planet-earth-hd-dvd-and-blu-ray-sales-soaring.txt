Well, the show was ported over to both of the competing high-def discs - HD DVD and Blu-ray - and according to Warner Home Video, it has pulled in more money than any other title. This $70 box set has generated $3.2 million dollars since April 24, which easily surpasses Scorsese's The Departed (2.8 million). Apparently, consumers want high-def media and are willing to spend good money it; maybe the fact that a BBC-created show is topping Hollywood says something about how important quality is.
