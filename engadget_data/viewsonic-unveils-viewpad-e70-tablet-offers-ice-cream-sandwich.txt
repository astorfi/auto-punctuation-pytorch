Announced at CES today, the e70 is powered by a 1GHz CPU and comes packed with 4GB of memory. The WiFi-enabled slate also supports 1080p HDMI output and sports a front-facing camera, though specifications like screen resolution and megapixel count remain a mystery. Perhaps most compelling is its $170 price point, though Viewsonic has yet to announce a launch date more specific than "Q1." We'll keep you abreast of the latest, but in the meantime, you can find the full PR, after the break.
