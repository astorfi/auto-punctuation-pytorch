 Wolverine has just unveiled the latest additionto their MVP line of kid-designed (we're justguessin') portable media players. The MVP 9120 comes loaded with a 120GB drive, which Wolverine says makes it thelargest-capacity portable media player on the market at the moment. The unit also includes a 7-in-1 memory card readerand has video out so you can connect it to a projector or TV. It's also apparently the only device on the market that'llwork with 33 different RAW-type camera files with EXIF information -- which may be enough for some to put up with therather unique choice of colors. The device also comes with all the necessary cables, a remote control, an ear piece anda carrying case with a built-in speaker.Â  Total cost: $599.
