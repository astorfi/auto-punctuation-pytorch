Then suddenly, somewhere along the primrose path to publication, original iPhone and iPod touch support evaporated. But no more. TomTom's pushed an update that allows for turn-by-turn navigation, but of course, you'll still need the car kit to work. Was this the missing link between your $100 and owning this app? [Warning: iTunes link]

Update: So, the Car Kit for iPod touch has hit TomTom's e-store, and it's $20 cheaper than the Car Kit for iPhone due to the lack of handsfree support (we guess, anyway). Thanks, Philippe!
