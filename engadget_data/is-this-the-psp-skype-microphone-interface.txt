This one, however, is quite curious -- we're seeing a device that appears to be the microphone created for the PSP's use with Skype on a respectable Japanese website, but weirdly enough, there's a "Copyright 2005" splash in the bottom left corner. Additionally, Famitsu has a couple of shots of the purported interface, and while all of this is perfectly murky right now, head on over to the read link and see what you can make of it.[Via JGadgets, thanks J]
