Yeah, we know, it's a little fuzzy because of the insane hype surrounding the handset itself, but Apple is doing a Bluetooth Headset too -- and guess what, the FCC just gave it a thumbs-up. Unfortunately for all of us, there are confidentiality agreements preventing more information about the device from showing up, but at least for now it looks like the missing pieces are finally falling into place for Apple's whole mobile phone initiative thing.
