Employing both Wireless Electricity technology developed at MIT, as well as Wireless Home Digital Interface (WHDI) this tube can supposedly stream video over 100 feet, but there's no telling if that WiTricity signal will be as far reaching. All this technology does add a good bit of heft to the panel's profile, so even though you might be avoiding that mess of tangled cables, don't think you're getting off that easy. Video of the wire-free panel is after the break.
