 Another major player has joined Qualcomm andCrown Castle with plans to enter a nascent mobile TV market whose future is wildly uncertain. Aloha Partners L.P. willultimately spend $500 million to roll out its Hiwire service nationwide on the 700MHz spectrum, which it will sharewith Qualcomm's MediaFlo, and which is considered superiorto the 1600MHz spectrum owned by Crown subsidiary Modeo.However, Hiwire will join Modeo in adopting the DVB-H standard for mobile TV, as opposed to the proprietary MediaFlotechnology that will be embedded into CDMA handsets. With Verizon already committed to offering the Qualcomm tech toits customers, Hiwire will need to partner with either Cingular or T-Mobile if it expects to gain a similar foothold inthe GSM market, and even then, its success will largely be based on consumers' willingness to adopt a service that sofar they have shown little interest in.[ViaMobileTracker]
