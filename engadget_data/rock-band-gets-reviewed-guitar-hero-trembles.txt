ArsTechnica managed to get ahold of the beastly package and give everything from the build quality to the multiplayer modes a full run-through, and the long and short of it is that Rock Band, well, rocks. Despite fears of lackluster quality, every piece of the kit was reported as being sturdy and ready to handle tons of abuse, and just in case you weren't aware, the wireless Guitar Hero III controller will function with Rock Band, but the same isn't true vice versa. While rocking solo, reviewers found that Guitar Hero was the superior title, noting that there "just wasn't as big of a sense of accomplishment" with RB, but after gathering up a few pals, everything changed. The crew found themselves spending countless hours rocking away as a band and loving every minute of it, and while the bundle is pricey, it was said to be worth every penny. So if you're still straddling the fence, do yourself a favor and check out the full skinny in the read link, but don't be alarmed if you feel the urge to dye your hair and get some ink done shortly thereafter.
