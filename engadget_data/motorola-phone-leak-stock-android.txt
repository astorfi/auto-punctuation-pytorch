Motorola's been talking up its phones in the pipeline as of late, which are said to feature stock Android, broader carrier availability and less bloatware. We first saw hints of such a device from a leak in Vietnam, but now @evleaks has weighed in with a stock Android smartphone that looks eerily familiar -- although this time, it's in a black box. What's to gain from the latest peek? First of all, it's plain as day that the phone in question is for AT&T, which features the carrier's name in the top left corner, its unique LTE logo in the top right and a bundled myAT&T app. Granted, it's not much of a surprise that Motorola is giving carriers some sway in the development of its smartphones, but given the latest leak, it seems that some of the more egregious customizations and bloat might stay on the sidelines. As for the back of the device, with a label that reads "XFON," well, we'll leave that to your interpretation.
