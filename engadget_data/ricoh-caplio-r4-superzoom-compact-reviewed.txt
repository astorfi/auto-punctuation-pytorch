Other nice touches include a skew-correction feature that adjusts non-level shots and andhistogram function for technical types, but some issues with picture quality -- most notably visible banding in a fewshots and significant noise at higher ISOs -- earned this model a good-but-not-great 84%. Still, the Ricoh definitelygets a thumbs up from D-L, and the sub-$450 pricetag won't break the bank.
