This is Ethan Czahor. Ethan is the new chief technology officer at Right to Rise, a political action committee formed by former Florida governor and presidential hopeful Jeb Bush. He also happens to have a track record of saying some pretty shameful shit on Twitter and no amount of digital spring cleaning will be able to cover his virtual tracks. Czahor, a co-founder of Hipster.com (which was eventually purchased by Engadget parent company AOL) never seemed to realize that what you say online can and will haunt you for the rest of your life. Like those times he referred to women as sluts... repeatedly.


Update: According to CNBC political columnist John Harwood, the Right to Rise PAC has accepted Czahor's resignation due to the "regrettable/insensitive comments." Mr. Czahor confirmed the move in a tweet, saying "I only hope that my recent news won't dissuade future techies from entering politics, regardless of political affiliations/backgrounds..and I've resigned my role at Right to Rise. Best of luck to everyone there, and I apologize in advance to whoever fills my position.
