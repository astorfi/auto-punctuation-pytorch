 
Truly our craziest show yet. In case you didn't tune into the livestream of The Engadget Show on Saturday (and if you somehow didn't hear about the news), then you're in for a real treat. The crew gets especially wild on this episode while talking Hulu and plans for world domination with Boxee's Avner Ronen, revealing the first partner handset for Windows Phone 7 Series with Microsoft's Aaron Woodman, and playing around with the Dell Mini 5, as well as the forthcoming Engadget app for Android. Oh, and there's also a fascinating short piece on chiptune music and visuals and the folks who make the magic happen. If you do one thing today, make it The Engadget Show. You won't be sorry. The full video is available to stream after the break, or you can download it below.
