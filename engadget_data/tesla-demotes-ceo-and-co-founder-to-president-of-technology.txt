 Tesla has demoted CEO Martin Eberhard, replacing him with interim CEO Michael Marks, with the company seeking a permanent replacement for Eberhard who will be moving to a role defined as "President of Technology." It's hard to pin down a precise reason for the demotion: the only negative news to come out of the Tesla camp is the "scaling back" of the roadster's battery capabilities back in April. Perhaps we'll know more on Monday, when the company makes an official statement on Eberhard's change in role.[Via Autoblog Green]
