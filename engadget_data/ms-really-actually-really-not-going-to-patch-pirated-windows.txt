Microsoft and antipiracy, those are some chewy words in our mouths. Surprise! Redmond's launching yet another
antipiracy campaign, this time called Windows Genuine Advantage (oh, how perfectly Freudian). The premise is that from
summer this year on, all those Windows XP boxes out there will actually have to authenticate to receive software
updates and security fixesâ€”naturally authentication can't occur on what can be identified as pirated MS software. And
we're totally sure no one will ever figure out a way to bypass the authentication, or repackage the updates, just like
no one ever figured out how to break XP's product registration scheme. Microsoft: 1, Pirates: 0.
