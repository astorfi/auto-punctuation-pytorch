For those unaware, Andy Rubin is the vice president of engineering at Google, and he's had his fingers in Android before the mobile OS was taken mainstream by El Goog. He recently sat down to talk mobile with PCMag, and he left the world with a wealth of quotes to ponder. For starters, he practically calls out OEMs who aren't keeping up with Android's releases, noting that "there's no advantage to the OEM of using an older version, and I'd say there's a consumer disadvantage." Clearly, he's not a fan of all of this fragmentation, either. Moving onto Windows Phone 7, he really came out swinging. When asked what he thought about WP7 as a competitor, here's what came flowing out: 

"I think the screen shots I've seen are interesting, but look, the world doesn't need another platform. Android is free and open; I think the only reason you create another platform is for political reasons." 
We'll obviously need to wait for Windows Phone 7 to launch (and see a few quarters of sales numbers) to see if he's just blowing hot air, but it's interesting fodder at least. Hit the source link for much, much more where this came from -- and keep it sensible in comments, okay? It's just code, after all.
