Perhaps it's due to manufacturers expanding from China to Vietnam's relatively cheap (but limited) labor pool? Or maybe it's because the kids at Tinhte are just resourceful as hell? Whatever it is, they've just scooped themselves what appears to be an unannounced MacBook update (identifying itself as a MacBook7,1) that includes a faster 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor (up from 2.26GHz) and NVIDIA GeForce 320M graphics with 256MB of DDR3 SDRAM (an update from the GeForce 9400M found in the current MacBook6,1) -- right, the same CPU and GPU as the entry level 13-inch MacBook Pro but for only $999 (assuming Apple maintains the same entry-level pricing). These minor bumps aren't enough to warrant a model change, however, as we're still seeing "Model No: A1342" stamped on the box. Of course, this could be an elaborate hoax, but Tinhte has an impressive track record and these MacBook specs are right in line with what we'd expect since the white MacBook was last updated in October 2009. No word on when we'll see these announced but it's gotta be soon -- Tuesday perhaps, with a refreshed MacBook Air if we're lucky.
