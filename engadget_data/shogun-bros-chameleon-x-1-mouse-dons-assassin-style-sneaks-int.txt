Look out, it's about to get a bit stealthier -- Shogun Bros. tells us that the dual analog rodent is sporting some fresh digs to ape the style of Assassin's Creed Revelations, complete with antique decorated leather mouse buttons. Cowhide aside, this is the same 1600dpi, 16 button wireless doodad the firm updated earlier this year. The branded mouse will debut at CES 2012 in "Altair white" and "Ezio grey," and promises to help you eliminate your targets in style. The outfit hinted to us that they'll be bringing a few other killer products to the show as well -- we'll be sure to sneak a peek while we're there.
