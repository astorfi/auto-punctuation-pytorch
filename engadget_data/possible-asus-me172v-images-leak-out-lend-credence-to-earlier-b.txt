 Sometimes, all a good rumor needs to bolster its street cred is a couple of images, and thanks to Notebook Italia and a Russian retailer, the 7-inch Asus ME172V has transformed from mere benchmark figures into a solid possibility. A site called oro1.ru is showing the device up for pre-order at 6,990 rubles (about $225) for a 16GB version, complete with 16GB, 1,024 x 600 screen, Android 4.1 and 1GB RAM. We espied the device earlier on GLBenchmark, which validates those specs while also showing a 1GHz CPU and Mali 400 GPU. Notebook Italia also scoped a photo on Picasa from an apparent 7-inch Asus ME371MG tablet, which allegedly sports a 1.2GHz Intel Atom Z2420 chip, 1,280 x 800 IPS display, 1GB of RAM, 3G and 16GB of storage. Considering the slim evidence, that slate's more doubtful, though, and we can't vouch for the Russian vendor's credibility either -- so you may wanna cool your jets until there's official word from the Nexus 7 maker.
