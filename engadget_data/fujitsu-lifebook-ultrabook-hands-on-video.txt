  We still don't have detailed specs or even a model number, but we just had a chance to go hands-on with Fujitsu's new Lifebook Ultrabook at CeBIT. The 14-inch device will ship in red and silver, and is very thin -- 16mm, to be more precise -- including a frameless display that folds flat 180 degrees to lie flush. The nearly edge-to-edge LCD looks fantastic, at least powered off. There's a webcam up top, two USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, a proprietary Ethernet connector, SD card slot, an HDMI port, headphone jack and a Kensington Security Slot. There also appears to be a backlit keyboard and a fingerprint reader -- just one of the proposed security features for Fujitsu's yet-to-be-named enterprise Ultrabook. The magnesium body is very lightweight, at 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs), though the lid did feel a bit flimsy, at least on the sample we saw today. Pricing details have yet to be announced, though Fujitsu reps have confirmed that the Ultrabook will ship by early summer. Jump past the break for a closer look in our video hands-on.



Update: It turns out that the Ultrabook does not fold flat -- the device we saw at the Fujitsu press conference had this capability, but only because it's a shell-only mock-up.
