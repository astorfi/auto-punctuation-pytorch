At Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit today, the ephemeral messaging app's founder Evan Spiegel said that ads are en route "soon." Those ads will be based around the Story section of the application that provides a platform for evaporating recaps of whatever you choose. "We're cutting through the new technology around ads to the core of it, which is telling a story," Spiegel (above) told moderator Katie Couric. Ads seem like a natural progression for any social network, so users shouldn't exactly be surprised by this -- after all, you gotta keep those ghosts employed somehow.
