For a company's that's mired in legal red tape, Aereo's nationwide expansion isn't showing any signs of slowing. The streaming service, which uses an antenna / DVR system to deliver local broadcast stations, will soon launch in three additional major cities -- Houston and Dallas-Ft. Worth, TX; Miami, FL -- in a rollout scheduled to complete by the end of September. Interested parties can head to Aereo's site now to get a leg up on pre-registration for the service, with rates starting at $8/mo for 20 hours of DVR storage. Take note, the first month's gratis, but after that it's the same old subscription ball-and-chain just like any other. And, hey, at least this is one way to guarantee Moonves' content kingdom and his trusty Chenbot still have a home on your flatscreen or iPad or, you know, device.
