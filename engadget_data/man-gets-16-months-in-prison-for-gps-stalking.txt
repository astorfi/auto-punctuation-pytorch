Wait a second, some dude in California gets 16 months in prison for stalking his ex-girlfriend by attaching a GPS
tracker to her car, but it's perfectly legal for the police
to do the same exact thing without a notifying you or obtaining a court order? Yeah, we know, there are some legal
subtleties involving the right to privacy here, but it seems like if it's illegal for the police to tap your phone or
email without a court order, it should be illegal for them to add a GPS tracker to your car, too.
