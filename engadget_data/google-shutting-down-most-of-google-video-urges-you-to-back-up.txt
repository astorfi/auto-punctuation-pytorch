Everyone that isn't involved in the Google Video for Business and Education programs will see their videos terminated from Google's servers soon, with playback no longer available after May 13th. Options for downloading content you've uploaded or migrating it to YouTube have been made available, though they too won't last beyond the 27th of next month. We suppose this makes sense in light of all the riches that Google is pouring into YouTube and the fact that its more popular video site is shedding its time limits for vids, but still, we had a bit of a soft spot for Google Video and the obscure stuff we could find on there. Better get the most out of it while the thing's still around.
