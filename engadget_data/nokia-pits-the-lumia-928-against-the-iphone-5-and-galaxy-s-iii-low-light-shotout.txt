Now that the Lumia 928's mere existence is official, Nokia's posted a video comparing its footage-shooting chops against the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S III in low-light conditions. The folks in Espoo also revealed that the handset will be toting an 8.7-megapixel camera, matching the Lumia 920. Naturally, the film showcases just what PureView tech, paired with a Carl Zeiss lens and proprietary OIS can do. After letting the 928's footage do the talking for roughly 50 seconds, Elop and Co. turn to side-by-side comparison shots, pointing out better color saturation, sharper image focus and less noise. Head past the break to catch the shootout in its entirety, and get a sense of deja vu.
