From our first taste of its dual-core potential at CES, to the stream of leaked specs, shots and release dates of the phone in the months since. Well, the wait officially ends on September 8th, as Verizon just confirmed the release date with a new version of the robotic battle teaser ad we saw a couple weeks ago. Big Red has also launched a Droid Does website with info on VZW's Droids and its new Arena augmented reality scavenger hunt -- where deft digital orienteers can win a Bionic, HDTV, laptop, tablet, or quadrocopter. For more info, hit the second source link below and head on past the break to see the vid for yourself. Feel free to enjoy the blade work of a raven-haired warrior slicing up cyborgs while you're at it.

Update: Looks like Verizon's ramping up for the Bionic era, as the handsets have already begun to arrive in stores. Pic's after the break.
