We had high expections (okay, maybe not) when
we heard about the Bose SoundDock, yet another speaker
system for iPods (save the first and second gen models) and iPod minis that also charges your player. CNET rather likes
the player, though; it filled their 10 by 18-foot room with good sound, masquerading well as a big speaker. We like its
looks, but $300 is just a bit too pricy for us, especially without stereo separation greater than three feet and no
other audio inputs besides the iPod connector. Next!
