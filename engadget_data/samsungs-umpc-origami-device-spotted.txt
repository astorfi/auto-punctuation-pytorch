It'sapparently 15 x 20cm (about 6 x 8-inches), runs a low-power 900MHz Celeron, has 512MB RAM, 802.11a/b/g, Bluetooth, and,of course, Windows XP Tablet, which we can only assume is tricked for the device. We'll get our hands on this thing onyour behalf as soon as we can, so stand by.[Thanks, Gob & Max]
