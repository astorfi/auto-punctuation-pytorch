	Nintendo's 3DS update had been dragging its feet, but it's got its act together, sneaking out to devices a day earlier than expected. It will add both 3D video-recording and DLC capabilities to the handheld, although there's been no confirmation yet of the Hulu Plus feature promised back in October. According to Joystiq, there's now a new Nintendo Zone to interact with when connected to certain WiFi hotspots and a host of new "accomplishments" to unlock on StreetPass. Users are reporting that the update is rolling out now -- it may be worth booting up that guilty Black Friday purchase for a look-see.
