AMD has always had our back in this regard, and now the company is back with further proof, in the form of a little something called the ATI FirePro 2450 video. This guy supports not two but four monitors, rocking either DVI or VGA, at up to 1920 x 1200 resolution, in a low profile form factor. The device includes support for DirectX 10.1, OpenGL 2.1 visual effects, and Microsoft Windows, and ships with 512MB of memory for $499. ATI points out that this device is aimed at "financial institutions," possibly a gift for your sweetheart in the foreign exchange market?[Via Electronista]
