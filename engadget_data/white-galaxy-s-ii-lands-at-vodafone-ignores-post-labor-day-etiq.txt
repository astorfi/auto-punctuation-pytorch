Today, the albino version of Samsung's Gingerbread handset officially made its way to Vodafone, just a few days after launching in the UK and more than a month after leaking in "official looking" images. The blanched, 4.3-inch smartphone is available for free with a two-year, Â£36 per month price plan (roughly equivalent to $58 per month), though it's still unclear whether it'll be making its way stateside anytime soon. If you're looking to brighten up your pocket, you can grab your own at the source link below.
