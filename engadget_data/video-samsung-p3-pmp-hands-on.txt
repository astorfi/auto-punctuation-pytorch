But fret not because we headed back to the company's booth to seek out the 3-inch WQVGA player with haptic feedback among the nauseating amount of HDTVs. The walk-through we were given paid specific attention to the P3's stereo Bluetooth capabilites as well as the touch-based interface. We came away pretty impressed with the polished UI and the smoothness of the user experience. Check out the device in action after the break and our gallery of hands-on shots as well.
