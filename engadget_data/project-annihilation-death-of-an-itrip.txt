Some companies make you jump through hoops to get a replacement for a malfunctioning device. Griffin Technology
takes a rather different approach to the process by issuing replacements right away, and asking only that the customer
destroy the non-functioning device "in a creative manner" and send photographic evidence. Well, one customer took the
challenge to heart and decided the only sane thing to do would be to take the obvious route: blow it up with model
rocket engines. Luckily, she also had the good sense to document the whole process. Witness evidence of destruction
after the jump.
