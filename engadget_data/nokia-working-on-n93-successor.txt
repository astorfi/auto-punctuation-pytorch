After all, the beastly superphone has been kicking around for just a handful of months (in users' hands, anyway) and we wouldn't say the specs are looking long in the tooth just yet. Alas, blurry shots have emerged of a phone being called the "N93i," looking altogether like a mildly facelifted version of its predecessor. No official word on what specs might be packed into that attractive shell, but high on the list of possibilities are A2DP and an upgrade to S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1.[Via Slashgear]
