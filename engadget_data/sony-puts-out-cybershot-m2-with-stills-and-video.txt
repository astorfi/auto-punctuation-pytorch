Sony's adding a new contender in the
CyberShot lineup â€” the M2 is a 5.1 megapixel
camera with both still photo and MPEG4 movie modes. It's got a 2.5-inch LCD, 3X optical zoom, supports PictBridge, and
captures 320 x 240 resolution video at 15fps to a Memory Stick PRO Duo. It's also got an onboard stereo microphone, a
first for a Sony digicam. The CyberShot M2 will be available in Europe this coming November.
