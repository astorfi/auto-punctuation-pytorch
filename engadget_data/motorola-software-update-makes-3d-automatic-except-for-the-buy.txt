To that end Motorola has developed an update for its latest set-top boxes that allow them to automatically detect and process 3D signals so those properly equipped can watch without having to lift a finger, and even adjusts the on screen graphics to match. No word when operators will actually deploy the new software, though odds are it will be well before you actually buy a 3DTV so we wouldn't worry too much, yet.
