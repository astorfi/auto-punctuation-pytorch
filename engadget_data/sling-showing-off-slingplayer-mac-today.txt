TiVo's not the only companywith early-release video software on Appleboxes -- in addition to today's comprehensive keynote coverage, it's come to our attention that Sling Media's going tobe showing off the Mac version of their SlingPlayer software today for Macworld. Granted, it's still an alpha, so wedoubt they'll be releasing it to the public sooner than their Q2 release target, but it's quite more than enough towhet the respective appetites of our Mac-usin' place-shiftin' staff 'round the office, that's for sure.
