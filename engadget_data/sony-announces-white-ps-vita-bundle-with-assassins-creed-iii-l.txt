 Still not sold on the PlayStation Vita? Then Sony's hoping that it's latest bundle will be more to your liking. In addition to the just-announced Assassin's Creed III: Liberation game, it packs a limited edition "crystal white" PS Vita (WiFi only), along with a 4GB memory card. Unfortunately, you'll still have a bit of a wait before you can get your hands on it, with the bundle only set to hit stores on October 30th (coinciding with the game's release). No word on a price for it just yet, nor is there any word on the white PS Vita being sold separately. Not to be left out, the PlayStation 3 is also getting an Assassin's Creed III bundle of its own, which includes the game and some exclusive DLC -- no price for it either, though.
