 It looks like the Dreamcast's long, slow demise has taken another turn for the worse, as Sega recently announced that it'll soon stop supporting the console in Japan, with its predecessor, the Saturn, also suffering a similar fate. According to the company, the cut-off date for repairs will be September 28th of this year, after which you'll be left to fend for yourself if your console finally conks out after one too many games of Ikaruga. Given what they're selling for these days, however, simply replacing the console with another, slightly less used one is probably your best bet in any event.[Via Joystiq]
