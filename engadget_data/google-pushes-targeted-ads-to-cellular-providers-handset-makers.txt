Apparently the web giant is looking at new ways to get ads out to subscribers by offering customized tools and handsets to a few providers it has allegedly approached. T-Mobile is purportedly furthest along in these discussions, but Google is also rumored to be chatting with Verizon Wireless and AT&T -- with whom they are already pretty friendly by nature of the partnership with Apple. We all love Google and the magical things they offer us, but unless these handsets come heavily subsidized -- both handset and calling, as has been rumored -- we'll have to take a rain check on more ads, thankyouverymuch.
