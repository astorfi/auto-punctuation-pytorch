Hot on the heels of the aforementioned 8800, RIM has officially taken the wraps off its hotly anticipated (and well scooped) 8300 "Curve," a device that takes the standard QWERTY BlackBerry formula and throws in a handful of consumer-friendly features for good measure. Clearly at the top of the list is a 2 megapixel cam with integrated flash -- but other goodies include comprehensive media support (WMA, WMV, and H.263 all make the cut), stereo Bluetooth, a true 3.5mm headphone jack, microSD expansion for when you exhaust (quickly) your 64MB of internal ROM, and a 15.5mm thick shell that's pretty stylish by RIM standards. Now that the phone's official, we're hoping to see it hit AT&T -- among other carriers -- in the coming weeks.[Via The Boy Genius Report]
