You'll have to wait until Valentine's Day to get the next dose of Netflix's popular series House of Cards, but it's doling out some love early. Starting today, fans can revisit season one with optional director's commentary tracks from all six directors: David Fincher, James Foley, Joel Schumacher, Charles McDougall, Carl Franklin and Allen Coulter. As shown above, viewers get the additional commentary option under the alternate audio/subtitles menu and it should be available on all devices. Usually these kinds of extras are tied to physical media, but Netflix announced recently it would give them a test run starting with its original content like this show and Orange is the New Black. If you appreciate the extra insight give them a spin, we know the streaming company makes many of its decisions based on analytics so vote with your play button -- if you're waiting for 4K we should hear more about that very soon.
