Alright mixmasters, turns out that Numark dueling iPod DJ
mixer we peeped back in April is indeed not vaporware. Numark will be announcing tomorrow the iDJ mixing console
for iPod as part of their summer 2005 product lineup â€” a two-channel mixer that accepts all iPod models with bottom
connectors and breaks out their controls into its dedicated interface. Both channels sport a 3-band EQ and gain
control, and the unit's got dedicated mic and phono/line inputs for bringing in additional signals. It's also rocking
some USB connectivity, enabling it to converse with your portable rig as a music-loading base. What we don't yet know
is the price, but y'know, if you've already shelled out for two iPods it's probably not gonna break the bank either
way.

Update: we're looking at $399.00 retail/$249.00 street on this thing. Not bad, not bad at all.
