Previously known to leak fans as the Ville, HTC's brought Ice Cream Sandwich to the fold, alongside the very latest version of its Sense UI -- 4.0 to match that Android version number. The highlight here appears to be that uniformly thin alloy unibody; in science terms, it's a plasma-heated micro arc oxidation process, giving HTC's typical aluminum frame a smooth ceramic finish and apparently toughening it up on the way. Camera-wise, it's wielding a potent eight megapixel sensor with HTC's very own ImageChip and a f/2.0 autofocus lens that's likely to blow all of its previous camera modules out of the water. HTC has focused on the camera software too -- the One S apparently capable of nabbing shots in under a second and the ability to capture full-size stills during 1080p recording. All this, and it's a mere 7.9mm thick. We'll be hunting down a model for a hands-on as soon as we're finished here. Expect to see our impressions very soon, check HTC's video preview after the break now.
