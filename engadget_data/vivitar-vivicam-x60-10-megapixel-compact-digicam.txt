The camera, due out later this year, boasts a range of features not typicallyavailable in a compact, especially one expected to retail for under $500. Those features include a 10 megapixel CCD, 6xoptical zoom and a 2.8-inch LCD. Right now, Vivitar's providing very little info about the X60 other than those specs --and the only pictures they've released make it pretty clear that production probably hasn't even begun -- but it couldbe the start of a new wave of high-megapixel point-and-shoots, especially since we suspect that this one is made byPremier as well, which means we'll likely see more of these, under a range of brands, over the next few months.
