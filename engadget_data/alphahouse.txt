If the promotional images are any indication, there's bound to be an awful lot of BlackBerry checking happening in Amazon's new Alpha House series. And now you can finally see for yourself. The first three episodes of the Capitol Hill comedy (including April's pilot) have just hit Amazon all at once. Not quite the binge watching we've become accustomed to over on Netflix, but it should be enough to keep you at home on a Friday night. The first three are free. Additional episodes of the John Goodman vehicle will be free for Prime users, starting next week.
