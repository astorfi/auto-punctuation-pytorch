We hadn't even been aware that the US military was already using these there (we'd heard about their use in
Afghanistan), but iRobot, the company behind the Roomba RoboVac, says that the first PackBot has been destroyed in
action in Iraq. They also reveal that there are somewhere between 50 and 100 of the robots on the
ground in both Iraq and Afghanistan that are being used for stuff like reconaissance and the finding and
disposing of explosives. If you don't count any of those Predator unmanned surveillance drones that have
been downed, could this be the first robotic casualty of war?
