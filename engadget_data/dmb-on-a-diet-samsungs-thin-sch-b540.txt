And on that mildly depressing note, we present to you this here little gem from Samsung, the SCH-B540. As usual, it has a pivoting doohickey of a screen with QVGA resolution, Bluetooth, and a decent 2-megapixel cam, but what sets the B540 apart is its svelte figure -- just 14.9 millimeters stand between you and the other side of the handset. And oh yeah, the stereo speakers and TV-out don't hurt, either.
