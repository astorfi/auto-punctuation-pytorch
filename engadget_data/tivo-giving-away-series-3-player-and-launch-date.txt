So, the fact that TiVo has just launched an eleven-week contest in conjunction withAmerican Idol, in which the grand prize is a TiVo Series 3 DVR, has already resulted in a flood of speculation as towhen the long-awaited box will finally materialize. The contest rules stipulate that TiVo has up to four months afterthe end of the contest to fulfill, meaning that the latest the Series 3 will be available will be October.Engadget contributor Dave Zatz speculates that the box will be out the first of September, at a price of $800. Anyoneelse want to hazard a guess?
