Parrot AR.Drone2.0 Fly - Record - Share: is this an all-new device or a firmware bump that adds some new functionality? The social media aspect of the poster is pretty self evident -- and might be accomplished with a device firmware upgrade -- but we're kind of hoping for a new Drone with better cameras, speed, battery life, and while we're listing things, a dedicated remote control wouldn't hurt a bit. While we're not sure exactly what AR.Drone2.0 is, you can be sure we'll be back in a few days with hands-on of whatever shakes out of Parrot's PR.
