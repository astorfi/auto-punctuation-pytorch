  If you've been following the latest bub around the hub, you may remember Apple's recent scuff with Shenzhen-based Proview Technology -- the Chinese outfit that holds the local trademark on the name "iPad." Not only did Apple lose a trademark lawsuit for the iPad name, but some time later mainland government had the slabs removed from retailers in the city of Shjiazhuang. Now, Apple's claiming that a Hong Kong court has sided with it in a similar battle, saying in a statement to China Daily that they purchased "Proview's worldwide rights to the iPad trademark in 10 different countries several years ago," referring, perhaps, to the deal they made Taiwanese arm of the company, "Proview refuses to honor their agreement with Apple." Xie Xianghui, Proview's lawyer, shot back with his own statement, explaining that the court merely ruled that the trademark couldn't be sold to a third party before hearing ends, claiming that this move does not count as a ruling in Apple's favor. Xie went on to suggest the issue stemmed from Apple underestimating the legal complications of doing business in China.
