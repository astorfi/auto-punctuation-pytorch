We got in touch with our people down in Cupertino who just confirmed the (somewhat) bad news is real: "Like current iPods, the touch can only view calendar entries created on your computer". In other words, no, you can't make new calendar entries on the fly. Why Apple would want to remove this simple feature that's already built into the mobile OS X calendar experience is really beyond us, but we guess they're doing their damnedest to draw the line in the sand between iPod and iPhone. Still, makes you wonder what other minor, useful features Apple pulled from the touch.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
