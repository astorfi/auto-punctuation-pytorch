 Seriously, guys, ION promises that this time around when it says it has a schedule for an HD launch, it's for real; maybe the previous 2008 figure was a clerical error, because now things are go for 2009. ION Television will lead things off in the first quarter, with the other two offerings getting switched on sometime later in the year -- qubo will target kids' eyeballs and multilingual ears and ION Life will offer up themes of "active lifestyles and personal growth." Sounds great, right? Well, not so fast -- even though the company has taken an extra year in prep, this year's press release has some pretty familiar echoes of the previous one that we don't like the sound of: "native and up-converted HD programming."
