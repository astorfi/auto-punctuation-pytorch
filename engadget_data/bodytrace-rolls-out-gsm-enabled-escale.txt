Of course, the big advantage here is ease of setup rather than portability, since you'll be able to automatically (and privately) upload your weight to the BodyTrace website without having to first mess with WiFi settings and whatnot. Somewhat surprisingly, the eScale is also actually cheaper than something like Withings' WiFi scale, with it running just $59.99 including a year of service -- or, alternatively, $9.99 a month with a $9.99 up-front setup fee (which also includes the scale).
