It looks like T-Mo's efforts to stand out from the carrier crowd are continuing to have an impact. The US operator claims it attracted a million new customers in Q3, following the 1.1 million people who joined its network over the summer. The company attributes this success largely to its UnCarrier plans, including Simple Choice and Jump, which it says are starting to "resonate" with consumers. Then again, rivals AT&T and Verizon have reported similar lifts in popularity last quarter, so one could also argue that T-Mobile is just keeping pace with the rest of the pack -- with the notable exception of Sprint, whose subscriber base is shrinking.
