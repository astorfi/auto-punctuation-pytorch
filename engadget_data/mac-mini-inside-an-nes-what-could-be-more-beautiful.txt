Brent Housen's buddy managed to get the whole Mac inside a NEScase, and added a DVD writer via an IDE to USB adapter. All the back ports of the mini are available, he made sure thefront buttons of the NES were functional, and he's even planning on enabling the controller plugs for use withemulators. Pretty hardcore stuff, we're still trying figure out this whole "soldering" thing.
