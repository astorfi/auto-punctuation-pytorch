For starters, they much prefer the new rocker key control setup to the confusing layout of Archos' AV500, and find the 4.3-inch screen to be much sharper and glossier than that device as well. There's also a kickstand for propping the 604 up on a desk, and little enhancements like interface tweaks and USB charging. With the weight loss and other refinements, T3 finds the 604 to be "infinitely more portable than its ancestors," but that approximate $510 launch price might keep this thing from mass market aspirations all the same.[Thanks, Ash]
