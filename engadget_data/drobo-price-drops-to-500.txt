Even though we didn't think the $700 pricetag for a Drobo is that unreasonable considering its capabilities, Data Robotics is apparently deciding to preemptively strike and cut its price before it even reaches retail availability. With enough pre-orders in to increase volume and cut costs, Data Robotics was apparently able to shave a full $200 bones (nearly 30%) off the top, meaning now you'll only have to ante up $500 if you want to take one home. Pre-order customers will even get a check back for the $200 difference, which we presume they'll probably blow on more (or larger) drives.P.S. -For the curious: it's still slated to land in early June.
