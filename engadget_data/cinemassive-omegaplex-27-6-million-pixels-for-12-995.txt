Nowadays, it takes a real beast to even catch the ever-wandering eye of we geeks, and while the CineMassive OmegaPlex isn't a HIPerSpace, you won't need a government loan and a damn good research proposal to claim one as your own. Boasting 27.6 million pixels and a total screen resolution of 7,860 x 3,600, this ridiculous rig also comes with a 3-year warranty and a practically unheard of "zero dead pixel" policy. Feel free to infinitely boost your 1337-ness by handing over $12,995 and patiently awaiting delivery via the largest ground vehicle UPS owns. Check the vid after the break for a little more encouragement. [Warning: PDF read link][Via Elite Choice]
