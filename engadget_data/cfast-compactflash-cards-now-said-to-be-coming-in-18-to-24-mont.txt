As CNET's Underexposed blog reports, a Lexar rep says he "predicts" that the cards should start showing up in "18 to 24 months," and that companies will "want to start working on prototype samples as soon as the specification is finalized." The big advantage to the cards, as we've mentioned, is their use of an SATA interface, which not only boosts the transfer rate to a speedy 375MB/sec but, of course, also makes them incompatible with current CompactFlash-based cameras. And you thought that 55-in-1 memory card reader was future proof.
