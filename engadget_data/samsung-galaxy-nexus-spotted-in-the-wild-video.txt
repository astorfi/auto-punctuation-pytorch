  Leaks are flying left and right as Samsung's Unpacked event approaches, with the latest coming from Romania's Mobilissimo.ro. Today, the site published new images and video of what could be the Samsung Galaxy Nexus -- the long-awaited follow-up to the Nexus S. At this point, it's difficult to say whether the device (model number "Tuna") totally jibes with the leaked specs we saw earlier this week, though its spacious display (rumored to be of 4.65-inch HD Super AMOLED stock) does look rather sharp -- the screenshots we've seen are indeed at 720 x 1280 resolution. Other than that, the handset appears to boast a 1,750mAh battery, along with a five megapixel camera and that rumored Ice Cream Sandwich UI, replete with onscreen buttons.Compared with the Nexus S, the front-facing camera on this handset is shifted further to the right, with the proximity sensor nestled between the earpiece and the shooter, rather than all the way on the left. Its corners, meanwhile, seem less rounded than what you'll find on the earlier version, though we noticed that it does have a micro-USB port lurking at the bottom center, much like its ancestor. Of course, we'll have to wait until October 11th to see whether these shots are as good as advertised, but you can head past the break to see the purportedly authentic video or to gaze at some extra screenshots.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
