DIYer macetech has sidestepped the whole "boring" furniture problem by installing 81 ShiftBrite LED modules into a 2x2 foot IKEA table which run a sine plasma into HSV/RGB conversion by way of an Arduino. Sure, it's probably not something your grandmother would want in her living room -- but your friends would undoubtedly be pretty jealous to see this thing hanging out in your place. Watch out for seizures, though. Video of the table in action after the break.[Via Make]
