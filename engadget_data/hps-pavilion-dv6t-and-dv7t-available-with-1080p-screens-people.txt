If you fall into that camp, well, the Powers That Be over at HP heard you -- both machines are now available with 1080p displays, for an extra $150. As before, both come standard with 2GHz quad-core Core i7 processors, AMD Radeon HD 6490M graphics with 1GB of video memory, 4GB of RAM, and 640GB hard drives. HP is also offering free upgrades to 6GB RAM and 750GB hard drive space, though no promises on how long that'll last. Before you get too excited, though, 1080p displays are only an option on these so-called Quad Edition models and the dv6t Select Edition -- meaning, you can't opt for a lower-end dv6 or dv7t and expect to upgrade it. Confusing naming conventions aside, if you're tempted, we suggest you avail yourself of some sweet coupons at the source links.
