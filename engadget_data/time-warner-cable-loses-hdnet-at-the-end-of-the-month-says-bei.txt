 Bad news for Mark Cuban, not only are his Dallas Mavericks out of the NBA Playoffs, but Time Warner Cable is dropping HDNet and HDNet Movies on all of its systems on May 31. Hopefully this doesn't mark the beginning of the end of the network MOJO HD-style, especially since we've heard of the network sliding onto new Comcast systems recently, but TWC PR director Robyn Watson doesn't seem optimistic, saying "being in HD is not enough." Ouch. Still, fans of Art Mann Presents and the like take heart, the "24x7 HD Network for men" MavTV is launching on the HD Xtra tier at the beginning of June.
