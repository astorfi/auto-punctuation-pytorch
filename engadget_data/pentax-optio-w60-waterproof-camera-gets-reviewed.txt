What's more, it's also apparently reasonably rugged, and it takes some decent pictures for good measure. While you can expect the usual noise problems at the highest ISO settings (including a nearly useless ISO 6400), the W60 looks to actually perform decent enough up to ISO 800, which is more than you can say for some cameras. On the downside, the site found that the camera suffered from some "particularly bad barrel distortion" at wide angle settings, and it proved to be a bit more sluggish than the norm, which appears to be at least partly due to the camera's autofocus system. Still, if resistance to the elements is your top priority, it looks like this one will get the job done.
