Unfortunately for us, the unit was extremely pre-release, meaning the menus felt sluggish, the device crashed a couple of times, and it generally felt like there was a lack of polish. But the folks at Sling aren't really ones to disappoint with what they put out there, and since the Catcher isn't out until Q2 we're going to give it a pass for now.
