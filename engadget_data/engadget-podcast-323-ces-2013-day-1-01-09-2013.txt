 All good things come to those who wait, and sometimes to those who don't. At CES pretty much no one waits for anything. Which is good, because it means we can get the latest tech news to you the moment it's announced. That's not to say the event is without surprises, and there are a few of those right here on the first official Engadget CES podcast. Listen in below.

 Hosts: Tim Stevens, Brian Heater Producer: James Trew
