That's just what it announced earlier today with the teeny Powershot ELPH 130IS, a $200 compact camera that offers wireless sharing capability with otherwise innocuous specs: a 16-megapixel sensor, DIGIC 4 processor, 8x optically stabilized zoom lens and an f/3.2-6.9 28mm wide-angle lens. We had a chance to play for a bit with the new model, along with the freshly launched A2600 and A1400 models sans WiFi, and although we couldn't snap any photos with the new models, we can affirm that they all seem like decent offerings for budget-minded vacationers or casual shooters, with the latter two at a miserly $150 and $100 respectively.
