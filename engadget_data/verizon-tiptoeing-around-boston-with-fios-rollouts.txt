More specifically, the areas of Boston, Brookline, Somerville, Cambridge, Everett, Revere, Chelsea, Medford, Melrose, Watertown and Quincy have yet to be reached by Verizon's recent expansion efforts, and for whatever reason, it seems that may be the case for some time to come. According to a response by Boston's Mayor on the situation, Verizon has "declined the city's repeated encouragement to enter a cable franchise negotiation, opting instead to slowly build in the suburbs." Granted, it's not unusual for the firm to target the outskirts, but it's certainly not pleasing news for Bostonians holding out for FiOS.[Thanks, Jason K.]
