 In an interview curiously timed just ahead of Samsung's Galaxy S 4 shindig tomorrow, Apple senior VP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller took time out to tell the Wall Street Journal exactly where he believes his company's product outpaces its Android competition. There's no mention of the Korean company or its flagship product by name, but he took care aim at a frequent target of Android foes: fragmentation.

  Android is often given a free replacement for a feature phone and the experience isn't as good as an iPhone. When you take an Android device out of the box, you have to sign up to nine accounts with different vendors to get the experience iOS comes with...They don't work seamlessly together
 According to the WSJ, he also shared company data indicating four times as many customers had switched to iPhone from Android during Q4 as the reverse. We'd be interested in seeing what those numbers look like in the quarter of the next Galaxy's release just to follow up, but owners of either product can find more (predictable) talking points at the source link.

 Update: Had enough? Apparently Phil hasn't, continuing his media tour to Reuters -- did he lose our number? -- rattling the fragmentation saber again, and this time pointing it squarely at rival Samsung. Citing Google's own Android Dashboard data, he pointed out that only 16 percent of users are on Jelly Bean despite it being out for a year. Also called on the carpet is the Galaxy S 4 ahead of its launch, as he said customers will wait for an update yet again after it ships with last year's software. Your move, Samsung.
