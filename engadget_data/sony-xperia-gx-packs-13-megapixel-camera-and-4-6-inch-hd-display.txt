The Xperia GX is up first, with a 720p 4.6-inch display squeezed in alongside a new 13-megapixel camera -- a first for Sony's mobile family, and presumably its new CMOS sensor. A 1.5 GHz dual-core processor ensures it should all tick along nicely, while the hardware design follows the curves of last year's Xperia Arc, this time with a matte finish. The camera upgrade and huge screen makes a good case for this to be Sony's new flagship device -- mere months since the Xperia S debuted in Europe -- and before the Xperia Ion has even had chance to launch in the US.

 It's joined by the Xperia SX, which Sony claims is the world's lightest LTE capable handset, weighing in at just under 100g. It packs a smaller 3.7-inch screen with the same Mobile Bravia engine found on its bigger brother -- and the rest of Sony's recent handsets. It's joined by a 1.5GHz dual-core processor (although there's no specifics on what type just yet), a more standard 8-megapixel camera and it wouldn't be a Japanese phone without infrared connectivity, mobile wallet and a mobile TV -- they're all built-in. Both phones will launch in black and white, and Android fans can rest easy, as they'll both arrive with Android 4.0 installed when they hit stores in Japan this summer.
