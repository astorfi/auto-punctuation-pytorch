One of the sexiest machines Dell has ever made, at a price point that's below the all-important four figure mark. Starting today, the Adamo Admire is sporting an altogether sultry base price of $999, which nets you a 1.4GHz Core 2 Duo processor, Windows 7 Home (64-bit), 2GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB solid state drive. If that's a little weak for your tastes, the upmarket Adamo Desire has also undergone a price reduction, enabling you to get a 2.1GHz Core 2 Duo chip, 4GB of memory, integrated mobile broadband and a 256GB SSD for $1,799 -- a full $500 less than it was in October. You're blowing it off like you just don't care, but you know you'll be back to visit that Source link when no one's looking. And the video after the jump, too.

[Thanks, Ben and Ryan]
