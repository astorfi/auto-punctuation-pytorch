We knew that Sony's Music Unlimited would be available on the PlayStation 4 on day one. What we didn't know, was that the company would be bringing a number of much-requested features to the streaming music app on its next-gen console. For one, you'll finally be able to listen to music while you play games -- a feature that was not only much-requested, but its absence was something of a head-scratcher. There are also new quick controls, which you can bring up by hitting the PS Home button, no matter where you are in the UI. So, even if you're not actually in the Music Unlimited app, you'll still be able to skip and pause tracks with just a couple of quick button presses.
