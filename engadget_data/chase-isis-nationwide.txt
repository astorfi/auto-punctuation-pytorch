We'd hardly call Isis a juggernaut, but the would-be Google Wallet-slayer is certainly building steam. After convincing American Express to back it in a nationwide rollout, Chase has decided to hop on the expansion train as well. The mobile payment launch partner is clearly quite happy with how pilot programs in Austin, Texas and Salt Lake City, Utah went. Soon enough holders of Chase Freedom, Sapphire and Slate cards, along with those special people in possession of a JPMorgan Palladium card will be able to load their accounts into the Isis Mobile Wallet app and tap to pay at retail locations across the nation. Of course, if you're part of the one percent, walking around with your Palladium card, chances are you probably don't wander into to Walgreens to pick up your own Gold Bond Medicated Foot Powder very often anyway.
