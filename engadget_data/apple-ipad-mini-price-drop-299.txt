Apple's iPad Air and retina iPad mini may be getting all the headlines, but its elders also made a bit of news at the company's event today. As is the Apple way, with the introduction of new hardware comes a price drop for the old. How much? The old 16GB WiFi iPad mini now costs $299, down from its previous $329 price, which makes it $100 less than the new and improved mini with a Retina display.
