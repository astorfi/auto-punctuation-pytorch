The boat, conspicuously named Sun21, is the first of its eco-friendly kind to attempt the journey. The 46-foot catamaran made the trip -- from the Canary Islands to the Bahamas -- in just under a month, and according to MW-Line, the operating costs are 20 to 45 times lower than traditional motorboats. The company claims their next project is to take a solar-powered ship around the world, and then get righteously wasted.[Via metaefficient]
