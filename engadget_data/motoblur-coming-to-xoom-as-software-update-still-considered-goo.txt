Being the inaugural Honeycomb device, you'd expect Google to keep the tablet as vanilla as possible (e.g. G1, Nexus One, Nexus S). Indeed, Android's director of engineering Dave Burke tells CNET UK that Xoom is a flagship product for Mountain View, but in the same reported meeting, Motorola's Jonathan Nattrass said Motoblur will be coming to the tablet as a software update. In what form? We don't know, but if we had to guess, it's gonna be much more isolated that previous devices -- special widgets, perhaps, and services for backup or tracking a lost slate. Let's play wait-and-see on this one, at least until the top bar gets a cartoonish blue aesthetic.

Update: Motorola reached out to Phandroid to say that, yes, this is a "Google Experience Device" and as such, you should expect the platform and UI to be Google's. Doesn't exactly explain where Nattrass got his talking points, but for now let's call it a strong rebuttal and move on. Certainly we'll have a clearer picture once we can actually try Xoom / Honeycomb out for ourselves.
