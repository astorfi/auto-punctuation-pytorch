Unfortunately, it seems like things aren't quite fully baked yet: the update doesn't include Sense UI, and it apparently wipes all your data and doesn't allow you to log back into your Google Account. Verizon tells us that the Eris update to a "newer" Android is still in testing and hasn't yet been officially released, so we're taking all this to mean that there's been a slip-up along the line -- especially since this obviously isn't final software. In the meantime, we'd say Droid Eris users should probably back up their sets just to be safe.
