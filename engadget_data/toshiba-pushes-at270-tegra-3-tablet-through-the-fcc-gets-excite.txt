This thin (0.3-inch) Tegra 3 tablet sauntered through CES without so much as a model number, eventually picking up the name AT270 at Mobile World Congress and finally snagging itself a spot in Toshiba's Excite series earlier this month. Its siblings are making their way through the FCC as well, offering 10 and 13-inch variations on the $500 slab. Salivating? Keep your mouth closed, this little number doesn't hit stores until June 10th. Of course, if Federal documents can satiate your appetite, satisfaction is but a source link away.
