 Not to be outdone by the ACC's deal with Raycom and ESPN, CBS has announced that it's teaming up with cable co's to bring viewers HD VOD (video on demand) segments from the NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball Tournament (aka March Madness). Right out of the blocks from round 1, the CBS College Sports Network will assemble highlight reels from 63 tournament games, daily tournament recaps and historical pieces. Comcast and Bresnan are the first to carry this programming, but we're seriously hoping that this catches on with a lot more carriers real quick-like. Price to get these VOD segments: free. Watching your friends' brackets go up in smoke, HD-style: priceless.
