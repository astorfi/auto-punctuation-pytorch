 
It's not all love for the iPhone today -- Apple just announced that Mail, Maps, Stocks, Notes and Weather are all coming to the iPod touch. New touch owners get 'em all for free, but all of you early adopters will have to cough up: the bundle is going to set you back a whopping $20. The new Maps app can't use cell-based location-finding like on the iPhone, but it can still figure out where it is using SkyHook's WiFi hotspot database. The touch also supports webclips and the reconfigurable home screen now, but we're a little unsure why all this has to cost $20 -- why no love, Apple?
