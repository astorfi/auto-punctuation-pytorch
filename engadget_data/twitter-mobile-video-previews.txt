Checking out a linked video from within Twitter's official mobile apps is frequently a clumsy process, but it's about to get a lot smoother. The social network has started rolling out simple in-line video previews on both its Android and iOS apps. If you've received the upgrade, you'll see thumbnails of clips in your timeline; all you have to do is tap them to watch the footage from within the Twitter app. The move is no doubt meant to drive up views of promoted videos, but we won't mind if it helps us catch up on cat videos during our daily commutes.
