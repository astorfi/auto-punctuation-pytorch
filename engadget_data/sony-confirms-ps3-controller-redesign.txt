Apparently the boomerang/banana shape that we've come tohate despise detest accept as the PS3's major drawback is being "tossed" in favor of anunspecified redesign (NOT the one pictured here) that will be unveiled at E3 in May, mentioned Harrison in a speechthat was mainly about the Xbox Live-like PlayStationNetwork Platform. There's a lot of pressure on Sony here to unveil something appealing for several reasons: theyneed to placate the vocal minority of ravenous fanboys who publicly slammed the initial design, but more importantly,they need to prove they can outdesign a bunch of very talented gamingblog readers.[Thanks, Mike]
