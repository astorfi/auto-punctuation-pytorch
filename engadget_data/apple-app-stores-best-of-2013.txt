Today, Apple's the one in a reflective mood, having published its "Best of 2013" selections for the iOS and Mac App Stores as well as iTunes. Free language teaching app Duolingo tops the iPhone chart, with chainsaw-assisted angling title Ridiculous Fishing snapping up the game-specific award. The iPad app of the year accolade goes to Disney Animated, an interactive guide to the iconic studio's animation process, and SFCave-meets-Super Meat Boy platformer Badland stands at the top of the podium in the games category. The iOS edition of Minecraft is the best selling paid app of 2013 despite its age, while puzzler Candy Crush Saga is both the top free and the top grossing app of the year. In the OS X App Store, to-do list manager Wunderlist takes home the prize for best app of the year, with Lego Lord of the Rings being named the greatest game. For all honorable runner-up mentions and the best-of selections for iTunes music, books, TV, films and more, load up the relevant store and look out for the banner.
