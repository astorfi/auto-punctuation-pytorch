 With five days to go until the release of the first Blu-ray movies from Sony, things are proving to remain fluid. The Samsung BD-P1000 will definitely make an appearance June 25 (unless of course you already have one), however the movies you can buy have changed, according to the latest press release. Our earlier source appears to have been correct, several movies have come off the list completely, while others are slightly delayed. The good news is that the launch titles are definitely set, as none of those have changed however the successive releases seem prone to slippage.Legends of the Fall, Kung Fu Hustle, Black Hawk Down, Sense and Sensibility, The Big Hit and Resident Evil: Apocalypse are all still MIA, we will keep you updated as launch approaches. The updated list follows.
