Today Dell will announce their entertainment focused
   XPS M140 laptop and Dimension E310 desktop. The
   M140 features MediaDirect technology for direct access to photos, music, and vids without having
   to boot the OS and like all XPS products includes Windows XP MCE 2005. It sports a 2.13 GHz Pentium M, 14.1-inch
   WXGA widescreen display, 4 x USB 2.0, FireWire, S-Video Out, PCMCIA slot, 5-in-1 card reader, Hi-Def audio support
   and is configurable with 802.11b or b/g, up to 2GB RAM, an 80GB HDD, and DVD±RW all stuffed into a 5.5-pound,
   1.5-inch thick design. Sorry…no TV tuner. The E310 meanwhile is Dell's 3.2 GHz P4 entry level
   Media Center PC with MCE 2005 and optional tuner for watching or recording that sweet, sweet teevee. The XPS M140
   will start at a cool G ($999) and will ship in November. The E310 starts at $599 and should be available later
   today.
