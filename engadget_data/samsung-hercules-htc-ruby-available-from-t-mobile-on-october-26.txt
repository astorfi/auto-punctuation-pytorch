The folks over at Tmo News have obtained a leaked back to school slideshow (pictured above) that pegs the release date for both devices as October 26th, despite earlier murmurs that the Ruby would be hitting shelves in September. There's still a lot of mystery surrounding the phones' specs and peculiarities, though Samsung's Galaxy S II variant is rumored to pack some pretty impressive horsepower -- including, perhaps, a dual-core 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon APQ8060 processor. We'll have to wait and see whether it lives up to its expectations and whether this reported release date proves valid, but we'll let you know as soon as we do.
