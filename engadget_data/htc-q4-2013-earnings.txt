HTC just posted another operating loss of NT$1.56 billion ($52 million), but managed a small net profit of NT$310 million ($10.3 million) selling its remaining shares of Beats. Though the Taiwanese company trimmed last quarter's operating loss of NT$2.97 billion ($101 million), total revenue actually fell a touch to NT$42.9 billion ($1.6 billion). That marks the ninth consecutive quarterly drop in sales, according to Bloomberg, despite the recent addition of the HTC One Max to the lineup. Unfortunately, the company's also been dealing with sales bans and patent setbacks, which are not helping the declining interest in its handsets. The alleged successor to its much loved but not much sold HTC One should be arriving soon, and at this point it looks like a crucial release.
