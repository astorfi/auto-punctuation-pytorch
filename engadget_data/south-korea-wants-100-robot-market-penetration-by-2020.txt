 You've got 14years, South Korea, to make good on your promise: 100% market penetration for robots in the home some time between 2015and 2020. We'll be generous and give you the later date to work with, but don't you and your Ministry of Information andCommunication go spouting off about how you've got goals to put a robot in every home by 2020 unless you're deadserious, you hear us? Because we here at Engadget take our robots seriously -- from Roombas to Ri-Man -- so don't go all getting ourhopes up for some postmodern South Korean android utopia of intelligent networked household service bots unless you'reprepared to deliver, ok?[Thanks, Palm Addict]
