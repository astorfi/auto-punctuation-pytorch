It's taken a while for Aereo's Android app to see the light of day, but it's finally hit Google Play today as promised. Subscribers to the service will now be able to watch live TV streamed to handsets and tablets running Android 4.2 or higher -- provided they live in one of the company's markets, of course. The software is currently in beta, so don't expect a bug-free experience. If your love of television outweighs your fear of software testing, hit the link below to grab the application.
