Of course, the $800 Xoom doesn't actually come with 4G connectivity out of the gate, but Jha told reporters that the Xoom's LTE upgrade will be free, and that wonder of wonders, the tablet will be capable of pulling down 50 megabit per second speeds. Someone might want to check Sanjay's math -- sure, in the midst of a Verizon fog at CES 2011, we were able to manage 33Mbps, but we typically get less than half that speed on a day-to-day basis.
