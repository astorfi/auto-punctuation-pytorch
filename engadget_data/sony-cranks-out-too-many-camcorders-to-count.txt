Most notably, the HDR-SR12 (pictured), HDR-SR11 and HDR-SR10 HDD-based camcorders along with the HDR-UX20 and HDR-UX10 DVD models all record at 1,920 x 1,080, but things get a lot less exciting from here.

Usually, we'd wonder why Sony left us to wonder about most of the specs, but when you're introducing this many products, we support you've little choice but to leave some things to the imagination. Nevertheless, also rolled out today was the 120GB SR12, 60GB SR11 and 40GB SR10 models, the UX10 / UX20 hybrid (media card / DVD+R) camcorders and the HDR-HC9, which is based on the HDV format, features Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T optics and a 3.2-megapixel ClearVid CMOS sensor. Continuing on, we've got the DCR-DVD910, DCR-DVD810 and DCR-DVD710 DVD models, and if those aren't your style (and you haven't bolted in a fit of frustration), you may find something to love about the DVD610, DVD710 or the DVD790. The last hooray comes from a pair of MiniDV Handycam models -- the DCR-HC62 and the DCR-HC52 -- which are slated to land next month for $300 and $250, respectively.
