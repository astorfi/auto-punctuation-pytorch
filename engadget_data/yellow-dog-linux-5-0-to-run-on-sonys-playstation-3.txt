Now it appears that we just might have a winner. Terra Soft's website proudly displays that the forthcoming version of Yellow Dog Linux "supports the PlayStation 3 console," and leaves hints that we might see a few sweet video demonstrations in the near future. While intricate details about the the OS's compatibility with the sure-to-be-scarce console are still few and far between, we're expecting it to drop "in mid-November" to presumably coincide with the November PS3 launch dates -- but at least pulling strings to get your name on a less-than-assuring pre-order list probably won't be necessary here.[Thanks, Clint]
