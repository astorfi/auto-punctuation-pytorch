Word is that the console is supposed to land next month over there for €300 Euro -- €100 Euro less than it currently retails, a real sight for sore, price-gouged eyes -- and gamescom seems to be the safest bet for a debut. Other details are scarce, and some facts are downright confusing: the console is currently being listed by this retailer's wholesalers as a "limited edition," which naturally seems silly given the traditional PlayStation life cycle. Still, we like where this all is headed.
