Microsoft, which hired former Wal-Mart exec David Porter to be its corporate vice president of retail stores back in February, has just confirmed that stores are, indeed, on the way -- and soon. COO Kevin Turner confirmed the plans at the Worldwide Partner Conference in New Orleans yesterday, saying the stores are due to open this fall (maybe to coincide with the launch of Windows 7?) -- and what's more, Redmond's bringing the fight directly to Apple's doorstep. "Stay tuned, because we're going to have some retail stores opened up that are opened up right next door to Apple stores." Things are about to get saucy, people.
