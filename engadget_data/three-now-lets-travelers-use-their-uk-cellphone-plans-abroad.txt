Three UK must hate international roaming charges as much as we do -- it just launched a Feel At Home initiative that ditches those fees in seven countries. Subscribers who visit Australia, Austria, Denmark, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy and Sweden can now use data, messaging and voice as if they were back in Britain. The perk doesn't require a specific plan, and customers can roam on any compatible network in a Free At Home country. There are a few catches, of course: calls to non-UK numbers still incur roaming fees, and tethering is strictly verboten. Still, Brits who just have to post vacation photos on Instagram should be happy.
