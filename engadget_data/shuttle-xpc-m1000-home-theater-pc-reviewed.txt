While most gadgetheads are only satisfied by building their own tricked-out Media Center PCs, the average soccer mom
and dad could certainly derive some benefit by routing all their A/V-gear through a
Windows Media Center
Edition-equipped PC. Unfotunately, most dedicated home theater PCs are either super-expensive, super-large, or
super-confusing (and most times a combination of the three), which has limited their appeal to a niche market so far.
Well Shuttle is trying change this perception, and AnandTech believes they have a good shot at reaching a larger
audience with their XPC M1000, although some notable
exceptions apply. This media-centric PC is designed to blend in with other components, and as such it sports a glossy
low-profile cabinet, and a Pentium M 1.73 GHz processor meant for low heat dispersion. The M1000 has got all of your
multimedia needs covered, with component video, DVI, S-video, composite, optical and coax out, optical in, 7.1 RCA
connectors, FireWire, USB 2.0, 8-in-1 card reader, 802.11b/g, IR out, DVD-burner, wireless keyboard and remote, 250GB
hard drive, and front expansion bay for an extra drive. The downsides here are a paltry 512MB of RAM and poor handling
of HD content, due to the inability to capture cable and satellite streams, but Anandtech places most of the blame for
the latter on the entertainment industry (which is kind of a Catch-22, seeing as that without Hollywood, we'd have none
of the content to create a demand for these products in the first place).
