       It's always welcome news to us when we see an audio stalwart make the transition from audio-only to home theater; even better when they embrace the internet along the way. Word comes to us via press release that MartinLogan is now making the heart of its speaker lineup, the Design series, available on Amazon. That means that if you don't have a local dealer (including Magnolia) in your area or you just can't be bothered to leave your AV den, MartinLogan speakers are now just a mouse click away -- with Super Saver/Prime shipping, no less. We've got to admit, the logos look pretty good together in a doodle kind of way. Included in Amazon's sampling are: Purity and Source uprights; Matinee and Vignette center channels; Ticket, Presage, Voyage and Helos 100 in-walls; and Abyss and Dynamo subs. Certainly enough to fill out your speaker needs; just be sure you remember to report the (cough) sales tax (cough)! Full press release after the break.
