It looks like the company might be taking a tack similar to Google's with the Nexus One, because a second variant of product code M01M just garnered FCC approval -- this time featuring WCDMA Band IV in place of Bands II and V, which means it'll work on T-Mobile's airwaves instead of AT&T's. In lieu of a carrier deal, could Dell be looking to blow this out on as many carriers as it possibly can? We hope so -- as long as our wallets can stomach the unsubsidized hit.
