Then you've probably not met a die hard OpenOffice user, who now finally have a mouse to call their own in the form of the OpenOfficeMouse. Developed by WarMouse in partnership with the OpenOffice.org community, this corded point-and-clicker packs no less than 18 programmable buttons (each with double-click functionality), along with support for up to 63 separate profiles, a clickable scroll wheel, an adjustable resolution from 400 to 1,600 CPI, and, get this, a built-in analog joystick that can itself be used to store up to sixteen different keys or macros. Still no firm word on availability, it seems, but you can expect to pay $74.99 for this one.
