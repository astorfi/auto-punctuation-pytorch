The new entries in the Inspiron line include the 1520, 1521, 1720, and 1721, each of which pack either 15.4-inch or 17-inch displays, and boast either Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Turion 64 X2 processors. The Vostro models on the other hand, appear to be Intel-only (at least from what's been revealed so far), with the Vostro 1500 coming equipped with a 15.4-inch display and the Vostro 1700 upping things to a 17-inch screen. Unfortunately, those are about all the specs that are known at the moment, although it doesn't look like we'll have to wait long to find out more, as all but one of the laptops are reportedly set to be released on June 26th, with the Vostro 1700 following later in July.Update: The laptop above is a new Inspiron, not a Vostro. Those, apparently, are all black.
