While the rest of the device is slightly reminiscent of a baby toy, the screen itself is killer and the image couldn't be more clear or crisp. Unfortunately, the engineering sample we got to mess around with was not loaded up with any video so we couldn't see that in action, but if the smoothness of the interface is any indication, playback shouldn't be a problem -- save for the fairly tiny screen. We've got video of the interesting player in action after the break.
