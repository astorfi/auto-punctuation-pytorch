 We doubt this will significantly dampen rumors of a Samsung Galaxy S IV announcement in March of next year, but any optimists who were expecting an official confirmation six months in advance won't be getting one. Our grasp of Korean isn't the best, but here's a tweet from the company's official Korean account indicating rumors of a Galaxy S successor simply aren't true. Of course, with the kinds of sales the line has seen to date it seems like a reasonable assumption that Samsung will keep cranking them out as long as the courts will let it for the foreseeable future, so it's certainly more a question of when, than if. Throw in the fact that the original Galaxy S was announced in March, the Galaxy S II in February, and the Galaxy S III in May -- and the when narrows down appreciably.



  [알려드립니다] 일부 언론에서 보도한 '갤럭시 SⅢ 후속모델 출시 예정' 이라는 추측은 단순루머일 뿐 사실이 아닙니다. 정해진 게 아무것도 없는데 왜 이런 소문이 퍼질까요 ㅜㅜ
