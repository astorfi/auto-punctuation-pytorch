As the story goes, the aforesaid automaker has demonstrated the first "official" iPad-vehicle integration setup at this year's Paris Auto Show, and to be frank, it's heinous. The idea here is to provide world-class rear-seat entertainment, while apparently destroying aesthetics in one fell swoop. It's just about too hideous to be true, but the iconic "BMW" logo on the mounting brackets all but confirms the authenticity. Perhaps you folks should consult with any number of the skilled DIYers out there before shooting for the stars with version 2.0?
