In a world where history changes 140 characters at a time, what's the above message if not the recipe for a bona fide television hit? According to The Hollywood Reporter, Hunger Games producer Allison Shearmur is teaming up with Lionsgate Television to get all The Social Network with the best-seller Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship and Betrayal. The details are pretty scant beyond that for now, though the term "power grab" is used at least once in the writeup, which always makes for compelling TV. Lionsgate's recent production credits include the Netflix series Orange is the New Black. Perhaps we'll be seeing the world's first big-budget Vine-based TV show, six-second power grabs at a time?
