"Our Chi is thinner than Air."


That was how ASUS Chairman Jonney Shih opened his CES keynote today. If you're not following, what he meant was the super-slim ASUS Transformer Book T300 Chi that was teased at Computex. Well, the time has come. This 12.5-inch, all-aluminum convertible laptop is now confirmed to carry Intel's latest Broadwell Core M processor (the new 5Y71 or the already-available 5Y10) to enable its fanless design. And don't worry, it'll still have that sweet WQHD (2,560 x 1,440) IPS screen option on top of the 1080p base configuration, plus a 128GB iSSD to keep it running smoothly. 





However, there's been a subtle change: The device has managed to gain a little bulk over the last six months, going from 14.3mm (0.56 inch) docked or 7.3mm (0.29 inch) detached to 16.5mm (0.65 inch) and 7.6mm (0.3 inch), respectively. But hey, the docked unit is still slimmer than the MacBook Air by a mere 0.5mm, and given its ability to switch between form factors, we'd still be impressed even if they had the same thickness; and we can just as easily forgive the former's 70 grams of extra weight.


Announced alongside the T300 Chi are two smaller models: the T100 Chi (10.1-inch, 1,920 x 1,200 IPS) and the T90 Chi (8.9-inch, 1,280 x 800 IPS). Both are powered by Intel's less powerful Atom Z3775 processor and pack either 32GB or 64GB of eMMC storage. When docked, the T90 is just as thick as its T300 sibling, but the T100 is even thinner by 3.3mm. As for weight, both are obviously much lighter -- 1.06kg for the T100 and 0.75kg for the T90.

Starting from February, these laptops will be rolling with the following price points: $699 for the 1080p T300, $799 for the WQHD T300, $399 for the T100 and $299 for the T90. Not bad, not bad.

P.S.: "Chi" means "air" in Mandarin Chinese.
