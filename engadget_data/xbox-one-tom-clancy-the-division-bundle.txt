Maybe you've been holding out on getting an Xbox One all this time because your subconscious has been waiting for this bundle. Whatever your reason is, this package is worth checking out if you've been looking to get both a 1TB version of the console and Tom Clancy's The Division when it finally drops. You can pre-order right now from the Microsoft Store, Amazon, Best Buy or GameStop if you're in the US or Canada for US$400.



A lot of retailers plan to release the pack on the same day the survival shooter game arrives (March 8th), but some might ship it out as early as March 1st. Best Buy's product page, for instance, lists 03/01/2016 as the release date. Ditto for some other locations around the world where the bundle will also be sold. If you're in the US, though, you'll get a really nice bonus for pre-ordering: the bundle will give you early access to the long-awaited title's closed beta, which is slated to launch on January 28th.
