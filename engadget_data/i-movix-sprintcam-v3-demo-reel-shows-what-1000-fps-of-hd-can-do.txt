While the don't-ask priced camera is way out of the range of the prosumer market it's aimed at sports and documentary makers, with what it claims is the only fully integrated slow motion system capable of 1,000 fps in full HD for broadcast. Whatever, we're just impressed by this HD trailer I-Movix put together (embedded after the break,) we never knew watching Jell-O or a Koosh ball bounce could be so intense.[Thanks, Jacob]
