The most exciting of the new features is AirPlay, which is Apple's redub for AirTunes, with the important addition of being able to stream music and video to your i-device over WiFi (with an iPad even acting as host for the new Apple TV). Also over WiFi is a new wireless printing feature, complete with a little Print Center applet that sits in the dock and lets you manage your print jobs. It might not be sexy, but it's certainly a welcome addition to iOS. Apple will be launching iOS 4.2 for iPad, iPhone and iPod touch devices in November.
