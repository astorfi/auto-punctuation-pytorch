When the latest Need for Speed drifted onto consoles, racers noticed that a few features were missing. No manual transmission option? No racing wheel support? Admittedly, the game isn't a sim racer like Gran Turismo or Forza Motorsport, but both of these omissions still felt a little odd. It's taken a while, but soon Electronic Arts will be righting a few of those wrongs. First of all, the game is coming to PC on March 17th. More notably, it'll have manual transmission and support for "a selection" of wheels by Logitech, Thrustmaster and Fanatec. Oh, and it'll also run with "an unlocked framerate" and up to 4K resolution. Sounds promising.



PlayStation 4 and Xbox One owners will get manual gear-shifting too, although it's not clear exactly when this update will arrive. If nothing else, it's a sign that EA is listening to player feedback and trying to support the community -- which is pivotal, given the game is an online-centric experience that thrives when everyone is happily racing together.
