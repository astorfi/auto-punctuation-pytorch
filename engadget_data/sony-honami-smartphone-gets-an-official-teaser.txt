The buzz surrounding Sony's Honami smartphone is reaching a fever pitch, and Sony itself is finally joining in with a new teaser image for the device. The official shot only confirms the presence of a G-branded camera lens and an LED flash. However, it coincides with a new batch of unofficial photos on Digi-Wo that show the Honami in white at a Sony event. While there's nothing new in the pictures beyond the color, it's clear that the Android flagship is nearing its debut. The company isn't mentioning any launch details itself. However, we won't be surprised if the new Xperia appears at IFA next week.
