Compatible with both Guitar Hero 2 and Rock Band: World Tour for Wii, and your PC or Mac, the You Rock has a full multi-touch fretboard which simulates a "real" guitar with six strings instead of five buttons. You can hook this bad boy up with a standard .25-inch connection, or plug in your iPod or MP3 player through the mini-stereo jack to rock out to your own private collection of Metallica. The folks over at ezGear promise a SDK for even further expandability by Spring, and expect the $150 device to be available in either Q2 or Q3.
