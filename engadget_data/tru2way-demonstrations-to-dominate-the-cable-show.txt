Not only will Motorola's forthcoming MTR700 tuning resolver be on display and strutting its stuff, but the much anticipated tru2way technology will be impossible to miss. Companies such as Samsung, Sigma Designs, and Zodiac Interactive will be in New Orleans showing off tru2way tech, while advanced video demonstrations are promised to come from Digeo, Motorola, Pixel3, and Symmetricom. More specifically, Sigma Designs will be demoing an "integrated tru2way-based set-top-box that features four narrow band tuners which can display three video channels -- HD as well as SD," while Zodiac Interactive trumpets its Zidget framework, which "utilizes its plug-in architecture to support applications such as local search, weather, traffic, sports scores, and local news without disrupting the TV viewing experience." Needless to say, May can't come soon enough.
