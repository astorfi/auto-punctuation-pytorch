Said rumblings have originated from a curious post over at GeekZone, which sees a prospective reseller of Popcorn Hour products admit that "three new models" will be released "in the very near future," including one with WiFi. We are told that the three models will be priced around $250, $250 and $320, though not a bit of it has been confirmed. Hit the read link for a list of proposed specifications for each of the possibly forthcoming boxes, and in case you haven't figured it out, we'd keep those hopes low for now.[Thanks, Simon]
