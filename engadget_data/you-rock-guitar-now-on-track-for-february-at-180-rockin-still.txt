Well, it seems that another year and another CES can make quite the difference, as the company (now known as Inspired Instruments) is now promising that the not-a-toy guitar will launch in February of this year, and that it will sport a slightly higher price tag of $179.95. From the looks of things, however, that's about all that's changed with the guitar, which still packs the same USB connectivity, MIDI functionality, and iPod or MP3 player connectedness as before. The company is even going so far as to reuse its tried and true promotional video -- see it after the break.
