Well apparently eBayer "joedick" is one such individual, whose $480 Buy-It-Now-dollars earned him one of the only 200 "Hot Summer Yoshi" edition DS Phats ever made, which were part of a larger series of six versions available only to Club Nintendo members in 2005. Congratulations, good sir -- just remember not to play with it or anything, or you won't be able to sell it for ten times what you paid a few years down the road.[Via DS Fanboy]
