Sure you can slap in an ATI R600 or you could find that bump in ASUS' just announced EN8800GTX AquaTank/HTDP/768M graphics combo and stay true to your rabid brand affections. As the name implies, the card features an all-in-one watercooling module which cuts the heat from a standard 8800 GTX by 12°C (53.6°F) for some serious overclockin' drama. That results in 11% faster graphics performance when compared with the traditional 8800 GTX card. Assuming you have the additional PCI slot required for the AquaTank card of course -- no external tank required, kids. Sorry, no pricing or availability announced, but we'd sure like to see it set up for another head-to-head with ATI whenever it does pop. [Via Impress]
