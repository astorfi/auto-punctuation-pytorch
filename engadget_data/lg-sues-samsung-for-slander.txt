Kim (right) throwing down street style, we still stood up and tooknote of LG's suit against Sammy over false and defamatory claims that their DVR TV required a cooling fan for its harddrive (when it apparently did not) and that it had a measly 20,000 lifespan when LG claims it would operate for at"at least 50,000 hours." Yeah, it's at best pretty unprofessional to even publicly discuss your competitionlike that -- especially when buyers are making choices for the World Cup -- but we'll let the judge sort it out whilewe lean back in our courtroom box seat just in case these two Korean heavyweight champions decide to settle this in thesquared circle.[Via The Reg]
