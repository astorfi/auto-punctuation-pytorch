 It all looks legit and final. AT&T and Starbucks have finally rolled out their free WiFi plan to Starbucks Card users registered with AT&T. In exchange for letting AT&T send you up to 4 emails per year, you get a single WiFi session of up to 2-hours per day at any of Starbucks' 7,000 or so US-based stores. Now get out of here, and don't forget your MacBook for some conspicuous posing and caffeine consumption.[Via Gear Diary]
