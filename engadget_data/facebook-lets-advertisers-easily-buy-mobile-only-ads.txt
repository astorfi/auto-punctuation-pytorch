Prospective advertisers now only need to use the social network's ready-made ad interface and Power Editor to back a sponsored news feed story on mobile devices, instead of getting the explicit say-so from Facebook. It's not open season on Facebook's mobile apps: we won't see dating ads rear their pretty heads in Facebook Camera anytime soon. All the same, it does mean the social stream on your HTC Status will be a bit less than pristine from now on.
