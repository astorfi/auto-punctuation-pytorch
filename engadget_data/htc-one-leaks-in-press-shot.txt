 Well, we're only a few days away from finding out what HTC has in store for us at their pre-MWC event, but expectations are it's the M7. Or, as the rumor mill is now calling it, the HTC One. While Peter Chou has already flashed the device at an event, evleaks claims to have the first clear press shot of the device. As you can see we're looking at a strange capacitive button layout that puts home on the right and a big logo smack in the center. Though it's hard to be certain, it also looks as if the edges of the device are metallic or chrome. The icons tally with some Sense 5 screenshots that leaked recently, while a separate User Agent Profile leak suggests we're looking at a Butterfly-style 1080p display (see More Coverage). Of course, we can't confirm that the handset will bear the One branding or that it is indeed legit, but considering evleaks' track record we're willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.
