AppleInsider is re-reporting by way of supposed insiders that Stevie's engineers are hard at work on a new MacBook with the fresh set of specs we've heard many a time to date: no integrated optical drive, solid state disk (resulting in increased battery life and system performance), sleek, slender body, widescreen display, and now a mid-year launch, presumably aligned with WWDC. We've heard this song and dance before (and we'll surely hear it again), so keep your wallet-carrying trousers on.
