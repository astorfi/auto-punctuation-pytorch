 Ah, the unsourced Digitimes rumor -- not quite as accurate as simply making things up, but almost always more interesting. This time the erstwhile trade rag says Lenovo's working on a new line of IdeaPads to compete with the flood of netbooks that's consumed the market. The IdeaPad G-series, as it's supposedly called, is said to feature a 14.1-inch display and run on the Centrino 2 platform -- which doesn't sound like much a netbook to us, but who are we to argue with a sketchy trade rumor? We asked a Lenovo rep about them, and while he didn't dive into any specs with us, he had heard of the G-series, but said they're probably / most likely not coming to the States, since they want to keep that premium vibe over here while they build the brand. We'll see how things shake out in the second half of the year, when these are supposed to hit, but it sounds like it'll probably be an Asia-only launch.[Via I4U News]
