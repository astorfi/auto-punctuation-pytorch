 Just weeks ago, Samsung slipped the entry-level Galaxy Discover into Canadian shops, with no word on whether or not it would ever cross the border. It has -- or rather, it will. The company has listed the Galaxy Discover as coming to the US through contract-free carriers Net10 and Straight Talk. Hardware-wise, the US version is the familiar starter smartphone with a 3.5-inch HVGA screen, an 800MHz processor and a 3-megapixel camera. The American model touts a slightly curvier frame, however. Its real stand-out remains the removal of TouchWiz in favor of pure Android 4.0; while not unique, it's still a rare break for a company that likes its custom UI layers. We don't have ship dates or prices when the phone hasn't yet been announced or listed for either network, but we'd venture that it will be one of the cheaper prepaid options when it arrives stateside.
