 
China may have its ups and downs, but there's no denying that it's a geeky wonderland for Engadget advocates. Oh, and we're not just talking about KIRFs either -- this country of 1.3 billion people has a lot more tech love to offer. In this first episode of a two-part series, we'll be showing you around the two hottest gadget districts of Hong Kong -- Mong Kok and Sham Shui Po. By the end of this you'll probably be sick of cramped street markets and computer shopping malls, but hey, just be thankful that you weren't the one who went through all that trouble and jet lag.
