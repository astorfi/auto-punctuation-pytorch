Patty Stonesifer, CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and former Microsoft VP, said that she would vacate her position on January 1st, 2009 but will remain with the organization. Perhaps the move has something to do with her giving away $16 billion of Bill's hard-earned stash? The obvious successor of course, is Mr. Gates who chairs the foundation and vacates his position at Microsoft this summer. However, the foundation's new CEO has not been officially named. That leaves direct control over its $38.7 billion endowment up for grabs. Don't let the fact that Chinese women want him and Americans want to be him deter you from applying.
