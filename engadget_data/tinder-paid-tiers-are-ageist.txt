If you didn't think that your opinion of Tinder could go any lower, something new pops up to make you change your mind. The hookup app has reportedly launched its long-awaited paid tier, but in Europe, users will have to overcome something worse than left-swipes: ageism. Tinder Plus users who are under 28 years old will be able to subscribe to the service for just £3.99 ($6.39) a month, but users over that age will be asked to spend £14.99 ($23.03) -- nearly four times as much for the same thing.



Tinder has been building hype for its paid tier since the end of last year, pushing users over to a freemium version of the existing app with limited functionality. Tinder Plus, meanwhile, enables users to undo left-swipes and alter their location when they're on the go. It's not yet clear if this pricing is an experiment, or if the US price of $9.99 will be similarly changed, but it looks as if you just got one more reason to lie about your age on Facebook.

Update: Tinder Plus' US pricing is now in, courtesy of Bloomberg Business. The service will cost you $9.99 if you're under 30, but twice as much if you're over that figure. At least we know now which country puts a better value on 29-year-olds.
