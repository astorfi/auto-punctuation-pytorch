The key bit with this one, it seems, is a so-called "getter" layer that's used in addition to the usual electrodes and emission layer, which helps to seal the area around the cathode electrode and compensate for minute defects. According to the company, that effectively triples the life of the OLED panel, which is especially useful considering that the same technology is also increasingly being used for lighting systems in addition to displays.
