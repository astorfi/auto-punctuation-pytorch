Google will distribute the laptop through its Chrome OS Pilot Program, in a sort of public beta. You actually have to apply to join the program, and there are going to be a limited number of the laptops available -- retail Chrome OS models from Acer and Samsung will be available in the middle of 2011 for the masses. Google's doing a number of little promotions to give away the devices to interested users and businesses which will provide feedback, and it looks like there's no way to actually pay money for one right now. Now, for the specs:

12.1-inch screen.
Full size keyboard.
Oversized clickpad.
Qualcomm Gobi 3G chip for Verizon data in the US, your carrier of choice internationally.
802.11n dual-band WiFi.
8+ hours of active use.
8+ days of standby.
Webcam.
Flash storage.
Intel Pine Trail processor.
100MB of free Verizon data.

The keyboard is the one we uncovered last week, with no function keys, but a full row of Apple Keyboard-style actions. The caps lock key has been replaced with a search button, which will enrage internet trolls and screenwriters alike. Branding-wise... there is none. The "Cr-48" refers to an isotope of the material chromium, there's no logo and no design frills on the laptop itself, and it only comes in black. It seems Google is going out of its way to make it clear that this isn't a mass market device, with Chrome OS still in the beta stage, and no apparent intentions to compete with third parties in the hardware space. Still, we gotta say: we wish more manufacturers would take a page out of this no-frills book. The murdered out Cr-48 looks like pure sex to us

Update: We've got a full preview and impressions of Google's Cr-48!
