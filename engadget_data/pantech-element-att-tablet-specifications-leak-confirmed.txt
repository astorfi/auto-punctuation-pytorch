The waterproof 8-inch slate (16.6 ounces) will start slipping out to retail shops starting today, with a two-year contract price of $299.99 and an off-contract charge of $449.99. Those tallies will net you a 4G LTE / HSPA+ enabled device, powered by Android 3.2 and a 1.5GHz processor. There's also 16GB of inbuilt storage, a microSD expansion slot, haptic feedback, a handful of preloaded applications (AT&T Messages, Enzo Pinball, Sketchpad and Photo Frame) and compatibility with a couple of data plans; there's the $35 / month (3GB) option for those on a contract, or the $14.99 / month (250MB) and $25 / month (2GB) alternatives for those operating sans strings attached. For those waltzing into an AT&T shop to snag one, don't be shocked if you're pressured to pick up an $85 Body Glove case or a $20 screen protector -- because, you know, the waterproof shell just isn't quite good enough on its own.
