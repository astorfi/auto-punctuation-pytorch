       There's been an awful lot of HD expansion mentioned lately, but Time Warner Cable (partly owned by Time Warner, parent company of AOL, which owns Engadget) has been sorely absent from the fun. Thanks to a tipster up in Maine, we've now learned that TWC has apparently added six new HD channels in Augusta without so much as a whisper. Customers in the area can now look forward to receiving CNN HD, HGTV HD, National Geographic HD, Food Network HD, Lifetime Movie Network HD and History Channel HD, but we've no idea if these options will make their way into any other surrounding regions.[Thanks, Jim Johnson]
