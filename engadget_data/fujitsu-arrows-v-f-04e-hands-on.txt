Launched as part of the NTT DoCoMo's winter lineup, this is the first opportunity we've had to get a hands-on as of course this set will never end up anywhere near our shores. The F-04E is loaded with everything one could expect in a high-end set like a 4.7-inch 720p display -- and it is wondrous to behold -- a 13.1-megapixel camera, 1.5GHz quad-core CPU, integrated 1seg TV antenna and a whopping 64GB of storage.

 The Arrows V, aside from the odd obsession Fujitsu seems to have on insisting to hide all its USB ports under tough to open flip up open doors, is a very slick handset. The lines are clean, the display -- did we mention it is lovely? -- clear and easy read from every angle. Sadly for us the booth's requisite bowl of water or fountain was missing in action so we couldn't do a dunk test but we did manage to capture a bit of video and a gallery for you to enjoy.
