Germany's Daum Electronics, a company that makes an exercise bike with a difference -- the Ergo Bike Premium 8i -- has certainly realized this. Its Ergo Bike is kitted up with a screen, camera, speakers and microphones, and the array of usual sensors: its most important asset, however, is an internet connection. This enables riders from different countries and continents to race (and sweat) with each other, or team up together to beat a simulated race. It's kind of an expensive hobby though, riding in at $3,500 a unit. Another firm called Expresso Fitness has a bike with an entirely unique 3D environment (pictured), and an entirely higher price tag no doubt.
