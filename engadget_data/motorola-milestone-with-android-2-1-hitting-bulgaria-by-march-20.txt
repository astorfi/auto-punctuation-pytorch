 We'd had some indication that Europe would be seeing Motorola Milestones running Android 2.1 roughly around this time, and it looks like we are now finally starting to get a few more specifics. According to Mobile Bulgaria, that country's leading carrier, Vivacom, will begin selling Milestones equipped with Android 2.1 "by March 20th," which should no doubt be just part of a broader European rollout in the coming days / weeks (that will hopefully extend to Canada as well). Unfortunately, things still aren't any clearer for Droid users in the US, but you can be sure we'll be watching every development on that front.
