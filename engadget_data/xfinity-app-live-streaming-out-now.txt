If you're a Comcast subscriber who wants to stream live TV from somewhere other than your couch, we have good news for you: The Xfinity TV Go app is available to download right now from both Google Play and iTunes. As long as you have a steady WiFi connection, and an Android device running Froyo or higher or an iOS gizmo with iOS 6 or better, you should be good to go. While this is cool and all, we were kind of hoping this update to the Xfinity TV Player app would've brought Chromecast support along with it.

Participating networks at launch include BBC World News, beIN SPORT, beIN SPORT en Espa√±ol, Big Ten Network, CNBC, CNN, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, ESPN Deportes, ESPNEWS, ESPNU, FOX Business Channel, FOX News Channel, FOX Sports 1, FX, FXX, Golf Channel, HLN, MSNBC, National Geographic Channel, Nat Geo WILD, NBC Sports Network and all seven Pac-12 Networks, with more to come.
