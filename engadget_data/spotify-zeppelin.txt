Now THIS is the news we were waiting for from Spotify. A little Coda to today's Spotify event in New York City -- one of the great rock bands of all time is coming to the streaming service. As CEO Daniel Ek put it, "I can't wait to get the Led out." Free is all well and good, but what's a streaming service without a little Houses of the Holy? Dazed and confused about where to begin? The company's created a handy little playlist. Though, for the record, old Led Zeppelin I isn't a bad place to start.
