Phones 4U scored a few sweet deals with HTC, announcing that it'll be the exclusive launch partner for the Sensation XE as it becomes available on October 1st (although O2 confirmed today that it'll come its way "soon"). This is the first we've heard of an official release date for the Beats-integrated device, and we're still unsure of pricing or availability for any other nook of the world. The retailer's also geared up and ready to sell both the HTC Radar and original Sensation in white, also as UK exclusives; it appears as though it's getting quite cozy with the Taiwanese company, so we wouldn't be surprised to see more of these kinds of deals going forward.
