At a briefing earlier today, Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata explained that the company was now developing a device to monitor sleep and levels of fatigue. However, it didn't sound like it would be a wearable device -- even though it's the done thing. According to a Reuters report, the device would track you from your bedside and is currently being co-developed with Resmed. The US-based company typically makes products for people with sleep disorders. It will form part of its new healthcare division inside the gamesmaker, marking a return to wellness hardware: something it has already touched on, way back, with the Wii Fit board. For an idea of what it all could do, we've added a video from Resmed's sleeping tech. Exactly how this will dovetail with our Tomodachi Life village remains to be seen.
