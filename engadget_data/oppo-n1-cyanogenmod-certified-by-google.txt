Oppo's announcement of a CyanogenMod custom Android version of the N1 was great news for performance phone fans, but who wants to sideload apps? Luckily, the new handset and CyanogenMod 10.2 combo has just cleared Google's compatibility test suite (CTS) gauntlet, meaning it'll officially get Google's Play Store to install apps. That's the first time CyanogenMod has been certified by Mountain View on any device, a milestone which entailed "a lot of sleepless nights," according to the group. With that hurdle cleared, Oppo has announced that the CM-equipped handset will be available on December 24th, though there's no word if it'll cost $599 like the standard model. Either way, fans of a more-or-less stock Android experience now have another choice besides Nexus and Google Play Edition handsets.
