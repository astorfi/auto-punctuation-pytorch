The Engadget Interview: Fusion Garage's Chandra Rathakrishnan... post-fallout

Court rules Fusion Garage and TechCrunch were business partners, tosses most everything else

If ever there was a time to exit the technology universe while everyone else is paying attention to... well, everything else, it's now. Chandresekar Rathakrishnan has seemingly signed off on liquidation paperwork this week, effectively putting an end to Fusion Garage as we know it. It's hardly a shock to anyone paying attention; the JooJoo was a letdown, the Grid10 was even more so, and the Grid4 never even had a chance to breath. We spent plenty of time talking to its founder over the years, but the execution and timing was never good enough to gain significant traction in the market. We'd bother asking you to pour one out, but we're guessing the majority of you have done so already.
