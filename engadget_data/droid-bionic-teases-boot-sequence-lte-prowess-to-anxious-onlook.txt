This time it stars in a video clip that reveals the phone's boot sequence, which is followed by an all-important thrill ride / speed test on Verizon's LTE network. As if you needed further proof, this Moto reveals itself to pack dual cores, and as you might expect, it sports Motorola's animation-laden skin. What about the LTE test, you ask? It pulls in respectable numbers -- approximately 4.5Mbps down and 1.9Mbps up -- but as you're likely aware, these speeds pale in comparison to what we've seen on the Droid Charge and Revolution. It's entirely possible the test is simply an outlier, so we'll hope for better scores as the phone approaches its September arrival. Curious for the sneak peak? You'll find the full video after the break.
