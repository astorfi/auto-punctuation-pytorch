The US is specifically named as one of the first new markets for the venture that is expected to go live in the middle of next year. In addition to knowing you'll have to shell out to get your fix of Top Gear, Doctor Who and, erm, The Foods that Make Billions, you'll also want to be aware that the first platform for the iPlayer outside the UK will be none other than Apple's iPad. What is it with Brits and the iPad?
