 
And you thought that just because you are the home theater in a box type that you wouldn't get to enjoy 3D -- Sony announced a trio of Blu-ray home theater systems that feature wireless speakers and the same internet streaming features BRAVIA Internet Video, DNLA and the iPhone app remote that the stand-alone Blu-ray from Sony do. And the top of the line BDV-HZ970W (pictured above) also supports 3D Blu-ray Discs. The other two new systems, the BDV-E770W and BDV-E570, have most of the same features, but both lack 3D and the BDV-E570 doesn't do DLNA. Check out the full release after the break if you are still left asking for more.
