We saw a lot at Microsoft's Xbox 360 preview event in
New York last week and we asked more questions than were probably actually welcome (you can usually tell when the
otherwise totally ingratiating Microsoft peeps start wincing and tapping their toes at you). But the one thing we
didn't think to ask about was the power adapter. It was missing from sight (how convenient!) and we're sure hoping to
god the one that comes with the system isn't the freaking insane brick you see here, which is rumored to be the AC
adapterâ€”at least the adapter for the dev kit boxes, anyway. Believe us, by our approximations the thing pictured here
is roughly the size of a small nation-state.
