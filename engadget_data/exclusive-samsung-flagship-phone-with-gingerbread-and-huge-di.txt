We've just been tipped with a few morsels on what should become Samsung's flagship Android device early next year -- February, to be specific, suggesting we could see an unveiling at MWC -- and it's looking promising. Different parts of the slide deck describe it as having either a 4.3- or 4.5-inch "sAMOLED2" display, presumably standing for "Super AMOLED 2" and implying that Sammy's made some advancements over the screens we've been seeing on the Galaxy S series this year. It'll naturally have Android Gingerbread and be equipped with an 8 megapixel camera capable of 1080p video capture, 14.4Mbps HSPA, Bluetooth 3.0, a 1.2GHz core of some sort, and 16GB of storage onboard. The deck describes it as having an "ultra sleek design," and judging from the side shot, we'd tend to agree. So who's holding out for this?

Update:  We're confident that the above slide comes from Samsung, but one of the pictures therein is most definitely not of a new Samsung phone -- but rather a VoIP handset by Apiotek from several years ago. Considering the image in question pops up right away in a Google Image search for "ultra slim phone," we're inclined to think Samsung got a little hasty putting together the PowerPoint this time round.
