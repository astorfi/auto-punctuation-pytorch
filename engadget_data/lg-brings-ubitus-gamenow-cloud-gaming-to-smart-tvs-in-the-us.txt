LG is more serious about TV gaming than many of its rivals, and it's proving that today by rolling out Ubitus' GameNow service to Smart TVs in the US. The cloud gaming portal streams a mix of mostly console-grade titles, such as Devil May Cry 4 and Dead Rising 2; it also includes free trials and support for a handful of gamepads. A free beta is available now, and the two companies are shooting for a full-fledged launch sometime in the "near future." While it's unlikely that GameNow will replace a PS4 or Xbox One for truly demanding players, we'll take the wider game library any day.
