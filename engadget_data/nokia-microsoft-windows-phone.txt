This is the same day as Nokia World's opener, and we have a feeling this isn't a coincidence. Rumors have been rampant that the Finnish company would choose this particular week to announce its lineup of Windows Phone 8 devices, and we're hoping this is indeed the case. Granted, the invite comes with a large reference to Nokia Maps, so it's certainly possible the navigation service could be a primary focus of the event, but we're hedging our bets on new handsets. Either way, we'll be there to share the excitement with you.
