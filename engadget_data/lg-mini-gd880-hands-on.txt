Build quality is striking here -- jaw-droppingly so -- with fit and finish on all corners, seams, and around the various ports looking spot on. This device also has heft for its diminutive size -- sure, it's only 99g, but that feels like so much for a device of this size -- but it only adds character and, well, it feels like money for lack of a better word. Running LG's S-Class UI, the touchscreen sadly isn't really up to snuff, we had to really poke at the screen to get it to register a touch, and there was lag and delay between key press and action. Of course, this isn't shipping today, but rather launches in Europe in March -- for some unknown price -- and then on to other markets. So here's hoping there is still a tweak or two in the GD880's future, it'd be a shame to let something as glorious as it looks not deliver an experience to match. Short video and gallery are right below the break.
