 
AMD's cutting it mighty close, but the latest word from its PR mouthpiece is that the hotly anticipated Radeon HD 6970 and HD 6950 will be unveiled just in time for the gift-giving holidays. Fudzilla has heard directly from the Radeon team, who say they're "going to take a bit more time before shipping the AMD Radeon HD 6900 series." The NDA is expected to lift on the week beginning December 13th, but it's anyone's guess whether reviews of the cards will be accompanied by widespread in-store availability. Our hearts say yes, but our minds are already making other plans.
