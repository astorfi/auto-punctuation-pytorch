 As we were wandering the floor today at IDF 2012, we happened upon an OCZ rep who pulled the company's new 2.5-inch SATA 3 SSD out of his pocket and let us get our mitts on it. Called the Vector, it will replace the well-received Vertex 4 at the top of OCZ's lineup. Like its predecessor, the Vector packs an Indilinx controller, but this time it's the Barefoot 3, which was developed totally in-house without any assistance from Marvell designs. You can expect to see 256GB and 512GB versions of the drive hit the market in Q4, with other sizes possibly showing up after. Of course, IOPS, read/write speeds and pricing remain a mystery, but at least we can share the gallery of shots below.
