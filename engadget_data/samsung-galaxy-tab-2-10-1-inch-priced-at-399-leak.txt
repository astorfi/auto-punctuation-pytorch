  Office Depot probably isn't the first place you'd think to look for Samsung's incoming Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1), but it looks to be the first legitimate retailer to throw a price tag on the aforementioned slate. Just weeks after cruising through the FCC, the Tab 2 is now being shown with a $399.99 price. Granted, that's for the lowly 8GB model, but it's still a step in the right direction -- you know, towards folks who would like to pay less than $499 for a 10-inch tablet. As of now, it's still impossible to actually check out with one, but those feeling lucky can hit the source link and get 'er a go.[Thanks, Dube]
