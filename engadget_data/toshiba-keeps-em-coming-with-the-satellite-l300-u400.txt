 
While not radically different than the Satellite A300 and P300 we peeked late last month, Toshiba is rolling out yet another pair in the L300 (pictured) and U400. As for the former, you can expect a 15.4-inch 1,280 x 800 resolution panel, a 1.3-megapixel camera, integrated WiFi and the usual complement of ports. Moving onto the U400, you'll find a smaller 13.3-inch display, ATI Mobility Radeon graphics, built-in Harman Kardon speakers, integrated webcam / microphone, Bluetooth and WiFi to boot. Unfortunately, we're not told whether or not the L300 will be available with a Penryn chip, but word on the street has the April-bound U400 checking in with one of Intel's prior processors or a CPU from its arch rival AMD.Read - Satellite L300Read - Satellite U400
