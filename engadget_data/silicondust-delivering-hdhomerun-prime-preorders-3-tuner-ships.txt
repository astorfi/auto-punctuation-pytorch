The company has informed buyers that it expects to fill all preorders by Labor Day weekend, and before it starts shipping devices to any retailers other than Newegg, so don't expect any more wayward Amazon listings until at least that date. As for the 3 tuner version of the Prime, it should start shipping on August 22nd so dust off that Ethernet port, pick up a CableCARD from your local office and get ready for the UPS guy to drop by.
