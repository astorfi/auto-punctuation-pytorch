Spotify's Windows Phone app has typically lagged its Android and iOS counterparts, but it's about to catch up in a big, big way. The streaming music provider has revealed a makeover of the app that will roll in the discovery, playlist browsing and radio features that we've seen elsewhere. It will also have a fresh interface that's in sync with Spotify's more recent apps while remaining true to the style of Microsoft's smartphone OS. Premium subscribers will be the first to get the Windows Phone update when it arrives this spring, but Spotify has promised that its free mobile listening option will be coming to the platform later on.
