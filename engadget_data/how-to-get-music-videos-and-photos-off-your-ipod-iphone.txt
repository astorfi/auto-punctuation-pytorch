Back then, the classic model had only recently added the infamous click wheel (while still rocking the monochrome screen, mind you), iPod nano was still called the mini, and viewing photos was a brand new feature worthy of having its own line. It's time to take another look at how to transfer media of all sorts -- audio, video, and pictures -- from a variety of iPods and iPhones back to your Windows or Mac OS X machine.
