   Good news for fitness junkies who like to mix and match their gadget brands: MotoACTV's accompanying application will now work on pretty much all Android phones, and not just those that happen to be made by Motorola. The only catch so far as we can tell is that your handset must run Android 2.1 (Eclair) or later -- a near-certainty in 2012. Already rocking a Moto device? You might still want to take the time to install this update, as it brings several other new features, including the ability track fitness goals on your phone, as well as use your handset to configure WiFi networks for your MotoACTV. You can also plan workouts on your device of choice, access them on MotoACTV and then send your workout data back to the phone. So far, the Engadget staff can confirm the update works just fine on LG devices, so we're optimistic the latest software will play nice with the Samsungs, HTCs and Huaweis of the world.
