The mission? Capture last week's lunar eclipse. Lucky for us, the mission was successful and both the cartoon astronaut and the accompanying film were successfully recovered. The resulting photographs are quite stunning, but you don't have to take our word for it. If you missed Google's live stream, you can catch up with Buzz and the team at the source link below.
