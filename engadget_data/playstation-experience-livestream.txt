Couldn't make it to Las Vegas this weekend to check out the first PlayStation Experience? Well, we've got you covered with a livestream of the event right after the break. If the official image above is any indication, we can expect to hear quite a bit about Until Dawn, Mortal Kombat X, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, The Order: 1866, Batman: Arkham City and hopefully a whole lot more -- maybe even a live demo of new Project Morpheus games. The Twitch stream starts with the keynote address at 1 p.m. Eastern / 10 a.m. Pacific and will run until 3 p.m. Eastern / 12 p.m. Pacific. Sony says that certain interviews and panels from the event will be broadcast as well, so be sure to keep this tab open!
