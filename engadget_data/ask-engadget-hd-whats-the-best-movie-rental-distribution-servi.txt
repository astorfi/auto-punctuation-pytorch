A lot has changed since Netflix and Blockbuster (among other smaller outfits) decided to get into the DVD-by-mail rental game, so we figured Chuck's question on the matter was ripe for some fresh takes. "Now that I'm hearing that HD Netflix streaming is fast approaching for other items outside of the Xbox 360, I'm tempted to sign up. But first, I wanted to know from current subscribers how their experience currently is with Blockbuster, Netflix or anyone else. Are the wait times for movies (and Blu-ray Discs, in particular) always too long? Is one noticeably better than the other? Thanks in advance!" No, thank you, Chuck. So, movie renters of all shapes, sizes and genders -- how do you like your current company? Are you thinking of switching?
