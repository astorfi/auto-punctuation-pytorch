Well, the little flip-out, fold-up has gone and gotten its manual leaked out to the internet, and we understand that at least two ultra-nerds have read it cover to cover. Of course, there's an upside -- we've got confirmed specs. What does it look like under the hood you ask? Well, the whole package runs atop a VIA C7-M CPU, sports 512MB of RAM, a 5-inch, 800 x 480 touchscreen, a 30GB hard drive, a 1.3-megapixel camera, WiFi, WiBro, HSDPA, and between two and five hours of battery life. No word on price or release date, but you can watch the most boring video possible of the device in action after the break.[Via SlashGear]
