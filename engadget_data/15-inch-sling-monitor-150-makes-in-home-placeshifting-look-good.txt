We can think of a few places to fit his 15.6-inch 720p display that picks up HD broadcasts over its WiFi antenna for that in-home placeshifting love. The only difficulty? Getting cable, telco or satellite operators that have so far failed to bring SlingLoaded hardware to market since the original announcement to actually sell us one. Good luck with that.
