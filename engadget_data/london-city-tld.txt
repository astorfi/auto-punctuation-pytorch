Not to be outdone by New York City, London is set to follow its transatlantic cousin in getting its very own domain name. ICANN, regulator of all things domain related, today gave the British capital the go-ahead to offer .london addresses to "businesses, organisations and individuals". While it gives Londoners the chance to show a bit of hometown love, the domain has already attracted the attention of "tens of thousands of businesses," which will each do their bit to help to boost London's online identity. Like the city's house prices, expect to pay a little extra to secure your own little piece of .london when registration opens in Spring 2014.
