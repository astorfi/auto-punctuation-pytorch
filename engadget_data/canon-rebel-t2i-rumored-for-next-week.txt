 It's all rumor for now, but Canon Rumors has word from a trusted source that a new Rebel is coming next week known as the T2i. According to its source, we can expect a new, higher resolution LCD, selectable FPS video, new LP-E8 battery and grip in the followup to the Rebel T1i. It also brings a new Rebel shape and build quality but lacks an articulating screen. And in case you're wondering, the uptick in camera news is related to the runup to the big PMA 2010 photog show kicking off on February 19th -- so get used to it.
