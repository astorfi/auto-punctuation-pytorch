Well, something else good has come out of it: a URL shortener, kea.nu. Created by Shane Snow, the money earned from the temporary ads served on the shortened URLs goes to cancer research, and we can continue to keep this meme at the forefront of our minds as we move into the fall. One of our favorite products of the "Sad Keanu Reeves" phenomena is below, and for the record: we're pretty sure the guy was just enjoying his sandwich.
