 
We'll be straight with you: there's no single expression of bad-assery more potent in the polyhedral kingdom of nerdistan than the USB Skull Ring. Brought to you by Solid Alliance, the 2GB USB drive feels right at home transferring files to your PC or at the end of a fist, deftly buried into the gut of a Moradin dwarf. Your choice for $145, no seriously. One more hair-free shot after the break.
