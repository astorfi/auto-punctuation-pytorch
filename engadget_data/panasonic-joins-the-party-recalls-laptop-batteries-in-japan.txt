 It's a drop in the bucket compared to Dell's and Apple's recalls, but Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. is nevertheless playing things safe and recalling some 6,000 batteries from its Panasonic Let's Note CF-W4G laptops sold in Japan. While the numbers are on the low-end, the recall is somewhat notable for the fact that the batteries being pulled back are not the same Sony-made ones that have given Dell and Apple headaches, although the company refuses to say who did make the batteries. Apparently, the problem with these batts lies in part with the cover, which can become loose causing the batteries to change shape when they heat up. Not exactly the fireworks we've come to expect, but probably still enough of a concern to get a replacement as soon as you can if you've got one of these models.
