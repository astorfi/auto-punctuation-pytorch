Nintendo said it'd offer different ways to handle amiibo shortages and a new Animal Crossing is where at least one of them will debut. With Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer, you'll use cards rather than plastic toys to insert characters into the no-chores, interior design-focused game. Don't fret if you're rocking an NFC-less 3DS either -- the company also announced a separate card reader that'll bring the functionality to older hardware. When's it all happening? Later this spring. 



An NFC reader/writer accessory for Nintendo #3DS and #2DS will launch alongside Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer. #NintendoDirectNA
