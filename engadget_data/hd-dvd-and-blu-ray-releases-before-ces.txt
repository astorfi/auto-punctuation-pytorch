 You may have wondered where our weekly HD DVD and Blu-ray release post was and we have been wondering the same thing about all the releases. We can understand the push right before Christmas, but we are kind of surprised at the limited number of titles released just before CES. So we are going to sum up all the releases since Dec 19th through CES. While HD DVD still has a comfortable lead through the Christmas Season and CES, January looks like it may be the month for Blu-ray content. Of course new titles are announced almost constantly, currently Blu-ray has 25 titles with release dates in January compared to HD DVD's 12, but even with twice as many titles this month, it still won't be enough to overcome HD DVD's lead.HD DVD 147 vs Blu-ray 131.Blu-ray
