    Last time we checked in on Motorola's V3m -- a slight music-centric update to the EV-DO V3c -- we weren't quite sure if this was going to Verizon or Sprint, but it looks like Verizon won out in the end, and are apparently going to be offering the handset for $150 with a 2-year contract. The phone features a MicroSD slot for music and video storage, and a 1.3 megapixel camera, but there doesn't seem to be a lot else new going on here. Music wise, the phone is designed to work with Verizon's V CAST music and video services, but we're not sure of codec support beyond those downloads (though MP3 seems a given and PlaysForSure is likely).[Thanks, Ryan]
