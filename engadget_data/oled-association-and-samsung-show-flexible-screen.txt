We saw the same back in November, but this time we got up close and filmed it ourselves. We're sure this mockup in no way reflects any future handset design from Samsung, but it lets us dream of a day with giant foldable displays, and those will be great days. Follow on for a vid of it folding and unfolding and a mini gallery, too.
