We can't get ourhopes too high, since the phone is still bearing a Vodafone badge and has a distinctly Vodafone warning label, but thehandset did lose its purple coloring for a svelte black shell, so this could be a sign of good things to come. Click onfor more pics, including sexy action shots of the swivel LCD.
