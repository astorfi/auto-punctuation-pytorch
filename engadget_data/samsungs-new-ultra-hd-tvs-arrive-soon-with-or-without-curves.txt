We got our first peek at Samsung's latest high-end HDTVs -- including the new curved shape that it says creates a larger viewing "sweet spot" -- at CES back in January, and now they're just about ready to come home. Of course the new shape isn't all there is to offer, and while Samsung isn't joining LG in pushing any new OLED TVs, it is expanding its lineup of Ultra HD screens and bringing more 4K content to watch thanks to a new deal with Fox. There's also upgraded Smart Hub software with multitasking to pull in streaming video and live TV all at once, new quad-core CPUs to boot it all up in just 1.8 seconds, and a simpler pebble shaped remote for control. That massive 105-inch Ultra HD TV we were drooling over is still penciled in to launch during the second half of this year, but if you're looking for a more modest upgrade, then we have new details on price and release for most of the other models (LCD only, no word on plasma).









All of Samsung's new top of the line 9000 series TVs are both Ultra HD and curved, and start shipping this month. Unlike some of the curved TVs we've seen before these can be wall mounted, and of course come with a ton of buzzwordy tech to improve picture quality. The 55- and 65-inch versions will hit first with $4,000 and $5,000 sticker prices, respectively, followed by a 78-inch version later this year for $8,000. There will be a step down 8700 series arriving later in the spring with the same shape but missing a few features (price is TBD), but if you want a high-res display and an old-school flat HDTV experience, the 8550 series is the one. 55- and 65-inch versions launch this month for $3,000 and $4,000, but it will be a couple of months before the 50- ($2,500), 60- ($3,500) and 75-inch ($6,000) options join them.
