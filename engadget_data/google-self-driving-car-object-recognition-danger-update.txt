Whenever we see a self-driving car, we're always nervous that it won't see us and steamroller us straight into the tarmac. It's a fear that Google is trying to quell with its latest video, revealing that the vehicles are constantly tweaked to better understand and navigate the obstacles of California. In the clip we learn that the cars can now spot a cyclist's arm-waving, and will wait until they've passed before moving along. The rides can also now spot pedestrians from behind, will slow for on-road construction and won't enter a railroad crossing until the exit is clear. Now all we need is for some bright Googler to get William Daniels to voice the on-board computer and we'll pre-order two.
