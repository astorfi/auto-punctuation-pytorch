That's how we'd explain the fact that the laptop will be one of the first to land with AMD's Trinity chipset -- despite already appearing with an Ivy Bridge refresh. According to Laptop Reviews, the Pavilion dv6-7010 will arrive with the quad-core AMD A8-4500M APU, teamed with a Radeon 7640G graphics card, six gigs of RAM and 750GB of storage. The outer specs remain unchanged, but there is one other difference worth mentioning; it's priced at $700 -- a hundred bucks less than the Intel version.
