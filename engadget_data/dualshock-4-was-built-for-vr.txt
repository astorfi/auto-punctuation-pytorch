You may think that Sony built its Project Morpheus virtual reality headset to accommodate the PlayStation 4's DualShock 4 controller, but it turns out that the opposite is true -- the gamepad was designed for VR from the start. The company's Jed Ashforth tells TechRadar that the Morpheus team insisted on building the always-on (and  occasionally irksome) light bar into the DualShock for its purposes, and had to remain silent about its real objectives until the VR helmet's unveiling this March. The move isn't completely surprising given Sony's tendency to use PlayStations as technology launching pads -- see the PS3's Blu-ray drive as an example. Still, it's good to know that the controller was designed for much, much more than motion-based experiences like The Playroom.
