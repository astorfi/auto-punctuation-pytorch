Skip the DVD-Audio player and just buy this: a Japanese DIY kit that let's you build your own old-style gramophone
out of styrofoam, a motor, thumb tack, a couple of sewing needles (and some other stuff, of course). Best part: you can
use the gramophone to "record" audio. They give you a few plastic discs, but Adam over at Kempa.com found that CD-ROMs
work, too (which is handy since we have stacks of them we're never going to do anything else with). If you're really
punk you can skip the kit entirely and make a functioning gramophone just out of a needle, some tape, and a piece of
printer paper. This is especially punk because it will destroy whatever records you play on it
