APC's Biometric Mouse Password Manager may not be the first
mouse/fingerprint reader combo, but at $50, it could
still be a quick and easy way to add biometric protection to your PC. The device uses an AuthenTec fingerprint reader
and the OmniPass password manager to provide fingerprint-based access to websites, protected files and directories, and
the Windows login screen.
