According to Bloomberg, Mattrick discussed the idea of buying the company with founder Mark Pincus, bringing Zynga's social games (and hopefully some of its millions of users) to Microsoft's Xbox. People "with knowledge of the matter" say that talks eventually broke down, which is probably why you don't see Farmville taking up acres within Xbox Live. At least, not yet.
