What this will mean for the impending iOS release (and the whole AirPrint thing) remains to be seen, but in the meantime you can get started now if you want to ooh and ahh at the various implemented fixes, including improved Microsoft Exchange server reliability, improved MainStage performance ("on certain Macs"), and various security improvements. For more info, hit that source.
