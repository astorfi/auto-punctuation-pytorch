Whether you're a Google Glass wearer or merely observing the new devices, you may have noticed a lack of major updates in January and February. Android Police and Glass Almanac reveal a post from the Explorers-only community forum explaining that after version XE12 closed out last year, those monthly updates might not be monthly anymore. That's not necessarily a bad thing however, since the team is focused on making larger changes, and is currently focused on moving Glass from the Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) software it shipped with to the current version of Android, 4.4 (Kit Kat), and all the improvements that includes.


According to Glass team member Teresa Zazenski, it will make things "smoother and just plain better," adding that developers should be excited too. There is one small change to report though, as Glass wearers can now post photos and videos directly to Google+ communities. While we wait to find out what's in store, the Glass team just linked a behind the scenes video for tomorrow's Academy Awards, giving a POV look behind the scenes from workers who make the show happen -- check it out after the break.
