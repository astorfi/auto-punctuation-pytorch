Despite an excellent vocabulary and ability to recognize similarities, the lack of basic life experience leaves one of the best AI systems unable to answer even easy "why" questions. Those sound simple, but not even the famed Watson supercomputer is capable of human-like comprehension, and research lead Robert Sloan believes we're far from developing one that is. We hope scientists get cracking and conjure up an AI worthy of our sci-fi dreams... so long as it doesn't pull a Skynet on humanity.
