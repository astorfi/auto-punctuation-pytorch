A new campaign launching tonight focuses on the iPhone's ability to carry voice and data simultaneously on AT&T's network, and each of the two new TV spots ends with the line "Can your phone and your network do that?" From where we're sitting, it looks like between this new round and AT&T's Luke Wilson-manned comparison spots, both the phonemaker and carrier are fully stepping into the ring. Way to get their attention, guys. See the full clips after the break.
