Taser International, not content with zapping people with electricity, now wants you to be able to capture the action on video -- hands-free. Similar to the helmet cam used on television sports, the Axon system includes a Linux-powered tablet PC, an eye-level HeadCam that records audio and video (using IR in low-light), and a corresponding account on Evidence.com, an online, real time app for accessing and analyzing the data -- sure to become law enforcement's third favorite web portal (after Sprint's GPS data dispersal site and Garfield Minus Garfield). The system -- which will cost $5,700 per officer every three years -- made news recently when a Fort Smith, Arkansas officer was cleared of any wrongdoing in the death of a man who had threatened his wife with a handgun. The policeman was wearing an Axon camera at the time, which the county prosecutor said that the video allowed him to "observe what happened with complete objectivity." Currently officers in San Jose are using the system as part of a free trial, with other departments around the country expected to get in on the action in the near future. And who knows? At the very least we can hope that some hilarious law enforcement hijinks finds its way to YouTube. Get a closer look in the gallery below.
