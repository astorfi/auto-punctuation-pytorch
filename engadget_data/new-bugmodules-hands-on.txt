 
These new BUGModules from BUG Labs aren't much to look at, but just holding them in your hands really gets your gears going about what new kinds of custom gadgets you could come up with. The new modules are really ones that open up the possibilities and make us think, "what if I want to use more than four modules?" The usefulness of the wireless adapters like WiFi and 3G go without saying, but the possibilities of having a projector in your pocket with sound could really lead to something. And last but not least, who wouldn't want the Swiss Army Knife of input and output on their custom gadget?
