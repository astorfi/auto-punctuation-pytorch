Outerwall promised two months ago that it would offer Redbox Instant on Roku players, and the company is making good on its word by launching that channel today. The subscription movie service is now available for both the Roku Streaming Stick as well as conventional players ranging from the Roku LT to the Roku 3. There aren't any visible new features in the Roku version of Redbox Instant, but we doubt that many customers will complain -- they're getting cheap movie streaming through a similarly frugal media hub.
