Now that HP's unveiled its holiday lineup, it can turn its attention back to more evergreen products -- you know, like business laptops. Today, the company announced the EliteBook Folio 1040 G1, the successor to its current enterprise Ultrabook, along with the EliteBook Revolve G2, a slightly tweaked version of the original Revolve. Starting with the Folio, it's made of machined aluminum this time, with a lighter 14-inch chassis weighing in at 3.3 pounds (down from 3.6). It's also thinner at 15.9mm (that's 0.63 inch, versus 0.74 inch), but in order to get the machine that skinny, HP had to remove both the Ethernet jack and VGA port. Other changes include a higher-res display (1,600 x 900 or 1,920 x 1,080) and an optional touchscreen. Additionally, this is the first notebook we know of with Synaptics' ForcePad, which uses pressure-sensitivity instead of clickable buttons.

Otherwise, it's as rugged as ever, certified to meet the military's MIL-STD 810G specifications. It also comes with all the security features an IT department could ask for -- namely, Intel vPro processors, a fingerprint sensor and a Smart Card reader. Finally, as you'd expect, it steps up to Intel's fourth-generation Core processors, with battery life now rated at up to 10 hours. You can find it today with a starting price of $1,299. Meanwhile, the Revolve G2 (pictured) has the same design as the original, which is to say it's a traditional convertible with a touchscreen that can spin around and be pushed back into tablet mode. This time, though, HP added an LTE radio, Haswell CPUs and an improved stylus to work with the Atmel active digitizer. That one's priced from $1,364, and will go on sale later this month.
