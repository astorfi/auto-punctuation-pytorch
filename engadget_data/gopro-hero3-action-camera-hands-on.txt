 GoPro just revealed its new flagship action camcorder, the Hero3, and we managed to get our mitts on one this evening. First things first, the Hero3 is tiny, particularly when considering that it shoots 4K video (albeit at a paltry 12fps), a resolution usually reserved for much larger, cinematic cameras. Having handled its competition recently -- the Action Cam from Sony and the Contour+2 -- we can say that the Hero3 feels smaller and lighter than both of them. It's about the size of a couple of matchboxes stacked together and is quite lightweight, yet still feels sturdy. The textured plastic exterior is finger friendly, and the big round power / mode and record buttons give a reassuring snick with every press. The WiFi remote that comes with the Hero3 Black Edition is similarly solid in its construction, though we wish it had the same textured skin as the camera instead of its smooth exterior. We didn't get to use the Hero3 for its stated purpose just yet, but we'll be filming with the thing tomorrow, so stay tuned for all the POV footage. In the meantime, feel free to enjoy a tour of GoPro's new diminutive hardware and check out its first sample video after the break.
