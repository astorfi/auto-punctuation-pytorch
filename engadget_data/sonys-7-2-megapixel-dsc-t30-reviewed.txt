For starters, the DSC-T30 features a Carl Zeiss lens backed up by a 7.2 megapixel CCD, and Sony was gracious enough to toss in some optical image stabilization for steady hand-held shots even at slower shutter speeds. You also get a 3-inch display that fills nearly the entire backside of the camera, and that, according to Imaging Resource, performs much better than average in direct sunlight. For as low as $400, it would seem that this followup to the DSC-T9 should be unrivaled in the marketplace, but several non-minor flaws -- including heavy noise in low-light shots captured above ISO 200 and audible artifacts in some video clips -- would suggest that this model is not for everyone. Still, the small size, good overall photo quality, and superior battery life (400+ shots) are enough to make the T30 one of Imaging Resouce's coveted "Dave's Picks."[Via Photography Blog]
