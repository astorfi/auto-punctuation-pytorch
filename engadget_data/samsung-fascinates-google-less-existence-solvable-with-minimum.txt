Basically, you download Google's enhanced search APK -- which is blocked from the Market in 2.1, so you need to download it and install it outside the Market proper -- then use a third-party launcher like LauncherPro to add the widget and reassign the search button. Voice search still requires root to get working properly, but it is possible, so yeah -- user community, one; Verizon-Bing search deal, zero.
