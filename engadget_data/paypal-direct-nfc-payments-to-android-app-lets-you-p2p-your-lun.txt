PayPal has released the 3.0 version of its Android app and, through that, users can directly exchange money from one NFC-equipped phone to another. Just add the Request Money widget to your (probably already rather cluttered) desktop, type in an amount, then pick up your Nexus S and do a little fist bump with your best bro's celly -- assuming said bro has a similarly near field communication-equipped Android device. Of course, you can still use Bump to exchange cash if you like, but neither that nor NFC will ensure your friend will ever actually pay you back. Maybe that's something Bluetooth 4.0 can manage.
