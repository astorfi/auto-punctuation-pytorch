  While Google isn't ready to answer all of the questions we have about its Project Glass concept yet, a member of the team has chimed in on one of the most common questions -- could it work even the user wears prescription glasses? Industrial designer Isabelle Olsson says the team ideally wants it to work for everyone, and posted a photo of the Glass-on-glasses mockup shown above to her Google+ page. Unless you're a Google exec this doesn't bring you any closer to going retinas-on with the heads-up display / augmented reality project yourself, but hopefully it keeps the dream alive even for the near / far sighted among us.
