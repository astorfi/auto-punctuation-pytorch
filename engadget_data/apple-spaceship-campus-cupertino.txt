In exchange, Apple has agreed to fork over more money to the city in the form of a reduced sales tax rebate -- going forward, Cupertino will only give back 35 percent sales tax instead of the 50 percent it had previously. Indeed, as soon as Apple gets its final permits some time today, it can begin demolishing the former HP headquarters and start building its own. The circular 2.8-million square foot glass-clad structure you see above is the main hub of the whole affair, and is said to have an underground parking facility that can hold around 2,400 vehicles. There'll be a 100,000 square foot fitness center, a 120,000 square foot auditorium, plenty more space for the company's all-important research and development division and of course everything's designed to be as eco-friendly as possible. Don't go planning your desk arrangements just yet though, Cupertino employees, as you'll have to wait until 2016 to move into what Jobs called "the best office building in the world."
