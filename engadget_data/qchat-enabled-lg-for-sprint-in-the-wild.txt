The FCC recently tipped us all off to the Samsung Z400, a rather rugged (or rugged-looking, anyway) clamshell that marks a departure from Motorola as the prime supplier for its PTT wares -- and now we have an entry here from LG. Looking considerably less rugged, we'd wager that Sprint is making the call to start marketing PTT in earnest to markets outside Nextel's traditional strongholds (construction and the like). Our tipster tells us that the display appears to be about the same size as the Muziq's, and in general, the phones feel similar. If all goes according to plan, we should see this one on the streets some time next quarter.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
