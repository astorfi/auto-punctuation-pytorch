While details are fairly light, the device sketched out above has turned up at the FCC for the requisite testing and approval, and it's definitely an ANT+ adapter for the iPhone, which we can only presume will work in conjunction with an app of some sort. Hopefully Garmin will fill in some of those remaining details sooner rather than later.
