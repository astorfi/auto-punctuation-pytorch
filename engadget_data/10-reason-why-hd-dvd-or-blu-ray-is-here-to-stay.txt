       While our favorite past time is to argue the merits of our preferred HD movie format, there are many out there like Jason from CE Pro that believe that neither format will survive. And while we agree that there are many compelling HD alternatives to both formats, here are ten reasons why either HD DVD or Blu-ray will survive.

They offer the best picture and sound quality
You own the disc, no one can expire it or take it away
Discs still cost less per GB than a Hard Disc
Discs don't 'just' go bad and cause you to lose your movies
Discs are portable and can be shared with friends
Eventually HDM players will cost less than upconverting DVD players
Xbox Live Marketplace HD expires and is locked to the device
HD VOD is limited in selection and availability
Even when VUDU gets HD, it costs too much, and the content is locked on the box
HD Movie channels crop, compress, and offer worse audio than DVD

Sure, no format lasts forever, but one of these HD movie formats will be here for ten or twenty years.
