 Newly LCD-focused HDTV maker Syntax-Brillian has teased a few details about its plans for CES, bringing a high-end feature from CES 2007, 120Hz, to its mainstream Olevia brand. No word on specific models or prices, but 1080p and 120Hz motion processing are the highlights of the 42-, 47-, 52-, 55- and 65-inch LCDs. Rounding out the CES 2008 plans are a JPEG/MP3 support, USB firmware upgrades, a new universal learning remote, and a whole slew of Olevia-branded accessories including HDMI cables, wall mounts and a wireless/waterproof LCD. Expect more details in a few days, and look for these HDTVs to hit shelves in the second quarter.
