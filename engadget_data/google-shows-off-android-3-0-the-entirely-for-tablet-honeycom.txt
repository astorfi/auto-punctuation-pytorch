We heard talk that 3.0 would be exclusively for tablets, as in not for phones, and that looks to be played out with the text "Entirely for Tablet" seen early in the video. Perhaps the best thing to say is that this looks more or less nothing like Android. Sure, the browser is the same, and the Gmail app will be familiar to iPad users, but trust us when we say there's a lot of lovely UI in the video above to admire...and a lot of glowly blue lights, too. Apparently we weren't the only ones who saw Tron:Legacy on opening night.

Update: The video is back! It's embedded below.
