We've all fallen victim to the pedantic e-mail filter that denies the existence of Scunthorpe and refuses to let you order Shiitake Mushrooms, but the situation just got a whole lot worse in the UK. The country's new nationwide adult content filter has been found to restrict access not just to smut, but also to online educational, medical and emergency resources. The list of "offending" sites runs from BishUK, a site to teach young people about relationships, all the way through to several women's crisis centers being blocked. In response to questions from the BBC, networks like BT and TalkTalk have pledged to make the necessary changes -- although some have questioned if it's right that ISPs have this much say in what parts of the internet are safe or not.
