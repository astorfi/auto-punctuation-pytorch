That's Nicholas Negroponte, of OLPC fame, making some bold predictions from his inaugural column in the back page of Wired. Sure, his thoughts on user control of when and what we watch really hit home with the YouTube generation, but his lack of interest in resolution seems a bit silly if you've stepped inside a Best Buy at any point this decade. That said, it's certainly worth a quick read before you run to the attic and dive into your archives. [Via Fimoculous]
