Think of this as IMDb baked into your Google search. Today, everyone's favorite Search giant from Mountain View announced that users seeking information about their favorite shows, or those just curious about specific series, will now find detailed episode listings within their results. The added information pings up the full season's worth of episodes along with their respective air dates. And clicking on any of those entries will pull up relevant search results -- handy, say, if you're looking for a spoiler-laden recap. That's about as deep as this addition gets, but you won't find us complaining.
