 Evernote may be known for its flexible suite of cloud software, but the company is apparently looking to hardware as its next evolution. CEO Phil Libin told IDG that his company won't create hardware internally at first, but with partners. "We won't actually do the manufacturing, but we'll do the co-design together," he said. That isn't to say Evernote is staying out of the internally produced hardware business forever; Libin estimates his company will get there "in a few years -- three, four, five."

 Evernote partnered with Moleskin earlier this year to create the "Smart Notebook," so the California-based company's certainly no stranger to working with collaborators. And that's to say nothing of Evernote's functionality on virtually every smart mobile device available (including Google's Glass project). It's not clear what Evernote's hardware ambitions could be, but we'll be sure to keep asking as the next few years roll along.
