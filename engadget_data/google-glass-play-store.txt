And that structure could very well come in the form of a Glass-optimized Play Store. Android and Me noticed a "Google Glass 1" entry pop up in the device field following Mountain View's Play refresh that hit the web last night. It's not possible to push apps directly to the wearable at the moment -- the Glass option is not currently live -- but it's entirely possible that the device could be selectable in the near future. Take a closer look in the screenshot at the source link below.
