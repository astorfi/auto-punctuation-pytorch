Needless to say, the Sidekick LX is the best Hiptop to date; we were pleasantly surprised with the handset's build quality, the blue shell with chrome trim looks pretty slick, and the bright, crisp widescreen display is simply glorious. Can't get to the store just yet? No worries, we've got you covered with a bunch of shots that should make the day fly by just a little quicker!
