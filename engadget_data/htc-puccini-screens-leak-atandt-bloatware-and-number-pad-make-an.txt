The bevy of shots over on Pocketnow show the AT&T-branded Honeycomb slate packing a serious amount of carrier-installed bloat, with AT&T's Code, Family, MyText and Navigation apps joining the likes of Amazon's Kindle app, Cordy, Let's Golf 2 and NFS Shift. The OEM also appears to have tacked on a number pad to its virtual keyboard solution -- a feature Sony's rumored to include in its own tablets -- taking full advantage of the purported 1280 x 800 display. And, lest we forget that last pic of stylus pairing, the slab's menu dock sports a "pen icon in the tray," confirming those notions of Scribe-functionality. Be sure to check the source for an extra peek at the orange-colored network's future must-have device.
