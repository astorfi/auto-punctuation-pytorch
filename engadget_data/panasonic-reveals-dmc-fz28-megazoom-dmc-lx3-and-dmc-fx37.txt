Kicking things off is the zoom-infatuated DMC-FZ28, which features a remarkable 18x optical zoom, 10.1-megapixel sensor, Intelligent Auto Mode, Auto Focus and a 27-millimeter wide-angle lens. Moving on, we see the DMC-LX2's rightful successor -- the unimaginatively named LX3 -- which lands in August alongside the aforementioned FZ28. Said shooter packs a 10.1-megapixel sensor, F2.0 24mm LEICA DC VARIO-SUMMICRON lens and the ability to capture 720p movies at 24fps. Bringing up the rear is the pocket-friendly LUMIX DMC-FX37 (due in September), which touts a 25mm ultra wide-angle LEICA DC lens, 10.1-megapixel sensor (are you sensing a trend?), a 5x optical zoom and 720p movie mode. Ready for the sting(s)? Try $449.99, $499.95 and $349.95 in order of mention.[Via LetsGoDigital]Read - DMC-FZ28Read - DMC-LX3Read - DMC-FX37
