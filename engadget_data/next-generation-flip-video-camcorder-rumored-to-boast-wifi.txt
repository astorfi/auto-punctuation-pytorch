 Oh c'mon, don't act surprised. It's just the natural evolution of things. Sony already upended the pocket camcorder market by adding GPS to one of its models, and now with Cisco at the helm (who, by the way, is a networking giant), it looks as if Flip Video's next product will sport an internal WiFi module. Granted, we were already assuming as much after listening to Pure Digital's founder speak of the device's future post-acquisition, but word on the street has it that a new Flip with WiFi will land sometime in 1H 2010. Furthermore, a Cisco spokesperson has been quoted over at Pocket-lint as saying that a new edition will feature "a large screen that slides to reveal the record and menu buttons underneath." We're guessing that we'll hear more about this mythical product as CES draws near, but that MinoHD you were about to buy? Yeah, might wanna lay off.
