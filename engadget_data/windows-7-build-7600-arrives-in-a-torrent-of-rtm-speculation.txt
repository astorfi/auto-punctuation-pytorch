What's interesting here is that the major jump in build revisions from the current 72xx builds suggests, but does not guarantee, that 7600 is the Release To Manufacturing (RTM) build rumored for a July 13th release (yes today) -- the same Windows 7 build that will be handed out by Microsoft to it partners in the run-up to Microsoft's October 22nd consumer launch. If it is the RTM build then we'd expect to hear some kind of announcement with the kickoff of Microsoft's Worldwide Partner conference in New Orleans later today.Update: Just to be perfectly clear, the official Windows blog has posted confirmation that 7 has not reached RTM yet, but is poised to do so second half of this month.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
