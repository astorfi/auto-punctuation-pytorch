As promised, more funtastic feline frivolity. That little pink kitty has once again proven herself the stalwartly
champion of social grace. This time around, the
Hello Kitty Breath Tester kicks
the old puff-and-sniff in the palm approach to
halitosis detection rightly to the curb. A
happy kitty icon means you'll get big hugs from daddy while a little wincing kitty means pack your bags
princess, it's off the
salt mines for you!
