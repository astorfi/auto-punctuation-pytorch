 Thepeople spoke, and Apple listened -- while they still have their hearing that is. After facing that French iPod law (no,not that one, theother one regulating volume output in portable audio devices) and a lawsuit here in the states aboutiPod-related hearing damage, Apple's apparently releasing a software update to allow for a personal volume thresholdoption in your iPod. Meaning you can set it so your iPod can't get any louder than a certain pre-defined level --though as long as that level is configurable, even if its placed out of the way in the device options, people willstill continue to set it to 11 and damage their hearing. Still, what's interesting here is that this move could beconstrued as an admission of guilt in some sense, but hey, we appreciate the thought, Apple. Look at that guy in thepicture -- we wouldn't really want him screaming at full volume right into our ears, either.
