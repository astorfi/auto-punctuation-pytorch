which is now missing from Apple's page after they announced it
going south earlier today). The 3.5 x 1.6 x 0.27-inch
device will feature 500 song/2GB and 1,000 song/4GB capacities, a 1.5-inch color display, and, of course, a click
wheel, which appears to have a drastically larger center button. If you're willing to ignore the fact that the
headphone jack is located on the bottom of the device (sigh), you'll be otherwise rewarded with a device that's no more
than 62% the size of the once diminutive iPod mini; it weighs 1.5 ounces (42 grams), has a maximum of 14 hours battery
life, will come in black (as well as iPod white), and includes a few new niceties such as a nighttime inverse screen
mode. Expect it to have a $199 and $249 pricetag; dock ($29) not included, and new lanyard headphones will be available
for $39.
