Check out the 24fps "Dublin's People" short after the break, shot with one of those fancy new 7D DSLRs from this little company named "Canon" that you may have heard of. The verdict? Filmmaker Philip Bloom loves the new hardware, and says the rolling shutter problems of the 5D Mark II have been slightly reduced (at a cursory glance, anyway). Still, he's hoping Canon also releases a firmware update for existing 30fps-limited 5D Mark II owners -- he owns two.[Via planet5D]
