 Take a good look: this may be the closest most Americans get to the Nokia Lumia 720 without going through an importer. The fashion-focused Windows Phone has passed through the FCC's approval and, as expected, doesn't include the LTE that most US carriers would demand. The agency does throw a few bones, though. The smartphone's full manual is on display, and there's support for HSPA+ on AT&T's frequencies for those who just have to get this slenderest of Lumias running on a local network. We'll keep an eye out for a version with US-native LTE should Nokia ever have a change of heart, but those who can't afford to wait can have a gander at the source link instead.
