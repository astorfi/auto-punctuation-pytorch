Ok, we should note that you could probably turn just about anything that's the right shape and size into a DIY
external battery pack for the iPod (like that one made out of
a deck of playing cards), but the latest to pop up is a pack that's been squeezed into an Altoids tin and'll give
you an extra ten hours of precious playing time.
