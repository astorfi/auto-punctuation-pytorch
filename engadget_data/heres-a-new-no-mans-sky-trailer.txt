Hello Games writes on its blog, "Portal is just one story that you can find yourself writing as you play No Man's Sky. It also reveals five ways you'll travel the galaxy: walking across the surface of planets, flying in their atmosphere, jetting into space, warping between systems and finding mysterious portals, which take you ... somewhere..."

The band 65daysofstatic is composing the soundtrack for No Man's Sky. "We've been huge fans of them for the longest time, and in fact, we've forever imagined No Man's Sky against their music," Hello Games says. "To have them write music especially for No Man's Sky is just amazing."
