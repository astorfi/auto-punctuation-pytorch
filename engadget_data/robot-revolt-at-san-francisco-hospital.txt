Cue image of fleets of angry mechanoids taking up arms and storming the local health care facility… then dash it
all, as it was really just a single robot gone wild at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center. Yet
highly troubling nonetheless, as nobody is quite sure what prompted poor, mild-mannered Waldo (who gives robots names
like Waldo?) — a lowly medicine-delivering bot — to run amok and terrorize the cancer ward. Waldo apparently blazed
past the pharmacy and blew into the radiation oncology examining room where a physician was treating a cancer patient —
and wouldn't leave (wouldn't leave? Don't these things have an off switch?). It was enough to prompt the
patient to flee the room in terror. What could disturb a robot so deeply? Messy breakup with
EMMA the nursebot?
