Supposedly, this 16GB to 32GB unit can't actually be plugged directly into an eSATA port as-is, as power from the USB socket is necessary for things to function properly. Essentially, the flash drive has to be connected to the pictured dongle -- which obviously takes up two ports in your machine -- in order to operate. Needless to say, we've all ideas that we'll see a design tweak before these ship en masse.
