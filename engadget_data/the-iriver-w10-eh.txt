We know they've been experimenting lately withform factors and devices like some sort ofcrazed college student, but the hell are they doing making a palmtop device? Apparently the W10, which they were showingat CeBIT (not sure how we missed it), will have something like a 5-inch screen, 60GB drive, WiBro, WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0,T-DMB tuner, USB On-The-Go, and support for MP3, WMA, AAC, MPEG-4 / h.264, WMV9, and DivX. We're a little confused andcurious ourselves, but willing to give it a try. What the hell.[Via GenerationMP3]
