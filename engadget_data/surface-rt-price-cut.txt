Microsoft might not be seeing the sales numbers it hoped to for its Surface RT, because according to The Verge, it's readying substantial price cuts across its debut tablet. In short, the cheapest option (a 32GB Surface RT) could reach $350, while adding a Touch Cover will land at $100 more to $450. Doubling storage to 64GB will cost $450, while another hundred bucks will add a Touch Cover there. We've been in touch with Microsoft, who told us that it "doesn't comment on rumor and speculation," so it's certainly not set in stone. We'll let you know when we see an official confirmation.


Update: Staples has confirmed the price cut is coming -- this Sunday!
