According to the fairly convincing screenshots, games cost will $15 each-- which sounds steep, but not unreasonable -- and will even be able to do multiplayer via WiFi networking. Of course,there's still no word on when this will be actually available, and the pics are from a tipster's "friend" whoworks as a "designer at Sony" (yeah, haven't heard that one before), which doesn't lend a whole lot of cred,but we'll let the pics speak for themselves.[Via PSP Fanboy]
