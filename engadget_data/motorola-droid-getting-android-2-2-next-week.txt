Considering the brevity of the announcement, it's entirely possible that this was thrown together in response to Sprint's EVO news -- but who cares? The more Android 2.2, the better, right? No official word on other Droid variants -- most of which are likely going to see Froyo updates soon -- but we'll be keeping our ears firmly planted to the ground.
