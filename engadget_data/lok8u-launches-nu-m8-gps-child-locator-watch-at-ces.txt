In fact, the locations services company is setting up shop at CES in order to debut its Nu•M8 GPS child locator, a so-called "innovative new best friend for parents and children." The device is said to be the first of its kind created specifically to be worn by children with the technology "cleverly concealed within a child's digital watch." Granted, the styling is questionable for youngsters over 9 or 10, but by that age they ought to be toting their very own beeper, right? Of note, the watch will also send an alert if it's ever "forcibly removed," though it'll cost you £149.99 ($218) for the peace of mind come Spring.
