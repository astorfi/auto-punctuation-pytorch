 In a move that's making us re-think our frequent flyer habits, Delta has announced that it will install Wi-Fi on its entire domestic fleet of more than 330 mainline aircraft by the first half of 2009. The Aircell Gogo service will run $9.95 or $12.95 for trips under or over three hours, respectively, and will allow connection of any WiFi device, although we have to think it'll shutter certain open-port services like Skype. Delta will roll WiFi out initially on Delta's 133 MD88/90s next month and then hit its Boeing craft, saying it will be done in first half of 2009. Delta says it chose Aircell because it's lightweight and affordable. We're certainly willing to pony up 13 bucks for a little browsing love at 37,000 feet.
