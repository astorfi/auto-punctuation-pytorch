 
 Back in June at Computex, we got to spend a little quality time with Lenovo's forthcoming Windows 8 tablet -- not too long after, the FCC got to play around a similarly specked device, as well. Now, courtesy of some leaked info, we're seeing a slate from the company that looks awfully familiar. According to the spec sheet, which compares the product head-to-head with Apple's iPad, the Windows 8 ThinkPad Tablet 2 will feature a 10.1-inch 1,366 x 768 IPS display, in excess of 10 hours of battery life and two cameras, including an eight megapixel one on the rear. Also on board is NFC and a fingerprint reader, all packed into a 9.8mm body. Oh, and in keeping with the Lenovo's businessy focus, we've also got a glimpse of a very ThinkPad-looking keyboard dock, complete with the customary pointing stick. Check that out after the break.
