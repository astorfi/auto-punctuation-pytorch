Panasonic is one of the few electronics companies that's not pushing a 4K TV right now, but that is apparently about to change. An AV Forums reader spotted a few webpages cached prior to the company's launch event that show off not only its upcoming 4K res WT600 television, but also details of the HDMI 2.0 spec. The current HDMI 1.4 connectors can only handle 4K content at 30fps, and the page mentions HDMI 2.0 will support at least 60fps, but any further capabilities are unknown. The Panasonic WT600 details shown include that it will support DisplayPort 1.2 as well as 4K specific features like a web browser, media player, rendering engine and THX certification. The only disappointing part, as the post points out, is that there's no sign yet of Panasonic's sweet 4K OLED prototype which combines both of this year's high-priced HDTV buzzwords in one lovely display. The HDMI licensing group has a press conference scheduled for IFA on Friday while Panasonic's is Wednesday, so it shouldn't be long before we hear more about both pieces of this puzzle, and how other manufacturers plan to react.
