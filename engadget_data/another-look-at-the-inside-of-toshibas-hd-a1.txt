 Some people are justso curious. Take Lorin for example. He ran out and bought Toshiba's HD-A1 HD DVD player and documented him opening thething up. The six minute clip includes everything from him removing it from the box to installing the HD DVD drive in aPC. No, Windows does not recognize it silly, but BIOS did. He did indicate that purhaps Vista would...It isdifferently worth watching if those internal pics of the playerwas not enough to satisfy you.
