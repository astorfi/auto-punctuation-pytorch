There was a time when we studied maps to figure out where we were going. Then there was a time when we went online and printed out directions before we left. Now we pretty much just jump in our cars and put all our faith in the Lady of the Dash (clad in shimmering samite), but Ford wants to give you a little more control over her. Back when it was still 2010 (barely) the company announced SYNC Destinations, enabling you to plan your route in detail before you even get in the car. Now we got a chance to play with it and, while it's simple, it certainly does seem useful. Check out the video after the break.
