HTC's CEO Peter Chou was recently asked whether rumors of five Googlephones from the company in 2009 were true. He played coy, but only slightly, saying to expect "at least" three on top of all the other Windows Mobile handsets we've seen bandied about for release this year. Subtract the pearly white handset above and that leaves two more surprises in store for us before 2010, meaning its going to be a busy year for HTC -- and for our favorite little green mascot.
