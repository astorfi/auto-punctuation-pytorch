 We're sure thatthere's a soap opera or at least an after-school special to be made surrounding the ongoing drama in the wireless emailindustry. As if the RIM/NTP saga wasn't juicy enough, NTP-partnerVisto has just filed a suit against RIM-competitor Good Technology charging, guess what- that the GoodLink service isinfringing on Visto patents. This is the third such major suit brought by Visto, who have previously targetedMicrosoft (for push email in Windows Mobile 5, and not for calling their upcoming OS "Vista") and SevenNetworks, but unlike NTP (who have seen all of their patents stricken down by the USPTO) a reaffirmation of one ofVisto's patents in the Seven case seems to give Visto's claim some foundation. There's a good lesson in this for allthe Junior Achievers out there: if you grow up to be a patent troll, and you've spent years in court spouting prior artthis and injunction that, make sure to hedge your bets by aligning yourself with another lawsuit-happy company whosebargaining position is a bit stronger.
