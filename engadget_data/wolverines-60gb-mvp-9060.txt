 It took some distribution deal with Costco to call our attention to Wolverine -- a company more known for mediareaders and external drives -- and their MVP 9060 kinda-budgetizer portable media player. 60GB of drive space, a2.5-inch display, 7-in-1 media reader, and video out for $349.99 isn't exactly a mind-blower, nor is it liable to bethe most amazing device you ever bought, but if you want to step it up you can always pick up the 100GB 9000 for a bitmore dough. Just sayin'.[Via PRNewswire]
