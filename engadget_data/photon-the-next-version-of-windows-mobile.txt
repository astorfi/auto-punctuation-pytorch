Alright, so Ryan and I are kicking it here in Seattle at Mobius, Microsoft's invite-only conference about Windows
Mobile and mobile devices (don't worry, we paid our own way, we don't accept junkets). Not a ton of news or product
announcements, but we did just get a sneak peek at Photon, the codename for the next version of Windows Mobile. We
can't say too much about it — we didn't sign an NDA, but the meeting was officially off-the-record — but what we saw
was hot, it's without a doubt a big (and much overdue) leap forward for the platform. The new OS is still "years" away,
but the one thing they would confirm is that they're finally going to unify the Smartphone and Pocket PC platforms,
something they were supposedly going to do with
Windows Mobile 5.0.
