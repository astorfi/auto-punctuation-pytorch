Obviously the notable thing here is the design statement Dell is making with all that glass and metal -- these days it's almost like they've started paying their designers or something -- but the good news is that beauty isn't only skin deep here, since this 22-inch LCD has a 1680 x 1050 resolution, 98% color gamut, 2ms response time, 2000:1 dynamic contrast ratio, and a built-in 2 megapixel webcam. There are also built-in speakers, and fancy touch controls across the base of the monitor, all wired along the glass with style. Connections include DVI and HDMI with HDCP and DisplayPort. Perhaps the best news is that you don't have to wait until CES to pick this thing up: it's available now for $1,199.[Via Direct2Dell]
