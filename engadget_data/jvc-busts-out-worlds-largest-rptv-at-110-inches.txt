The TV uses JVC's proprietary "D-ILA" liquid crystal panel tech, for a 1,920 x 1,080 resolution, and pulls 220w of juice for powering all its glorious pixels. As usual, there's not much of a plan yet for commercializing this display -- the main purpose of the prototype is to show off a new screen tech from Toppan Printing that is manufactured as a single component -- but there's always bragging rights and booth extravaganza action to be had.
