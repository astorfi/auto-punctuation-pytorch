 Merely days after hearing New Line affirm that it would indeed be following Warner Bros. to the Blu side, we're now seeing confirmation that HBO (owned by Time Warner, which also owns Engadget's parent companies) will be making the same leap. According to reports, HBO Video president Henry McGee has stated that HBO will too be "following the same policy as Warner Home Video" -- though we can't really imagine anyone being shocked about the decision. The blows just keep on comin', eh?[Thanks, Utah]
