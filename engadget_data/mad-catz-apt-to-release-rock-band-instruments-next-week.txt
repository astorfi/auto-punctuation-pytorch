Sure enough, the deal was announced shortly before CES 2008 consumed our lives, and now we're hearing whispers that the first products from said agreement could hit stores as early as next week. We're talking a Fender bass ($69.99), Telecaster ($79.99), microphone ($59.99), portable drum kit ($49.99) and a premium drum set ($149.99). From what we can glean, everything listed above will be tethered, but we aren't writing off wireless versions just yet. Oh, and be sure you consult with the SO before you up and purchase a second kit for the den -- you can't afford for that first one to get defenestrated.
