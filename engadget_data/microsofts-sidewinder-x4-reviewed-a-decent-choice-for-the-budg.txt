For those unaware, Microsoft designed the SideWinder X4 to handle up to 26 key presses at once (it's a "pro gamer" thing, we're told), but it also allows for macro recording and profile / mode switching. According to the critics, the X4 is a step backwards in terms of design, particularly when compared to the flagship SideWinder X6 (which can be had for around $40 right now). Essentially, they could only really recommend it for those that actually do have ghosting issues when gaming, though they confess that said crowd is a relatively tiny one. But hey, don't take our word for it -- hit the source link and discover the truth for yourself.
