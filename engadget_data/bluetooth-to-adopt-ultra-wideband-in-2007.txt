Way back in May we heard the first rumblings of discussions between the
Bluetooth SIG and Ultra Wideband proprietors about
merging the two standards — well, looks like Bluetooth's pulling the trigger on it, and will be updating their product
roadmap to reflect the pairing (pun oh so intended), so that by Q3 2007 Bluetooth should have prototype UWB compatible
BT cores a-cookin'. But there are still kinks to be worked out, namely that the two
Ultra Wideband heavy hitters — the WiMedia
Alliance and UWB Forum — have yet to come together and proceed with a single UWB standard, making the whole thing
increasingly sticky for a third party like the Bluetooth SIG to step in and try to adopt the technology. Still, we can
totally understand that another couple hundred megabits per second on top of Bluetooth 2.0's 2.1mbps must have been
mighty tantalizing, kinks and all.
