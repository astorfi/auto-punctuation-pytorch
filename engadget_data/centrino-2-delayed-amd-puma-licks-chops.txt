 We were all excited to see Intel's Montevina-based Centrino 2 next month, but it looks like that was never meant to be. Citing problems with the chip's integrated graphics and issues with 802.11n certification, Intel has pushed its launch to July 14, with the complete line hitting streets in the first week of August. Says AMD, "Hi. We're AMD. We have a little chip called Puma, it has no integrated graphic issues, and it'll be available in June. How YOU doin'?"
