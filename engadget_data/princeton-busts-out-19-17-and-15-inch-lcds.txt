The only monitor of particular note is their new PTFWHF-19W widescreen 19-incher, which sports a 1,440 x 900 resolution, 5ms response time, 300 nits of brightness and a 700:1 contrast ratio. There's also a built-in speaker and DVI port, but that's about as exciting as it gets. The PTFWHE-17 follows up with 17-inches at 1,280 x 1,024 res, but a lame 12ms response time, while the PTFWHE-15 makes do with an XGA resolution, 250 nits of brightness and 8ms response times. At least the prices are a bit more fun, since the LCDs go for 34,800 Yen ($295 US), 25,800 Yen ($219 US) and 24,800 ($210 US) respectively. Oh, and in case you hadn't noticed, you get your pick of white or black, so choose wisely, friend.[Via Impress]
