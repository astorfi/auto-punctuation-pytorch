Its new Electric Rock Guitar Bag features 14 buttons for a fretboard so you can strum any songs in a Major key, and a detachable amp that cranks all the way up to an obligatory 11. You'll also have room for a 17-inch laptop, while its eight pockets can hold your Green Day and Blink-182 chord-charts. Come August 28th, 50 bucks is all it'll cost ya to rock while you're rolling during the commute, but in the meantime, we know the perfect synth player for when you wanna get that office band started.
