Most cogent example? See the non-existent Made For iPhone accessories market -- accessories with their own electronics could have an 8-18 month lead time, so we still probably won't be seeing the first proper iPhone add-ons until closer to the holidays.Which is why it's so weird that Uniea would go out on a limb and produce a hard leather case "for new iPod" (which we've been affectionately referring to as the nano fatty). Did they really just tip Apple's hand? Probably not. If any accessories-maker WAS going to get the new iPod early, we doubt it'd be some unknown company like Uniea. Besides, a few grand in costs for cheap Chinese accessories production secured them all kinds of PR-marveling at their leak-or-gamble product (including this here post on Engadget). Well, we're calling this one a gamble, not a leak, so there you go.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
