MCJ is slumming it with a 1.6GHz T5500 Core 2 Duo processor, 1GB of RAM, 60GB HDD, dual-layer DVD burner, and a 1280 x 800 15.4-inch display. The good news is that they've also stuffed a 1.3 megapixel webcam inside the 1.3-inch thick laptop, and at a mere 129,990 Yen ($1102 US) all this mediocrity shouldn't break the bank. It should be available now direct from MCJ, with Linux and OS-free versions available for the hax0rs.[Via Akihabara]
