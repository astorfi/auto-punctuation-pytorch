Starring Steve Van Zandt of the E Street Band and The Sopranos, it follows a mobster in witness protection who moves to Lillehammer, Norway, chasing dreams of clean air and gorgeous women. Naturally, it doesn't quite work out like that, but in an interesting twist Netflix will let you find out how it does work out all in one shot. Unlike most linear channels, and even Hulu's original programming efforts like The Confession, Netflix will post the entire season all at once (and in all of its territories -- US, Canada and Latin America) just like it does with older material. Of course, Netflix has a lot of ground to make up after its missteps last year, so perhaps extending its usual policy customers watch video when, where and how they want to content release timing is just the kind of bonus needed. Until it's available however, we'll have to live with the press release and trailer, both of which are included after the break.
