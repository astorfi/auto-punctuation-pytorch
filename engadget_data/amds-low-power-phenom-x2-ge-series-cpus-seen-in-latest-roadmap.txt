The Phenom X2 GE-series CPUs currently consist of a trio of units, each reportedly scheduled to land sometime in the first quarter of 2008. The chips all sport thermal design power (TDP) ratings of 45-watts, and while the GE-6400 will clock in at 1.9GHz, the GE-6500 adds 200MHz but lags behind the flagship 2.3GHz GE-6600. The whole lot touts 2 x 512KB of L2 cache, 2MB of L3 cache, and an (estimated) 3,200MHz HT3 bus, so go on and start pinching those pennies for the moment these land in a Socket AM2+ motherboard near you.
