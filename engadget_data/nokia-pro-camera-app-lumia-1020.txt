Ready to pair with Nokia's new Lumia 1020 is a new Pro Camera app to go with all those megapixels. Its new Pro Camera app, not to be confused with the Lumia 925's Smart Camera app, looks to offer users more control over camera settings, with a new concentric circle system offering access to flash, focus, ISO, shutter speed, white balance and exposure. In video mode, you can shoot at 1080p at 30 frames per seconds with 4x zoom, or up to 6x zoom in 720p. You'll also be able to reframe your shots within the app too, making better use of that high-resolution 3x zoom feature and manual focus.
