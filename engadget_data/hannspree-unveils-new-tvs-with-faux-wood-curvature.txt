Each one comes with basically the same generic plastic case wrapped around ports that we generally don't mess around with more than we need to. But these new Hannspree sets are something else indeed. Each Hanspree Lounge model is wrapped in faux wood paneling, and its curves give you something to admire whilst you're grabbing that next beverage from the fridge during commercials. These new HDTVs will display at 1,366 x 768 and come in three sizes -- 26-inch, 32-inch, and 37-inch -- whose prices range from $1,200 to $1,900, respectively. The New York Times reports that the smaller model will be available this week, with the 32-incher rolling in by the middle of the month and the 37-incher dropping "in early November." Um, isn't that around now? Oh, and each comes with a memory card reader (no word on what type) too.[Via The New York Times]Update: Jared C. pointed out that the Hannspree website actually does list what memory cards this TV accepts, something we missed on our first pass. They include CompactFlash MicroDrive, Smart Media, SD, MMC, Memory Stick and Memory Stick Pro.
