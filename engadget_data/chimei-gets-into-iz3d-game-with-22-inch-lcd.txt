Well, now Taiwan's Chimei is busting out what looks to be the first 22-inch LCD sporting that iZ3D spec. Unfortunately, that's about as much info as we've got on the display, other than the 140 degree viewing angle, but we can tell you that Chimei isn't just stopping here: it's planning a whole line LCD displays of the computer and television varieties for the North American market in '07, and with Chimei's success in the Taiwan and European markets, we might be seeing some good, friendly competition on our retail shelves this year.Read - Aving.netRead - DigiTimes
