ASUS' 12.2-inch mini laptop weighs less than 3-pounds and offers 8-hours of unplugged freedom with some help from Intel's Atom Z520 processor and ASUS' own Super Hybrid Engine tech. Most notable is that massive (price too we expect) 512GB SSD, a world's first in a laptop according to ASUS. No price or dates yet, expect those along side the official press release later today.
