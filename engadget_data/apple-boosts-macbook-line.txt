Apple's new smartwatch might be the focus of its "spring forward" event, but the company still had time to surprise us with updates to its MacBook lineup. The all-new "Retina" MacBook with its pressure-sensitive trackpad might get all the attention, but older MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models also got a few tweaks under the hood. They now boast Intel's latest Broadwell Core i5 and i7 processors, more powerful graphics and improvements in the battery department, which means you can eke out over 10 hours with most of its new models.



The new MacBook won't be the only notebook to get Apple's new Force Touch trackpad, either. The 13-inch MacBook Pro will enjoy the same tactile controls as its counterpart, allowing you to "feel" what's happening on the screen. You'll be able to pick up the 2.7GHz Intel Core i5 model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage today for $1,299, rising to $1,799 for the 2.9GHz version with 512GB of flash storage. The 11-inch MacBook Air can also be ordered today starting at $899, rising to $1,099 for the top-end model.
