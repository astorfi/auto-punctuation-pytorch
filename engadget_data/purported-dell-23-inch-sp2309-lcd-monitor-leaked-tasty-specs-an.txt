We've received word that the above pictured SP2309 will boast a 23-inch 16:9 panel with a wicked 2,048 x 1,152 (QWXGA) native resolution, an 80,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio, 98% color gamut (NTSC, we presume), 2-millisecond response time, 2-megapixel camera (with microphone) and VGA / DVI / HDMI inputs. We're hearing that it should be available for purchase later this month, though pricing details remain a mystery.[Thanks, Anonymous]Update: Looks like Canada will get it first (in "one to two weeks") for $419.99. Thanks, Alex!
