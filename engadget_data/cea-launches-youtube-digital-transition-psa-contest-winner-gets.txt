The Consumer Electronics Association is sponsoring a contest with country band Whiskey Falls (yes, that's what we think when we think DTV, country music), offering a flat screen HDTV, Blu-ray player and surround sound system to the maker of the best video demonstrating how to get family and friends ready for the analog shutoff coming in February. Head over to the dedicated YouTube channel to check out the entries, and Whiskey Falls promo asking for entries after the break. Voting opens December 1 with a winner selected December 10, any questions?[Via CE Pro]
