Apparently the rumored service will see iTunes able to convert any song into a ringtone -- for a fee, of course -- and you'll even have the ability to dictate which portion of the song becomes the tone. The offering will also include the ability to use previously purchased tunes as ringtones, and we're hoping your own music in iTunes, too. We're feeling this is long overdue, but can assume that Apple could have been in conversation with the labels to sort out the financials of all this magic. Watch this space next week for more news on pricing and availability -- if indeed, it actually pans out.[Via AppleInsider]
