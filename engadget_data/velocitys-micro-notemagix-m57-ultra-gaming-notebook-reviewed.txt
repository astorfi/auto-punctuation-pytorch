TheM57 is powered by a 2.26GHz Pentium M 780 -- which gives it only decent productivity benchmark scores compared to a dualcore machine -- but the fact that Velocity throws in 2GB of RAM along with the high-end mobile nVidia GeForce Go 7800GTXcard and a 7,200 RPM hard drive allowed the rig to best PC Mag's previous champ, the Dell XPS M170, in all-important 3-D andframerate testing. Even better, the faults here are few and far between --Â  a rather-hefty 9.3-pound weight, lackof software for the built-in TV tuner, and separation between mouse buttons are the only knocks in this review -- sonon-SLI snobs should feel safe in dropping their $3000 on what is judged to be a "Very Good" laptop.
