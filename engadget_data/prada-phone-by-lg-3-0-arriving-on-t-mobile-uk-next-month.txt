The awkwardly-named Prada Phone by LG 3.0 is looking to set sail from its native Korea -- where it's already launched -- and will be available on T-Mobile, half of the Everything Everywhere duo, some time in February. Sidling up to the UK carrier's coming soon page, the salient selling points appear to be that Prada styling and LG's 4.3-inch NOVA plus display. That subtle monochromatic skinning of the Gingerbread OS won't hurt its chances either. No word on a precise launch date or price, but we expect to see a review model pretty soon -- once we're dressed well enough to be seen with it.
