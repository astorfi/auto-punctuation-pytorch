Believe it or not, Sony couldn't even wait for its E3 event to get started to share some news about the PlayStation 4. The company is launching a media player for its console with some playback features you might miss from your PS3. It'll stream media from DLNA-compatible devices on your local network, for a start, and you can plug in a USB drive if you'd rather play locally stored music and videos. The player should be available later tonight, so it won't be long before you can try it for yourself.
