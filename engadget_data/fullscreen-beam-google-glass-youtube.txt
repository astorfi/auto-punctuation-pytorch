Sure, using Google Glass to record a video is a pretty neat trick, but how about uploading it to YouTube without a computer? Thanks to Fullscreen's BEAM video sharing app for Glass, you can do just that. After setting up an account with the company's website, Glass owners can use their high-tech eyewear to send clips to YouTube along with a tweet linking directly to the video. If you've managed to get hold of Google's modern-day monocle and would like give BEAM a try, you can register at the source link below. As for the rest of us, at least we can watch the demo video after the break.
