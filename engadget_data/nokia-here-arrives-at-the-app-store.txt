 If you've been keeping up with the news of Nokia's cross-platform mapping service, then you'll know it's designed to offer access to all of that Finnish cartographic expertise even if you're holding something other than a Windows Phone or Symbian device. To that end, the iPhone and iPad version of Nokia Here has finally landed at the App Store, promising to make you "feel like a local anywhere you go," through traffic and public transport overlays, voice-guided in-car and on-foot navigation and community-based updates. It also integrates with Nokia's other new service, Collections, which lets you save your favorite places to a personal account. Crucially, the app allows you to download one geographical area of your choice as an offline map -- although a 10MB cap means that the more square miles you try to grab, the less detail you'll see.
