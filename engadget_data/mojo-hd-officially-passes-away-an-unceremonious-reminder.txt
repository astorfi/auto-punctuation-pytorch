We know, you were crossing your fingers and summoning all sorts of good fortune in hopes of it magically staying active after the December 1st date with Dr. Death (sorry for the Dr. Danger reminder), but it just wasn't to be. Here's to you, MOJO HD, and all the outstanding (and lackluster) programming you've delivered over the years. Time for a "best MOJO moment" list in comments? We vote yes.[Thanks, Tom]Update: Another obituary is after the break -- feel free to send in your own and we'll post! Thanks, Eddie!
