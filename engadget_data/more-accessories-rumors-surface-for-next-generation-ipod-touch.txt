Last week came talk of new iPod touch and nano models, and now we have even more cases and accessories that seem to back up the belief that there's a fourth-generation touch and a sixth-generation nano coming. The nano is rumored to have a 3 x 3cm touchscreen (presumably this one) and room on the bottom for a proper dock connector, ensuring compatibility with the millions of iPod cradles and whatnot out there. The new cases we're seeing certainly back up that idea, with a dock-sized cut-out along with room for what's said to be a headphone jack, volume controls, a hold button, and a clip 'round the back. At the moment we know rather less about the new touch, but we can hazard a guess as to what it'll look like.
