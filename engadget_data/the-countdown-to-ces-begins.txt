We'll be back shortly with the details. Like you'd expect, we'll be covering press events in real time, but they'll be over at Engadget instead of Engadget HD, so now you know where to look for live coverage when HD DVD and Blu-ray kick off their press events.In the mean time, take a moment now to sit back and relax. Because once we really get started, things are going to get a little crazy. And geeky.Sunday, January 6thAll day - Almost all other press conferences.
