We've known for a while that LG's upcoming G Flex smartphone features a pretty noticeable arc from top to bottom, but thanks to a source who's spent some time with the device, we now know that the phone is more aptly named than we first suspected. The 14-second video you see below shows that the curved device actually offers some give to it; according to our informant, you have to apply a reasonable amount of force to duplicate the desired effect, so it's not going to simply happen when it's hanging out in your pocket or purse. We can't imagine that you should do this on a regular basis, but it's probably good for the occasional party trick.


This particular feature has been left out of the public eye until now, but here's what else we know so far: the G Flex comes with a 6-inch 720p OLED display, a Snapdragon 800 processor and 2GB RAM, along with the G2-inspired rear volume and power buttons. You'll also get to enjoy LG's new "self-healing" coating which is capable of repairing hairline scratches that you may incur on the back of the phone. All told, this is shaping up to be a very intriguing device that we can't wait to play around with.
