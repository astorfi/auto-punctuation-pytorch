These 6-legged spiders can “see”and communicate with each other via audible “chirping.” At the moment, the bots are on an apparent hungerstrike as they won’t stay at the “feeding station” long enough to charge, presumably due to a riftwith their creator over having only instilled semi-autonomy. However, the next release of these spiders will be solarpowered (and we imagine 10 feettall!) for release into the wilds of Brazil. Hey Paulo, is that a swarm of birds coming over the horizon?
