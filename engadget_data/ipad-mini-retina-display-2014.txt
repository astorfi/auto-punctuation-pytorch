Still, rumors of a pixel-packed iPad mini have been making the rounds for a while, and, frankly, we don't expect the stream to slow down anytime soon. Now, Taiwanese publication Economic Daily News is reporting that Apple's having trouble lining up displays that meet Retina standards, making it difficult for the company to launch its 7.9-inch tablet ahead of this year's upcoming holiday season. Interestingly enough, the publication also says Apple plans to release the iPad mini with different screen resolutions come next refresh -- one of them being a lower-end, non-Retina model. Will we see a new iPad mini around its first anniversary? Maybe two? Oh, the waiting game...
