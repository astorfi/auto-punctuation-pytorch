 Although QNAP was indeed one of the forerunners in getting PC-less downloads into the NAS arena, it's been a tick since the firm pumped out anything new, but those looking for a multifaceted drive have found their match. The TS-100 supports SATA drives up to 750GB is extendable to 1.5TB by an eSATA and USB 2.0 port, operates as a UPnP media server, iTunes music server, remotely accessible hard drive, and "non-stop" BitTorrent / P2P client that can keep those downloads runnin' so long as it's being fed an internet connection. Furthermore, the device sports a trendy white / silver finish, a fanless design, comes pre-loaded with the company's QGet download management software. No word just yet on price nor availability, but we're guessing it'll hit around the $300 mark when it lands.
