 We've kept anxious eyes on Huawei's Ascend W1 for a while now, so imagine our disappointment when it was a no-show at the Windows Phone 8 launch. Fortunately, a Huawei employee has tweeted a pair of pictures that show the device in all of its budget-handset glories. Gone are the rounded corners of handsets like the Ascend D Quad, in favor of a boxier aesthetic that sits well with Metro Windows 8 Style whatever we're calling it this week. Hardware-wise, it's believed to be carrying a 1.2GHz dual-core CPU, 4-inch, 800 x 480 display, 2,000mAh battery and a 5-megapixel camera. There's also an unconfirmed rumor that we'll first see the China-exclusive device at CES 2013, breaking the hearts of impoverished westerners everywhere.
