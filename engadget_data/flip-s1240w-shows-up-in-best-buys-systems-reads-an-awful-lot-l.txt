Aside from the obvious appearance of the Flip name in the top right corner, the retail box dimensions listed herein -- 7.7 by 1.5 by 3.6 inches -- seem an almost perfect match for the recently spied Flip Slide HD product box. At that time, we were furnished with supplemental pics pointing out 16GB of built-in storage for up to four hours of video, and today we can add a price and potential release date to the dossier. April 18 is the reputed "in stock" date for this Flip shooter, with a $280 "regular retail" price shown on the other snapshot we've come across (see it after the break). That means we've only got a few days of mystery left before Cisco flips the covers away.

[Thanks, Jae]
