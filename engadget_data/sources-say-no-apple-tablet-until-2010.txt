It seems like just when rumorland is ready to claim this month or this season as the absolute certain sure time of the Apple tablet, those pesky "sources" get cold feed and bump the imaginary release date back a year or so.

They claim "very reliable sources" have called the September rumor "flat out wrong," and state that we won't see the tablet until the first half of next year sometime. Sigh. Don't give up internet, if we just wish hard enough we know that anything is possible.
