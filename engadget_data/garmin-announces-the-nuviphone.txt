 
That's right folks -- Garmin has just announced its new iPhone-like smartphone, the n√ºvifone. The device features full browsing, PIM, phone and of course, GPS functions. It's an HSDPA, quad-band phone, also equipped with WiFi, Bluetooth and a somewhat familiar ultrathin design with full touchscreen support. The unit will use Garmin's proprietary OS which is based on the UI its GPS units utilize, and sports a 3.5-inch LCD display... not unlike certain PNDs you know and love. There's no word on price or release date, though the company swears we're going to be hearing about it soon.
