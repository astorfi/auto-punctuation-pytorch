Whether or not that's what you asked for, it appears to be what Motorola's giving you judging by this "Family Edition" branded Xoom that just showed up at a big box electronics store. While there's still no hint of the subwoofer-equipped Xoom 2 Media Edition that's been rumored, this model is differentiated by the addition of a Kid Mode with $40 of software for kids from Zoodles (trailer after the break) packed-in. We don't have a release date or official pricing yet, but we'd expect to see the MZ505 on shelves sooner rather than later, but for now just check out a few more pics in the gallery below.
