Looks like Kodak's updated their upper-crust
Easyshare lineup with two new devices today, the P880 and P850. While neither happens to be a
DSLR, the P880 shoots at 8.0 megapixels (in
RAW, no less!) with a wide-angle 5.8x zoom lens, has a 2.5-inch screen, SD slot, and hot shoe; the P850 shoots at 5.1
megapixels, and has an image stabilizer and hot shoe as well. The devices will cost a decently valued $599 and $499,
respectively, and are due in September.
