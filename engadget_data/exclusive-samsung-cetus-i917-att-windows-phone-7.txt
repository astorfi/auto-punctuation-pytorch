Indeed, we're told this is the Cetus i917 destined for AT&T, featuring Windows Phone 7 in a glossy, black, curved shell that should fit nicely in those new skinny pants you just overpaid for. We don't know when this is hitting exactly, but we suspect everyone involved -- Microsoft, AT&T, and Samsung -- wants to have this on shelves in time for the holiday season. Hit up the gallery below for a couple more shots.
