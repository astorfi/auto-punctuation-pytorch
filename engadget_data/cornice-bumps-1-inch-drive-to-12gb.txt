 You wouldn't think it would have taken Cornice 8 months to announce a 2GB growth in their drives, but the portable drive manufacturer announced their first (but not the first) 12GB 1-inch Dragon series drive, due to ship to OEMs Q306 for $85 apiece. It'll still be a little while before you start seeing portables showing up with 12GBs of capacity (think about how few 10GB devices you see as is), but something tells us Cornice is really going to have to step up their game if they're going to outrun Samsung and their NAND flash production abilities.[Via Impress]
