As promised, Dell has taken the wraps off its first Chrome OS device, the Chromebook 11. The 11.6-inch, 2.9-pound laptop is built with the classroom in mind, and it should ship in tandem with a Wyse PocketCloud app that should make it easy for students and teachers to share their work online. Its 1.4GHz Celeron processor and 16GB solid-state drive are no great shakes, although the system could be the Chrome OS longevity champion -- Dell estimates a 10-hour battery life that could beat out Acer's long-lived C720. Educators who want the Chromebook 11 will have to be patient, though. A version with 4GB of RAM will ship to the US and UK in January. There will also be a 2GB model for cost-conscious schools, but Dell is only promising that it will launch sometime in the first quarter of 2014. Dell expects to sell at least one model under $300.
