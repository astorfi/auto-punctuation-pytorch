 Samsung has been pushing an ever-growing number of its mid-tier phones to larger screen sizes, and there's further evidence that it's not about to stop. Following some rumors, both the Galaxy Grand Duos and Galaxy S II Plus appear to have been spotted going through China's TENAA certification process. The Grand Duos seen here isn't likely to reach the US given its lack of compatible 3G, but it looks to have a Galaxy S III-based design that's still relatively fresh for the category. Claims have it mating its namesake dual SIM slots with a 4.5-inch (if just 800 x 480) screen, a 1.2GHz dual-core processor and cameras similar to its bigger cousin.

 As for the Galaxy S II Plus? While it should have 3G that works with AT&T and Canadian carriers, we're not anticipating much pressure to bring the S II Plus to North America when the device at TENAA closely resembles the 4.3-inch original, especially if talk of a modest 1GHz dual-core chip proves true. We'll need an official announcement, or further leaks, to know whether the S II Plus or the Grand Duos are enough to lure in new buyers.
