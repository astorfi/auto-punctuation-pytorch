 A Coolpix for every budget? Nikon's got you covered with this latest lineup of compact point-and-shoots. The S9500, priced at $350, offers a standard mid-range lineup of pocketable-cam specs. There's an 18.1-megapixel 1/2.3-inch BSI CMOS sensor, an impressive 22x 25-550mm zoom lens and a 3-inch OLED display. As you might expect from a camera in this price range, Nikon threw in embedded WiFi and GPS, letting you geotag and upload your pics directly from the camera. Next up is the $180 S5200, which manages to squeeze in a 16-megapixel 1/2.3-inch BSI CMOS sensor and a 6x, 26-156mm optically stabilized zoom lens. You'll use the 3-inch HVGA LCD to navigate the updated (and simplified) user interface. Both of these cameras offer 1080/30p HD video capture modes, too.

 Budget-cam hunters might like the $120 Coolpix L28, which is largely identical to its predecessor, the L26, save for a new CCD sensor that snaps 20.1-megapixel stills, rather than the 16.1-megapixel shots you'd be able to grab with 2012's offering. Otherwise, you'll find a 5x, 26-130mm zoom lens with a maximum aperture range of f/3.2-6.5, a 3-inch QVGA LCD, 720p video shooting and an AA battery compartment. All three cameras are set to ship in late February, and will be available in black. The S9500 will also sport a red or silver finish, the S5200 can be had in blue, purple or red, while the L28 will come in red and silver. Try to hold back your excitement.
