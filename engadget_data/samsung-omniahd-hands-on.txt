The team at Engadget Spanish had a chance to swing by and check out the high-end handset's goodies today, and let's get right down to the point (and the main reason you'd buy this phone): the video that's getting shown off on the phone looks as good or better than anything we've ever seen before (it does have "HD" in its name, after all). Follow the break for the video!
