 CEO Kaz Hirai didn't spend too much time on it during the keynote, but Sony has just announced two new changes to its Music Unlimited service that it no doubt hopes will help it lure in more customers. The first is a 60-day free trial that will be available to all new customers. Those looking to stay on beyond that will also now have a new subscription option to choose from, dubbed Access, which will give you unlimited streaming for a monthly fee of â‚¬4.99 (or just over $6).
