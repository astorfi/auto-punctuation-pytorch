Speaking with APC (the website, not the clothier), Philip Newton, director of Samsung Australia's IT division, said that the company is working on a slate PC for the second half of 2010 that will have "PC-grade processing power and connectivity" -- two things Newton had previously cited as the main things lacking in the iPad. That's really all there is to go on -- no specs or features mentioned, though Samsung has been vaguely hinting that the tablet, when it appears, will run on Intel's Atom platform, which sounds about right. We'll have to wait and see, won't we?
