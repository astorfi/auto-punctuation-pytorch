Facebook brought stickers to its Android and iOS apps this spring, and they're reaching the web right as summer hits full stride. As in the mobile space, desktop users can now use critters, giant smileys and other over-the-top graphics in their private messages. A store is on hand for those who want to venture beyond Facebook's free catalog. Web stickers are available today -- if :) just won't cut it for your conversations, you'll now have a more expressive set of emoticons wherever you go.
