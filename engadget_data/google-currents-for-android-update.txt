 We don't see the Android -- or iOS, for that matter -- version of Google Currents get quite as many updates as, say, Google+ or Maps, but today its Mountain View creators have stuffed the app with some tidbits that are sure to come in handy to those using it on a daily basis. Most notably, Currents for Android is now more friendly with editions including audio content, adding a media bar which will allow for easy playback of such files within the application. Additionally, Google also gave its magazine-like app a boost by enhancing syncing between devices, making it rather facile for folks to pick up where they left off on a story. Go on and grab the updated version now from Google Play -- in the meantime, we'll still be pondering whether or not we should insert a shameless plug.
