 There was (and still is) plenty of buzz surrounding StreetskaterFU's recent hack that enabled Blu-ray games to be played back from the PlayStation 3's internal hard drive, and now it seems like details are beginning to seep out. Fellow hacker ATOC has released an admittedly sketchy step-by-step guide for getting a number of backups to boot from the PS3, though it has only been thoroughly tested on Warhawk and Call of Duty 3. Hit up the links below for instructions, but think long and hard before you make any irreversible decisions and come dangerously close to destroying the universe.[Thanks, Bob]
