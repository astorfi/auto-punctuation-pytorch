To perspectivize things, the DSi was snatched up to the tune of about 170,000 units in the same time period, while the PSPgo sold around 28,000 units. To celebrate, the kids at PC Watch have ripped one of these bad boys -- and you'll never guess what they found! (OK, maybe you will.) Check out the link below for the hardcore details -- and don't say we didn't warn you.
