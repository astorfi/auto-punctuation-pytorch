Any weird hack solely devised and executed only using zip ties (which are on the same par as duct tape, if you were
wondering) is fully okay with us. Especially when it's something as ridiculous as using them to mount a Mac mini to the
back of a plasma. Then again, if we had our HDTVs hanging off the ceiling, we probably wouldn't want to have a
Mac mini lying around on the ground below, umbilically tethered to
the display.
