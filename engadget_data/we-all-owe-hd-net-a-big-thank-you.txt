 HDNet has changed the way I watch TV. We all know high definition is great, but I never knew that Hogans Heroes was just as good! No really, I love this show and will sit down to watch it every chance I can at 2:30 p.m.. I would have never watched this show if it wasn't in HD but now that is, I watch it all the time. In fact, this is a good way to get more high-def programming in lieu of the real stuff. Put M*A*S*H or even The Brady Bunch in HD and I will watch it. Put Happy Days or Mork and Mindy and I will watch that too. I believe that I'd watch any of these programs in high-def instead of new prime time shows that are not in HD. Until some of these other shows come on I guess that we will just hang with the Colonel Hogan and the gang.
