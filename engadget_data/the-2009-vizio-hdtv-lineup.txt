All the lines feature either SRS TruSurround XT or HD and multiple HDMI inputs. But while the VL and VT series are all 1080p and feature VIZIO's version of 120hz technology called Smooth Motion II, the EcoHD series is the new eco-friendly version we've heard about which is up to 25 percent more energy efficient than Energy Star 3.0 requires. The VL line ranges from 32 to 47 inches, with retail prices between $599 and $1099. The VT however is only available in 42 and 47-inches, which are $899 and $1099. The EcoHD line however really spans the gamut ranging from 19-inch all the way up to 32-inches and from $249 to $449.Read - VIZIO EcoHDRead - VIZIO 120hz 1080p LCDs
