After shareholders approved the deal last year, the partnership became mired in anti-trust concerns across the globe. That was then -- today the company founded by Konosuke Matsushita is the proud owner of 50.19% of Sanyo for the bargain price of Â¥404 billion ($4.6 billion). That gives Panny access to Sanyo's battery (some of which was sold off to appease regulators) and solar technology as well as its unsurpassed ability for making dull and matronly consumer electronics. Everybody wins!
