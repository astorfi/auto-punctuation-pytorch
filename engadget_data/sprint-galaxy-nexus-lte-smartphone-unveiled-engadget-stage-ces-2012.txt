After all, the Sprint edition of the Galaxy Nexus didn't even exist in the minds of the public just two weeks back, and now it's being showcased right here in front of our very eyes. We'll be filming a more in-depth hands-on with the device in the hours ahead, so keep it locked for our impressions and comparisons with the unlocked HSPA+ and Verizon Wireless variants of the handset.

Keep tabs on our next interview right here!

Full product specifications, pricing and availability will be shared closer to each device's launch date. 		The debut of these devices is a key element of Network Vision, Sprint's plan to consolidate multiple network technologies into one seamless solution. With Network Vision, Sprint customers can expect to enjoy ultra-fast data speeds, improved 3G voice and data quality, and stronger in-building signal penetration providing a more valuable wireless experience and enhancing the value of current unlimited plans. 		"The first three products that will run on the Sprint 4G LTE network exemplify the cutting-edge technology our customers can expect from Sprint as we progress with our 4G LTE rollout," said Steve Elfman, president of Network, Wholesale and Product Development for Sprint. "Galaxy Nexus packs industry-leading features and the best of Google into a beautiful design while LG Viper 4G LTE continues Sprint's commitment to green devices that don't sacrifice speed or technology. These products combine with our unlimited data pricing plans to give Sprint customers a powerful wireless experience."

Additionally, 4G devices, including HTC EVO™ Design 4G, Samsung Epic™ 4G Touch and Nexus S™ 4G, will continue to be sold in 2012. 		The new 4G LTE smartphones will benefit from Sprint Everything plans including the Everything Data Plan with Any Mobile, AnytimeSM offering unlimited data, texting and calling to and from any mobile phone in America while on the Sprint Network.

Sprint's unlimited data plans also benefit NBA fans. As the Official Wireless Service Partner of the NBA, Sprint exclusively offers Sprint NBA Mobile on Android phones, including the upcoming 4G LTE LG Viper.

Galaxy Nexus features software navigation buttons, a first for Android smartphones. The lock screen, home screen, phone app and everything in between has been rethought and redesigned to make Android simple, beautiful and useful. 		Ice Cream Sandwich introduces innovations such as Face Unlock, which uses facial recognition to unlock your phone. Using NFC (Near Field Communications) technology, Android Beam allows users to quickly share web pages, apps and YouTube™ videos with friends by simply tapping phones together.
