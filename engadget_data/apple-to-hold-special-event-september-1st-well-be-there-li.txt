Just like they always do come fall time, Apple will be holding a "special event" on September 1st out in San Francisco, and we'll be on the ground reporting live. Think we'll see that new Apple TV we've been hearing about? Some iPods? A 'one more thing'? Yes, probably. Tune in here at 10AM PT / 1PM ET on the 1st to catch the best liveblog in the business!
