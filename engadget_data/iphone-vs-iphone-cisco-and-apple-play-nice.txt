Another protracted legal battle for Apple? Oh hells no, son. After Steve dropped their latest i-bomb, Cisco told MarketWatch that they've been in "extensive discussions" with Apple recently and "it is our belief that Apple intends to agree to the final document. We expect to receive a signed agreement today (Tuesday)." Sweet.
