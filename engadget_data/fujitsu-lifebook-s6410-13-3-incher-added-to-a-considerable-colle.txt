 While we wouldn't say there are too many laptop manufacturers exactly slacking off on Santa Rosa introductions, Fujitsu-Siemens is making everyone else look bad, with this here S6410 laptop being about the tenth Santa Rosa-top we've seen from this manufacturer in a week. The 13.3-inch LifeBook S6410 naturally runs that new Core 2 Duo goodness, along with Intel's 965 chipset and GMA X3100 graphics. Fujitsu has also tossed in a UMTS modem, Smart Card reader and webcam, along with a Bluetooth option and Intel's Turbo Memory Robson tech in the near future. No word on price or availability, but where's the fun in that?
