We don't know what it is about Nokia's obsession with the caped crusader, but the Lumia 1320 -- which was given the codename of Batman -- isn't the first time we've seen the superhero associated with the Finnish company. No matter: what's important here is the fact that the 1320 has been officially unveiled at Nokia World 2013 in Abu Dhabi. Much like the 1520, its flagship brother, the 1320 features a 6-inch display; at an unsubsidized price of $339, however, the company is targeting this particular large smartphone at a more budget-minded consumer.


The 1320 features some respectable specs that will appeal to wide range of users, such as a 720p ClearBlack panel, LTE and an impressive 3,400mAh battery. Imaging enthusiasts won't be terribly ecstatic about the 5MP autofocus camera on the back, and plenty of people will balk at the 8GB of internal storage (though microSD expansion is available). It will also come with a 1.7GHz dual-core Snapdragon 400 processor and 1GB of RAM.


Take a look at our gallery of hands-on images below, and stay tuned for more of our first impressions after the break!





While the two new Lumia phones are the same size, the 1320 is thicker, taller, wider and heavier than its premium counterpart. Thanks to its 85.9mm width and 9.8mm thickness, this device isn't going to be great for one-handed use, and its rounded corners and edges lend to more of a pebble-like shape. Fortunately, it's a typical Lumia device in the sense that it still looks and feels plenty durable, regardless of its price.

As you can imagine, the Lumia 1320 is very much an enlarged Lumia 625 with a matte finish in three familiar color options. While it's relatively slim for a 6-inch phone, its rounded corners plus solid build make it quite comfortable to hold. Compared to is near-identical 1520 sibling and our 1020, the 720p display is understandably not as vibrant nor as sharp, but it's still pretty good given its price. Not a bad job overall.
