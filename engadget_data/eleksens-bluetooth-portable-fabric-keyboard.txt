Eleksen is coming out with a new Bluetooth-enabled version of their fabric keyboard for smartphones and PDAs.
Probably not what you'll want to use to bust out that screenplay, but for $99 you might be sorely tempted to keep one
rolled up in your pocket or gadget bag (we have the version for the Orange SPV around here somewhere). Should be out
sometime around the end of June and come with drivers for Windows Mobile Smartphone, Symbian Series 60, and Palm OS 5
devices.
