Laptop Mag was able to get their paws around an Asus Eee PC 701, and while you may not think a meager 900MHz Intel Celeron processor could stir up all sorts of jubilant emotions, apparently it still can. Reviewers made no bones about the machine's lack of raw horsepower, and it did make sure to knock Asus for releasing a machine with webcam drivers "on the way," but despite the rough edges, the wee 701 was deemed a great choice for the novice PC user or someone scouting a secondary machine. Notably, the Eee PC 701 isn't apt to make just anyone smile, but if you're interested in finding out if such a device would work for you, be sure and give the read link a bit of your time.
