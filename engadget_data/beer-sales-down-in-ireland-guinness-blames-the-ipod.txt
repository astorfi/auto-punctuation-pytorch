Sales of Guinness are down six percent in Ireland and the company's CEO knows exactly what's to blame: gadgets.
Rather than while away their hours in pubs, he says that young men have developed another perverse addiction, and are
spending their money on "electronic stuff such as iPods". Definitely good news for us and bad news for all the, uh,
beer weblogs.
