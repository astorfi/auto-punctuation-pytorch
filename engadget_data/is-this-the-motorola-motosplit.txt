Yeah, we want one -- it reminds us of the beloved Nokia 6820, although it's much thinner. We're told this thing is coming to AT&T in Q3, which makes sense; we've only pinned down three of Ma Bell's five planned Android devices, and this would be a nice higher-end compliment to the Backflip. We'll keep an eye out -- and you let us know if you hear anything good, okay?

Update: Yes, we know it's a render, sheesh. We have a bit of a history with Motorola and renders, you know.
