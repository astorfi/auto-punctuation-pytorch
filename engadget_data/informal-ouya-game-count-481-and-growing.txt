You can sometimes gauge a game console's short-term success based on its launch lineup; many of us know the pain of having to choose the least terrible game of a small bunch while we're waiting for a better selection. While we can't vouch for how the OUYA will fare for quality, Eddie at OUYA Forum has done the legwork to prove that there won't be any problems with the Android console's quantity. He's checked with both OUYA and developers to confirm that there are at least 481 games headed to the fledgling system, as of this writing. The clear majority of these are smaller indie titles that won't dampen Sony's enthusiasm for next week, but that's not necessarily a problem -- the abundance mostly hints that there could be a few gems for early adopters, even if there's a lot of fluff.
