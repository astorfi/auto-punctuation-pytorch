This here Circuit City inventory screenshot, however, has a ring of truth to it, and even unveils a pricetag in the process: $1299.99. Not bad for rumored specs that include a 12 megapixel Live View sensor, video recording, HDMI out and GPS. The price also includes that new 18-105mm VR lens, but there's no more info to be had at the moment. A little help, Nikon? We won't tell a soul, we swear.
