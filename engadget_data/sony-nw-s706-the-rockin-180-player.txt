Nevertheless, Sony has just released the new NW-S706, which comes in an elegant elliptical form factor along the lines of the NW-E series -- that said, it appears to be an update to the NW-S205. All we know so far, according to one British online retailer, is that the NW-S706 comes in three colors (purple, black and pink), packs 4GB of storage, up to 50 hours of battery life (probably only if you're bumping ATRAC), line-in recording, an FM tuner, and should be due out on October 9 for Â£180, or $336. We're still unsure if this is a Europe and Asia-only release, but nontheless, we'd love to be able to snag one of these Stateside real soon.[Via CNET Asia]
