Really, there isn't a whole lot here that we didn't already see in the keynote and up on their site, but it's definitely Mac mini sized in terms of footprint, and is a sexy little bugger. Click on for lots more pics!
      

 

The Apple rep who was showing us the iTV was quick to let us know that the unit was a prototype -- and we were quick to ask for the settings menu. And then we were quick to ask for the TV resolution sub-menu, which he put the kibosh on. "Sorry, we're not drilling down into the settings at this time." Boo, we say.
