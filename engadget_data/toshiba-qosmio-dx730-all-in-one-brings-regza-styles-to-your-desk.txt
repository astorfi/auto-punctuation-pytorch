The base model bears a rather lousy Pentium processor, but the range also includes Core i3 and i5 models, along with up to 6GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, a Blu-ray drive, TV tuner and Onkyo speakers. The multi-touch Full HD 23-inch panel also works in its favor. Pricing has yet to be announced, although Akihabara reports a similar bunch of models in Japan starting at a rather incredible Â¥120,000 ($1500). We'll have to rely on the Dell Vostro 360 to keep Toshiba's expected margins firmly in check.
