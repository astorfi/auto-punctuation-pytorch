We were wondering when they'd sign off a manufacturing deal: today
Quanta announced what could be one of their
biggest, most difficult, lowest-margin laptop manufacturing contracts they've ever landed â€” no, we're not talking about
Dell (though Quanta's done their machines for a while, as well as Apple, Compaq, Fujitsu, Gateway, HP, IBM, Sony,
Sharp, and Siemens laptops). We're talking about
Negroponte's and the MIT Media Labs'
OLPC $100 laptop for developing nations. Quanta, who
inked another deal with MIT earlier this year, says
they're aiming for a 5 - 15 million unit launch by Q4 2006 (aggressive, aren't we?), with a million or more units
destined for Argentina, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Nigeria, and Thailand. No word on whether this is an exclusive
manufacturing contract, but they are officially looking into a commercially developed version of the machine to
subsidize costs. (Remember, OLPC is a
non-profit.)
