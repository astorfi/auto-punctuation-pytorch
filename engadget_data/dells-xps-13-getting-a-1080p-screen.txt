 Dell's had a fairly minimal presence here at CES 2013 but it does have this bit of news to share: its XPS 13 Ultrabook is getting a 1080p screen later this month, according to a company spokesperson. In general, it's encouraging to see PC makers step it up on the resolution front, but it's particularly good news here, as the XPS 13's mediocre 1,366 x 768 screen was one of the few things we criticized in our review. Now that the weak display is getting taken care of and the trackpad drivers have been fine-tuned, that leaves just one lingering flaw: no SD card reader. Perhaps we can't have it all, but it does sound like this will be a stronger choice than it had been. No word yet on how much that upgrade will cost or when, exactly, it will become available, but we'll keep you posted.

 Update: Dell says the XPS 13 with a 1080p screen will start at $1,299, compared with $999 for the standard-res version. Further, Dell added that the 1,920 x 1,080 screen being used here also has an improved color gamut: 72 percent, up from 45 percent on the standard version.
