After snagging CBS exec Nancy Tellem and launching a Halo-based TV series with Steven Spielberg, Microsoft's Xbox Entertainment Studios appears to be tackling a whole new genre. According to Deadline Hollywood, the fledgling TV division will launch its first reality-TV series for Xbox Live based on street soccer called Every Street United. Eight 30-minute episodes will be produced featuring undiscovered talent playing four-on-four soccer across eight different countries. The idea is to have the top eight compete in a climactic final match during the World Cup, though final details are still up in the air. The show will reportedly target Xbox's sports-crazy demographic, though the choice seems a bold move for Microsoft -- which is clearly thinking outside the US box.
