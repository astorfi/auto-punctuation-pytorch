We're big fans of Nike's SportWatch GPS, but we do wish that the wearable would double as an activity tracker when we're not sprinting 'round the block. Polar seems to feel our pain, and has welded together an activity tracker and a GPS watch for its latest CES gadget. The Polar V800 has integrated GPS with multi-sport profiles that'll record your performance no matter what you're doing, as well as tracking your heart rate and even your altitude. The rechargeable battery offers 14 hours for training, 50 hours in low-power GPS mode and 30 days if you're using it as a watch. It'll be available in April for $450, or $500 if you want one with a heart rate monitor, too.
