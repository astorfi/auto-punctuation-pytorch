 
Here's a rather odd partnership: legendary rapper and producer Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, Chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M Records, have teamed up with cable, line conditioner, and accessory powerhouse Monster to market a pair of high-end, high-priced headphones. The so-called "Beats by Dr. Dre" were supposedly tuned by the former N.W.A. member and Death Row founder himself (along with a little help from 'Head Monster' Noel Lee), and boast "rich, deep bass" which promises to keep your head ringin'. Scheduled to ship this spring, these over-the-head cans will sport a $400 price tag -- you know, just so you can be sure that this is in fact a Monster product
