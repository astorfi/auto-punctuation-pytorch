The W9600 replaces last year's W7900, and, like its predecessor, the specs are pretty thin. We do know, however, that it uses Texas Instruments' WVGA chip for the projection, has a 5 megapixel cam, a completely beautiful touchscreen AMOLED display, and can project vids, pics, and even the phone's interface. We've always felt that projection phones are pretty toys but ultimately, we didn't see a really solid reason they existed when we first saw them, and we still don't with the W9600. That being said, this phone doesn't feel so much like a work in progress, the focus wheel, finish, branding and the rest make this feel a bit more like a real phone and less like a dummy phone. Of course, the whole point is moot as the Anycall-branded W9600 will likely never make its way to our pockets, let alone our carriers. But do feel free to wander the gallery and take in the sights.
