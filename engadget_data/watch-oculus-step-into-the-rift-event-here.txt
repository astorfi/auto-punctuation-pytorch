Oculus is holding a very special event today in San Francisco simply called "Step into the Rift," and it's presumed to be, at long last, the unveiling of the consumer version of its VR headset. There isn't much we know yet about what will happen, but we're assuming we'll at least get to see what the final consumer Rift will actually look like (perhaps like this?). We're also hoping to get more detailed specs, the names of some of the game titles at launch and, of course, pricing and a pre-order date. We'll be there live to cover the event, but if you want to get a taste of it too, check out the livestream embedded right here starting at around 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET today.
