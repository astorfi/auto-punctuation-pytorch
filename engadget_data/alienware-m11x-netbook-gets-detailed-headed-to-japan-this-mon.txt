A couple of newly leaked slides have now cleared up most of the remaining mystery, however, the biggest of which is that the system will apparently be available with either a Pentium SU4100 or Core 2 Duo SU7300 processor -- making the "netbook" term even more of a stretch than it was before. Curiously, the slides also show a target price of $899 (up from the $799 we heard at CES), and a ready-to-ship date of February 5th, which would seem to indicate that the "Spring" launch tossed around earlier may have been a bit cautious -- that latter detail is further backed up by a post on Dell Japan's website, which indicates that the laptop will be released in the country this month.
