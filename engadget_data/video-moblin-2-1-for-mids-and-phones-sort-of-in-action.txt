But while the devices remain somewhat uninteresting, Moblin itself has some terrific potential from what we've seen -- there's deep location and social networking integration with a unified contacts list that works a lot like Palm's Synergy, standard Linux apps can be easily ported over and run without any fuss, and manufacturers and developers can even ditch the standard UI and develop whatever they want on top. It's definitely cool stuff -- we just wish Intel had given us this demo on a compelling hardware instead of an older Menlow-based Compal MID, you know? Video after the break.
