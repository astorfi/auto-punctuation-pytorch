And while this has worked pretty well for us, we were excited to see this new tool on the FCC's site that shows a much prettier map and even more useful stats that try to predict the signal strength available at your house. We're not sure how accurate the "receive power" estimates are, but we're sure they are more useful than no data at all. So if you're trying to figure out if you need to make any changes to your antenna farm post-transition on the 12th, head on over and check it out.[Via The Digital Media Zone]
