Ask Engadget took the week off last Thursday, but it's back, this time with a question from reader Bennington P. who
wants to know,




Does anyone have any suggestions for a wearable display, headmounted or otherwise? Seems to be many out there, but
 does anyone have a first person experience they would care to share?



Even our straight up geeky selves have been a little reluctant to walk down the wearables path, anyone out there
have any advice?
