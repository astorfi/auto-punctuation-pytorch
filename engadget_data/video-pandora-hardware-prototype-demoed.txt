Actually, what we're looking at is a nearly complete prototype of the hardware, and though the unit is still admittedly in rough-around-the-edges prototype form, it's good to know the project is progressing (and should be welcome news for all those people that pre-ordered way back in October). Near the end of the video there's an epic struggle between the pint-sized console and the hands that would seek to enslave it. Trust us: you don't want to miss this one, guys.
