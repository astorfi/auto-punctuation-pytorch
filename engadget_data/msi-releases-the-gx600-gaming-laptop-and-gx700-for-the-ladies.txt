The black 15-incher is normally clocked at 2.1GHz, but hitting the 386-style Turbo button overclocks the Core 2 Duo to 2.6GHz. Apart from that, it's the usual Santa Rosa action: 800MHz bus, 802.11n, webcam, 512MB GeForce Go 8600M GT, and HDMI out. The GX600 also has some chintzy flame graphics, but they look positively half-hearted next to the GX700 MSI's also got at Computex: we saw this 17-incher back in January, but MSI has decided to throw a "feminine" mural on the lid. MSI's been experimenting with strange cases for a while, and we gotta say, it's not working for you, guys. Check the turbo button in action after the break.
