Days after AT&T appeased the masses by finally enabling 3G streaming over the iPhone's SlingPlayer app, Verizon Wireless has delivered some big gargantuan news of its own. Starting next month, all Verizon Wireless customers with smartphones (and an accompanying data plan) will be able to make and receive unlimited Skype-to-Skype voice calls to any user in the world over its 3G network, which is something that AT&T users have been able to do since last autumn. Let us repeat that: VZW, which is known historically as one of the most controlling carriers in this great nation, is opening up its 3G network for limitless Skype calling. The forthcoming Skype Mobile application will also support Skype Out calling, instant messaging between Skype users and an ability to "remain always connected... to see friends' online presence." Nine smartphones will be compatible at launch (the full list is after the break), and we're guessing that more will be added in due time. Giddy yet?
      

 

Initially, Skype mobile will be available on millions of best-selling Verizon Wireless 3G smartphones with data plans, including: BlackBerry Storm 9530 BlackBerry Storm2  BlackBerry Curve 8330  BlackBerry Curve 8530  BlackBerry Curve 8830 World Edition  BlackBerry Tour 9630  Motorola Droid  HTC Droid Eris  Motorola Devour
