Most of us flail wildly at a ball without any clue about what happens to it, then wonder why we don't get better. To help out, Zepp's 3D sports motion sensor is designed to put hard numbers to your golf, baseball or tennis swing by showing you (via an iOS or Android app) your swing's speed and contortions. We now know that you'll be able to grab one for $150 from Zepp now, or at Apple and Verizon on November 19th, though personally? We're kind of afraid to see exactly how bad we are.
