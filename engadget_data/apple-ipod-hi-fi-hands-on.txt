We'dheard this was coming, and it's caught our attention namely because it's Apple's first true foray into the iPodaccessories market, along with their new leather iPod cases. We did get agood listen in some of the rooms Apple set up on campus to demo the sound in a "real world" environment (ourfav was the teenager's space, replete with dirty laundry strewn about), and yup, it sounds pretty good. You know how wewish it was, well, a little less iPod-centric for being a regular old piece of consumer electronics and all, but hey,you know how they play the game. So how's the thing feel? Well, let's be straight up, the Hi-Fi is heavy. Like, way tooheavy to want to carry with you to the cabana or the beach, as they described you might despite its alternate six D-cellpower source.
