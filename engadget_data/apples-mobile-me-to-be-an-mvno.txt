So apparently this friend heads to the throne and our tipster snaps up the friend'sSamsung SGH-X497, pops off the battery, and grabs the given blurry shots of the Apple-branded SIM, which was apparentlystamped with:xx/50 Test Unit [digits written in sharpie]Apple ComputerInternal TestMM1.3.aOf course we've talked about an Apple MVNOsince what seems like the dawn of time, but between the blurry camphone shots and how well we know Apple for sendingout test units into the wild before a Stevenote goes down, well, we'll let you decide whether this thing is the realdeal.
