 What's a "premium" movie service these days without access on additional screens? Not much, which is probably why rumors indicate Showtime is about to follow EPIX HD and ESPN 3(no 60) by creating an online service for subscribers to view on their PCs and mobile devices. Don't expect to watch Weeds, Dexter and The Real L Word on your iPad just yet (except for what's already available on Netflix) as a spokeswoman had only a standard "nothing to announce to" offer Bloomberg Businessweek, but their sources indicate it will resemble the HBO GO service we tested out recently when it went live for Verizon FiOS TV customers. Heading online seems like a good followup to turning on interactive HDTV features, but we'll see if that's enough to keep viewers signing up for its service when there are so many alternatives available.
