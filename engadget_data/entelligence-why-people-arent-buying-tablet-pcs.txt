We're introducing a new weekly feature called Entelligence, where every Thursday Michael
Gartenberg of Jupiter Research is going to drop a little something in the way of gadget-related research data on us.
This week's factoid: Why Tablet PCs haven't been selling as well as expected.

While Tablet PCs have intrigued the marketplace, there's been a lot of speculation why they haven't sold better
commercially. Conventional wisdom would state that price is the leading issue but as usual, conventional wisdom is
wrong. A recent Jupiter Research survey shows only 32 percent of online consumers planning to purchase a laptop are not
willing to pay anything for Tablet PC functionality, indicating price is not the greatest adoption hurdle. The same
study shows that 61 percent of online consumers interested in using Tablet PCs prize traditional notebook functionality
in a Tablet PC. It's not that the tablet concept doesn't resonate with consumers, or the higher price. It's about
devices that don't live up to consumer expectations in many cases and an under-educated consumer marketplace.



 The question posed: "What features would you be interested in using on a Tablet PC (i.e. a notebook computer that
allows you to write on the screen as an alternative to using a keyboard and/or mouse? (Select all that
apply.)"
