 Earlier today AT&T announced the rebranding of its U-verse Live TV service, changing its name to Mobile TV. To go along with the name change, the carrier now offers direct account billing, enhanced picture quality over LTE and a slightly reduced price tag of $10 per month. In addition to Mobile TV's stock programming from ABC Mobile, Disney, ESPN Mobile and Fox News, customers can purchase one of three premium packages for an extra $5 per month. This trio of add-ons offers kid-friendly programming, content from BET or select Spanish-language networks. So, if it's your heart's desire to watch reruns of Keeping up with the Kardashians on your smartphone, Android and iOS users can download AT&T's Mobile TV app from their respective marketplace, while Windows Phone devices ship with the software pre-loaded.
