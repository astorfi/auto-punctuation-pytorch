Remember that big idea you had to develop a sneaky microphone
implanted in your tooth â€” well save it dreamer 'cause a patent was already filed with the US Patent office earlier this
month. Ok, technically it's not an implant since it's "clamped to a back tooth" but
still the device would
be ideal for noisy environments like battlefields (or
Steve Ballmer keynotes) where even throat or skull
clamped mics fail. This tooth-bone
conduction mic is toggled with the tongue and transmits the signal to a retransmit module worn by the user, thus
enabling two-way RF communication with others. More importantly, this will enable our Bluetooth headset wearin'
brethren to return to the dating scene.
