No offense, but we think the Secret Service might want to pick up the ECG Shirt for Dick Cheney, a t-shirt with two
built-in cardiac sensors that can keep track of your heart rate, and then if something catastrophic happens, can use a
Bluetooth to connect to a cellphone and automatically send off that data to a doctor or medical center. Just make sure
you let them know before you take the shirt off.
