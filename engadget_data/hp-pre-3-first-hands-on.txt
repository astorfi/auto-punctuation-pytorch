We're also still working on our shots of the Veer and the TouchPad, but sharp eyes can find both devices in the gallery below -- there might even be some iPhone and Nexus S comparison shots, but we don't want to give too much away.

Update: We just had a chance to play around with the Pre 3 at some length... and we have to say it feels good. The body of the device is sleek and solid, and the weight feels substantial in your hand. The screen is a relatively spacious 3.6-inches, and webOS looks absolutely stunning on it. The extra resolution is a big help on readability and clarity. The slider mechanism feels fairly solid, though there's a little give just at the end of it's movement that made us slightly concerned. Compared to previous devices, however, it seems far tighter. We're still messing around with the phone and will report back on what we find, but in terms of hardware quality, HP has taken a big step up here. As for the keyboard, it feels really fantastic. We realize this is very much a matter of personal preference, but we had zero problems typing quickly and accurately on the Pre 3 right from the get go.

Update 2: Hardware hands-on video after the break!

Update 3: More pics, including the Touchstone 2 dock.
