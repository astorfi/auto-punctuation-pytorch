You've mostly been out of luck if you've wanted to jailbreak iOS 7 so far; what options have existed have been incomplete at best. Cracking the code just got a lot easier, though, as evasi0n 7 has just arrived. The untethered jailbreak lets Mac and Windows users freely modify iOS 7 on any device that can run the software in the first place, including newer gadgets like the iPad Air and iPhone 5s. Just be prepared for a rough experience, at least with early versions. In addition to the usual risks associated with unofficial OS tweaks, Saurik (Jay Freeman) warns that he hasn't had a real chance to test Cydia's app distribution platform with the new evasi0n release; you're using it at your own risk. Still, those who just have to venture beyond Apple's prescribed boundaries can start downloading the jailbreak at the source link.
