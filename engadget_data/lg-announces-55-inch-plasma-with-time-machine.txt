Well, actually that's just a poorly-translated description of PVR functionality that will "pause, record and reply [sic] TV programs for two hours after the original broadcast." LG had previously announced a product line with PVR built in, but that series will include 1,080p capability. This display sports 768 lines of resolution, 2000:1 contrast, a 9-in-2 card reader, the usual range of connections including component and HDMI, and LG's XCanvas display control technology. No word on what happens when you hit 88 mph.[Via AVING]
