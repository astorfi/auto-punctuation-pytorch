 
Mixed in with the hoopla surrounding the MediaFLO-capable U620 yesterday came another gem: more details on the dual-hinge U710, which has apparently turned out to be the U740 (you say "po-tay-to," I say "po-tah-to"). Like the U620, the U740 is destined for Verizon and -- in theory, anyway -- offers the benefits of a full QWERTY layout while maintaining the usability and portability of a clamshell. Specs should include a 1.3 megapixel cam, microSD expansion, Bluetooth, and that all-important EV-DO radio, though we still don't have word on a drop date.
