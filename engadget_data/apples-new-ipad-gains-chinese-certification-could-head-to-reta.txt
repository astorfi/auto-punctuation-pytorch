  Apple's newest iPad could be making a trek over to the Orient very soon, if this latest regulatory filing is any indication. As recently as last week, China's Quality Certification Center granted that Cupertino slate -- bearing model number A1416 -- its seal of approval, paving the way for a retail debut in the region. If and when it does make it to official sales channels, expect that particular unit to be of the WiFi-only variety, as additional clearance is necessary for network-enabled variants. Despite an ongoing trademark scuffle over Chinese ownership of the iPad moniker, the company is expected to carry on with business as usual, adding to its near 70 percent domination of the tablet category in that region.
