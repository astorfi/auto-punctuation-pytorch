So let's get the comparisons out of the way: obvious volumetric differences aside, the maximum brightness versus the DSi seems to be slightly higher, and the stylus is inexplicably a handful of millimeters longer -- not a big deal, but you'll definitely figure it out when trying to stuff it into an older model. We're not really a fan of the top lid being glossy again -- we rather like the matte DSi lid, and this one seems even more fingerprint-coveting than its DS Lite predecessor. So with all that said, is the extra screen size worth it? Admittedly we do appreciate the extra room, and it comes without a cost to the picture clarity. The inherent tradeoff, however, is a complete inability to stuff this in our pockets -- we had better luck with the Mini 5, to be blunt. You'll be able to decide for yourself soon enough, but in the meantime, there's pictures below and video after the break!
