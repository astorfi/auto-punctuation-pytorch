  Sure, your iPad 2 has a camera, but that doesn't mean you should be using it to take pictures. One of the biggest point-and-shoot trends to pick up speed in 2012 is built-in WiFi, letting you capture higher quality stills and videos with your dedicated imaging device and transfer them directly to the web, or to a smartphone or tablet on the same WiFi network. The PowerShot ELPH 530 HS is Canon's latest pocket shooter to employ this feature, and the company had a few samples on hand at CP+ 2012 in Yokohama, Japan to demonstrate how it works.We took the 530 HS for a cordless spin, connecting the iPad to the camera's Ad-Hoc (point-to-point) network and launching the Canon CameraWindow app. After a few seconds (and quite a few taps on the 10-megapixel cam's 3.2-inch LCD), we had the two devices communicating, with a final click sending the image from the ELPH directly to the iPad's screen. That seconds-long connection delay may be inconsequential when transferring a day's worth of photos, but it's a slight inconvenience if you're only trying to transfer a single image. The camera also includes built-in Twitter and Facebook upload functionality, though, bypassing the Apple middleman entirely. The $349 ELPH 530 HS won't be shipping until April, at which point you may be refreshing your tablet as well. Jump past the break for a quick video demo.
