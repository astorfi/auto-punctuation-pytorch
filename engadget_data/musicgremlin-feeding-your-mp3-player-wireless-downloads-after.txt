So a company called MusicGremlin is working on software so that any MP3 player with built-in WiFi (all one of them
right now) can wirelessly download songs from an online music store. We're all for adding WiFi to MP3 players but
honestly, it sounds more like they're interested in giving the record industry what it wants rather than creating
something consumers will like (there's no file sharing allowed, and if you sign up for their subscription service
rather than their a la carte service all the music on your player disappears after you cancel your subscription). It
probably won't matter what they do anyway because sooner or later Apple will probably put WiFi into the next iPod so
that people can make those impulse purchases from the iTunes Music Store while they're on the go and that'll be what
gets everyone all hot and bothered. Anyway, they're talking to a few different manufacturers about getting the
MusicGremlin software on to players, but it probably won't be until really late this year or early next year that the
first ones show up.
