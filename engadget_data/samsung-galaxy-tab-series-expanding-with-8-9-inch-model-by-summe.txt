 Not much detail here kids, but the Korean Yonhap News Agency is reporting that Samsung has an 8.9-inch Android tablet due in the first half of the year. This, according to a Samsung company spokesman speaking to the reputable news site over the phone. Yonhap also notes local media reports claiming that the tablet could be for sale as early as next month. We first heard about Samsung's plans for 7-, 8-, and 10-inch tablets way back in June -- long before the 7-inch Galaxy Tab was announced. Now, with the 10.1-incher official, there's no reason to doubt an 8.9-inch Galaxy Tab by summer.
