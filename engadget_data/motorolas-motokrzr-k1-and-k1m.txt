The KRZR, as we very well know, is the latest in Moto's 4 LTTR DVCE NAME LINE, both models featuring a microSD, Screen3, and a thinned-wideness but slightly girthier body. The specs between sub-models do vary, however: GSM K1 has Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP, 176 x 220 display, and 2 megapixel camera; both K1ms will forgo the A2DP, but the CDMA / 1xRTT version has a QVGA display (and an accordingly larger battery), and a 2 megapixel camera, while the EV-DO K1m has that damned 176 x 220 display a 1.3 megapixel camera, as well as a millimeter added to its waistline. Despite the differences, though, all should be available in the second half of the year (you know, the half we're currently in) from, well, you know damned well who's gonna offer this phone.P.S. -From the looks of it, that device is running Moto's new Juix interface. We can't yet confirm this, but that'd certainly be a welcome addition to the otherwise predictable handset.  Read - MOTOKRZR K1 Read - MOTOKRZR K1m
