That's right, that shiny box which has had been subjected to the harshest criticism, the loudest praise, and a shortage of epic proportions, has finally made it's way in -- and out -- of stores on this launch day to end all launch days. We got a pretty dang good idea of how ugly things were going to get last night, but who could've predicted 12:01AM would be greeted by such violence? We've got ourselves an actual shooting (none of this BB nonsense), hospitalizations aplenty (due to the genius who lined up 300 people to make a run for the door in the pic above), an armed EB holdup that netted 5 PS3s for the thieves, pepper ball riot control and an escaped convict just to spice things up a bit. Plus, all these suckers missed last night's episode of The Office -- how dreadful! Jim and Pam fuhevah!Read - CT man shot outside Wal-Mart, suspects still on the loose. [Thanks to everyone who sent this in]Read - Armed robbers steal 5 PS3s from Ohio EB Games store. [Thanks to everyone who sent this in]Read - Riot breaks out at Circuit City. [Thanks, John C.]Read - Police use pepper balls to control crowd in Tyson, VA. [Thanks, Troutman]Read - Escaped rapist apprehended in Best Buy PS3 line. [Thanks, MrMarvey]Update: While not actually criminal, last night's award for cruel and unusual went to PC Gamer, who were on hand in SF to try to convince a card-carrying line-waiting PS3 fanboy to swear off Sony forever. In exchange for a $7,500 Falcon Northwest PC rig, dude had to sign a legally binding contract to not purchase or ever own a PS3, under pain of death paying back $7,500. Some guy named Neil, who'd been waiting for 40 hours, signed his life away -- pic after the break.
