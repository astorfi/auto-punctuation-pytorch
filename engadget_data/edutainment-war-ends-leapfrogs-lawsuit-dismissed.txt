 LeapFrog's patent lawsuit againstMattel over their Fisher-Price line of PowerTouch talking books was dismissed by a Delaware court today. LeapFrog cried foul in October 2003, noting the similarities ofFisher-Price's edutainment titles to their own successful line, but the judge didn't see it that way. Both partiesseemed amicable after the trial, with Mattel stating they have deep respect of intellectual property rights, since theydo have a few of their own. LeapFrog head Tom Kalinske merely stated the obvious: “Technology-based patentlitigation is very complex and challenging. Nonetheless, we will continue to defend our intellectual property rights inthe future.” Couldn't have said it better ourselves.
