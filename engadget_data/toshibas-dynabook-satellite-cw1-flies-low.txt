A base model kitted out with a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron M420 processor, 14.1-inch WXGA display,60GB disk, 512MB of RAM, ATI Radion Xpress 200M graphics, and dual-layer DVD burner will set you back, oh just $957 inJapan. Yeah, that kind of green will get you Core Duopower 'round these parts but that still constitutes affordable in the land of the rising sun. [Via Akihabara News]
