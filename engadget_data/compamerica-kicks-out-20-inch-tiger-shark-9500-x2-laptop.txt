While not directly dubbed as yet another "most powerful laptop on Earth," this behemoth packs quite a wallop, including an AMD Turion 64 X2 processor, WSXGA+ LCD, dual NVIDIA GeForce Go 7950 GTX or Quadro FX 2500M SLI graphics sets, 512MB to 2GB of DDR3 RAM, up to 120GB SATA hard drive, a built-in 1.3-megapixel webcam, optional TV tuner, and a dual-layer DVD burner. Additionally, you'll find a 7-in-1 flash card reader, gigabit Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g, full sized keyboard with number pad, four speaker sound system (including a "subwoofer"), front panel audio controls, DVI / S-Video / composite outs, FireWire, serial port, audio output, and five USB 2.0 ports to round things out. This 15-pound machine starts out around $3,399, but you can tweak this bad boy 'til your credit card cries uncle if you so desire.[Via CompAmerica]
