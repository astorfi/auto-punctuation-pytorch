 We already peeped Sony’s Blu-ray packin’Vaio at the Tokyo Anime Fair last month. Now, Sony comes clean with some general specs around their new Vaio RC300series machines. The line-up will feature Pentium D dual-core CPUs, S-ATA drives supporting RAID for mirroring that 2TBof supported storage, PCI Express x16 graphics, and advanced DDR memory. Yeah, these are positioned rightfully, ashigh-end Media Center Edition 2005 PCs sporting Sony's Giga Pocket and RC Digital Studio apps to view, schedule, andmanage your recordings. No doubt, it’ll be a few months before thesedrop, but after yesterday’s Fujitsu Blu-rayDeskpower TX95 announcement, we guess Sony had to get official right quick like. [Thanks, Himanshu]
