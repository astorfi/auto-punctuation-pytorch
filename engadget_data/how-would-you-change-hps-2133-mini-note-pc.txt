As soon as HP's order page went live, however, we began to hear grumblings like "Where's my option for XP?," and "I'm stuck with a VIA?" Nevertheless, reviewers found an awful lot to love about HP's first foray into the land of bargain-priced wee lappies, but we know the critical sect is out there keeping 'em honest. Now that the machines have been shipping for over a fortnight, we're interested to hear from you early adopters. Is it everything you hoped it would be? How on earth could the next model be improved upon? The floor is yours.
