Just when we thought Chinese tech news has died down ahead of China's National Day on October 1st, a seemingly reliable HTC leak from there just had to ruin the fun. According to Weiphone, these are apparently the screens of the Butterfly 2, a new flagship device that's been rumored to carry a larger 5.2-inch 1080p display, a quad-core Snapdragon 800 SoC, an UltraPixel camera and BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers. Like the Windows Phone-powered 8XT, this alleged Butterfly 2 disguises its bottom speaker as a short black bar in between the Android soft keys, and it also utilizes a similar two-tone color scheme -- for its front side, at least. ePrice reported earlier that the new phone could be waterproof-certified at IPX7 or above, but we won't find out until January 2014 the earliest. One more shot after the break.
