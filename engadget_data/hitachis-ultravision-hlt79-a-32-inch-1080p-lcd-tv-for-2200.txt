 Remember that mega-spec'd and rock-bottom priced 42-inch hunk-o-plasma Hitachi announced earlier this month? Consider it a trend 'cause Hitachi is now saying that they'll be pushing out four new 1080p LCD displays with 120Hz refresh and their Black Frame Insertion picture enhancement technology for less than $3000. Yeah, that ain't no typo -- p as in progressive for less than the five-large similarly sized sets pull today. The Ultravision HLT79 family will spawn a $2200, 32-incher and $2700, 37-inch model while the HLX99 Director's series will offer some additional features and image tuning in the $2500, 32-incher and $3000, 37-inch panel. All models are expected to ship in November, just in time for the holidays. With prices in freefall, the argument over whether you can see any difference between 1080i and 1080p (or even 720p) in sets this small just doesn't seem to matter anymore, eh? And yeah, that 32-incher ensures Hitachi's rule as the world's smallest 1080p display.
