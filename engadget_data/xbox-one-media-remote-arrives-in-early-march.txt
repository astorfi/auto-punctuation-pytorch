That didn't take long. Scarcely a week after the Xbox One Media Remote briefly surfaced at a Canadian retailer, Microsoft has made it official. As expected, the peripheral lets you navigate videos more elegantly than with the bundled gamepad. However, it's not just a cheap substitute for a mobile device using SmartGlass. If you have your Kinect plugged in, the remote will also steer the power and volume of your TV or receiver. That consolidated control may help justify buying the peripheral for $25 when it ships in March -- especially if you're the sort who's more likely to watch Netflix than play Forza.
