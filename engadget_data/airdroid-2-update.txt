 If you're an Android user with a pressing need to transfer files from your phone to your computer (and vice versa), there's a good chance you've heard of AirDroid. The remote access tool, which has been widely available on the Play Store for ages, has finally received an update that makes it even more useful. First, a primer: AirDroid gives you the ability to access all of the files on your phone -- APKs, music, photos, videos and plenty more -- directly in a web app on your browser, which offers an Android-like user interface. You can view or download videos, pull up your contact lists and even send and receive messages, just as if you were using the phone itself.

 Version 2.0, which has been in the works for several months, adds even more useful functionality. The update now gives you the ability to access your phone with a cellular data connection, whereas WiFi was the only option previously. It also throws in a "Find my Phone" feature, a remote wipe and a camera option that will let you see your phone's front or rear camera views -- as well as snap pictures remotely and store them directly on your computer -- without activating the display (a very useful feature in case your prized possession gets stolen). It also supports incoming call notifications, as well as the opportunity to initiate outgoing ones. Not bad for a free (ad-supported) app, so head to the link below to check it out.
