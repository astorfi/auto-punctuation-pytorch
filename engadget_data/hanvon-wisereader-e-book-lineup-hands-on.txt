They're pretty basic in both the design and functionality departments, with support for text, images, and audio in the usual array of formats -- including DRM'ed EPUBs. The N518 and N526 models both have touchscreens, though you'll need to use a stylus for handwriting and note-taking. Other than that, there wasn't really much of note, though we were told that there's a capacitive version in the works but it wasn't quite ready to bring out of their labs in Taiwan just yet. There's always next year.
