In order to further this mad mission the company's introduced something called the Cable Box Mini. It's a cable box, and presumably it's smaller than some other cable box. To be quite honest, we prefer this idea to more complex cable management systems: rather than run your cables through trays, or organize them with velcro wraps, you still make the same mess -- except this time the mess ends up in a box.
