Then you may want to keep an eye out for one of these new "limited edition" bottles of CK One or CK Be, which each come paired with an "MP3 speaker" that appears to be a speaker first and an MP3 player not at all. No word on any technical specifications, as you might have guessed, though those are details probably best left unsaid. $50 and it's yours starting next month.[Via SlipperyBrick]
