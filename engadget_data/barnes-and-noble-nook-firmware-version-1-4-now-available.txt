Version 1.4 includes a couple of pretty important fixes -- including the much-need "go to page" feature, an extra large font size, and support for AT&T WiFi. That's right, the next time you wander into an AT&T hotspot you'll be Nooking for free. The Nook firmware version 1.4 update is available now (and we've included a direct link to the download below if you really want to check that out).
