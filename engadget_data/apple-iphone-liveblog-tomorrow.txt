Apple's making some huge changes to iOS this year, so what are the chances that the iPhone will undergo a similar transition? Based on what we've been hearing, the likelihood is pretty high; Tim Cook, Sir Jony Ive and the rest of the crew may show off not one but two new iPhone models for the very first time. We're expecting to see both a 5S and a colorful 5C, but we're still in the dark on when they'll arrive, how much they cost and where they'll be available. There's always potential for a top-secret product nobody was anticipating, too. Regardless of what interests you the most, bookmark this page and return tomorrow at the time listed below as we keep you updated on the play-by-play!
