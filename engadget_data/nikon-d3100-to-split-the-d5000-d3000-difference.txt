 We'd obviously take this one with a grain (or two) of salt, but Nikon Rumors has it that Nikon's fixing to give entry level DSLR buyers yet another option in the not-too-distant future. Of course, with the planet's largest photo show coming up in just a few months (Photokina, if you're curious), it's about time that some of these rumors start to pick up traction. Truth be told, this isn't the first time we've heard of the D3100 -- a few months ago it was being bandied about as the D4000. Word on the street has it that the shooter will boast a 10 megapixel CMOS sensor, a dozen autofocus points and a fixed LCD on the rear (read: no swivel). But that's just the beginning; the D3100 will purportedly boast 1080p and 720p movie modes, and each will support continuous autofocus while filming. Yeah, you read that right -- continuous autofocus in video mode. That's a killer feature that we've been begging for ever since the D90 became a reality, and while we'll probably want to swap out the stock 18-55mm lens for something with a bit more flexibility, we couldn't be happier to hear of these features hitting Nikon's range. Look forward to a price and release "in a few weeks." We are.
