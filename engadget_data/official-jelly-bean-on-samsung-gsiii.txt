It's not the first time we've seen it in some official form, but playing with the handset on display at Vodafone's IFA booth certainly made the inevitability of the upgrade all that much more real. Using the handset next to one running ICS, the differences in the buttery smoothness weren't too apparent, though the OS certainly felt quick. Video evidence after the break.

 Update: We also spotted the Titanium Grey iteration at T-Mobile's stand. Check the gallery below.
