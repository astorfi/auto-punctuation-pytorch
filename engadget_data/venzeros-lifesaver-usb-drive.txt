 Venzero's trio of digital audio players still aren't even shipping yet but the company's already expanding its product line-up, now also taking pre-orders for its boldly-named LifeSaver USB drive. While not candy-colored, the 8GB Microdrive promises to live up to its name by including backup software and a "mobile desktop" on the drive, which'll let you access your files and run programs like Skype or Firefox on any Windows PC without having to install anything (ala U3). Unlike its other devices, Venzero's only providing the Euro price for the LifeSaver: â‚¬149, or about $190. Guess we'll just have to wait and see if it gets a price drop similar to Venzero's LilOne when it hits stateside next month.
