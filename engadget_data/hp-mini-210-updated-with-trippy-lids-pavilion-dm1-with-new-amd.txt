While the Mini 210 was just released at CES, the 10-inch netbook will be available starting June 15th for a couple extra bucks -- $355 to be exact -- with some "fashionable" new lids. We definitely prefer the "crystal white" to "preppy pink" covering, but both use a pretty cool in-mold layering technique -- when you look closely at the lid and matching underside there's a 3D-like effect where some colors and shades appear above or below others. HP's also expanding its netbook line with the Mini 110, which at $280 buys you a six-cell battery and standard Atom parts. The netbooks don't get any internal updates -- nope, all the new performance parts go to the 11.6-inch Pavilion dm1. Though it still sports the same chassis as the Mini 311, the dm1 will grab AMD's newest Turion II Neo dual core and Athlon Neo processors, which promise improved performance and battery life over the previous generation. We're hoping that's the case, because our experience with those chips haven't exactly been peaches and cream. That's all we got for you, but if you are in a pink mood head on down below for some hands-on pics, or after the break for the sort of "Pretty in Pink" we don't mind rocking.
