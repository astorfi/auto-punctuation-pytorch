Apparently not content to let Sprint's Galaxy S II, Epic 4G Touch hold on to the crown for unnecessarily wordy titles, Magenta is reportedly launching Samsung's T699 as the Galaxy S Blaze Q. Yep. If you've stopped giggling, you'll be glad to know TmoNews' leaked photos and details at least hint at a serious QWERTY slider attached to the silly name. The Android 4.0 hardware should be a slightly detuned Galaxy S III, with the familiar 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 and 720p display being tempered by a more restrained 1GB of RAM and a 5-megapixel back camera. As long as a store layout document proves accurate, we'll have the choice of snagging a Blaze Q at T-Mobile on August 15th... assuming the store clerk doesn't get tongue-tied first.
