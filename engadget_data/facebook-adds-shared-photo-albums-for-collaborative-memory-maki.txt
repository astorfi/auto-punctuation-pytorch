Google+ may not be the premier destination for photo sharing, but its devotees know just how wonderful Party Mode's collaborative albums are. Facebook is bringing a little bit of that magic to its much more popular platform through shared photo albums. The feature, which was built during a company hackathon, allows up to 50 people to contribute to a single album and upload up to 200 pictures each. To ensure that the albums don't become a chaotic mess, only the creator can alter the privacy settings of the album (public, friends of contributors and contributors only) and only he or she can modify or delete photos at will. Contributors will only be able to edit the images they themselves have uploaded. The tool is still very much in the early stages of development, and creators Bob Baldwin and Fred Zhao are already planning for the future. The upload cap of 200 pictures will likely be lifted, the duo told Mashable, and soon the ability to create shared albums should be coming to mobile (for the time being, you can only contribute to an existing shared album). Currently, shared albums are rolling out to a small test group of English-language users, before moving to broader availability and eventually crossing language barriers.
