 If you're looking for a nav unit that has a dash of everything and no major digs (aside from the price), the Garmin n端vi 360 just might do the trick. Although the n端vi lineup has been a tad expensive from the get-go, it packs a lot of desirable traits into a portable package, and PC Mag has slapped their Editor's Choice tag on Garmin's latest unit. While not drastically different than the well-received n端vi 350, the 360 was given a pat on the back for the inclusion of Bluetooth and the ability to double as a speakerphone. While the built-in maps, excellent 3.5-inch LCD screen, intuitive GUI features, and pocket-sized design were briefly praised, the bulk of the critique was spent on the most noticeable upgrade. Reviewers raved over the ability to call a restaurant or landmark via Bluetooth with just the press of an on-screen button, and felt that the the only shortfall in the wireless integration was the slightly poor voice quality while speaking from a distance. Adding even more pizazz, the n端vi 360 switches from navigating to a caller ID screen when it detects an incoming call so you can see if potentially veering off course is worth burning those precious peak minutes. Aside from a few minor software nuisances, PC Mag couldn't find any reason to dislike the NAV, and although this isn't the cheapest tour guide on the block at about $900, the Bluetooth integration on an already solid unit could make for some pretty happy campers.
