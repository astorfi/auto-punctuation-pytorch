 Just thirty days after the first local HD newscast in Tampa Florida, WFLA announces they too will make the switch. Starting with today's edition of the 5 o'clock news, HD fans will have a choice in HD news in the greater Tampa Bay area (#12 market in the US). WFTS was the first station in the area to go HD, but their pre-recorded segments and live on-location news is still upconverted. WFLA is expected to have about the same mix of SD and HD in their newscast, but we can certainly see where a little friendly competition could be a good thing for HD fans wanting to get as much HD as they can. The real question is, how long will the remaining two local broadcast news stations take to make the switch?
