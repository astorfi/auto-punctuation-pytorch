Americans won't necessarily have to track down a Titanfall bundle (or move to Europe) to get a free game when they buy an Xbox One. Microsoft has announced that some US retailers will start including free digital copies of Forza Motorsport 5 with the console as of next week, offering gamers a flagship game no matter what system they get. However, the Forza deal will only be available for a "limited time." We've reached out for a clearer time frame, but it's safe to say that you'll want to hurry if you're a racing fan. Don't fret too much if you miss out, though. Microsoft's willingness to give away major titles so early in the Xbox One's life cycle suggests that this is the start of a trend -- it may launch similar offers in the future to help fend off some very fierce competition.
