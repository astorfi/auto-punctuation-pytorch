We have no way to authenticate the claim but whatever we've got here is sporting a Dell logo on a Pre-esque handset running Android somewhere in China -- the country where Dell is expected to launch a new phone before the end of the year. A scenario that matches the Dell smartphone rumors to a tee. [Thanks, LesterW]
