TI's DLP unit promised us brighter, sharper pico projectors when it unveiled its Tilt & Roll Pixel architecture at CES, and it now has the TRP-based silicon to make those projectors possible. The company's new DLP Pico 0.2" TRP chipset produces images with up to twice the brightness and resolution of its ancestor, even while it uses as little as half the power. The company hasn't named hardware partners, but it notes that companies are already building products with the chip; it may not be long before we see the next generation of projector-equipped smartphones and tablets.

The result is bright, detailed images with a life-like quality, making DLP Pico the ultimate means of sharing life's experiences, anytime and anywhere."We believe that through the creativity and passion of our customers, the 0.2" TRP chipset will set a completely new benchmark for big picture experiences from mobile devices," said Frank Moizio, business unit manager of DLP Pico. "We expect their pioneering products to create the most compelling and unique displays, transforming the value of mobile experiences."Beyond traditional mobile electronics, DLP Pico is finding applications in emerging technologies like the growing wearables market. As with many wearable devices, the design of near-eye displays presents a unique design challenge, requiring a critical balance of both style and performance. In this arena, DLP Pico excels, as described by Paul Travers, CEO of Vuzix:"Given the aggressive power and brightness needs of our see-through near-eye display products, the new DLP Pico chipset is a perfect fit," said Travers. "The combination of unmatched power savings and high contrast lets us deliver consumers longer battery life while creating a brighter, more vibrant image than we would be able to achieve with any other technology."
