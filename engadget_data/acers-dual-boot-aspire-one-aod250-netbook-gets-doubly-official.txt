Of course, this one's about as standard as it gets once you move beyond its dual OS nature, including an 10.1-inch WSVGA screen, Atom N280 processor, 1GB of RAM, a 160GB hard drive, and a six-cell battery. You can get it in your choice of four different colors though, and the $349.99 list price is certainly right for anyone looking for an easy way to jump into Android.
