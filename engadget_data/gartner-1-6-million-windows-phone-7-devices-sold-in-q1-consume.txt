That means Redmond partners sold more Windows Mobile devices in the first three months of 2011 than ones bearing the sparkling new operating system. Guess now we know what LG meant when it said the Windows Phone launch didn't meet expectations. Gartner sees these numbers as evidencing a failure "to grow in consumer preference" by WP7's launch devices, though it predicts better things ahead, with Nokia's participation helping to accelerate the platform's momentum.

Update: ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley prodded Microsoft about these figures, but got neither a confirmation nor a denial. The fact Redmond didn't bother to at least dispute Gartner's stats seems to lend them an added sliver of credibility.
