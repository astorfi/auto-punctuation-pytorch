By now, KURO black levels and contrast are so well established that not much ink needs to be spilled over them, except to say that the ninth generation 6020FD bested the reigning champ Elite PRO-150FD, but the review does a good job of finding nits to pick. Most notably, infinitely tweakable parameters like color temperature and sharpening are missing; we're guessing these are design choices made to leave room for the Pioneer Elite models. We have to wonder, though, how many high-end plasma shoppers (at $5500, are there any other kind?) will be willing to give up full calibration capability.
