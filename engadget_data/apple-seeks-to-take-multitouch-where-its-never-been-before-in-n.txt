This go 'round, the Cupertino powerhouse has filed a lengthy document that spells out its plans to revolutionize the multitouch game by creating a solution that recognizes both palms and all ten fingers. According to the filing, such a system could provide "unprecedented integration of typing, resting, pointing, scrolling, 3D manipulation, and handwriting into a versatile, ergonomic computer input device," and when we hear things like "computer input device," we think of precisely one thing. Of course, the oft-rumored Apple tablet has been spinning for what feels like ages now, and we've definitely seen countless applications from the company that have yet to lead to any meaningful developments. Still, a multitouch surface that recognizes all ten digits simultaneously? Slap that on a Palm IIIc and we'd still be interested.
