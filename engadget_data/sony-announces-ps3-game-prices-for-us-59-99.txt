Sony is matching Microsoft's main Xbox 360 pricepoint at a "mere" $59.99, with all 7 games now available for pre-order at the Sony Style online store. Sure, we wouldn't have complained if Sony somehow decided to undercut MS on next-gen game prices, but we suppose that's wishful thinking at this point. Ah well, there's always the Wii, right?[Via SlashGear; thanks Rohit K.]
