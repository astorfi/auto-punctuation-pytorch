As far as the app goes, Box is keeping things relatively simple -- much like on iOS and Android -- but adding a few tweaks to fit nicely alongside that Metro UI, including tidbits like pinning tiles to the Start screen for viewing updates on files. Of course, you'll also be able to manage your content straight from the application, as well as locking any docs with a passcode in case "paranoia" is your middle name. Notably, Box knows it'll have to compete directly with Microsoft's own SkyDrive, to which Chris Yeh, VP of Platforms, says his company "will be watching carefully to see if SkyDrive gets the better integration" of the two. Regardless, folks can download the Box app now from the WP Marketplace, and best of all, it won't cost you a single dime.
