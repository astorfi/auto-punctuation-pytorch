Be that as it may, the unassuming flip is still on a very, very short list of CDMA Nokias sold in the US, which in itself makes it sorta interesting -- and your hard-earned $49.99 on contract after $50 rebate is going to nab you Bluetooth, a color external display, VZ Navigator support, and Xpress-on changeable covers (when's the last time you owned an Xpress-on Nokia, eh?). It'll be available for order from Verizon's site, telesales, and stores starting Friday, with all sales channels opening the floodgates come January 23 of next year.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
