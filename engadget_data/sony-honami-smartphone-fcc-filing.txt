In the past, Sony hasn't been too strict about issuing confidentiality requests when slipping its Xperia smartphones into the FCC's database. The Honami, however, is no typical Xperia. For those unaware, manufacturers generally submit equipment to the FCC for testing shortly before the product is ready to launch on US shores -- once its radios are cleared for use on the airwaves that the FCC controls, precious little stands between said product and your hands.


We've seen a stream of Honami leaks over the past few weeks, but none have indicated quite so clearly that it's nearly ready for a formal debut. The filing masks all internal and external photos, but a software version entitled "s_atp_honami_1_25_1" (seen after the break) makes obvious what device we're looking at. This, Motorola's X, and an impending iPhone refresh? Looks like we're in for a star-studded autumn in the handset universe.
