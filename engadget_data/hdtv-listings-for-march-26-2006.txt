 Whatwe're watching: No new Grey's Anatomy? Nooooo. Where will we get our soapoperatic exploits of doctors in 720p? Until General Hospital upgrades to HD and ER becomes the show that it was 10years ago, nowhere would be the appropriate answer. In it's stead we will accept warmed over episodes ofCSI (after watching The Evidence, we appreciate this show much more) and Pistons vs. Nets on ESPN. I went to a couplePistons games this week and after several overpriced beers experienced considerable compression issues and artifacting,real life isn't all it's made out to be.I haven't seen tonight's episode of Rides before, where four teams of designers take a crackat the Chevy HHR, so that will get at least a look as well.Our traditional high-def listings continuebelow.
