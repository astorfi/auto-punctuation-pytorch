The TomTom GO910 heads the GO series, and sports a 4-inch widescreen touchscreen, Bluetooth, MP3 playback off of the 20GB harddrive, and extensive iPod integration. Sounds like most of the features function well and as advertised. There's quickand easy rerouting, clear directions which even include street names read aloud via text-to-speech, and an easy to useremote for those backstreet drivers. The only problem the reviewer had with navigation was an outdated POI databasethat guided him to a stadium which had been torn down five years prior. The Bluetooth connection offers up traffic andother information over your phone's wireless Internet connection, though, while the phone does have maps for Europe,the US, and Canada, there's no live traffic info for the US yet. The other main caveat with the player is the price. At$799 you probably afford to pay a man to dress up as a princess and drive you to wherever you need to be, but we're notsure if he would take as kindly to an iPod connector cable.[Thanks, Bob]
