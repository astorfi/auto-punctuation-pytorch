 Hannover might not be as famous as Hamburg (Beatles), Berlin (politics) or Frankfurt (erm, meat-based cuisine), but for one week in March, it's home to one of the world's biggest tech events. Unlike our jaunts to MWC and CES, we're never quite sure what weird and wonderful things we're likely to find at this Teutonic tradeshow, but we'll be sure to bring you something new and exciting. Even better, thanks to some corrupted Michel Thomas Method MP3s, we'll be getting by with what remains of our high school German, a nice smile and a heck of a lot of pointing -- so wish us luck.
