  With both its 1D and 5D-series models already confirmed for 2012, today's Canon teaser hints at something slightly different -- and, according to our sources, a major announcement. The event is set for April 15th -- during the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) show in Las Vegas -- further confirming that whatever imaging device we'll see will likely be geared towards the motion picture and television communities. So, what could it be? A new Cinema EOS cam with a 1D form-factor? A lower-priced model poised to compete with the RED Scarlet? We have but a month to wait for confirmation, so if you haven't already placed your C300 order, it might not be a bad idea to hang tight until after Canon's Tax Day reveal.
