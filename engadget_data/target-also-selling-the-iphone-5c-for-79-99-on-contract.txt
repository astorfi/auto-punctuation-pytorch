We've already seen Walmart undercut Apple by selling the iPhone 5c for less than the MSRP right out of the gate, but it turns out it's not the only retailer offering a deal. Target's also selling the 16GB version for $79.99 on a two-year contract from your choice of carrier, offering a savings of $20. You'll still pay the same $199.99 for the 32GB model, though, and there's no similar discount to be found on the iPhone 5s, either (Walmart has knocked it down ten bucks to $189). You'll find that price in store tomorrow, or you can get your pre-order in on Target's website now.
