The company introduced updates to its low-end 2x5 series, including the 265T, 265WT and 275T. The models include lifetime traffic alerts via NAVTEQ Traffic, Bluetooth connectivity, and are offered in 3.5-inch or 4.3-inch touchscreen iterations. Garmin also updated its higher-end 7x5 lineup, bringing the 755T, 765T, and 775T into the mix. The devices sport 4.3-inch touchscreens, those same NAVTEQ Traffic updates, 3D transparent building views, accelerated graphics rendering, and HotFix (which stores "critical satellite information"). No word yet on release date or pricing for the new models, though we expect to see them on display at IFA.[Thanks, Tim]Read - Garmin Expands Affordable nüvi 2x5 Series, Offering Hands-Free Calling and Lifetime Traffic AlertsRead - Garmin Introduces nüvi 7x5 Series with Lane Assist, Giving Drivers a Clear Picture of the Road Ahead
