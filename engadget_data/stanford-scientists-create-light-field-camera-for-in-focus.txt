Some Stanford computer scientists have created a camera that allows pictures taken with a wide open aperture to
still focus on every depth of field, allowing for brighter and faster, but still in-focus, photos. The "light field
camera" uses a microlens array that sits between the main lens and the CCD, and holds 90,000 miniature lenses which
separate the light before it hits the sensor. Software then manipulates this "expanded light field" to determine where
the light rays would have landed if the camera had been focused at different depths. The result is an image where each
subject has been digitally refocused. If this all sounds very confusing, it is, but the point of it all is for better
images, especially in demanding situations such as science or security surveillance, so don't worry if this little
feature doesn't start popping up in your local Best Buy's camera lineup anytime soon.
