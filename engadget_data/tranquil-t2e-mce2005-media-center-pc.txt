Tranquil PC (a UK outfit) has a new Media Center PC called the
the T2e MCE2005 that runs on
Windows XP Media
Center Edition 2005, uses a low power VIA 1.2 GHz CPU, Serial ATA hard drives, and has a heat pipe system (similar
to what Shuttle uses in their XPCs) to create a quiet home theater PC that can sit next to your TV without driving you
nuts with obnoxious whirring fans. The T2e also has optical audio out, a slot loading DVD drive, a GeForce 128MB FX5200
graphics card, and comes with 512MB of DDR266 RAM.
