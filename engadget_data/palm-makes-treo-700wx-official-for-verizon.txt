The Treo 700wx rights the 700w's wrongs with an extra 32MB of memory for a grand total of 64MB; otherwise, though, the device is all but identical to its older sibling, with Windows Mobile 6 sadly nowhere in sight. Get it now while it's hot at Verizon stores or online for a stiff $399 on 2-year contract after $100 rebate.
