A Huawei exec has posted this image and the one after the break on Weibo (a Chinese social network) with a caption that says: "My new toy. Do you like this color?" Since the company's expected to launch a smartwatch at Mobile World Congress, it's easy to assume that this is the device in question, but we'll know for sure in a few days.

By the way, these images were taken using a mysterious Glory X1 device, which could be the MediaPad X1 7.0, the watch itself or something entirely new. Despite these pictures, it might still be worth checking back for Huawei's smartwatch next week. After all, this baby blue bracelet could just be an early prototype... or a high-tech toy from a cereal box.
