  Invasion of the One S chassis snatchers? That certainly seems to be the case here, as a render and listing for the T328w -- what is supposedly HTC's Wind -- has popped up over on Chinese site, Tenaa. The dual-SIM 4-inch handset, sporting an uncanny resemblance to its mid-tier look-alike, will purportedly occupy a lower rung on the smartphone scale, toting a single-core 1GHz CPU, 512MB RAM, a rear 5 megapixel shooter and WCDMA bands with support for HSDPA and HSUPA. From that list of internals alone, the unit sounds more like a dressed-up, specced-down One V, albeit without that idiosyncratic lip. On the software side, we're looking at Ice Cream Sandwich smothered in Sense 4a -- presumably, a localized variant of the OEM's newest UX. With a global rollout for the One line slated for this spring, our friends to the East could be seeing this device breeze its way onto retail shelves sooner than later.Update: If you think the T328w looks familiar, your instincts are justified. It's a member of the Dragon series -- a trio of handsets from HTC that we first rubbed up against during Mobile World Congress.
