 Oh yeah, we're mildly excited that LG Display should be able to start cranking out product from its 8G LCD plant earlier than expected, but the real kicker here is the outfit's outlook on OLED. Merely two days after hearing that Samsung was hoping to dish out affordable medium-to-large OLED displays in 2009 / 2010, we're now getting word that LG Display is looking to offer up a 32-incher the year after. And we're talking "volume production," no less. Makes holding off on that XEL-1 that much easier, doesn't it? Nah, we didn't really think so.  [Via OLED-Info]
