 Fox has been slow to show its hand concerning the Avatar home video release schedule, but that didn't stop director James Cameron from spilling assorted dates and SKUs in a Wall Street Journal interview. He's pegged a standard DVD & Blu-ray release for April 22, with a special edition DVD and Blu-ray 3D version arriving in November. Considering how much electronics companies have invested in bringing 3D to market this year and specifically Panasonic's push to make Avatar a box office smash the timing seems right on target. Whether you love the Na'vi just a little or far, far too much, budgeting for a 3D related Black Friday upgrade to go along with blue body paint for Halloween is seeming like a more sensible option every day.

Update: Fox has responded, simply stating that 3D is in the conceptual stage, and that Avatar will not be out on Blu-ray 3D in November. Should we believe them or the guy with an executive producer credit on Point Break... is that even a question?
