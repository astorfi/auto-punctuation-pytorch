On March 26th, the Senate Judiciary Committee plans to examine the deal's effects on the average consumer -- specifically focusing on its impact on market competition and TV and internet pricing. "The merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable touches on important policy questions bout how Americans access these valuable services," Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy wrote in a statement. "It also presents a critical moment to discuss net neutrality principals that have allowed the internet to remain an open marketplace for ideas." Although the hearing probably won't affect the merger directly, it's possible the discussion could lead to legislative changes further down the road.
