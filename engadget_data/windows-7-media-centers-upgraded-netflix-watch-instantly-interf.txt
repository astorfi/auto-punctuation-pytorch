Clicking it revealed a slightly smoother install process than the initial Netflix upgrade for Vista users last spring, then it's off to the refreshed interface we first spotted at CEDIA -- extender support or HD streaming is still out. Also updated is the out-of-beta internet TV sliding under the TV tab (new from beta 2: Adobe Flash video support and region locking) with a wide assortment of streaming video available, though the picture quality still leaves something to be desired.
