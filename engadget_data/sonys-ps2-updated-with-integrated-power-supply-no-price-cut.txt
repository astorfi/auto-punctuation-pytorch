The SCPH-90000 with integrated power adapter hits Japan on November 22nd for ¥16,000 or about $140 -- that's the same price as the SCPH-79000 model already available. Besides that internal power supply, we're not seeing anything new. ¥1,500 (about $13) will buy you the optional vertical stand. Hurting for gaming profits are we Sony? Oh, right.
