Ranging from 2.9- to 4.5-millimeters thick, the new LED-backlit TFT display manages a 1280x 800 WXGA resolution and 300cd/m2 brightness, packed into a light 183-gram design. TMD, a joint venture between twoJapanese electronics giants, says that the display is already in production, although there is no mention of anyspecific products that will see the new tech, nor any info on when these presumed products would hit stores.[Via Akihabara News]
