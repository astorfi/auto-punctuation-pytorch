Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan isn't happy that free speech rights thwarted his desires to block Twitter and silence corruption allegations, so he's switching to plan B: accuse Twitter of shady dealings. He's now promising to "go after" the social network for tax evasion, and has implied that other internet-based peers like Facebook and YouTube might be breaking local laws. We've reached out to Twitter for its response, but we wouldn't expect the company to take Erdogan's charge lightly.
 
For now, it's difficult to tell whether or not the claims will amount to more than just talk. There isn't an official case against Twitter at this stage. Also, Erdogan's views don't always mesh with those of Turkey's judges -- he believes the Constitutional Court is conducting "interference in politics" by upholding freedom of expression. When the politician has had success in banning YouTube, though, we wouldn't be quick to rule anything out.
