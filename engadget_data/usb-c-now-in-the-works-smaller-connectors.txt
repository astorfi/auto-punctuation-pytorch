In order to squeeze the ultra-fast 10Gbps USB 3.1 standard into the next gen of slim devices, the USB 3.0 Promoter group has just announced the USB Type-C connector. It'll be similar in size to existing USB 2.0 Micro-B connectors, while bringing USB 3.1 speeds and other distinct advantages over current cables. For starters, the new design will be reversible like Apple's Lightning ports, meaning at long last you won't have to worry about which end goes up. In addition, Type-C will bring scalable power charging and the ability to support future USB standards. The downside is that it won't be compatible with existing connectors, but if we don't have to do the flippy dance to insert a phone cable anymore, we'll take that trade-off in a New York minute.
