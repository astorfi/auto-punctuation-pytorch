 A solid four months after first seeing thing plastered across half of Las Vegas, Motorola's i1 finally has a date with Sprint. The planet's first Android-equipped smartphone with Nextel Direct Connect will go nationwide on July 25th (via telesales and websites; all other Sprint channels will see it on August 8th), bringing military spec ruggedness, push-to-talk capabilities and a certain ability to withstand all sorts of death grips. Unfortunately, Android 1.5 is a bit of a dinosaur at this point, but it's still a heck of a lot better than that G'zOne Rock you're currently toting. Get ready -- you've got just under a week to scrounge up $149.99 and the nerve to sign another two-year contract.
