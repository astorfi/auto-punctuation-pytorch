Tech and IT blogger Greg Hughes posted that
he picked up a Dodge Ram truck that's fitted with U-Connect, Crysler's Bluetooth goodie bag that's all a geek could ask
for. He notes that the setup was a breeze, and he can now take calls over his car stereo or use voice recognition to
call mom. The stereo system is completely integrated, with microphones in the rear-view mirror.
