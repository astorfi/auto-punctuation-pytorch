So far there's no date for when we might see this software, but Todd Rutherford,Microsoft's program manager for eHome Control, says it's a sure thing. We guess it depends on your style if you'll usethis thing as a glorified remote control, or as a primary viewing device, but at least now it'll do you a lot more goodthan just some oddly shaped Frisbee with a touchscreen.
