Unusual for Apple rumors, this event has pretty much all the analysts and so-called insiders in sync with their predictions. Mass disillusion or divine soothsaying, we don't know. Certainly everyone's been expecting this to be a big quarter for product transitions. While we wait, we figured you might as well get up to speed on all the predictions for Wednesday's big show:

iPod Touch with flash-memory, WiFi and OS X-based Cover Flow user interface 
iPod nano "phatty"
Wireless iTunes store sales for iPhone and wireless iPod(s) 
(PRODUCT) Red iPod shuffle 
iTunes ringtone service
Beatles on iTunes -- yes, again

While not necessarily rumored for Wednesday, there's always a chance that we'll hear a bit more about Apple's automotive collaborations with Volkswagen and Jaguar. Just sayin's all.
