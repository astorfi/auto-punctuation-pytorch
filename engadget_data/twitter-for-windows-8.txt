 Thanks to Twitter's API changes that cut off the number of users for third party efforts, official app support has become more important and now there's one built for Windows 8. Available in the Windows Store now in 22 languages, it brings the Home / Connect / Discover / Me tabs found in other official apps, plus support for Windows new UI features like snap view, the search charm and Live Tiles. Support for the share charm means you can tweet from any Windows 8 app by swiping from the right edge, which also provides access to search. Windows Phone 8 users should recognize much of the design from the recently updated mobile app, especially in the minimized snap view. 
 Despite the inclusion of social networking feeds in the People Hub, a dedicated app should make accessing the service much easier, although Twitter's design has left quite a bit of blank space to work with. Hit the Windows Store link below to load it up on your x86 or ARM Windows-powered device and let us know how it's working for you, or check out the video demo embedded after the break.

But nowhere else can you scroll through Discover stories horizontally. Smoothly move through a collage of Tweets, pictures, links and article previews that make the most of your device.

   - The Share charm makes it easier to tweet links, pictures and opinions to your followers from anywhere in Windows 8. Reading an article in Internet Explorer about Hawaii? Swipe in from the right edge of the device, tap the Share charm, add your comments in the Tweet and hit send.
