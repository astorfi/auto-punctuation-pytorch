It incorporates a few features you normally don't find on projectors in this price range, such as a standard $30 projector bulb for cheaper replacement costs, component inputs. a 600:1 contrast ratio, and 1,000 lumens of light output. While its native resolution is 854 x 480 (great for DVDs and standard def content, not so much for high-definition), the low cost of bulbs and overall price puts it right into that sweet spot for the holiday buying season. Of course it's no 1080p Sony Pearl, but for five hundred a piece, you could buy four of them for less than half the price of the Sony, and matrix those bad boys up for over 18 diagonal feet of screen![Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
