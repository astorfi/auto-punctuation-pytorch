 Oh, go ahead and throw out that DLP bulb that burned out early, whydon't you. Mitsubishi might make that expensive bulb obsolete by developing the first rear-projection television that uses a laser as its primary lightsource.According to the company, the laser can be split into red, blue and green colors in a way thatprovides up to 1.8 times more color variety than current LCDs in a package no deeper than current RPTVs in theMitsubishi line, which is about 26-centimeters. Actually, you'll need that bulb for another two years, so go dig it outof the trash; the company figures it will take a solid two years before the manufacturing process is cost feasible.We're OK with the wait; it gives them time to figure out how to split off some of the blue portion of the laser forbuilt-in next-gen DVD integration, right?
