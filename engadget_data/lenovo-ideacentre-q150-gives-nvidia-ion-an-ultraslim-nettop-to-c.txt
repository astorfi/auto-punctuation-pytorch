The successor to Lenovo's IdeaCentre Q110, the Q150 is built around a pair of Intel Atom options -- the single-core D410 or dual-core D510, both running at 1.6GHz -- and will come with Windows 7 Home (Basic or Premium) preloaded, built-in WiFi, a quartet of USB 2.0 ports, and an HDMI output should you pick up the Ion option. The wireless Multimedia Remote with Keyboard is also optional, but Lenovo seems to rightly expect you to want one in order to match the stylishness of the machine. The starting price for this little beaut is listed at $249, with availability by the end of June, but expect to pay quite a bit more for the fully outfitted option above. One more intimate pic of the Q150 awaits after the break.
