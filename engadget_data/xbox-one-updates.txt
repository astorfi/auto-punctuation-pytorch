Remember those new Xbox One features Microsoft announced at Gamescom this week? They're available right now -- at least to members who are part of the company's preview program. Major Nelson just announced that Xbox Live users that have access to preview updates will be able to download the new features today. This includes the updated Friends section announced earlier this week as well as SmartGlass TV streaming, the system's new boot to TV mode and the long awaited Media Player app. The announcement also revealed a host of previously unannounced updates, including tweaks to the Party app and Xbox One's GameDVR.



For the most part, the new features are about getting organized: the Party app has been retooled to give specified "party leaders" more control over the group and the entire interface has been tweaked for clarity. The GameDVR allows users to select and delete multiple files at once, too -- which should make it easier to keep your console's hard drive clean. Finally, the update will reorganize a few sections of the Xbox One's settings menu and bring "Xbox On" voice functionality to Australia, French Canada, Italy, Spain, Brazil and Mexico. All in all, not a bad set of updates. Not part of the preview program? Don't worry, the update will roll out to you (and the rest of the community) in the coming months. In the meantime, you can check out a quick walkthrough of the upcoming Media Player below.
