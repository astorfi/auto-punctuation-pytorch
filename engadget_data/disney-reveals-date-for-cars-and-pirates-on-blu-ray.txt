       As long as Disney has been supporting Blu-ray, fans everywhere have wondered; where is Cars and Pirates of the Caribbean? Many have even doubted Disney's commitment to the format as a result. There were rumors that Disney was only waiting for the whole BDJ mess to get worked out, either way the wait is over. Well it's almost over and at least we have dates for both Pirates movies and Cars. The Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead Man's chest will both be timed with the theatrical release of the 3rd Pirates movie on May 22nd, Cars will follow shortly after on June 5th. This is good news for fans, but unfortunately no other details are available.
