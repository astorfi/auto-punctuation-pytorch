Sony's response has been to acknowledge there's a problem in the vaguest of terms -- "We're aware certain functions of PlayStation Network are down" -- and to promise an update on the situation as soon as it's available. Alas, that statement was issued over nine hours ago and there's still no word of either a rectification or an explanation for the outage. The error code provided by the console is, as you can see above, somewhat uninformative as well. So come on, Sony, what is going on with your Network?

Update: PSN is acknowledging on its EU blog that the network outage may be a result of "the possibility of targeted behaviour by an outside party." Still no ETA for when services will be restored.

Update 2: PSN is now reporting that the network may be offline for "a full day or two."

Update 3: As of midday on Friday (US Eastern Time), an issue that began on Wednesday night is still being worked. Thanks, Farres!
