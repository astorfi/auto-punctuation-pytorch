Just in case you've seen that web page floating around implicating Dell in some wacked out government
conspiracy by suggesting they fit a 4mb keylogger between the keyboard end of some guy's 600m and the Ethernet adapter,
we'd like to point out a few key bits, having been inside a Dell laptop or forty.




Dell laptop keyboards plug directly into the motherboard with a ribbon cable




He was inside to replace a broken PCMCIA slot riser on the motherboard? Uh, that's a guaranteed next-day mobo
  replacement on a "almost brand new Dell 600m"—not that you could, but why bother even if you knew how
  and had spare laptop motherboard parts?




We've never seen a zip-tied circuit board in professionally assembled machine




That device is far too massive to fit under the mobo of a Dell laptop




Awful blurry picture of where it's at in the machine!




Sorry dude, but we're calling major, major BS on this. Anyone care to prove us wrong and open up a huge can of civil
rights violations?


Update: Looks like the hoaxster pulled the images from
here. [Thanks, scim]
