No huge shocker that we're finally seeing the much-discussed and long awaited new version of RIM's business-friendly tablet -- though the slate did leak out a bit earlier than expected. Canadian Review claims to have gotten confirmation device ahead of today's keynote. The new PlayBook is said to be rocking a 1.5Ghz dual-core processor and NFC. From the outside though, it should be difficult to distinguish the old from the new.
