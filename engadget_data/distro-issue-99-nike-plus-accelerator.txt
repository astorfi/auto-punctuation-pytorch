Back in March, 10 companies descended upon the Nike+ Accelerator in Portland, Oregon, with the aim of building devices that would integrate with the athletic outfit's line of fitness gadgetry. In a brand new issue of our weekly, we step inside said venue after three months for a glimpse at Nike's formula for fueling the quantified self. Eyes-On takes a look at a quite dapper Ricoh point-and-shoot, Hands-On fondles Nokia's latest Lumia and IRL offers up another pair of our daily items. So pull up a comfy chair and grab a cup of tea, because the latest issue is here for your end of the week perusal.
