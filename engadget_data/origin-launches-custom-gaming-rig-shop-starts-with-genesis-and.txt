Looks as if we'll soon find out, as Origin has just launched itself into the mix with a pair of new rigs catering to those with specific (and pricey) demands. Poised to take on the likes of Falcon Northwest, this boutique outfit has ushered itself into the sector with the new Genesis desktop and EON18 laptop. The former gets going at $1,699, and if we're reading this right, Origin allows buyers to select "any chassis on the market, any color and design" and pretty much any other hardware they can dream of. The lappie is an 18.4-inch beast with a 1080p panel, limitless color and design options, twin GeForce GTX 280M GPUs, 8GB of RAM, a trio of HDDs, dual-layer Blu-ray burner and a starting tag of $2,599. So, who's up for celebrating the real end of the recession?
