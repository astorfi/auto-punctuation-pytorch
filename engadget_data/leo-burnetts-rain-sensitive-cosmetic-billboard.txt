The Leo Burnett agency, a graphical genius of sorts, has its latest breakthrough concept plastered on a Max Factor cosmetic billboard. The pictured woman sports finely groomed eyelashes when kept dry, but rainy weather creates black runs akin to real life scenarios to presumably suggest that ladies should make haste in picking up the run-resistant flavor of makeup. So if you're trying to focus on important things like pedestrians and oncoming traffic while cruising through a torrential downpour, just make sure to not point and stare too awfully long.[Via Core77]
