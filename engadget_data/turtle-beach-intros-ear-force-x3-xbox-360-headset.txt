You'll also get a "dynamic talkback expander" feature to automatically adjust incoming Xbox Live chat levels during loud gaming moments, along with features like automatic shut-off, bass boost, and a stereo expander to provide a "wider sound field." Of course, while they're designed for the Xbox 360, you can also simply use them as a standard pair of headphones with any other device. Look for these to start shipping early next month with a retail price of $99.95.
