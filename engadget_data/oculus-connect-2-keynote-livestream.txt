Can't make it to Hollywood for Oculus' second virtual reality conference, Oculus Connect 2? Fret not -- the Facebook-owned VR company will be livestreaming the event's opening keynote on Twitch. But better yet, because this is Oculus after all, there's also going to be a stream in virtual reality, which you can check out if you have one of Samsung's Gear VR headsets. The keynote, led by Oculus VR CEO Brendan Iribe, starts at 1PM ET today. To enjoy the 360-degree immersive experience, you'll need to download the NextVR app on your headset, otherwise we have a 2D way for you to watch the keynote right here.
