 Food is an undoubtedly essential part of life -- and, in a rather digital age, some could certainly make the same argument about app updates, right? Well, combining the best of both worlds, today Evernote released a refreshed version of its Evernote Food application on iOS, making it more accessible for hungry users to book a reservation through OpenTable's system and adding some social tidbits that'll let foodies share their recipes by way of email, Facebook or Twitter. Syncing features were also added in v2.1, which will allow any recipe saved on Evernote to seamlessly show up in the My Cookbook portion of the app. While you go and try out the slightly revamped Evernote Food, we're going to keep perfecting our fish tacos recipe -- and maybe we'll even share once we deem it good enough for a Bobby Flay throwdown. Just maybe.
