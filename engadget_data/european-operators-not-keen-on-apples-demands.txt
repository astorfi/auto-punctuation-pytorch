 Ah, the plot thickens. Just days ago we got wind that Apple could be facing a few hurdles in the European market, and considering that operators are now referring to the company as "unbelievably arrogant," we'd say the two have some serious issues to work through. According to Avi Greengart, a principal analyst at Current Analysis, Apple is making demands that "simply cannot be justified no matter how hot the product is," but failed to note exactly what these were. Interestingly, it was even noted that several carriers felt adamant that "they would never offer the iPhone." C'mon, who are these guys kidding -- somebody will end up bending to Apple's demands if it means offering up the oh-so-coveted handset. At least, we sure hope so for you folks across the pond.[Via MacRumors]
