 
Update 'em all! That's Toshiba's laptop motto here at CES. Along with the A and M series, Toshiba's plugged its Qosmio X505 with the latest Intel Core i7-2630QM and Core i5-2410M processors. The powerhouse multimedia laptop is still just that, and in fact, its NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460M graphics with 1.5GB DDR5 discrete graphics memory can support NVIDIA's 3DTV Play, which lets you output 3D content or games over HDMI to your living room's 3D display. Other than that the X505 still has all the high end features you'd ever want in a 18.4-inch chassis, including a 1920 x 1080-resolution display, Harman/Kardon speakers, HD webcam, and a Blu-ray drive. The rig will be available in the coming months for $1300 to $1900 -- hit the break for one more picture.
