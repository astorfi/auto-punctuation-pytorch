Haven't had a chance to fire up one of our old iPAQs and test this out first-hand, but a company called StyleTap has
announced a new emulator called StyleTap Platform that'll let you run Palm OS apps on your Pocket PC. They claim that
the software is compatible with thousand of different applications written for Palm OS 5.2 and earlier, and that you
don't have to run programs in a separate emulation windowâ€”supposedly they'll show up as native programs on your Pocket
PC and you can use them just like you use Windows Mobile apps (that includes being able to cut and paste text back and
forth, too). No support for Bluetooth, at least not yet.
