We've heard rumors of this, but now seems they're true:
Prada has released a toolkit in a deep chocolate leather
sleeve (we're going to head over and try to get some shots this weekend). That's all. It's not an
ice-cube tray. It's just a toolkit. But it's a
Prada toolkit.Â  And at $700 US, it will probably cost you more than just buying a new one of whatever it
is you're trying to fix.
