Here's a last-minute gem from CeBIT — a video camera controlled by the eyes. We've seen stuff like this years ago
with eye-scanning viewfinders that track focal points, but this working prototype developed at Munich's
Ludwig-Maximilians University does full camera movement. It is expected to have applications for psychology and market
research — not to mention the obvious fashion uptake we can expect from it.
