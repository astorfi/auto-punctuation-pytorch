       If you're waiting for the manufacturers of value priced gear to enter the Blu-ray arena, your day is coming. Funai, the company associated with brands Sylvania, Emerson and Magnavox officially announced that it will begin production of its NB500 series of players in Q1 2008 with the intent to bring them to the North American market during Q2. The NB500 will be a Profile 1.1 number, with HDMI 1.3a, DeepColor, a "high-bit-rate audio stream out," CEC and output of SD card video footage. The press release is calling for a retail price under $300, but with the recent price cuts seen in the market, we're thinking that Funai will have to come in at substantially less than that figure to stand out.
