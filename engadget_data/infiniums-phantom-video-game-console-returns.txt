The good news is that Infinium Labs isn't suing anyone (again) for talking trash about the PC-based video game
console they're supposedly coming out with (and which was
originally supposed to be out today!), the bad news is
that they're up to their old tricks again, with some an announcement yesterday about how they've partnered up with
Limelight Networks for a deal to distribute games online. Fine, we'll give them the benefit of the doubt, but it's time
for a little less talk and a little more rock, you know what we mean?
