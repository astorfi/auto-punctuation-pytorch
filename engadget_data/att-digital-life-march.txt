 
 AT&T's mobile-friendly Digital Life home monitoring system has been brewing for nearly a year. At last, it's ready to roll: the service is now expected to launch in eight markets as of this March. While we're still waiting on prices, the company is already dividing its offering up into packages. Those worried about break-ins can get a video package with live video from inside and outside the home. There's also bundles that can control doors, manage energy-based devices or even check for water leaks. The carrier is adamant that Digital Life is a go-between service, not a component of its regular network -- we won't need to have AT&T cellphone or broadband access, and it should work with Android, iOS and Windows platforms. The service is a gamble in a crowded field, but AT&T is betting that its telecom savviness will carry the day over the traditionalists.
