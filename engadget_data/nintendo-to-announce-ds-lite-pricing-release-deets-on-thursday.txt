Our hot sister blog Joystiq is reporting that a recent 1UPpodcast revealed both the May 4th announcement as well as the actual pricing/launch info, but the latter deets werebleeped out in order to conform with pesky embargoes and non-disclosure agreements. You can be sure that we'll be onhigh alert later this week to bring you all the info as soon as it's available, and remember, the sooner you startstanding in line for your new DS, the sooner we can post amusing pics of people suffering for theirhobby.[Via Joystiq]
