When we last saw the Huawei Honor, it claimed to have a single-core 1.4GHz processor, a 4-inch FWVGA (854x480) capacitive screen, and a radio primed for European and Asian bands. The official word? It's got all of that, but it's also packing an 8 megapixel rear facing camera (2MP up front), 512MB of RAM (with 4GB ROM memory, and expandable up to 32GB) and a hefty 1900mAh battery. The Gingerbread powered handset is a hair thicker than we expected as well, measuring in at 10.9mm at its thinnest point. What else is new? Oh, just a handful of new frequencies, including GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 /1900 and the WCDMA/HSPA+ 900 / AWS / 2100 bands (compatible with T-Mobile's US 3G). No word on price just yet, but the DLNA-certified powerhouse should be hitting Asia-Pacific, China, Russia, and the Middle East in "Classic Black" the fourth quarter, with more colors (and hopefully, regions) dropping sometime during the Christmas season. Want the full PR and official spec list? Skip on past the break.

Powered by a 1,900 MAh battery, Honor frees consumers from the inconvenience of searching for an electricity source, allowing them to share and connect for up to three days1 on a single charge – the longest battery life among smartphones in the 4-inch screen range. With a 1.4 GHz processor, an 8-megapixel HDR2-enabled camera and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera, Honor is a powerhouse in a sleek 10.9 mm-thin body and weighs just 140g. 		"Huawei Honor encapsulates the Huawei brand – it features simple-to-use, advanced technology that allows people to share and connect easily. Honor provides a package of features that elevates the smartphone user experience, including an ultra-long battery life, so critical to the performance of smartphones but yet is often downplayed," said Victor Xu, chief marketing officer of Huawei Device. "Consumers now have a high-performing smartphone that lets them communicate, connect, entertain and share content for an extended period of time without compromising on looks, technology or style." 		Honor comes with an exclusive Huawei user interface which is easier to customize and manage, as well as a dynamic weather widget. Honor also features a Gyroscope which enables a better gaming experience. The smartphone is DLNA-certified which ensures interoperability with other DLNA-certified devices such as digital cameras, game consoles and TVs. This makes it easier for consumers to share their digital photos, music and videos between different DLNA-certified devices. The DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) is a non-profit organization with more than 250 member companies in the mobile, consumer electronics, PC, and service provider industries. According to ABI Research data, as of 2010, more than 440 million DLNA-certified devices have been installed in homes. 		Honor will be commercially available in "Classic Black" in Asia-Pacific, China, Russia and the Middle East in Q4, 2011. Honor will be released in more colors closer to the Christmas holidays.
