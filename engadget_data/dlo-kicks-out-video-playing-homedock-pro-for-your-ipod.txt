While DLO hasn't skimped on the amount of iPod-compatible goodies it's pumped out, the HomeDock Pro steps it up a notch by allowing you to navigate your music, playlist, and video menus right on your television, and they also include a 18-button remote to keep you seated while scrolling through your shows. Aside from docking / charging your Appleicious PMP, the device also sports "discrete on / off," standby mode, and a diagnostic mode in case things go awry. Unfortunately there's no pricing information to speak of just yet, but this one ought to hit store shelves here before too long.[Via iLounge]
