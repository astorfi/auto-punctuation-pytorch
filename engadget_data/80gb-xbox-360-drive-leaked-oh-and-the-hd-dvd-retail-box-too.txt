Looks like at least one Xbox 360 was outfitted with a larger-than-normal drive at one of Microsoft's two fall HD download / update / launches event this evening (that'd be SF and NY). Which is good because if when Xbox Live Video goes, um, live on November 22nd and there isn't a larger drive, we have a feeling certain Microsoft customers (namely us) will start rioting and looting Redmond. Ok, maybe not -- but seriously, of all the rumors to track closely, how much longer do we have to keep watching for a freaking bigger hard drive? Oh, and click on for the HD DVD retail box -- this Plaid Ninja guy got it all.[Thanks, Dean]
