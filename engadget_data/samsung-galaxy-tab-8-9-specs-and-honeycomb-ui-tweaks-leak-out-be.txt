We snuck onto the show floor this afternoon, and while we didn't find the actual tablet, there was a serious amount of Galaxy Tab 8.9 signage. We couldn't get a close look at the placards, but the guys at PocketNow had better luck. Not only does the 8.9-inch display have a 1280x800-resolution, but the tablet itself is said to be incredibly thin -- it measures just .33-inches thick and weighs 1.03 pounds. It also looks like the 8.9 will be the first Honeycomb tablet with some noticeable interface customizations -- one of the signs showed a new "Live Panel" and a "Mini App" tray. All that certainly makes this one a bit more interesting -- we're assuming we will be hearing all the official details at Samsung's press conference tomorrow, so stay tuned!
