This will be an especially attractive model to Windows Mobile 5.0 device owners, who have recently been able to cut the headphone cord thanks to the folks over at xda-developers, but still need a cassette adapter or FM transmitter dongle for listening in their cars. Little else is known about the specs on this unit, but the "phone" button would indicate that it can also route calls through your speakers, so it may include an embedded mic as well. We saw the DEH-P810 online for about $660, but the price was in yen, so we're pretty sure you're gonna need to import for now.
