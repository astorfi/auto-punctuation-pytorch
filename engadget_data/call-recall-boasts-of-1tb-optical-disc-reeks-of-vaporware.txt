The latest from the company -- which still seems to believe that no pictures are necessary to substantiate its claims -- is the "industry's first 1TB optical disc." This device has reportedly been developed and tested behind closed doors, and unsurprisingly relies on its own 2-Photon-3D technology. Additionally, the company purports that it is "entering into product design and discussion with leading manufacturing partners," so we ought to see something coming down the pike relatively soon if all of this is legit.[Via PCLaunches]
