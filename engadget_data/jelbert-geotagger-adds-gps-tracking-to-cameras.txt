The less-than-sleek contraption most conveniently attaches to the hot shoe of any SLR / DSLR, but can supposedly be used with any manual focus cam in some form or another; depressing the shutter button triggers the stamping action, which saves the GPS information (including your current direction) to a dedicated SD card that can be merged with your photos using third-party software (such as RoboGEO). So if you're looking for some precision tagging to go along with your pointing and shooting -- and don't mind the, um, unpolished look -- the GeoTagger can be picked up now for Â£149 ($284).[Via The Raw Feed]
