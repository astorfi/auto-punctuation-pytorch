 Whichever way you slice him -- cold, calculating genius, or harmless, lovable fuzzball -- Steve Jobs is nothing if not a total Apple fanboy. In fact, he's so into his own dogfood, that he's sharing the love with every single employee of Apple by handing out free 2G iPod shuffles to all. Everybody from corporate on down to retail is getting their very own $79 mini-mini-DAP to have and hold, as Stevie J. recently revealed via a company-wide email. Apple gave away free copies of the original iPod shuffle as well, back in the day, and employees can expect the new version in the mail by the end of the month.[Thanks, Caleb W.]
