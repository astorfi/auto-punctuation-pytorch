As of this moment, Everex's CE1200V is up on NewEgg's site, but is still sporting a "deactivated item" status. Nevertheless, Packard Bell's XS20-006 (as it's so eloquently dubbed across the pond) is currently for sale at PC World for Â£349.99 ($686). And yeah, there's a number of unboxing shots pleading for your attention in the link below, so what exactly are you waiting for?[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]Read - PC World's XS20-006 listingRead - CloudBook unboxing
