 The FCC isgearing up for one of their spectrum auctions that always get the big telecoms in a tizzy. This new auction is for theairwaves currently being used to hit planes with incredibly expensive phone service. Verizon is the culprit there, butthey'd like to get in on this new auction to be able to offer broadband to planes, which sounds good to us, thoughbased on their phone charges, internet might cost more than the flight itself. And then, of course, there is thequestion of Skype usage, and once somebody does it everybody isgoing to be reaching for their cellphones, and we'll end up with one big noisy 747. Well, we've got until May 10th forthe auction, and about a year after that for the services to get set up, so we'll try to get some traveling in soon andenjoy the sound of crying babies while we still can.
