 Sony rolled out its first head-mounted 3D visor last fall, and announced the HMZ-T2 followup recently at IFA 2012. Now in Japan it has revealed few more details about the changes it's made this time around as well as a release date and pricing. Scheduled to hit shelves on October 13th, the HMZ-T2 features all the upgrades we'd heard about: lighter total weight, redesigned head strap for improved comfort, ear buds instead of headphones plus 24p cinema support and a "Clear" panel drive mode for fast moving content. While we still don't have a US price the Japanese damage is 70,000 yen ($894), a 10,000 yen ($127) boost over last year's model which cost $799 in the US. Sony Japan has also put together an "Institute for Immersive Pleasure" Facebook page , and plans to show it off again at the Tokyo Game Show. Check out our hands-on impressions from IFA here, we'll let you know when there's more release information for other regions.
