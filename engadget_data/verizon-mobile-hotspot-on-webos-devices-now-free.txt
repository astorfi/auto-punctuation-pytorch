For some, this alone could be reason enough to take the plunge and become a webOS user, we'd wager. Here's Verizon's official statement on the matter: "Customers who purchase or upgrade to a Palm Pre and Palm Pixi will get the Mobile Hotspot for free. Existing customers who already have the service will find charges on their next bill will be $0.00."
Add that in to the fact that the Pre Plus is now $49.99 and the Pixi Plus is now $29.99, both with buy-one-get-one-free deals tacked on, and yeah... what do you want to bet there are some wide smiles over in Sunnyvale this morning?

Note: This isn't an April Fool's joke -- try pricing a Pre Plus on Verizon's site and add the Mobile Hotspot feature at checkout.
