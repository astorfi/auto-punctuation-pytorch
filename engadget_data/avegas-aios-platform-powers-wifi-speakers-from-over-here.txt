Avega was showing off Aios-powered WiFi speakers at the CES Unveiled event last night, capable of receiving multi-channel audio (stereo up to 7.1 surround) blasted through the ether by your WiFi compliant device. Avega is supplying the technology that powers the concept -- both hardware and software -- to manufacturing partners and expect to see products at retail this June ranging from the consumer-level $250 to the audiophilic $10,000.
