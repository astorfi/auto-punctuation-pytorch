The Attorney General of New York and District Attorney of San Francisco are teaming up with police and government groups to cut down on smartphone-related muggings. George Gasc√≥n (SF) and Eric Schneiderman (NY) will announce "Save our Smartphones" at a summit in New York later today, after meeting with representatives from Apple, Google, Samsung and Microsoft. The scheme aims to introduce a universal "kill switch," similar to iOS 7's Activation Lock, that'll render stolen phones worthless across all makes and models -- preventing this sort of thing from becoming a hazard of modern living.
