 It's no secret that Microsoft is anxious to get copy / paste functionality rolled out to Windows Phone 7 users on the double. In his CES keynote last night, Steve Ballmer himself said that it'd be coming soon -- but a little hint on Microsoft's site indicates that it might be coming as soon as this month: the URL Microsoft is using for the update's details page includes "january-update.aspx" in it, which we'd say is pretty telling. Of course, launch dates inevitably slip, and perennial Microsoft guru Paul Thurrott thinks it's tracking for early February before it'll actually reach users' devices... so we wouldn't go canceling vacations you've got scheduled this month just so you can be around to score the update as soon as it's available.
