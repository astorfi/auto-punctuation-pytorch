   We already got some brief hands-on time with this Gingerbread-sporting PMP at IFA, where it went by the name of "Walkman Mobile Entertainment Player." Now it's just been announced as the Sony Walkman Z, which rolls off the tongue a whole lot easier. Beneath that 4.3-inch WVGA display lurks a 1GHz Tegra 2, 802.11 b/g/n WiFi and a battery rated for 20 hours of music and 5 hours of video. There's HDMI out as well as Sony's Throw feature for pushing media wirelessly to a Bravia TV. Pricing remains "open" apparently, but Sony does commit to availability in Japan from December 10th. You'll get a choice of 16, 32 or 64GB models in either red/black or black/blue, or you can wait for a limited edition white version in early 2012. If you're planning on sending it our way, Sony, then you should know we'll be utterly broke by then.  [Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
