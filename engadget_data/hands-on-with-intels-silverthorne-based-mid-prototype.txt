We've got to say, Intel should just bring this thing to market right now. While the UI wasn't up and running, just holding the thing, and checking out the demo shots of the interface was enough to give us big chills. It's thin, it's light, and we have to say, pretty darn fresh. If they keep up with this kind of work, we're fully prepared to be blown away in the future. Of note: the rep here claimed that the company now has even smaller and thinner versions of this thing in prototype -- though they don't seem to be at CES, and he kept reiterating that the prototype I was handling was slated for a 2009 release. Oh well, feast your eyes on the gallery.
