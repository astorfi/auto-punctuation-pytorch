Well now that Vista is out, Niveus is throwing Vista into new versions of its Rainier and Denali PCs, alongside its Pro Series n7 and Pro Series n9 media servers, for a nice little family of beefy Windows Vista Media Center boxes. Highlights in the various PCs include full home theater outs, including HDMI; built-in HD DVD drives; dual CableCARD and that fancy quad-core QX6700 processor in the n9; and of course ridiculous pricetags to the tune of $15k for the "low-end" n9 box.
