 
Sure, all the Intel action lately has been about Nehalem and Montevina, but that doesn't mean the company's not busy tweaking its existing products, and it introduced the new P45 Express and G45 Express chipsets today at Computex. The new chipsets all support FSB speeds of up to 1.3GHz and DDR3 RAM speeds of up to 1.06GHz and have PCI Express 2.0 slots, but the G43 and G45 include X4500 / X4500HD integrated graphics while the P43 and P45 do not. Expect to see this kit under the hood of desktop Intel systems relatively soon -- now, if we could just get going on that Montevina launch, we'd be all set.
