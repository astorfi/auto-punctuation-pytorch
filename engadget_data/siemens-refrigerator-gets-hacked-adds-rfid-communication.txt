Sure, Samsung's already on the ball, but anyone interested in receiving SMS alerts about how out of date their milk is, which peanut butter not to buy, and whether Sally's favorite sherbet is all but empty isn't down with waiting another year. Thanks to Kim Otto of Denmark's Innovation Lab, along with RFID labels / readers, copper wiring, a PragmaSoft-enabled computer, and a (previously) TV-equipped fridge, the task has already been accomplished. Reportedly, the Siemens smart fridge prototype can judge all sorts of facts from foodstuffs that are tagged with RFID, and considering that it's also connected to the internet, it can be made to beam out emails or text messages to alert you of dwindling supplies or warn you of recalled produce. Best of all, the folks even took the time to video the newfangled creation, so be sure to click on through for the not-even-for-sale fridge of your dreams.[Via BoingBoing]
