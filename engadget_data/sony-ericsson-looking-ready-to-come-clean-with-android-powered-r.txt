It looks like November 3 is the date SE has chosen to unleash the first volley in its Android strategy on the world, likely the XPERIA X3 (or X10, or whatever the heck they decide to call it) with that wild Rachael UI that we've been tracking for a few months. How do we know? Well, it does line up with the latest and greatest rumors -- but more importantly, digging into the event page's HTML source reveals several mentions of Rachael by name, so... yeah, that's pretty much a lock. Should the unannounced Dragon and Sholes / Droid both be shaking in their boots already?
