Folks in the industry are noticing that rising ticket prices combined with greater availability of televised games are enticing fans to opt for the more comfortable couch, and "a study by the Consumer Electronics Association showed about three in ten sports fans" would rather watch events in HD than actually go. Furthermore, of the 48-percent surveyed who were looking to upgrade their set within two years, "more than half were sports fans." So, dear readers, how has the abundance of televised sporting events changed your views on making it to the stadium, if at all?
