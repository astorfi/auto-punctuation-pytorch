 iRiver Japan is Reigncom's only region we've seen make theannouncement today, but they've got a 2GB version of their lime green T10 due out there for Â¥19,980 (about $170US). Doesn't look too different than the MP3, WMA, OGG, ASF playing, FM tuning, voice recording device we're well usedto otherwise, and it's still got that same damned single-cell AAA battery, making it one of the more capacious playersto take said cells. Expect these to go on sale the 26th of this month over yonder in the land of the rising sun -- whoknows (if and) when, elsewhere.
