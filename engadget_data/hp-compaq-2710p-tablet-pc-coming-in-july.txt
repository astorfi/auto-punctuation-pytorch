Specs are very sparse for this particular model -- apparently all the source could dig up was that it'd come with 802.11n wireless and, wait for it, an optional webcam configuration. Other than that, this aluminum metal (at least, the render looks like real metal) tablet is due to hit sometime around July this year. So, what's next from the sieve that is HP's laptop department?
