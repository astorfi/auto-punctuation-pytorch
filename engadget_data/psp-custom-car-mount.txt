Turn your PSP into an auto audiovisual device
with this simple yet effective setup. It converts the Intec desktop cradle into a charging car mount suitable for
bringing the Playstation Portable on the road. Note that
this setup involves plugging the audio into the car radio's aux input — if you don't have an aux in but you have a
cassette deck, any of those cassette-style D/A convertors would do the trick as well. And of course, this technique is
applied so that the passengers can enjoy the video, as the driver has more important things like, well,
driving, as opposed to staring at a PSP screen — but we don't have to tell you that, right?
