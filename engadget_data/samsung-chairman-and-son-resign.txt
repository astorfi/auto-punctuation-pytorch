Lee said, "We, including myself, have caused troubles to the nation with the special probe. I deeply apologize for that, and I'll take full responsibility for everything, both legally and morally." Lee Jae-yong, the Chairman's son and heir to the Samsung throne also resigned as did Vice Chairman Lee Hak-soo, Lee's closest advisor. Lee Soo-bin, chairman of Samsung Life Insurance, takes on representation for Samsung Group although the group chairman position remains unfilled. So it's over. Now lick your wounds Sammy and get back to your hyperbolic announcements of world's first, fastest, biggest, etc... we miss you.[Thanks, Dave L.]
