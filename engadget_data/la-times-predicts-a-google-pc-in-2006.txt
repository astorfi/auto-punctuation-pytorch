 The LA Times has a roundup oftech predictions for '06 and they start their list off with a real doozy: Google has cheap PC in the works that features a Google OS and willdebut via Wal-Mart and other retailers. Not the first time we've heard rumors that Google is getting ready to make somemoves in this direction, but the LA Times seems fairly confident about things this time around, saying that that they'vespoken with several industry and analyst sources who claim the boxen would drop for as low as a couple hundred dollars.Not that there aren't plenty of peeps out there who are chomping at the bit for Google to throwdown big time againstMicrosoft, but until we're blogging from our brand new Google PC we're going to have to treat this report as totalspeculation. Discuss.
