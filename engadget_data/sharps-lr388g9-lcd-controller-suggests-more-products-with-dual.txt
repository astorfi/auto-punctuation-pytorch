Sure, that resolution may sound pathetic compared to your Cinema Display, but this silicon's intended for the likes of e-readers and phones, where a single image that size is desirable and a pair would be most welcome. Never mind that the chip can send 1080p content at 24fps to an external display, too. Of course, what we really want to see is a nice autostereoscopic smartphone fitted with Sharp's 3D HD camera module. Pretty please?
