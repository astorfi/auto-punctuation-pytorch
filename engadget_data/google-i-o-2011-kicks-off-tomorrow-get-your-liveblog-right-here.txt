The outfit's annual tech extravaganza kicks off in the morning at San Francisco's Moscone West, with an untitled Day 1 Keynote scheduled to boot things up at 9:00AM PT. As for what to expect? Things have been eerily quiet surrounding this year's event, but it wouldn't be a stretch to hear more about the rumored Google Music, Android's next step towards world domination, juicy details on the company's relationship with NFC, or where Chrome OS really sits. Might we see the mythical Nexus Two? Is Android 4.0 ready to shock the world? Will we be smacked around by a litany of location-based apps, all of which can happily be opted-out of? Feel free to toss your guesses in comments below, and be sure to have a bag of your favorite popping corn on tap come May 10th.

As always, we'll be live from the keynote floor bringing you up-to-the-second coverage, and you'd be doing yourself a solid by bookmarking our liveblog page right here. For reference, a handful of time zones are listed below -- we considered adding Easter Island, but we have yet to confirm whether or not the Moai forbid access to the internet.
