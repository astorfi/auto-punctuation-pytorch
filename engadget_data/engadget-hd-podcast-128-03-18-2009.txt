The spring is always a slow time for HD news, so with less to talk about, it gives us more time to go into detail. We start off the show with a twist on an old tip, which is to tune your TV for both picture quality as well as energy consumption. Next up, we talk a little EHX 2009, what was there, and what wasn't. The most interesting things at the show this year were Media Center related, so there is more than a little in there if you like that sort of thing. Finally we talk a little gestures, and the reasons why they don't make sense as well as why the new Boxee remote does. And last but not least we talk about the time we spent with the Popcorn Hour A-110.
