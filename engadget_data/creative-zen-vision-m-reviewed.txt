Among the features the reviewer liked are the Vision:M's ability to play DivX and XviD, its"superb" video quality playback, and its "very intuitive" GUI. Their biggest gripe (beyond the factthat a video-out cable isn't available yet, and the resourceful reviewer had to resort to rolling his own in order totest this feature)? The fact that the Vision:M isn't mass-storage compliant, meaning you have to run software to uploadcontent onto the device. But that's not enough to stop them from declaring that it's "everything the video iPod isand then some." (We did mention that this review is from Anything But iPod, right?)
