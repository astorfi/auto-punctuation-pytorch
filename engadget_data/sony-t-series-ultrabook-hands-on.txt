Here's the Cliff Notes version if you missed the earlier announcement: the 13-incher weighs 3.5 pounds (admittedly a little hefty for an Ultrabook), but its chassis is just 0.71 inches thin. Moreover, the T13 starts at $800, which is pretty dang low in the larger scheme of Ultrabook pricing. We went hands-on with the T13 at the Sony Center this morning -- head past the break for a closer look at Sony's first Ultrabook.
