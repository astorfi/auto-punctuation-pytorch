So far as we can tell, the format has been in existence since at least 1987, and no matter the adoption rate, 22 years in the consumer electronics industry is a milestone to be proud of. CNET has a new piece up that points out just how many AV receivers are dropping S-Video connectors entirely, with Yamaha's new RX-V family among the latest to bid the port a fond farewell. Our question to you is this: do you mind? When's the last time you actually used an S-Video socket over component, HDMI, DVI, VGA or DisplayPort? We're guessing most of you won't even be able to recall.
