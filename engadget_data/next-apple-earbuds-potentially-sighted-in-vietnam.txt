They're notorious for slipping out of wearers' ears and having a mediocre sound next to just about anything else you can buy. If Tinhte's own discovery in Vietnam is authentic, Apple might be breaking with another one of its longstanding traditions this year by redesigning those earpieces for the better. Gone are the usual buds that only vaguely aim towards your ear canals. Instead, what's on show has oval tips very loosely resembling those of the Klipsch Image S4 II, and slots in at an angle to fit more directly into the canals -- not to mention more comfortably, based on early tests. We can't guarantee that these headphones are more than just the products of an ambitious third-party manufacturer, but Tinhte has had a good track record for snagging pre-release Apple gear, and that "Designed by Apple in California Assembled in Vietnam" lettering would reduce the possibilities to either a good KIRF or the real thing. One way or the other, we could know the truth soon enough.
