Some of ASUS' big Computex 2013 launches today involved the latest 802.11ac WiFi flavor, and since you'll need to feed them with a router packing the same tech, ASUS has also announced one of those: the RT-AC68U. The company claims it's the first dual-band 802.11ac router with AC1900 data rates up to 1900 Mbit/s, thanks to AiRadar beamforming, which helps bring a stronger connection and 150 percent better range, too (if accurate). You'll also be able to share files between ASUS routers with USB-attached drives thanks to a router-to-router sync mode, negating the need for a switched-on PC or other device. There's no word on pricing or availability, but the previous RT-AC66U flagship ran about $200 or so -- so we'd be surprised if it came in under that figure.

The ASUS RT-AC68U is the world's first dual-band 802.11ac router with blisteringly fast combined AC1900 data rates of 1900Mbit/s. The RT-AC68U also features ASUS AiRadar technology that uses beamforming to focus the Wi-Fi for a stronger wireless connection and 150% greater coverage than other routers. The RT-AC68U features a Router-to-Router Sync mode that makes light work of sharing files. A simple invitation allows photos, videos and other files on USB-attached storage to be synchronized automatically to USB-attached storage on other compatible ASUS routers, without the need for a switched-on PC at either end.

Other ASUS products announced at Computex include the Zenbook Infinity Ultrabookâ„¢, MeMO Pad FHD 10 tablet, G10 desktop PC with built-in UPS and the PA279Q ProArt WQHD pre-calibrated professional monitor.
