 There is no doubt we live in a time where almost every electronic device we own could use some sort of firmware update. Lucky for us HD DVD and Blu-ray player manufactures don't mind admiting when they made a mistake and release an update for their hardware. First to the market and first to release an update was HD DVD and then Samsung and now Sony. Based on the list of fixes we can only assume this was released as a direct result of issues with The Descent, but we will have to wait and see what users say after they have had a chance to download the disc image or order a disc from Sony.The update is supposed to address:

Improves BD-Java compatibility to enhance interactivity with some BD-ROMs
Enhances playback compatibility with certain BD-ROM format discs
Corrects the output signal status information for audio output and display when Linear PCM 5.1 channel soundtracks are played back via HDMI
