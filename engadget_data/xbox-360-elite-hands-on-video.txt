 We know how it is, you just have to see it on video, right? Keep in mind this is Microsoft's Channel 10 doing the shooting, so everything is well lit and the questions are as boring as all get out, but it's the best we've got -- and be sure, we'd be pushing you some grainy QVGA camphone video of the Xbox 360 Elite if we had it. The interview is with Albert Penello, who is quick to get a dig in on Sony for leaving out an HDMI cable. Albert again confirms that a migration cable will be packaged with the stand-alone 120GB drive, but says they're "still working on a solution" for migrating data from a current Xbox 360 to the Elite, since apparently data is tied to the console in some way... such is the way of DRM, always putting the consumer first!
