Ready to make a date with a next-gen console? Microsoft's Xbox One goes up for sale on November 22nd, Redmond officially announced this morning. By way of a reminder, the PlayStation 4 will also land in the same month: November 15th for US customers -- just in case you can afford to two-time it. If not, well, we all get to witness the assuredly bloody fight for our hard-earned cash come this holiday.


The Xbox One launches in 13 territories initially (UK, Ireland, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, US, CAN, MEX, BRA, AUS, NZ) and costs $499 /€499 / £429 -- Microsoft's calling it a "global" launch, though the list was cut down considerably from initial plans. "Many more markets" will see the console arrive in 2014, a note from Microsoft spokesperson Larry "Major Nelson" Hryb says. The aforementioned territories list notably excludes Japan, a territory traditionally important in the video game market. The console is also in "full production" in its charge toward homes everywhere, and Microsoft made one last internal tweak before sending it out: a 10 percent clock speed increase (from 1.6GHZ to 1.75GHZ). "It means that the processing power to make those games that we've been showing off at Gamescom that already look great will look even better," corporate marketing VP Yusuf Mehdi said in a video announcing today's news (find it just below the break).


When Xbox One arrives at retail this November, the $500 package includes the console itself, a new wireless gamepad, the new Kinect, a headset, and various cables for attaching it to your favorite television. Limited editions of a special "Day One" version of the console are also available, which include an insignia on the controller and an exclusive Achievement. Microsoft is apparently making an extra set available starting today, should you still be on the hunt.
