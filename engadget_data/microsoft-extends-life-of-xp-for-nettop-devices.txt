 It's pretty obvious given what's going down in Taipei at the moment. Nevertheless, Microsoft just went official with it's plans to extend "Windows" for the category they (and Intel) define as "nettop" devices. So in addition to "Netbooks," "ultralow-cost PCs (ULCPCs)," and all those other mini-laptops originally intended for emerging markets, Microsoft has now officially extended the life of Windows XP for ultralow-cost desktops like ASUS' Eee Box and MSI's Wind PC. While Microsoft doesn't explicitly say it's XP in the carefully worded press release, we all know what they're talking about. Microsoft claims to be working with more than 20 OEMs -- including HP, Dell, ASUS, Acer, Lenovo, and more -- to help deliver Windows-based nettop devices. And here you Linux dreamers thought this would be a cake-walk.
