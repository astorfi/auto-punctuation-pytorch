While the video looks fairlyconvincing, we'll continue to reserve judgment at least until Colin Nederkoorn hands narf a check. Speaking of which,Colin, sponsor of the XP on Mac contest that started this whole thing, had to switch hosts after yesterday's frenzy, and is now hosting only thecontest page, rather than the forums where narf had earlier posted pics of his supposed XP solution. Colin expects tohave narf's solution in by the end of the week for testing, so we should know pretty soon whether this is the HolyGrail or a just another tin cup. Update: Narf has sent hissolution to Colin for testing, so this does indeed seem real. Now let's see if it's reproducible!Watchthe video (7.7MB MOV)Read about the contest[Thanks, Rob and Joseph]
