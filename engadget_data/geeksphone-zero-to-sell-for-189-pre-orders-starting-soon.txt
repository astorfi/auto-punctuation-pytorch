Well, they're coming back for round two with the Zero, said to be launching soon -- and Android France looks to have a jump on pricing and specs. The phone's clearly on the low end of the range (Geeksphone says it's saving the flagship horsepower for the yet-to-be-introduced Two) with a 600MHz processor, 256MB of RAM, a 3.2-inch HVGA display, though it gets brownie points for a 5 megapixel autofocus cam and Gingerbread out of the box. Pricing looks aggressive, too: the site claims we'll see it for €189 ($265), though early buyers will get a €179 ($251) special and previous owners of the One will get it for €168 ($236). Pre-orders will allegedly kick off within a couple weeks.
