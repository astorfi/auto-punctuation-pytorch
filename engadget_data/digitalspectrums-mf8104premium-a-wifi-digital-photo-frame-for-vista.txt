No, we're not talking 'bout the latest PMP out of Korea, these are the specs for the DigitalSpectrum MF8104Premium digital picture frame. This 10.4-inch, 800x600 pixel TFT LCD frame is available in a variety of colors and styles for mounting on the wall or tabletop to display your family snaps stored in JPG/PNG/BMP/TIFF formats. Oh, and did we mention it ships with a remote control for navigating the embedded HTTP web server and RSS feeds from your fave photo sharing sites like Flikr? Well, it does. Hell, Microsoft's Vista will even autodetect the frame and automatically feed photos from the Vista Pictures folder. Thing is, for $380, you'll wish it did more. Available for pre-order off the biggie consumer electronics websites (hint: Amazon) with shipment expected mid-January.[Thanks, dpf insider]
