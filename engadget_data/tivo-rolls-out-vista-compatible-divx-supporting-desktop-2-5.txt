Headlining the updates this time around is Windows Vista compatibility, not to mention support for the transfer and playback of DivX and Xvid files, along with support for conversion of previously transferred recordings. TiVo's also now finally added the iPod to the list of portable devices, and it'll kindly send converted files straight to your iTunes library. Hit up the link below for the download.
