 Despite its $1,100 price tag and nearly universal panning by critics, the initial stock of Samsung Q1 UMPCs sold out within 24 hours of appearing on Best Buy's web site this weekend. Of course, we don't know how many units Samsung allocated for the initial sales period, but we suspect it was a pretty small number. After all, there are few better ways to hype a product than to announce that it's sold out, and prospective buyers will have to wait a while before they can buy one. Yeah, we fell for it, too. But we're still not about to click on that "Add to Cart" button.
