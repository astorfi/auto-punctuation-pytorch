   As most of you know by now, we've recently welcomed some old friends back to the fold here at greater Aol Tech. We're thrilled to be working with the gdgt crew on our first event together, tomorrow night in Austin during SXSW.

 We'd love to have you join us for a night of fun gadgety action -- take a break from your intense schedule of panels and booze buses and come on out to mingle with gdgt and Engadget staff, check out the devices our sponsors are bringing in spades (plus win some!) and have a great time with like-minded technophiles. It's free to attend, and you don't even need a SXSW badge to get in. The one catch: you must be 21 or over to come to this party (upside: open bar!), although our future events will be all ages.

  When: Saturday, March 9th (7:00pm â€“ 10:00pm CST)  Where: The Hype Hotel, 301 Brazos Street Austin, TX  How: RSVP hereSee you there!
