Under the deal, the company is promising to deliver  a "lightweight, see-through, full-color eyewear display prototype" that's a good deal more "wearable" than some of the displays now in use (as seen above). Eventually, the company says the displays will be as small as protective eyewear or "high-fashion sunglasses." Not surprisingly, the company also foresees a few advantageous side-effects to the deal, saying that it won't only accelerate the available of displays for the military, but for consumer, industrial and medical markets as well.[Via I4U News]
