Apart from looking way hotter than the silver version that's made the rounds, you're getting GPS, a 2 megapixel camera with video recording, Bluetooth, "enhanced" web browsing, and the usual suite of Sprint music and TV services. $179 with a two-year contract later this month, says Sprint. One more shot after the break.[Thanks, mocchy989]
