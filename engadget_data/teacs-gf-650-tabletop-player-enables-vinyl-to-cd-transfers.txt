This unit touts an AM / FM radio, auxiliary input jack, wireless remote, CD player, and of course, a record player. As expected, users simply load in a CD-R / RW, queue up their favorite record, and walk away (or hang around, it's up to you) as the real-time transfer takes place. As for output, it's got a meager 3.5-watt x 2 amplifier, and it should be on sale right now in Japan for a staggering Â¥83,790 ($740).[Via Impress]
