You may (or may not) be assick of CES 2006 as any of us, but like it or not the time came and went forus to wrap it up, pack it in, and head on home to our respective Engadget bedrooms offices, yet again. While someof us are still on the road, and thoughthe Engadget crew certainly didn't take it any easier this year than in CES 2005, this last Sunday was admittedlya little bittersweet as we all piled in the Engadget Limo (aka the Engadget church bus, a 10-person Econoline) one lasttime. Everybody here had a great time going crazy on the latest and greatest while trying not to look too hung-over /disappointed by gambling losses / sleep-deprived in front of all the kind PR and media relations people -- but namelywe hope we helped make some sense of the complete chaos that is the Consumer Electronics Show (and we'll continue totrickle out non-news coverage throughout the week as we're clearing up space on our hard drives and flash disks).Perhaps most importantly, however, we hope that when you looked for coverage of CES 2006 you came to Engadget, and thatwhen CES 2007 hits you'll do the same.Team Engadget 2006 CES stats:Number ofposts: 334Number of lost gadgets: 7Number of laptop-coffee spills: 1Number of bags lost: 1Number of WiFi networks traversed: 11Average hours slept nightly: 5.6Number of casinos visited: 9Amount of money lost gambling: $200 Average number of laptops per person: 1.3Average number of cellphonesper person: 1.5Pounds of shwag thrown away: ~74Clearance (in inches) between the Engadget limo and theceiling at the Venetian parking garage: 0 Number of times someone played "Let's Get Retarded":unquantifiable
