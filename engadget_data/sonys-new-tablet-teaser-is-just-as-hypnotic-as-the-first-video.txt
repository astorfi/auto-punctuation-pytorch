Much like last month's spellbinding ad, this sequel features plenty of balls, levers and bizarre figurines moving together in serpentine synergy. If you look closely, you might even spot one of Sony's Honeycomb slates. This is only the second installation in what could very well be a never-ending series -- but we'd be OK with that, because these clips make our brains happy. Click play to get the ball rolling and let the symphony begin.
