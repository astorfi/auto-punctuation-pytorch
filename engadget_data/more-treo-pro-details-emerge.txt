TreoCentral member scottymomo has fleshed out a few more details on the device, and dug up that Comm Manager shot up above. Details include:

HTC task manager.
Comm Manager's Airplane Mode and other assorted easily switched options.
MicroSD (up to 32GB supported) isn't under the battery, but you do have to take off the battery cover to access.
1500mh battery.
Other stuff.

It's all very exciting, we assure you, but you can explore the shots for yourself if you're really feeling hard up for Treo Pro infos. Oh, while we're thinking about it: sexiest Treo yet, or disastrous usage of phone face real estate? Both?[Via Palm Infocenter]
