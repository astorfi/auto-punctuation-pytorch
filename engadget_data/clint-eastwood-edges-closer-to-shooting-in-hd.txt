 Sure, we'd expect a legend like Clint Eastwood to stick to his theoretical guns when it comes to manhandling the cameras on the sets of Flags of our Fathers and the forthcoming Iwo Jima, but when HD camcorders almost win out against the tried and true 35mm film approach, we can't help but take notice. Eastwood admits that he, alongside a bevy of experts, ran a series of tests between scenes shot in HD versus film, and while he couldn't quite "reach the black levels" nor "control the atmosphere" as well as he wanted with HD cams, even he admits they came awfully close. He claimed the biggest dig against current HD rigs was their size, citing a need for ultra-fine HD capturing machinery that's uber-small as well before he could shoot an entire film with it. Still, he was able to utilize a series of Sony HVR-Z1U HDV cameras inside "prop 50-caliber machine-gun ammunition cases" after ruling out Panasonic's HVX-200 due to a lack of FireStore availability, and eventually blended a good bit of that content into the feature film. Mr. Eastwood admitted that HD wasn't quite where he needed it to be just yet, but felt very hopeful about its future in the motion picture industry, and if we had to guess, we'd say it won't be too much longer before HD technology will be "making his day."[Via DVGuru]
