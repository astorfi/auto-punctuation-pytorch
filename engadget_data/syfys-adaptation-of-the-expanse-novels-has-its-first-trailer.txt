Tonight Syfy premieres its new series 12 Monkeys (based on the movie of the same name, and bring your Hue lightbulbs), but fans of the genre should also check out this trailer (click here to view it from outside the US) for another new show coming this year, The Expanse. The name comes from the award-winning series of books its based on, starting with Leviathan Wakes, and the show will star Thomas Jane as the lead character Detective Miller. The show has been described as Syfy's "most ambitious" effort ever and garnered comparisons to Game of Thrones (like every book-to-TV adaptation does these days), but you can get an idea for yourself by taking a peek after the break.
