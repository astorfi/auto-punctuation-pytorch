In press shots appearing on a Vietnamese gadget site, the device is pictured with a mirrorless mount and a trio of NX lenses. Judging from the body, the camera is likely to be closer in size to a DSLR than Samsung's existing CSC lineup, with a large touchscreen occupying much of the rear.


Hardware controls are few and far between, and may be limited to a shutter release, video capture button, top-mounted dial and a pop-up flash release, along with the compulsory lens release to the left of the swappable optic. It's said to include Android 4.2, a 20.3-megapixel APS-C sensor, ISO sensitivity through 25,600 and 1080p video capture. Pricing info is still up in the air, as is an official announce date, which could very well be as soon as Samsung's June 20th event in London. Hit up the source for a few more shots.
