You can't get Sony's new U70 ultraportable PC in America (at least not through official channels), but one of the
biggest gripes we've heard about it is that it runs on vanilla Windows XP rather than the Tablet PC version of XP that
Microsoft has been pimping for the past year and a half. Not a big deal really, except that the Tablet PC OS has all
the extra handwriting and speech recognition software for getting the most out of a tablet-style PC. Anyway, frustrated
with the limitations of the U70 as he bought it, James Kendrick decided to take matters into his own hands and figured
out how to install the Tablet PC version of Windows XP (which isn't particularly easy to obtain, um, "legally") on the
U70.
