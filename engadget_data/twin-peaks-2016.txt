Ready for a slice of pie and a cup of damn fine coffee? Twin Peaks creators David Lynch and Mark Frost sure are, as they're reviving the show for a third season that's due to air on Showtime in 2016. The duo announced as much via Twitter with a characteristically-vague trailer (see it below). In it, Laura Palmer stands in the red room, stares into the camera, and snaps her fingers. Sure! At least someone isn't speaking backwards, right?


Variety says it isn't a remake of the original series, but rather a modern day continuation of storylines from the second season. Lynch is signed on to direct the entire season, which is said to be nine episodes. And no, there's no word yet if Detective Dale Cooper (Kyle McLachlan) is returning, but when handed such pleasant news, it seems wrong to immediately demand more. As Coop put it, "Every day, once a day, give yourself a present." We've already indulged.
