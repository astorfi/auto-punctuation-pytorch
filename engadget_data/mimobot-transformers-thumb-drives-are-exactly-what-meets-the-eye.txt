 

Oh, look, Mimoco is back with a couple of new USB flash drives. These particular Mimobots come in the likeness of everyone's second favorite morphing robot rivals -- Optimus Prime and Megatron. (Obviously Cy-Kill and Leader-1 take the top slot in our hearts.) Sadly, these Transformer thumb drives don't actually transform, but they do come preloaded with screensavers, wallpapers, and digital comics... if you're into that sort of thing. The Autobot and Decepticon leaders are available now, starting at $23 for 2GB of storage and reaching $60 for the 16GB model. PR is after the break.
