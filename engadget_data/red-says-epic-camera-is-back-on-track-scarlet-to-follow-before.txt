He now says that the company has managed to nail the bug, however, and that the camera is back on track to head into production... sometime. Jannard also assures us that production of the Scarlet camera (also affected by the bug) will then follow, although that depends on "how fast we can get EPIC production rolling and solid" -- he did later add that he expects it to be sometime before the end of the year, though.
