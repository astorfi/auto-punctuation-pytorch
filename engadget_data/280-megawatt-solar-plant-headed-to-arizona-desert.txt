Truth be told, that 14-megawatt project pales mightily in comparison to the one being dreamed up for Arizona, and even Cleantech's 80-megawatt endeavor in California can only bow to the 280-megawatt Solana Generating Station. According to the Arizona Public Service Company, the facility will boast "enough capacity to serve 70,000 customers" when it (hopefully) becomes operational in 2011, and it will also create 1,500 construction jobs and 85 technical positions once open. So, now that the game of leapfrog is official on in the solar biz, who's game for trumping this one?
