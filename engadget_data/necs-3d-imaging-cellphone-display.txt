Just when you were getting over that raging case of astigmatism, NEC drops an outrageously dense 235ppi (pixels per
inch) cellphone display that uses a type of lens separation to create 3D images without the special glasses. Right, so
that means you won't have to stare at anaglyphs in
order to read your SMS messages in heart-pounding 3D! Of course, we're taking it all with a grain of salt, but even if
it does work as advertised aren't exactly a whole host of applications that a 3D cellphone display would be all that
useful for.
