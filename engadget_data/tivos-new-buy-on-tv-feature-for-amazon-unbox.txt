We weren't the only ones and some even took matters into their own hands by creating a home grown application. Well TiVo and Amazon finally got the hint and today announced what they're calling Buy on TV -- which obviously lets you buy movies directly from your broadband enabled Series2 or Series3 set top box. You can find movies or shows to download by either browsing under TiVoCasts or via Swivel search; and so your baby-sitter doesn't run up your bill, you'll need to enter your five digit purchase pin when ordering.
