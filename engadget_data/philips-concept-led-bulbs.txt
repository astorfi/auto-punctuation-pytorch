Philips is showing off these new LED-based
takes on the good old light bulb, which allow direct interaction with the fixture to change the lighting effect. The
lights are part of Philips Design's Next Simplicity project, in which they're putting a designery twist on everyday
objects. We've been testing this concept at Engadget labs on some traditional light bulbs, and recommend you hold out
for these low-heat LED versions, which could be surfacing in a couple years.
