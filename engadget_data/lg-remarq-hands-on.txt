LG launched the eco-friendly Remarq this week at CTIA, and this tiny -- well, when shut -- device at least points those interested in green mobility in the right direction. The packaging that the Remarq ships in is made from 87 % post-consumer materials and the device itself is crafted from 19% recovered plastic. Sound fun? Yeah, course, but LG has also thrown in an admittedly kitschy but fun app that helps you keep track of your carbon footprint by rewarding you shrubs and trees based on the walking you do instead of the driving. Of the two sets launched by LG this week, this one definitely stands out as the winner. The screen, display, and look and feel of this squarish device are very well done. Follow the fold to see a gallery and a video tour by none other than Martin Valdez.
