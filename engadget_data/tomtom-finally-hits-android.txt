 As TomTom promised, Android users can now be guided offline by the nav company -- unless you happen to own a Galaxy SIII, Galaxy Note II, Galaxy Nexus or a handful of other recent, popular smartphones or tabs. It said most models would be compatible by year's end, but if you do have one that works already, you'll get all the features that iOS users have enjoyed for quite a while: radar camera warnings (depending on your country), eco routes, contact navigation, free map updates and traffic guidance. The app is now available on Google Play starting at $50 for the US and Canada maps, an "introductory offer" that's 10 bucks cheaper than the same iOS version, so you might want to check the source before that price goes up -- if you've got the right device, of course. We're hoping to take a spin with the app soon, but meanwhile, you can check out a teaser video and the PR, after the break.
