If you're the sort to wander around the house listening to audiobook versions of hot new novels, Amazon just made your day: it upgraded its voice-guided Echo speaker to handle Audible files. Much like a kid asking for a bedtime story, you only have to ask the Echo to read you a title. It'll even pick up where you left off without mentioning the book by name. Amazon's audio tube won't speak text (at least, not yet), but this is a big step forward if music playback alone just won't cut it.
