Good, then you'll love this highly emotive video produced by VIA showing its meager 1.3GHz Nano processor kicking Intel's 1.6GHz Atom to the curb in a 1080p HD video test.

Now pull up a seat ringside and get ready to sputter along with the Atom-based netbook -- video after the break. [Via UMPC Portal]
