Designed to compete in the YouTube-friendly pocket camcorder sector, this critter was actually said to be built a bit studier than the Flip and pack a more luscious display to boot. Reviewers also found the audio quality to be (expectedly) subpar, and while video quality was decent for a sub-$100 device, the compression monster managed to make ho hum results downright ugly when clips were uploaded to the 'Tube. Still, for the market this one's aimed at (read: a market without videophiles), it's not a half bad addition to the cargo pocket arsenal -- just don't go expecting the world and you'll be fine.
