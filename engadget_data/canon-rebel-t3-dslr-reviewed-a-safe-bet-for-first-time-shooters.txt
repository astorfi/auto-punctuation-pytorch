Well, Canon's latest entry-level DSLR may not be the most unruly camera out, but at least it sports a moniker that fits the bill. The Canon T3 Rebel, also known as the EOS 1100D, is a 12.2-megapixel affair designed with the DSLR newbie in mind, and according to a review over at PhotographyBlog, it doesn't sacrifice image quality for ease of use. Touted as a successor to the Rebel XS, the T3 actually carries over some useful features from its more sophisticated sibling, the T3i, including a user-friendly control layout, but lacks the camera's Scene Intelligent auto mode and extensive list of creative filters. Aside from that, the reviewer found T3's grips too slick and its diminutive LCD screen a minor setback, but was quick to point out that none of these is a deal-breaker. In fact, aside from a bit of noise encountered at the highest ISO setting, the camera delivers high quality photographs even in low light. All things considered, it looks like the Rebel T3 is a "responsive and intuitive DSLR" for the novice photog, and at $600, it's got at least some of the competition beat. Now, we won't tell you what to do, but if we were you, we'd click the source link to see how the T3 stacks up.
