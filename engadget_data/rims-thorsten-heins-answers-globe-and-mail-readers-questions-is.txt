 RIM CEO Thorsten Heins did a fair bit of talking to the media following the company's latest dose of bad news (in addition to penning his own op-ed), and he's now gone one step further by responding to some readers' questions for The Globe & Mail. While there's expectedly not a whole lot in the way of surprises, he did talk a bit more about the reasons for the BlackBerry 10 delay, noting that he "could still see some of the seams," and appears to have ruled out any further delays, saying that he is "absolutely committed" to the new timeline. He's also assured folks that the company will continue to support BlackBerry 7 devices "into the future," but reiterated that upgrading those devices to BB10 was out of the question.
