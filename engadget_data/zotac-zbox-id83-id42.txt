 Despite the fact that Zotac's model number sequence appears to run backwards, the company's latest mini-PCs on show at CES appear to contain healthy upgrades relative to the ZBOX ID84 we saw in August. According to a brief report at Hot Hardware, the new range -- including the ID42 and ID83 -- will bring additions like dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, dual WiFi antennas for better reception and, most importantly, a cooling system that allows for more powerful processors up to a dual-core 1.1GHz Celeron or even a Core i3-3120M. Different configurations will come with either HD4000 integrated graphics or NVIDIA's GeForce 620, and can be purchased as barebones units or with RAM and HDD preinstalled. As for pricing and availability, we'll just have to wait and see --although early retailer listings suggest the Ivy Bridge ID83 could cost around Â£320 ($520).
