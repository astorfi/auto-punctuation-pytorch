The bonus of this whole Internet thing is knowledgeable users can sometimes peep things that we don't have access
toâ€”like the very lucky and privileged few who already have Verizon
FiOS fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) that we've been
hearing (and hoping, wishing, dreaming) about for way too long now. One of the first cities with an active rollout is
Keller, Texas, and resident Craig J.'s got a sweet first-look user review of the IPTV service, which has 20 HD channels
and apparently the best picture quality dude's ever seen, including non-HD channels (to paraphrase). Just to tempt you
a little more to move to an area with service, you can also pick up 30/5MBps fiber Internet access, if you recall. Oh,
cruel metropolis with constantly-going-out 5/0.3MBps Internet, we curse thee!
