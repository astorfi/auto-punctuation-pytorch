 Not even a month after we asked you fine readers what you'd love to change about the YP-P2, in comes early word that a tweaked successor could be on the way. Granted, most everything here is lost in translation, but we're gathering that Samsung could be readying a touchscreen YP-P3 that would look awfully similar to the SCH-W420 mobile. Good thing, too, as that particular unit has haptic support (force feedback from touch panels, in a nutshell) already loaded in. So convenient, wouldn't you agree? Keep a loose eye out for this one to surface late this year.[Via PMPToday]
