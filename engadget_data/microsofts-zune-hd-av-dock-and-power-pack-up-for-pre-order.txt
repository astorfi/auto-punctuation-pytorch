If not, we'll have you know that the Zune HD AV Dock (left) and Zune HD AV & Power Pack (right) can be pre-ordered right now from Microsoft's online store as well as through Amazon, and we suspect most every other respectable e-tailer will pick 'em up soonly. Both devices are expected to ship alongside the device itself on September 15th, with the former including a dock, three inserts, wireless remote, AC adapter, HDMI cable and AV output cable for $89.99. The latter is meant to pipe content from your docked Zune HD onto a TV, as it includes an AC adapter, HDMI cable and AC output cable for $49.99.[Thanks, Thomas]Read - Zune HD AV Dock Read - Zune HD AV & Power Pack
