       The LCD vs Plasma battle is nothing new, but in the past two years it has just started to getinteresting. A few years ago when someone would ask me which one I thought was better my response was "It depends,do you want a TV bigger or smaller than 40 inches?" It amazed me that so many people didn't realize that for sometime the smallest plasma and the largestLCD were both 37 inches. Sharp changed all that last year with the release of their 45 inch LCD and nowmany manufacturers are or soon will be selling LCDs up to 65 inches. The last major hurdle to overcome in order to levelthe playing field is price.The first large Sharp LCDs were considerably more than plasmas, but that has recently changed. The cost differenceis usually less than $1,000 now compared to over $3,000 just one year ago.  As a result thebattle is officially on! Now that size and price are finally comparable which isbetter? Plasmas have stellar black levels and smooth motion, but LCDs don't suffer from burn in and are believed to last longer. Sony seemsto be on the LCD train while LG, Pioneer and Panasonic continue to lead the way inplasmas. Which will be around in 5 years or will both be replaced by something else like OLED or SED?
