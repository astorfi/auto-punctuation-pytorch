AtCeBIT, the company announced that its first computers to come with Blu-ray drives, high-end Vaio desktops and laptops,would arrive toward the middle of the year. And that's it. No model names or numbers. Not even any mocked up pics ofsuperdeluxe Vaios showing HD videos thanks to those Blu-ray drives (which wouldn't be too hard to do, given thatcurrent model Vaios, likethe F TV, above, already have tuners and video capabilities). So, er, maybe Sony is kind of sitting still afterall.Update: No prototypes at the CeBIT booth but at least we learned that the new laptopsare about as thick as the existing VaioBX series, will feature HDMI ports, include a 17-inch display and ship "around September" -- is thatstill mid-year?
