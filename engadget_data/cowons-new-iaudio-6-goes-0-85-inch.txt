They're targeting this 4GB player at the iPod nano (what else?) and have packed in a 1.3-inch OLED screen for viewing the vids, and a touch sensitive"%" control scheme they title "Swing Touch". Not a bad looking player, it seems a bit on the thickside, but the included video playback is a nice touch for those with the patience for 1.3-inch flicks.[Thanks, Martin]Read
