       While not the most mesmerizing news to flow from 2008's Intel Developer Forum, this is a welcome piece for anyone who appreciates hasty transfers. The Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO) has announced that the partially complete SATA Revision 3.0 specification will eventually double data transfer rates to 6Gbps. This week's release gives the green light to developers to begin designing products based on said tech, though the finalized paperwork won't be ready until later this year. On a related note, the same consortium has announced the formal launch of its certified logo program, which will enable consumers to easily recognize when a product has passed SATA-IO interoperability testing and is a bona fide SATA 6Gb/sec-enabled device.
