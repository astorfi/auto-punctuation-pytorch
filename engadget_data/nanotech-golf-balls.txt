We're sorely tempted to file this one as yet another attempt to cash in on the hype surrounding nanotechnology, but
a company called NanoDynamics says they have a new golf ball made out of nanomaterials that can supposedly correct its
own flight path in midair and shouldn't wobble or break as much during putts. Nice, but could you just get cracking on
a robot that hits the ball for us?
