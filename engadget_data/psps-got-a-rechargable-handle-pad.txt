Maybe you're still a little depressed about Sony getting
barred from selling PS2s because their dual-shock
controllers infringe on patents, or maybe you're just about making that slick little PSP a slight bit more
ghettofabâ€”we're not asking why about the "Rechargable Handle Pad", we're just glad Dragonplus (whoever they
are) at least had the good nature to use that extra space to stack on another 4-5 hours of battery life for doing your
thang.
