People are reporting that while the 2005 Mini Cooper will include built-in Bluetooth for making hands-free phone
calls with your cellphone, the implementation limits the compatibility to only three phones.  Apparently, the
connection forces one to fit a phone into an armrest for full Bluetooth functionality.  The compatible phones
include the Sony Ericsson T610, Nokie 6310i, and Siemens S55/56.  If these reports are true, it's a bizarre choice
and sad day for Bluetooth users around the world who happen to want to be driving Minis next year…and who don't have
the three phones listed. Remember, that's assuming that this report is, in fact, true.
