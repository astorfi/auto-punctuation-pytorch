Well, isn't this convenient? Rumors have circulated that Nokia was delaying the Lumia 1520 launch beyond late September, and the company has just teased an "innovation reinvented" event on October 22nd. The company isn't giving many clues, although the desert skiing image is curious -- we're wondering if the press gathering may take place in a similarly exotic venue. Wherever the event takes place, you know we'll be there.
