 You win some, and you lose some, right, Apple? Hot on the heels of its latest victory in Dusseldorf keeping the Galaxy Tab 10.1 out of Deutschland, Apple was denied similar satisfaction in Munich today. Bloomberg's reporting that the Munich Regional Court denied Cupertino's motion to exclude Sammy's 10.1N and Galaxy Nexus from store shelves due to infringement of a touchscreen patent granted last year. While details of the ruling itself are scarce, the judge apparently rejected Apple's overtures because the patent in question is likely invalid due to the market presence of the same technology before the patent was granted. Of course, the 10.1N's not out of the woods yet, as next week the aforementioned court in Dusseldorf will pass judgment on Sammy's reworked slate. So, pop some popcorn folks, these legal fireworks are far from over.
