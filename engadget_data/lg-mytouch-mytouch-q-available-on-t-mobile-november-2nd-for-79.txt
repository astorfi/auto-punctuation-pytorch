Word of these handsets' existence leaked out via YouTube a few months back, but the carrier's since made both official. The duo will hit T-Mobile's site on November 2nd, each at a budget-pleasing $79.99 -- that's after a mail-in rebate on a two-year contract. But if you're the sort to pick up your wares in-store, then expect to see this pair on offer come November 9th. What'll you get for that sub-$100 price? Well, the devices run along the operator's 4G HSPA+ network and pack a single-core 1GHz Qualcomm processor, as well as front-facing / 5 megapixel rear cameras. The only thing setting these two apart is your predilection for a landscape QWERTY slider, in which case you'll want to snag the Q. So, if you've been waiting on T-Mo to roll this twosome out of the gate, consider tomorrow your lucky day.
