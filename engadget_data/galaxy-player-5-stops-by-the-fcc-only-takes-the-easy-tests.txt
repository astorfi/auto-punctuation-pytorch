Samsung's WiFi-only PMP, the Galaxy Player 5 (aka YP-G70, aka Galaxy Player 70), just got rubber-stamped by our favorite federal body, passing with flying colors. While we weren't treated to any teardown antics, we do have the lovely sketch above showing you where you can find the FCC logo. It's the thing on the pointy end of the red arrow above, a label that hopefully you'll be able to see in person very soon.
