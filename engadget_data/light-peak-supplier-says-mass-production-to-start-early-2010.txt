That's right on track with what we've seen and been told about Apple and Intel's plans for the tech, which forecast a line of back-to-school Macs featuring Light Peak in the fall of 2010. And, well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, but Intel was pretty high on Light Peak for devices that needed maximum connectivity in the smallest amount of space, like an iPhone -- or, say, a tablet. Quite a nice little package of rumors, don't you think? Okay, we'll calm down now.
