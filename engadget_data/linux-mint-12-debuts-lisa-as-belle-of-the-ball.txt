Code-named "Lisa," the distribution introduces a new desktop that's based on GNOME 3.2, yet offers extensive user customization courtesy of Mint Gnome Shell Extensions (MGSE). Open source fans will find the default search engine is now DuckDuckGo, which touts crowd-sourcing and a no-tracking privacy policy. Those concerned with aesthetics will certainly appreciate two new themes, Mint-Z and Mint-Z-Dark, and the distro also delivers upgrades to Firefox, Thunderbird and LibreOffice. Linux Mint currently rides in the pole position at DistroWatch, having supplanted Ubuntu as the alternative of choice for many Tux enthusiasts. Perhaps it's time to sample the freshness for yourself.
