  We'd seen some prior leaks, but aside from poorly translated marketing jargon, Huawei's managed to keep its latest and greatest smartphone under wraps -- until now, that is. The device is being billed as the "world's fastest quad-core smartphone" with the company's own K3V2 CPU, clocked at 1.5GHz, powering the unit. Sharing a slim, albeit slightly chunkier 8.9mm profile than its P1 predecessors, this Android 4.0 beast sports a 4.5-inch 720p display, 8 megapixel rear camera, Dolby 5.1 surround sound, support for LTE and an 1,800mAh battery bolstered by a proprietary energy management software that the manufacturer claims will last for up to two days. The actual hardware design itself takes a cue from Nokia's Lumia 800, with a screen that blends into the device's edges, creating an "infinity feel."Along with this flagship powerhouse, two other Diamond family members -- the Ascend D Quad XL and Ascend D1 -- will be joining Huawei's lineup. Spec-wise, the XL is essentially an unchanged version of the original Quad, except imbued with a larger 2,500mAh battery, while the D1 swaps out the four core internals for a more 2011-ish, 1.5GHz dual-core setup and smaller 1,670mAh battery. All three are slated for a Q2 release this year and should hit retail and online shops in white and black options across North and South America, Asia, Europe and Australia.

Powered by the Huawei's K3V2 quad-core 1.2GHz/1.5GHz processor and boasting the most compact design among 4.5-inch smartphones, the Ascend D quad expands the realm of possibilities for consumers with an Android 4.0 operating system and Huawei's proprietary power management system which provides up to 30% in energy savings.  "We've listened to people's top demands from smartphones: speed, long-battery life, high quality visual and audio capabilities, and a compact, lightweight handset. The Huawei Ascend D quad exceeds these expectations," said Richard Yu, Chairman of Huawei Device. "In January at the Consumer Electronics Show at Las Vegas, we achieved a world record for the world's slimmest smartphone with the Huawei Ascend P1 S. We are proud to once again introduce a world-first at the 2012 Mobile World Congress with the Ascend D quad, the fastest smartphone."  The Ascend D quad is an entertainment dynamo with its 4.5-inch 720P high definition touchscreen, and the industry's most powerful 32-bit true color graphic processor. Its PPI 330 screen providing crystal clear display even under direct sunlight, is complemented by its Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound and Audience earSmartâ„¢ voice technology for an experience which excels across the senses. Its 8-megapixel BSI rear-facing camera, 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera, and 1080p full HD video-capture and playback capabilities enables you to record your special moments in clearer, richer detail.  The Ascend D quad comes with an 1800mAh battery, which lasts for one to two days with normal usage. The smartphone's prowess is enhanced by Huawei Device's proprietary power management technology which provides a longer battery life of up to 30% compared to industry average by adjusting power consumption according to usage needs. It also ensures higher chipset performance and efficiency by maintaining a low chip temperature.  Measuring 64mm narrow and 8.9mm slim, the Ascend D quad is proof that good things do come in small packages. With an ultra-thin frame, the lightweight and compact smartphone's 4.5-inch touchscreen seems to vanish into the edge, creating an "infinity" feel and allowing an exceptionally narrow body.  In addition to innovative hardware design, the Ascend D quad also has outstanding software design. In addition to its Android 4.0 operating system, the Ascend D quad optimizes the user experience, ensuring greater ease of use.  As part of the Ascend D series, Huawei also introduced the Ascend D quad XL and the Ascend D1 smartphones. The Ascend D quad XL comes with a 2500mAh battery which provides two to three days of normal usage. With the same specifications as the Ascend D quad, the Ascend D quad XL measures 10.9 mm slim. The Ascend D1 runs on a 1.5 GHz dual-core CPU and has a 1670mAh battery.  The Ascend D quad series will be available in China, Australia, Europe, Asia-Pacific, North and South America, and the Middle East in Q2 2012. The Ascend D1 will be available in the above markets from April 2012.
