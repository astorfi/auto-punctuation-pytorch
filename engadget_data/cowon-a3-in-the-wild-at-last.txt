GenerationMP3 got a hold of the unit at IFA, and while it's a bit chunky for a modern player, there's no denying the capabilities -- or the sheer wonder of that 4-inch 800 x 480 screen. Apparently DMB only comes as a €100 option ($137 US), which is a bit of a low blow, given the €449 pricetag for the 30GB player, and €499 for 60GB ($615, $684 US), and there's still no exact word on release date, but we're sure the A3's hefty codec support and extensive features will win over few fans.
