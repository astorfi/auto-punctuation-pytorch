 For now at least, Zune hacks appear to be far outweighing the Zune cracks, although we doubt neither are making Microsoft very happy these days. The latest on hack front comes to us courtesy of Zune Boards member Marshilboy, who whipped up a little something that does away with the Zune's guest sync feature, instead letting you sync any Zune as if it were the "home" Zune. That also does away with the need to erase everything on your Zune and start over from scratch should you ever somehow completely mess things up with it. Of course, as with all such hacks, it's probably not be the best idea to start modifying software you're dependent on unless you know what you're doing, so proceed at your own risk.[Thanks, Mike]
