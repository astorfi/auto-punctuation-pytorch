What's more, that word doesn't only come from the expected doomsayer analysts, but from some top tier PC makers as well. That includes Fujitsu, who's senior director of mobile product management, Paul Moore, says, "We're sitting on the sidelines not because we're lazy. We're sitting on the sidelines because even if this category takes off, and we get our piece of the pie, it doesn't add up." That's a sentiment echoed by Sony, who's Stan Glasgow says simply that, "we are not looking at competing with Asus," although he adds that Sony is "investigating" what consumers want in a second PC. Even Dell, which is set to dip its toes into the netbook waters, seems a bit hesitant, with vice president of marketing Michael Tatelman saying he thinks the devices have "limited consumer appeal," and that they're good for a "30- to 90-minute experience," but not for more intensive tasks. Of course, that's all before any of them heard of the new world's cheapest laptop, so there's no telling how things may shake out now.[Thanks, Penny]
