In an attempt to make sure the deadline is met, the firm has battery testing going on 'round the clock in Michigan and Germany that will theoretically simulate a decade of use in just two years. Additionally, it's placing batteries in test Malibus in order to get a feel for real-world results. Still, GM has yet to definitively decide on the final engine or which battery supplier it'll end up working with, but as the eleventh hour grows ever closer, we can only hope that the pieces start to come together.[Via CNET, image courtesy of Reuters]
