 Sure, you could go out and buy one of those ready-made systems-in-a-controller that provide a handful of games to let you wax nostalgic about your button-mashing youth, but to really fulfill that old school craving without cluttering up your living room with dusty consoles, the DIY route remains your best bet. While it may not be quite on the level of some of Ben Heckendorn's own NES hacks, benheck.com forum member G-force nonetheless holds his own with his modded NES controller. Using the ever-versatile system-on-a-chip, the controller boasts 70 built-in, not-quite-legal games, and a cartridge slot on the back so you can put your well-worn collection of carts to good use. The controller also apparently manages to squeeze in a port for a second controller, or a light gun, should the Duck Hunt mood strike you. Of course, no hack would be complete without the requisite LED lights, which G-force artfully positioned inside to illuminate the Nintendo logo when the controller's in use (check it out in action after the break). Unfortunately, he hasn't provided step-by-step plans for the less-l33t among us to build our own unit, but skilled modders should be able to crib enough from the ample supple of pics to whip up their own variation.[Via Ars Technica, thanks Mike]
