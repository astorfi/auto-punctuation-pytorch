Now we're here at Digital Experience with the company's new Roomba 700 series bots, which are considerably less compact than the Scooba, but boast a number of improvements over their predecessors -- namely, better cleaning and detection. Hit up the gallery below for a closer look, and head on past the break for a video of the Scooba 230 for good measure.
