 No sooner than we find out that Japan will be getting a sure-to-be-coveted Pikachu DS Lite, we now know that American DS owners can finally enjoy the luxury of browsing the internet on their handheld with the US version of the Nintendo DS Browser. The cartridge sports an Opera-based browser that takes advantage of the DS's dual-screen approach, and there looks to be different versions depending on whether you're buying for the DS Lite or original DS. Of course, we aren't thrilled by the notion of coughing up $29.99 for this convenience, but at least we Americans now have the option, eh?[Via BrightHand]
