Now that the brand new HTC One is out, it's high time the rest of HTC's siblings get updated to Android's latest, especially if they want to remain relevant. The previous HTC One got the KitKat bump back in February, so now it's the little brother's turn at the firmware upgrade. Yep, if you have a HTC One Mini, you'll likely get your Android 4.4 KitKat with HTC Sense 5.5 update starting today if this post by carrier AT&T is to be believed. The update will bring a number of improvements, like an enhanced dialer app, new navigation bars, a full-screen immersive mode and a new BlinkFeed app. So go on, head into Settings and download the latest System Update to keep up with the cool kids. That is, if you're not tempted to get a new phone altogether.
