 
After an impressive run in theaters and a recent slew of year end awards, it's no surprise Sony Pictures has quickly scheduled the release of The Social Network on Blu-ray for January 11, 2011. The two disc set includes extras like a commentary with director David Fincher, another with writer Aaron Sorkin and the cast, a documentary about the making of the movie and more. Of course, we think they really might be missing out if there's not some sort of BD-Live powered Facebook checkin included, but that's just us.

The film explores the moment at which Facebook, the most revolutionary social phenomenon of the new century, was invented and how its overnight success and wealth changed the lives of the classmates who created it. Described by Frank Rich of The New York Times as "A brilliant film," and by Peter Travers of Rolling Stone as "An American landmark," The Social Network has become a cultural touchstone, recently garnering six Golden Globe® nominations, nine Critics' Choice nominations and winning Best Picture awards from several prominent organizations including the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Board of Review.Directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin, The Social Network stars an ensemble that boasts some of the finest new actors of their generation: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Max Minghella and Rooney Mara. Extensive bonus materials include commentaries with Fincher, Sorkin and the cast, as well as the four-part feature length documentary How Did They Ever Make a Movie of Facebook? which covers the making of the film from the book through production. Viewers will explore the music of the film through a conversation with composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and also in the interactive feature In the Hall of the Mountain King, which allows the same scene to be viewed four different ways with different layers of music. The Social Network will be available on Blu-ray™ for $34.95 and DVD for $28.96 SRP.Synopsis:David Fincher's The Social Network is the stunning tale of a new breed of cultural insurgent: a punk genius who sparked a revolution and changed the face of human interaction for a generation, and perhaps forever. Shot through with emotional brutality and unexpected humor, this superbly crafted film chronicles the formation of Facebook and the battles over ownership that followed upon the website's unfathomable success. With a complex, incisive screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and a brilliant cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake, The Social Network bears witness to the birth of an idea that rewove the fabric of society even as it unraveled the friendship of its creators.Directed by David Fincher, The Social Network has a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.
