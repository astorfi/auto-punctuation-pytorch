Combine the two, however, and you'll be the most fashionable kid at Legoland. Add a random sampling of mystery QR codes and Mister Green Jeans himself will be asking you for couture tips. Best get your order for the $66 Invader Scarf in soon though, Lendorff Kaywa is only knitting 500. [Via Oh GizMo!]
