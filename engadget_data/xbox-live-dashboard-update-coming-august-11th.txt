Microsoft's announced that the next Xbox Live Dashboard update is beaming to your console on August 11th. This one includes Games on Demand, user ratings for games, a number of Netflix additions, and the much-anticipated (maybe not) ability to spend actual money on clothing for your Avatar. What it doesn't have is Twitter, Last.fm, and Facebook support, but according to Microsoft, those are still coming sometime later this fall. You went ahead and signed up for the preview program, right?
