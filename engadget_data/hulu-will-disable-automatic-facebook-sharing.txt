The still-under-previous-ownership Hulu is disabling the Open Graph-powered option to automatically share the videos you watch with your friends on Facebook. According to the video streaming site, the change came because "feedback indicated that people prefer the experience of expressly sharing content." So, if you really want people to know you're watching the latest Switched at Birth, you can just punch the button at the bottom of the page. If you've switched social features on for services like Hulu or Netflix: do you welcome the added control, or are you among those looking forward to a feed with less spam from oversharing friends?
