Dell has announced the phone for our fine country at its CES 2011 press conference, although it failed to mention a price, a release date, or anything else very helpful. Right now Dell doesn't have a carrier partner, so they're planning on selling the handset unlocked from Dell.com. Apparently they're flirting with the idea of a T-Mobile version, but the unlocked model won't have the T-Mobile 3G bands -- basically, it's an unlocked AT&T phone that AT&T hasn't blessed. Oh, and just in case you forgot the specs: WVGA 4.1-inch AMOLED screen, 8 megapixel camera, Android 2.2, and a 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 8250 processor. Got it? Good, now we wait.
