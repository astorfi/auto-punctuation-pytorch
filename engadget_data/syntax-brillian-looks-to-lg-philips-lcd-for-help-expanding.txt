 
To compete in todays flat panel television market, you gottahave size, and Syntax-Brillian has found a way around that. Today they announced they will be buying their LCDscreens from LG.Philips in sizes from 20" to 47". This means S-B will be able to ensure they can get their Olevia branded televisions on store shelves, and LG Philips LCD knows there willalways be someone to buy them, especially with the constant reminders that overcapacity is imminent.This isone of many such partnerships, you'll need a scorecard (if you already don't) to keep track of who actually made the TVsitting in your living room.
