Finally, here we are a whole bunch of months later, the high-end Droid having been released back in November and Verizon still without a midrange choice for Android hopefuls -- but that's about to change. Right, Verizon? Right? The latest intel from Android and Me suggests that the Devour (as it'll almost certainly be known to the public) will feature a Qualcomm MSM7627 -- the same next-gen entry-level core being used by the Pixi that's designed to replace the aging MSM7600 series, very likely a chip that we're going to be seeing a whole lot of over the next 12-18 months in devices that manufacturers don't deem worthy of Snapdragon. Meanwhile, Android Central seems to have scored a shot of some promotional material for the Devour suggesting that it's not far off -- the site says we're looking at a retail box here, but considering how small and narrow the Droid's box is, this could actually be some in-store signage or something to that effect. We'll know soon enough, hopefully.

Update: And look at this, Motorola's support documents for the Devour are now live (we count 10 pages' worth, total). Not too much interesting in here, but we can confirm that the name will be Devour, it's got WiFi, and there'll be a car kit available. Thanks, Stormdancer!
