Destined to support you in your state of involuntary abstinence, the U-Tsu-Shi-O-Mi system maps a pretty girl onto the robot's anatomically correct, green-cloth surface with the help of a sensor-equipped head-mounted display worn by the lonely, lonely man. The result is a 3D character you can touch and "interact" with. Researcher Michihiko Shoji hopes that the system can be commercialized for arcades and for general use around the home. Slather her up with artificial human skin and you've bunged the hole Tux could never quite fill. Also available in a chubby doughboy model if that's how you roll. Video? Oh hells yeah, right after the break.[Via Impress]
