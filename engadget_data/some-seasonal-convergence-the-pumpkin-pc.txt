Here's something to inspire while you're all busy with that snazzy
gadget Halloween costume of yours: the Pumpkin
PC. It's using the guts of a Dell Latitude D410 and runs a 1.6 GHz Intel Centrino processor, which might not be warm
enough for getting those pumpkin seeds all toasty brown the way we likes them, but we'll have to wait for a full review
to find out for sure. This little project by some guys attending the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville has helped
us realize the vast untapped potential of vegetable-based case mods, which seem to be perfect for that produce themed
home theater we've been thinking about throwing together.
