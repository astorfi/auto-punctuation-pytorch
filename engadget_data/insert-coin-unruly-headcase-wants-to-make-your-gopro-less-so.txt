 In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line.
  
We've had a bunch of fun testing out GoPro cameras, but one thing that has always been a source of frustration is the fiddly mount system. A problem that's seemingly inspired a Kickstarter project called Headcase Pro. Effectively it's a lightweight aluminum case aimed at making the GoPro infinitely more mountable. Unlike the bog-standard plastic housing, the Headcase Pro has a self-tightening door that should prevent it from flying open on impact, along with gunk-repelling rubber sealed buttons. Most pleasing to frustrated directors will be the nine threaded mount holes, letting you attach it to your existing tripods and peripherals. Also, the Headcase Pro is large enough to work with the BacPac and battery packs without the need to change doors, and a protective lens ring is a final sweetener. For those of us with more amateur needs, there is the Headgear model, which fits around the standard GoPro case, but still bumps your mount choices and protects your lens. Think this has got legs? Or simply want one for yourself? Then $328 will get you one of the first run, and push the project along to its $25,000 goal. Still not sure? Then focus on the video after the break for a demo.
