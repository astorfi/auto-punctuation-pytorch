        Definitely providing a look at what the follow ups to the HD-A1/XA1HD DVD players here will look like, Toshiba is prepping their HD-E1 and HD-XE1 players for Europe at IFA 2006. Other than sporting what appears to be a more compact design, the low end HD-E1 player due in November includes 720p/1080i output, HDMI 1.2, and support for Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD audio for 599 euros. The top of the line HD-XE1 player adds 1080p and HDMI 1.3 to the list of features when it releases in December. The lower end model will only output 2 channel audio via analog, while the more expensive player includes a 12bit/296MHzDAC and 5.1 analog audio output. HDTV UK has noted that the XE1 will include DVD upconversion to 1080p via HDMI, but neither player will include support for managed copy. Hopefully we'll learn more about these players and Toshiba's plans for the future after they are announced Saturday.[Thanks, WiFiSpy]Read - Toshiba HD-E1 and HD-XE1 players announced - AVS ForumRead - Toshiba Announces HD-E1,HD-XE1 HD DVD Players for Europe - Home Theater BlogRead - IFA 2006 Commences - ImpressRead - IFA 2006: Toshiba names its two HD DVD players for the UK - HDTV UK
