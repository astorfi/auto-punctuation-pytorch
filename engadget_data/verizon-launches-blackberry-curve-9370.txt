Verizon unveiled the latest budget-friendly RIM device for CES and it doesn't depart too much from the QWERTY, candybar mold. In addition to CDMA radios it's also got GSM for globetrotters and NFC for those that want to hop on the next wave of mobile payment tech. Around the back is a 5-megapixel camera, probably not capable of shooting 1080p. The 9370 will run you $99 with a two year contract after a $50 mail-in rebate. And, most importantly, it'll be upgradeable to BlackBerry OS 7.1 -- the most advanced in 20th century smartphone technology.
