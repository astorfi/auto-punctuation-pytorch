Apparently aware of our wandering eye, Acer is set to release a thinner model that, according to speculation, will buck the netbook storage trend by being SSD-only. Beyond that little is known about this streamlined portable, but you can be sure we'll be keeping an eye out for more info -- between fleeting glances at other hot arrivals, of course.
