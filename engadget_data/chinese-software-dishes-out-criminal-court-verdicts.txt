 Apparently our pals over in the Chinese judicial system are getting challenged by technology these days. No, they haven't invented lawyerbots yet (though some of the nursebots we've seen could wield a gavel), but they're getting closer. A new software app implemented in the Zichuan District Court in China's Shangdong province, gives suggestions on "proper verdicts" in criminal cases. This software is apparently going to be used to curb the problem that some Chinese judges have become too subjective, undertrained, and in many cases, corrupt. Maybe in the US we could speed up our own backlog of judicial proceedings simply by outsourcing our judges to China, too. We're sure that would go over well with our litigious society -- we can smell the briefs being drafted already.[Via The Register]
