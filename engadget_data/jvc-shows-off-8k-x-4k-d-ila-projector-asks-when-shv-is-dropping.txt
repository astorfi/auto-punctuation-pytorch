The prototype device boasts a native resolution of 8,192 x 4,320 and packs a dynamic contrast ratio of 1,100,000:1. In case you couldn't guess, its purpose is to display Super High Vision material in all of its natural glory, though only time will tell when that content (and this machine) are widely available to enjoy.[Via AboutProjectors]
