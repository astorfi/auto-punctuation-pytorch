After a long wait, the next crop of Windows Phone handsets are beginning to trickle in, and just in time for the holidays. If you're familiar with our reviews of the HTC 8X and Nokia Lumia 920, you already know that Windows Phone has some impressive contenders in its stable, but these flagship devices only tell half of the story. Now, we're given an opportunity to test the Lumia 810, a mid-range smartphone that's now available on T-Mobile.


It's clear that T-Mobile isn't looking to start a price war here. At $150 after a rebate, the Lumia 810 costs more than Nokia's crown jewel, the Lumia 920, which you can find on AT&T for $100. Another telling sign: the phone also costs more than its siblings, the Lumia 820 for AT&T ($50) and the Lumia 822 for Verizon ($100). Naturally, you'll be able to recoup some of this with T-Mobile's lower monthly fees, but it goes without saying that T-Mobile is levying an early adopter tax on its subscribers. That said, for those sold on Windows Phone yet unwilling to jump ship, you're left to choose between the Lumia 810 and the more expensive HTC 8X. Along with its lower cost, Nokia holds an ace up its sleeve in the form of its home-brewed Windows Phone apps, which may be enough to sway customers away from HTC's flagship. Will the extra card be enough for a winning hand? Join us after the break as we explore the finer points of the Lumia 810.




Hardware
If you like substantial handsets, you're going to dig the Lumia 810. For others, its shape may be a bit of a sticking point, as it's one of the chunkier smartphones we've come across in quite some time. Despite the relatively common 4.3-inch display size, Nokia's latest creation for T-Mobile is surprisingly large. To put things in perspective, the phone nearly matches the height and width of the HTC One X, and yet at 0.43 inch (10.9mm) deep, it's also quite a bit thicker. If you'd prefer a more compact Windows Phone, look to the HTC 8X instead, which is easily the more svelte of the two, despite the similar dimensions.

Beyond its physical dimensions, the Lumia 810's substantial appearance is reinforced by its aesthetic design. Unlike most smartphones, which attempt to disguise their girth with curved or beveled edges, the Lumia 810 flaunts its thickness with clean edges and flat sides that are fused with the tapered rear casing. Overall, the handset is very comfortable to hold, and more importantly, it's easy to operate with one hand. You might notice, however, that it's a bit more difficult to slip into your pocket, given that thick profile.


The Lumia 810 is a spiritual successor to the Lumia 800 and, when it comes to T-Mobile's offerings, the Lumia 710. From a design standpoint, however, it represents a fresh start for Nokia. Unsurprisingly, the phone has similar proportions as the Lumia 820 for AT&T and the Lumia 822 for Verizon. Still, without rounded sides or corners, the Lumia 810 is the most elegant of the bunch. The face of the phone is also spare: it's just a solid, expansive sheet of glass. It houses the front-facing 1.2-megapixel camera, ambient light and proximity sensors, an earpiece and the capacitive Windows Phone navigation buttons. Absent from the equation is a notification light, which is a distinct advantage of the HTC 8X.

Situated in the middle of it all, of course, is that 4.3-inch, 800 x 480 (WVGA) ClearBlack AMOLED display. Unique to Nokia, the screen features a polarized filter that makes it easier to view content in direct sunlight, and in this regard, it really is a step above the competition. As another differentiator, it's also possible to manipulate the screen with your fingernails or even while wearing gloves. Yes, bare fingers are still ideal, but the utility here is hard to ignore. Overall, the display offers plenty of real estate for content, vibrant colors, deep blacks and superb viewing angles. There are a few downsides, however, as text appears surprisingly jagged within the web browser and the display's white balance is decidedly on the cool end of the spectrum.


The rear cover of the Lumia 810 is, in fact, a complete shell that wraps around the sides of the device. As such, it also contains the volume rocker, power button and dual-stage camera shutter button, which are located on the right side of the shell. As a bit of good news, right-handed folks should have no trouble cranking up the volume or waking the device, as both buttons are within thumb's reach. On the bottom, you'll find a micro-USB port that's situated between two grilles, which conceal the loudspeaker on the left and the primary microphone on the right. Up top, you'll find a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack and an additional microphone for recording stereo sound. The phone's rear is quite spartan, containing a vertical camera pod -- complete with Nokia and Carl Zeiss badging -- along with a dual-LED flash. As a nod to those who easily get bored, the rear cover is completely interchangeable, and purchasers may choose between shells with different colors and textures, along with ones that support Qi wireless charging.

For the most part, the Lumia 810's thickness is a differentiator, rather than a hindrance. It's also somewhat necessary, as the phone offers built-in support for the Qi wireless charging standard, which means it's compatible with Nokia's charging pillow from Fatboy. Once the rear cover is removed, you'll find a removable 1,800mAh battery that occupies a substantial amount of space. You'll also discover a micro-SIM tray and a microSD slot, along with an NFC antenna that's built into the rear shell.


Beyond design, there are a few other differentiators between the Lumia 810, 820 and 822 versions. In terms of battery capacity, the Lumia 810 and 822 both sport 1,800mAh cells, whereas the 820 offers only a 1,650mAh option. It's a similar story for the front-facing cameras, as both T-Mobile and Verizon's phones are capable of capturing 1,280 x 960 imagery, while AT&T's version is limited to VGA quality. With respect to internal storage, Verizon's Lumia 822 takes the prize with 16GB built-in, whereas the Lumia 810 and 820 offer 8GB. This last consideration shouldn't be much of a deal-breaker, however, as all three phones accommodate up to 64GB of expandable storage. It's also worth mentioning that the HTC 8X doesn't have a microSD slot, which could be enough to make the Lumia 810 an easy choice for some T-Mobile shoppers.

Nokia's inclusion of a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 in the 810 isn't much of a surprise, as it's part of the current Windows Phone reference platform. We'll discuss performance in greater detail a bit later, but with a 1.5GHz dual-core Krait CPU and an Adreno 225 GPU, you can rest assured that the Lumia 810 offers nimble performance. Naturally, the Snapdragon S4 also offers up a wide array of connectivity options, which include DC-HSPA+ access over the 850, 1700, 1900 and 2100MHz bands, along with 802.11a/b/g/n and Bluetooth 3.0. For a more detailed breakdown, we've included a complete spec sheet for your perusal.

It almost goes without saying that Windows Phone 8 and a Snapdragon S4 combine to offer excellent performance. As you might expect, benchmark scores place the Lumia 810 roughly in line with the Lumia 920 and HTC 8X, and real-world performance is every bit as solid. As is often the story for Windows Phone, many of the stock applications pop open nearly immediately, with the operating system's characteristic animations being the only delay. Nokia's own apps are also quite quick to load, although third-party titles such as Yelp and Weather Channel take a bit longer -- somewhere in the ballpark of two to three seconds.

Internet Explorer 10 is usually quick to initially render pages, but complex sites sometimes require a decent amount of time to fully load. This would normally be a minor annoyance at most, but if you've become accustomed to panning and zooming through content as it's still loading, you're likely to experience stutters and longer-than-normal render times. So, despite the browser's excellent SunSpider benchmark scores, we're left with the impression that Internet Explorer needs a bit more polish to match the overall fluid experience of Chrome and Safari.


In real-world use, the Lumia 810 is a generally competent performer, but there are areas where it still needs improvement. For example, while the camera app is quick to load, it generally takes three to four seconds to capture the first shot. Likewise, cold-booting takes somewhere in the 40-second range, which is about twice the time we've come to expect from modern smartphones. Perhaps its strongest point is that it grabs its GPS positioning from satellites nearly instantaneously. That's a nice touch, given the company's emphasis on location-aware apps. Those who demand excellent call quality can also rest at ease, as all of our calls were consistently clear and free of distortion. Likewise, those on the other end were similarly impressed with the clear call quality.

As for battery life, we were easily able to squeeze more than two days out of the 810 with light to moderate usage, as the phone runs very efficiently in standby mode. In a more strenuous test -- which involved constantly snapping and uploading photos, messaging, browsing the web in sunlight and navigating throughout town -- the Lumia 810 chewed through half of its battery capacity after four hours. Meanwhile, the Lumia 810 survived for 2.5 hours in the WPBench battery torture test, which puts it directly on par with the Lumia 920 and HTC 8X. When it came time to juice up, we found that Nokia's micro-USB charger was able to take the battery from empty to full in two hours. From our experience, it generally takes longer to charge phones wirelessly, although we weren't able to test this with the Lumia 810.

Nokia prides itself on stacking its phones with excellent camera hardware, but it also has a reputation for finicky setups that often require users to fine-tune the settings in order to capture the best possible shots. Fortunately, the 810's camera is on its best behavior; the phone is able to produce some impressive shots even in auto mode.
