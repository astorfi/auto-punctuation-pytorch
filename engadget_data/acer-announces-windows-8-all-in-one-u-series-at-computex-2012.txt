 
 Acer just introduced two Windows 8-equipped U Series all-in-one desktops here at Computer 2012 in Taipei -- the 27-inch Aspire 7600U and 23-inch Aspire 5600U. The 7600U features a 64-point capacitive multitouch tilt and swivel display and is only 3.5cm (1.38 inches) thick, while the 5600U is billed as "the thinnest AIO available" (no numbers specified). Both system feature HD visuals and Dolby Home Theater Surround sound, but the company isn't ready to share any other details on specs.

 We spent a brief minute with the larger 7600U and witnessed its ability to tilt 90 degrees from vertical to horizontal and then swivel from landscape to portrait mode -- turning it into the world's biggest e-book reader. There are two USB ports and a DC power connector in the back, two USB ports, audio in / out and an SD-card slot on the left side plus a slot-load Blu-Ray drive on the right edge. Check out the gallery below, then hit the break for our hands-on video and the obligatory PR.
