Withings has just announced that the world's first WiFi-enabled bathroom scale has made its way into the States after a few months abroad, and we have to say, this could change everything. When pouncing upon it, the scale automatically records the user's body weight, lean / fat mass and calculated body mass index (BMI) to his or her secure webpage, and if you're more the iPhone type, it can beam data to a Withings iPhone app as well. It's available now for $159, but you can certainly wait 'til your latest diet has had some sort of effect before bringing one home. A delightful demonstration video is waiting for you just past the break.
