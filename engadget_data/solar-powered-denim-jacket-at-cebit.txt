Bogner promises the jacket will keep your iPod, cellphone, and laptop charged as you make your way through theday (though we'll probably stick with a solar paneled bag for chargingup the laptop). Although we won't argue with yet another product lookingout for the battery life of gadgets, we're not sure if sticking some solar panel shoulder patches on designer denim isgoing to make for the best look. Even a big Roadhouse fan would have to admit that lugging a laptop around in yourjacket doesn't make you look any tougher, but then again, neither does having Swayze's immaculately combed hair andrugged good looks.
