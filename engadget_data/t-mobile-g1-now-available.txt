That's right -- the Android-powered G1 is now available for sale from T-Mob's website to all comers, though we're only seeing the black and bronze models listed at the moment and both are tagged with an ominous "extremely limited availability" label which tells us they probably won't be there long. $179.99's the price on two-year contract, and if they do sell out online, don't sweat it just yet -- sweep your local stores today.Update: Full press release with all the details just hit the wires. Remember, all T-Mobile retail shops will open early at 08:00AM if you want to get your G1 on before the rush to the office.[Thanks, Elisha]
