When Google showed off a new and revolutionary Gmail Motion control scheme yesterday, it failed to fool most people, but it didn't fail to catch the attention of some motion control geeks with Kinect cameras on hand. Yep, the FAAST crew that's already brought us a Kinect keyboard emulator for World of Warcraft has taken Google to task and actually cooked up the software to make Gmail Motion work. All your favorite gestures are here: opening an email as if it were an envelope, replying by throwing a thumb back and, of course, "licking the stamp" to send your response on its way. Marvelous stuff! Jump past the break to see it working, for real this time.
