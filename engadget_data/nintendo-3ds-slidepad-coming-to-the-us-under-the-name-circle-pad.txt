At the time, there was no indication that the add-on would be coming to North America anytime soon, but according to Capcom, it's on its way. Speaking at New York Comic Con last week, Capcom's Ryan McDougall confirmed that the attachment will indeed arrive Stateside by February 7th, alongside the company's new 3DS game, "Resident Evil: Revelations." It's not clear whether the add-on will arrive for other games released before February, but it may very well have a different name by the time it does. According to Siliconera, Nintendo has already filed a Japanese trademark for the name Circle Pad Pro, which could be the moniker we'll be seeing in the West. Nintendo, it should be noted, has yet to confirm any of this, nor has it mentioned anything about US pricing, but we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.
