The first goal is to come up with a way to sate Congress's demands for a nation-wide broadband service, as opening up the airwaves would certainly be a lot cheaper than running more wires everywhere. Secondly, though, the FCC wants to assuage issues cellular providers are having in keeping bits flowing to all those fancy new smartphones. Exactly how long it'll take for the FCC to rope off another few bands of frequencies for use remains to be seen, but we're sure whenever it does it'll use them as another reason to block white space approval.
