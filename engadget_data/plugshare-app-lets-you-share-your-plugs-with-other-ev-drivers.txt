Then you might want to consider using the new PlugShare app for iOS devices that was just released today, which will let you broadcast your location and plug status to everyone passing by. Of course, there are also some privacy settings if you prefer to control things a bit more tightly, and the app also includes a complete database of public charging stations across the US if you'd rather not bother someone else at all when you're out on the road. What's more, while the app is iOS-only at the moment, the company promises that an Android version is "coming soon." Head on past the break for a quick demo video.
