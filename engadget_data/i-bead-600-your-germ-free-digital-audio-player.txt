You know, it's not just your cellphone that gets all
nasty with bacteria â€” think of how often your MP3 player gets fondled by those grubby mitts. That
other player? Totally a walking
Staphlococcus trap! Pick yourself up an i-Bead 600 for some disease-free tunes, as its Silver Nano coating kills 99.9%
of the bad nasties with its specially-formulated antibacterial, disinfectant and deodorizing blend of whoopass. Plus,
it's loaded with MP3/WMA/ASF/WAV/OGG, FM tuner, voice recorder and line-in encoding goodness at a rumoured price of
$165 for 512MB. Sick! We also appreciate the tasteful green Wookie photo shoot the i-Bead PR folks decided to spring
for on this.
