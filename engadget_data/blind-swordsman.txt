Virtual reality gaming isn't just about immersing yourself in visuals... it can be about sound, too. If you need proof, you only need to look at (or rather, hear) Scott Leaman's experimental Gear VR game Blind Swordsman. The title has you fending off a trio of killers using only the directional audio cues in your headphones. You have to listen carefully, face your enemy and swing before it's too late. The concept is simple on the surface, but it's reportedly very involving -- and it takes advantage of technology that wasn't viable until recently, such as cordless VR and positional sound software. Blind Swordsman isn't as superficially impressive as other virtual experiences, but it does serve as a friendly reminder that VR opens up creative possibilities beyond graphics.
