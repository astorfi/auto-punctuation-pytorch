 Those of us waiting for the next fully featured HD DVD release after Fast and the Furious 3: Tokyo Drift now have Accepted to look forward to, on November 14th. Universal is pulling out all the stops on this summer comedy about a guy who opens his own university with a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack, U-control interactive features and 1080p bonus footage on the HD DVD side of the combo disc. The typical $39.98 MSRP for a combo disc applies, HD DVD owners have been waiting for more extras and it certainly appears that Universal is equipped to deliver them on every new release now. Accepted vs. Black Hawk Down...decisions, decisions.
