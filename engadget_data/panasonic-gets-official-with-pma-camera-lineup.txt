As expected, those include new entries in the company's LZ, FS and TZ-series as well as, perhaps most notably, the FX35 (that's the tiny one up above), which is the first Lumix with a 25mm wide-angle lens. Hit up the appropriate read links below for the official word on each camera from Panasonic, or just head on over after the break for a rundown of the key specs.Read - Panasonic Lumix FX35Read - Panasonic Lumix LZ-SeriesRead - Panasonic Lumix FS-SeriesRead - Panasonic Lumix TZ-Series
