Both start with optical image stabilization and Canon's new DIGIC 4 image processor. The $400 SD990 IS then sprinkles in a 14.7 megapixel sensor, 3.7x optical zoom, and 2.5-inch LCD while the $300 SD880 IS drops the sensor to 10 megapixels while boosting the LCD and Zoom a bit to 3-inches and 4x, respectively. Both should land for retail sometime in October.
