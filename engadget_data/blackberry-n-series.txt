 Well, well, well, here's a holiday treat for the BlackBerry enthusiast in your life. CN Beta has a pair of enticing images purporting to be the forthcoming keyboard-packing N-Series from RIM. The picture of the back, sadly, is the sharper of the two, but the above shot still gives a pretty clear look at what may well be the BlackBerry 10 handset for those power users who just can't say goodbye to the world of physical keyboards. Either way, it won't be too long until we know for sure. In the meantime, we'll see you after the break for a view of what the back of such a device just might hold.
