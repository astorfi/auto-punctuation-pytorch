It looks like Lenovo's got some new Ideapads heading our way... if we're lucky. This photo was apparently taken at a recent company event in Beijing, and shows off a new model -- the 14-inch Z460 -- which reportedly boasts a 2.13GHz Intel Core i3 processor, ATI HD5145 graphics, 2GB of RAM, a 320GB SATA, and Windows 7 Home Basic operating system. That's about all the detail we have on this one, and there's no word yet on pricing or availability stateside. We'll keep our eyes peeled for you!
