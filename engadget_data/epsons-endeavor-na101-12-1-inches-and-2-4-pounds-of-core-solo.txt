This 2.4-pound (sans dual-layer DVD writer) laptop can bring the 1.2GHz Core Solo U1400 (or Celeron M 423), a 12.1-inch, 1024 x 768 (XGA) LCD, Intel 945GMS Express graphics, a 100GB UltraATA/100 disk, up to 1.5GB memory, Bluetooth, WiFi, and up to 12.6 hours off long haul battery. You also get the usual assortment of USB 2.0 and Firewire ports, a PCMCIA slot, and multi-format memory card reader. Lightweight, yeah, but at 1.3~1.4-inches around the waist, she's a bit too meaty to be called "ultra-portable." Should be ready to ship in Japan starting early July for about Â¥144,480 (or about $1,243) lightly spec'd.[Via Impress]Impress
