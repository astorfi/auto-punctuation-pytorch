Why's that? While tethering seems to be simply due to a lack of an app that "isn't part of this update," the mobile hotspot issue is a bit more curious -- Verizon spokesperson Brenda Raney says that the Droid "doesn't have [the] hardware to support a mobile hotspot." No further explanation than that, but we have a sneaking suspicion that Motorola and Verizon aren't passing over the feature because of a lack of hardware, but because of too much hardware -- namely, the Droid 2 and Droid X.

Correction: It's Verizon making this claim, not Motorola.
