Keeping device availability tucked firmly under its hat, Best Buy is now offering Nokia's Lumia 920 and the HTC 8X for pre-sale, priced at $149.99 and $99.99, respectively. Early buyers have options, too: the Lumia 920 is kitted out in red, blue, yellow, black and white shells. Fashionistas with a flair for purple, however, will need to stick to HTC's hardware. Unfortunately, you don't get that much choice -- Best Buy's pre-orders don't balk at the devices' AT&T exclusivity. The retailer doesn't say when devices are going to ship, but we imagine early adopters won't have to wait too long.

 Update: The Lumia 920 has disappeared from Best Buy's listings, while the 8X remains. This seems to suggest that pre-order stock for Nokia's new flagship has sold out, but given the short time it was available, let's hope that other issues are to blame and the absence is only temporary.
