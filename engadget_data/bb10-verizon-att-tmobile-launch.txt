 Can't wait for RIM's big mobile refresh? Neither can major US carriers, apparently. Just like Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile have confirmed that they'll be carrying BlackBerry 10 devices at launch, too. Hardly a surprise, considering all three carriers have stocked RIM hardware in the past -- but still an important win for customers betting on BlackBerry. UK carriers announced something similar recently as well. As VP Alec Saunders tells us, BB10's designed to be different and to move you forward -- and going by what we've experienced so far, the upcoming six pack just might help the folks at Waterloo move forward, too.
