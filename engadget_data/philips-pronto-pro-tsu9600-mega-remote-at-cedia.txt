Supposedly the TSU-9600 will feature everything from a 3.7-inch VGA touchscreen display to IR and wireless extenders, a soft touch finish, and features improved IR learning, PC macro downloads, even voice recognition. This is sure to be one of those you can't afford it if you have to ask the price scenarios, but we'll keep you apprised as to its existence (or arrival, as it were) when the time comes.
