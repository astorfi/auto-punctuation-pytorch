 The Weather Channel has dwelt mostly on its iOS apps as of late, but don't worry -- it's lavishing attention on forecast-minded Android users today. As of version 4.0, the Android app is optimized for tablets and gives a better heads-up for the conditions ahead from your Nexus 7. Other tweaks are more for feature parity, including precisely-timed warnings for significant weather changes, faster radar maps and higher-detail forecasts. Favorites also help with Android-specific widgets. Should you need to know more about the rain or snow than a Google Now card can deliver, the Weather Channel revamp is ready at the source.
