Sprint has a little extra room to spare in the lower end of its lineup, so it's tossing in the Kyocera Milano. The device is rumored to run on Gingerbread and may include an 800MHz CPU with 512MB of RAM, a 3-inch display, a 1,340mAh battery, a 3.2 megapixel camera and a slide-out keyboard. It's likely to be hitting Sprint on September 9th for $50, just in case you've always wanted a phone with an uncanny resemblance to the cookie of the same name.
