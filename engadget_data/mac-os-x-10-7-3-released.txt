   How about a 700+ megabyte download to spice up your Wednesday? Apple's just unleashed an update to Lion, bumping its feline all the way up 10.7.3. Those braving the rather portly update can look forward to a bevy of new languages, a new version of Safari (5.1.3) and a fix for a nasty WiFi reconnection bug upon waking from sleep. Also buried in the release notes are RAW support for "more cameras" and a bevy of tweaks for those sharing files with Windows machines. Don't believe us? Hit Cupertino's source link for the full rundown.
