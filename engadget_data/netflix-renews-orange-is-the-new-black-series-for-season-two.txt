Netflix is putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to building a library of first-run content, tonight announcing it's signed up new series Orange is the New Black for a second season, set for release in 2014. That's particularly notable because unlike Hemlock Grove's renewal last week, this series hasn't even been posted to the streaming site yet. It's not the company's first bold move however, as it signed up for two seasons of House of Cards without seeing anything first, but that had David Fincher and Kevin Spacey attached. This new show is written by Weeds creator Jenji Kohan and follows a woman from Brooklyn sentenced to 15 months in federal prison -- season one debuts July 11th.

Produced by Lionsgate Television, the hour-long series starring Taylor Schilling, and based on the popular memoir of the same name by Piper Kerman, is set to debut its first 13-episode season on Thursday, July 11 at 12:01 AM PDT in all territories where Netflix is available â€“ U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Latin America, Brazil and the Nordics.

"Jenji and her team have produced a phenomenal series and we're eager to get a second season to our viewers," said Cindy Holland, Vice President of Original Content at Netflix.

"I am thrilled that Netflix has extended my sentence," said series creator and executive producer Jenji Kohan.

"We're enormously proud of the brilliant work of Jenji, the cast and the entire production team," said Kevin Beggs, president, Lionsgate Television Group, "and we're delighted about this early second season renewal. Netflix has been a great partner on this series and we look forward to our continuing collaboration."

"Orange is the New Black" follows engaged Brooklynite Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), whose decade-old relationship with drug-runner Alex (Laura Prepon) results in her arrest and 15-month long detention in a federal penitentiary. To pay her debt to society, Piper must trade her comfortable New York life with fiance Larry (Jason Biggs) for an orange prison jumpsuit and a baffling prison culture where she is forced to question everything she believes and form unexpected new alliances with a group of eccentric and outspoken inmates. The series' diverse ensemble also includes Kate Mulgrew, Natasha Lyonne, Pablo Schreiber, Danielle Brooks, Laverne Cox and Taryn Manning.

The second season of "Orange is the New Black" is set to begin production later this summer.

"Orange is the New Black" is executive produced by Kohan. The series is produced by Lionsgate Television for Netflix.
