Both are built around NVIDIA's 1GHz Tegra 2 chip, which has been the most popular thing out here in Vegas after the free food and shuttle rides (Moto even has the Droid Bionic, a 4.3-incher bound for Verizon, using it). But what does that extra core matter to you? Well, aside from facilitating 1080p video playback on both phones, it does make them quite formidable mobile gaming stations. NVIDIA took the time to show us a couple of games being handled with ease by the 2X and Atrix before noting that it isn't leaving it entirely up to Google to provide the compelling content for its hardware. Gaming is, after all, close to the GeForce maker's heart, and we were told that NVIDIA is working closely with developers to help them exploit the added firepower of Tegra 2 so as to deliver prettier, shinier things on screen. We were also informed of the introduction of a Tegra Zone, an Android app designed to serve as a showcase of Tegra partners' wares, whether they be video or gaming content, though you shouldn't fear the specter of fragmentation here -- it's not a separate app store, any purchases will be directed through the Android Market. Anyhow, enough talking, there's video to be watched after the break.
