Serving as its flagship model, Sharp unveiled the first 80-inch (80" diagonal) screen size class Quattron™ 3D LED TV, available in April 2012.   "As the number one market share leader in the large screen television market, we're excited to provide consumers with more choices, better designs and innovative features," said John Herrington, president of Sharp Electronics Marketing Company of America, a division of Sharp Electronics Corporation. "It's clear that consumers are looking for the biggest television experience coupled with the highest picture quality possible, which is exactly what Sharp is delivering in 2012."   The New 2012 Line-Up  Sharp will expand upon its market-leading selection of large-screen LED TVs in 2012 by offering a wider array of choices to consumers, including more than 20 models in screen size classes of 60-inches or larger, many featuring 3D in 120Hz or 240Hz panel options. The AQUOS Quattron models will feature the new Quad Pixel Plus II technology. All Sharp AQUOS LED TVs meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® version 5.3 standards, drawing a relatively small amount of power for their screen sizes. The 80" class LC-80LE632U is the most energy-efficient flat-panel TV available today, as measured by power consumption per square inch. On average, it costs just $22 per year in electricity use to operate.   Taking the 80-inch Class to a New Dimension  In September 2011, Sharp launched the industry's largest LED TV with its 80-inch class LC-80LE632U, providing more than twice the screen area of a 55-inch TV. Today, Sharp is taking the 80-inch class TV to a new dimension with the launch of the new LC-80LE844U. Available in April, the full HD 1080p LC-80LE844U features a vivid 3D image, employing Sharp's Quattron technology with full array LED backlighting and a newly developed 240Hz AQUOS LCD panel to virtually eliminate blur during fast-moving video. The LC-80LE844U also boasts built-in WiFi, 4 HDMI® inputs and the new SmartCentral user interface.   Enhanced Picture Quality  Sharp is introducing Quad Pixel Plus II, the latest innovation for its exclusive Quattron technology. Quad Pixel Plus II, available on the 60-inch (60 1/32" diagonal) and 70-inch (69 ½" diagonal) classes Sharp AQUOS Quattron 8 and 9 series LED TVs, offers even greater detail, smoother lines and color transitions. Sharp is improving picture quality even more in the 9 Series with the introduction of full array LED backlighting with local dimming, which provides deep black levels and an optimal contrast ratio, while reducing energy consumption. Local dimming allows specific groups of LEDs to be dimmed for greater control of brightness and darkness in different areas of the screen for outstanding black levels.   Ownership Experience  AQUOS connected TV owners have access to AQUOS Advantage LIVE℠, Sharp's unique, complimentary customer support program. AQUOS Advantage Live allows trained advisors to remotely connect via the Internet to AQUOS TVs to assist with setup, troubleshooting and picture optimization. And with LIVE answer, Sharp's experts are available to customers through a dedicated line, 1-87-SEE-AQUOS, providing instantaneous, remote access to representatives. SmartCentral will be integrated in most of Sharp's new 2012 LED TVs, including the 6, 7, 8 and 9 Series.
