As the device's manual helpfully informs, this one will let you set up an ad hoc wireless network between two computers without the need for a router or any network infrastructure, or between a PC and a USB-equipped peripheral like a printer or an external drive. Naturally, there's no word on a price or release date just yet, although it seems likely that the final product will come from another company and not Wisair itself, at least if the company's past track record is any indication.
