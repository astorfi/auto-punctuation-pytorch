Like HTC before them, Taiwanese Asustek Computer will begin pushing their ASUS brand front and center. To make this happen, Asustek's OEM business will split from their branded business under the new names of Pegatron (PC-related manufactuing) and Unihan (casing, modules, and non-PC goods) starting January 2008. Trouble for the establishment, maybe, but nothing short of good for us consumers.
