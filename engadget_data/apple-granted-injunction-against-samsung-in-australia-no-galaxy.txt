  Among the many battlegrounds in the legal spat between Samsung and Apple, the case filed down under has had some of the most action. Just over a week ago, Apple wanted nothing to do with Samsung's attempt to settle the suit. Today, the crowd in Cupertino is glad that they rebuffed Sammy's overtures, because the Federal Court in Australia granted Apple's injunction barring the Galaxy Tab 10.1 from appearing in Aussie stores. That means that Sammy's svelte slate will not be for sale (legally, anyway) in Australia unless it can convince the court that its tablet doesn't infringe Apple's patents at trial. You've won this battle, Apple, time will tell if you win the war.
