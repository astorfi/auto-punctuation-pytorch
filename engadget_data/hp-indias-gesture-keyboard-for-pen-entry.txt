People using non-Roman characters never forget that these keyboards weren't designed forthem, and have spent decades searching for alternatives. The latest, developed by HP Labs India, is the gesture-basedkeyboard, which is actually a pen tablet that uses a stroke-based system to recognize characters in non-Romanlanguages. It was designed specifically to deal with languages in use in the subcontinent, such as Tamil and Kannada,but has potential for other Asian languages as well. The system was designed to be rugged, and to be usable by peoplewith no prior experience with keyboards or the Roman alphabet. HP expects to license the technology to a third-partymanufacturer for commercialization.
