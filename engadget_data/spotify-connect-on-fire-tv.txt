Amazon's Fire TV hasn't had a lot of choices for on-demand music; for the most part, you've been stuck with either the company's own music service or Vevo. As of today, though, you can add Spotify to the list. The set-top box now serves as a Spotify Connect target, letting you send songs to the Fire TV using your mobile devices as remote controls. You'll still need a Spotify Premium subscription to get those streams going, but that may be a small price to pay if you're hoping to use your TV as a jukebox.
