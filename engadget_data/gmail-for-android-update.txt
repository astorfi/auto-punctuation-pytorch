Hours after Google released the latest update to its Gmail app for iOS, the folks in Mountain View have pushed the new software to the Android faithful everywhere. While some were able to snag a look earlier this week, the retooled mailbox is now available for all. This version touts new inbox features, slide-out navigation, the ability to reply / archive / delete from notifications, improved search and labels API for third-party devs. Also of note: Google hasn't nixed the Delete button, it just hid it by default. You can re-enable the feature in the "Archive & delete actions" tab of the General Settings menu by ticking "Show archive & delete." If you haven't yet recieved the signal atop your handset or slate, head over to the source link below to beam the update to your device(s).
