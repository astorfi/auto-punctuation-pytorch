Just as long as you've got a €1,000 pre-tax bounty saved up for the Arte or €1,150 for the Sapphire Arte when they ship in Q4 2007 and Q1 2008, respectively. For that you get a 2.0-inch QVGA OLED display, 3.2 megapixel camera, 1GB of built-in memory, an anti-fingerprint coating on the metal and glass, and a leather pouch with linen-lining to keep things tidy. A turn-to-mute feature allows owners to quiet their phone by simply turning it over -- the phone equivalent of a huffy, raised-palm pirouette. It also ships with a Nokia BH-803 noise-cancelling Bluetooth headset which should help to minimize the "new money" whispers from behind your back.
