The company announced during its keynote that it's giving away 5,000 Samsung-built developer "PCs" to attendees, and that AT&T will throw in a year of 3G service (2GB per month) for good measure. And, yes, if you haven't noticed, Microsoft is intent on calling every Windows 8 device a "PC," even tablets. In this case, that PC comes complete with a second-gen Intel Core i5 processor, an 11.6-inch 1,366 x 768 Samsung Super PLS display, a 64GB SSD, 4GB of RAM, and a dock with a USB, HDMI and Ethernet ports.
