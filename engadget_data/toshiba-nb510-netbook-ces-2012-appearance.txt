According to Notebook Italia, the Japanese company is expected to introduce the NB510 mini-machine in Las Vegas next week, splitting the numerical difference between the NB500 and NB520 from a year ago. The rig's said to be sporting Intel's Cedar Trail Atom processors, accompanied by one gig of DDR3 RAM, a WSVGA (1,024 x 600) display and it'll be running on Windows 7 Starter Edition. Price tag on the lappy might be â‚¬340 (around $400 in US cash) for the entry-level variant, but we'll hold our horses on that until we see an official unveiling in the upcoming days.
