Sony won't have many rabbits to pull out of its hat once its big IFA press conference rolls around in a couple of hours. All of its latest camcorders have leaked out thanks to B&H Electronics, and now its rumored QX10 and QX100 'lens cameras' have appeared on Amazon. The Carl Zeiss zoom glass is married to a built in 2/3-inch, 18-megapixel sensor on QX10, while the QX100 has the same 1-inch sensor as the RX100 Mark II. The latter has an f/1.8-f/4.9 lens, while the Q10 has a more pedestrian f/3.3-f/5.9 aperture range. Each attaches to your smartphone via a clip, and will come in silver or black with an SD card slot. Your smartphone will link up via NFC and WiFi, and essentially act as a screen, shutter trigger, backup storage and social-media sharing tool. We also have the all-important price: the QX10 will run $248, while the QX100 is $498. That's quite a sum to spend on an unproven device that doesn't do anything without a smartphone. Then again, the stunning RX100 Mark II is $650, and Samsung's mirrorless Galaxy NX Android camera... well let's not even go there.
