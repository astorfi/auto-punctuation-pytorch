We were feeling pretty good about this one, that is, until we finally tracked it down: azitastore.com lists it for â‚¬735 (yes, that's around $1,068). This is clearly only for those of you who put the word "disposable" in "income." Looks like we're going to have to find another way to keep our Lady Gaga headphones safe and secure, after all...
