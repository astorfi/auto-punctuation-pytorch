Wonder no more, as it's merely a tweak for Samsung's Media Hub application that disables downloads over 3G. It's kind of a shame, really, as that means if you don't live in an LTE market you'll need to be tied to a WiFi hotspot to get your multimedia there, but Verizon claims it's a compromise to "ensure quality and speed."

Meanwhile, Verizon's other LTE handset is getting an additional boon -- the carrier's extending its free wireless hotspot offer through June 15th for the HTC Thunderbolt, after which you can expect to pay $20 a month for the WiFi tethering privilege. Enjoy it while it lasts, folks.
