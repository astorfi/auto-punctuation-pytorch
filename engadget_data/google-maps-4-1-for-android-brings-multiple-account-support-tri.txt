This time around we're looking at 4.1, though the mere 0.1 bump in the version number really doesn't do this thing justice -- they've redesigned the results screen, added a swipe gesture for moving between results, served up a new Latitude widget for the home screen, and brought in support for multiple Google accounts (for seeing different Buzz follows, for instance). The icing on the cake, though, is a new live wallpaper for Android 2.1 phones that's a live map of your location, which sounds absurdly awesome -- assuming it doesn't beat your battery to a bloody pulp with constant GPS access, of course. It's available now from the good ol' Market for devices running Android 1.6 and up, so if you're on a device that's still stuck on Cupcake, feel free to shake your fist angrily at the sky a couple times. Interestingly, Google specifically says that the live wallpaper feature works on "Android 2.1+" devices -- a sign that the next major build is around the corner, perhaps?
