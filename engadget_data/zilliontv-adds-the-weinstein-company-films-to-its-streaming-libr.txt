For those who've already forgotten, ZillionTV is the streaming to TV service with designs on selling its hardware to customers via their ISPs, then streaming content free with ads as well as providing pay video on-demand. Even without flicks like Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Vicky Cristina Barcelona and The Reader, it already had a competent lineup of content partners, but now ZillionTV is looking even more like a legitimate challenger, if only we had a few more details to go on.
