Stemming from the existing StopBadware group that began in 2006, the group will develop policies, build a platform for identifying scofflaws and share trends with government and law enforcement. For its part, Google curbed 130 million ads promoting counterfeit articles, malware and worse in 2011, but said baddies would normally move their shady businesses to another corner of the internet. Thus, the aim of this new league is to aid players across the web with its super resources in a bid to stop the knavery, no matter where it tries to hide.
