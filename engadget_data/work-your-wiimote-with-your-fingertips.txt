The "hack" involves sticking the reflective pads on your fingertips, and placing a Wiimote close to an infrared emitter, with the result being that the Wiimote thinks it's moving when in fact your fingers are. The hack won't work very well with your Wii -- can't press dem buttons! -- so it's limited to gimmicky Minority Report-style demos on your PC. Besides, isn't the whole point of couch potato gaming that you don't have to lift a finger?[Via Hackaday]
