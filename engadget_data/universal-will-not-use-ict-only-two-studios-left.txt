       BusinessWEEK is reporting that Universal has decided not to take advantage of the image constraint token. While some are still skeptical of the studios and their long termgoals, all but Warner and Lions Gate have announced that they will not down-rez analog outputs.Â  This is greatnews for those of us who either have no choice but to use analog inputs or those of us who choose to use them. The bad news is that it appears Warner is going to down-rez according to the article; "Execs at WarnerBrothers declined to comment, but sources with knowledge of the studio's plans say "at least some" of the 20HD-DVD releases planned through April will use the software." I knew at least one studio would do it, but I wishit wasn't them, I will have a hard time boycotting "The Matrix" because I don't plan to buy any movies thatdown-rez. We will see how long that lasts. Now we just wait and see what Lions Gate does, but I have a bad feeling thatno news is bad news.via [engadget.com]
