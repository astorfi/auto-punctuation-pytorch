Those employees represent approximately eight percent of HP's entire workforce, and the restructuring saves the company $3 to $3.5 billion per year -- money it badly needs following last quarter's losses. HP says that 3,800 employees were affected as of July 31, 2012 -- just over 13 percent of the restructuring total. It's unclear how many more will be affected by year's end, if any.
