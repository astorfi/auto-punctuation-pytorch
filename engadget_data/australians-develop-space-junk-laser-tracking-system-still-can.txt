 Australian company Electric Optic Systems has announced its developed a laser tracking system which will be able to stop space junk -- discarded debris in orbit around the earth, of which there is currently over 200,000 pieces larger than 1cm -- from colliding with satellites and spacecraft. The new laser system is more precise than previous radars specifically because of its ability to track debris that is small, which can still cause major problems if encountered. Using a 3.5 million dollar grant from the Australian government, the company developed the system which it says will ultimately work best as a network.
