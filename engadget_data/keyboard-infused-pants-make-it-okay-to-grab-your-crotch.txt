Dreamed up and designed by Erik De Nijs, these Ã¼ber-geeky pants boast a built-in keyboard that's apparently Bluetooth-enabled. Beyond that, you'll also find sewn in speakers, a pocket made especially for travel mice of all flavors and a "joystick controller" strategically located just behind the front zipper (saywha?). Hate all you like, we just penned this very post on a pair of these bad boys. Only kidding.

[Thanks, Hans]
