 In an attempt to offer a compromise for UK viewers who may want to watch the occasional sporting event but don't want a full pay-TV package, Sky Sports is available in pay-as-you-go form on its Now TV service. Access won't come cheap however, priced at £9.99 for 24 hours of access to Sky's six sports channels. That does however open up streams for all of the sports it airs, like F1, soccer, cricket and more, on TV-connected devices like the Xbox 360 and its mobile apps.
