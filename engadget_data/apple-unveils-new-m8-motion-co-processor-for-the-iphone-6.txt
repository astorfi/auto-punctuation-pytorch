 Apple today introduced its new iPhone 6, updating the hardware across the board. One small improvement is a new M8 motion co-processor that build upon the introductory M7 that debuted with the iPhone 5s.


Similar to the M7, the new M8 is an integrated motion coprocessor that is designed for fitness apps. It's more than a step tracker, the new M8 can distinguish between sports such as cycling and running. It also can calculate distance and elevation using an onboard barometer to measure air pressure changes.


Third-party app integration also will be available with Nike already confirming it will updates its Nike+ app to support these advanced capabilities. The new M8 will debut in the iPhone 6.
