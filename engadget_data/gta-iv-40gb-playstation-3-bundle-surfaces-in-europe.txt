Out of seemingly nowhere, a Grand Theft Auto IV PlayStation 3 bundle has popped up on a Swedish retailer's website, offering a 40GB PS3, a copy of the game, a decorated box and little else (DualShock 3?). Judging by the package art, we're guessing there's no suave paint job waiting on either side, and Webhallen has the unit priced at 4,499 SEK (or about $755). Before you ask -- there's no telling whether this thing is headed stateside or not, but surely Sony / Rockstar Games wouldn't let such a moneymaker swim around the US of A, right?[Via N4G, thanks John]
