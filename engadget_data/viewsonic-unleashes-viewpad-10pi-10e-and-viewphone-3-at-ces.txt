The 10pi is a dual-booting machine with an Oak Trail z670 pushing your choice of Gingerbread or Windows 7 to a 1280 x 800 IPS panel. The 10e is a 9.1mm-thin Android 2.3 device running on a 1GHz Cortex A8. Both the 10pi and 10e will be available later this month for $849 and $299, respectively. The company also announced that the ViewPhone 3 would be coming to Latin America, as expected, later this quarter for $279. Check out the PR after the break.

The company's ViewPad tablet line, which also consists of the ViewPad 7e and the ViewPad 10pro, are perfect options for consumers to surf the web and interact with friends, and for the mobile worker to enhance productivity while on the go.
