 If you've been wondering how you'll get that stash of game demo downloads, HD movies and ripped music from your clunky ol' white 360 over to the Elite's 120GB drive, the rumor mill has the answer: a cable. Crazy, we know. The word of an Ars Technica tipster is that Microsoft will be including some sort of transfer cable with its Elite units and standalone 120GB drives, so it should be no problem to scoot the data over no matter which one you buy. After all, you didn't think Microsoft would pass up a chance to get that 2nd Xbox dollar from its most loyal of followers, did you?[Via Xbox 360 Fanboy]
