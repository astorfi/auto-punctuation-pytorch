That's particularly interesting because Jannard's also mentioned that RED's working on a video-capable DSLR and recently pointed out that the D90's CMOS sensor tech leads to "jelly movement" when shooting video -- a problem RED solved long ago with the RED ONE's proprietary CMOS sensor, so we're guessing a few of these threads are coming together. We'll see when we see -- if RED produces anything within the price spectrum of the D90 and 5D Mark II, it'll shake things up pretty significantly.Read - "Wipe your minds of the past announced Scarlet"Read - Jannard points out the D90's "jelly" video
