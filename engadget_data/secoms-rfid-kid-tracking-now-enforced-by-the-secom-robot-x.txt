Remember Secom's
Robot X robot security sentry? The one that goes all
crazy on people and rams at them really fast and shoots smoke and fires blinding lights? Well, looks like they've
integrated RFID into the bot, so the Robot X can be used to guard Japan's precious Secom
RFID-tagged youth. Say goodbye to your days of
heady power as hall monitors, kidsâ€”like many jobs in the real world, a robots going to do what you do, but
better.
