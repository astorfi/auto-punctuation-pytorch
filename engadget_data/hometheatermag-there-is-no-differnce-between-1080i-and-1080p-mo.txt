 A few weeks ago we answered the question on whether or not you can tell the difference between 1080i and 1080p. Many of you didn't like what was said or simply read it wrong, but HomeTheaterMag has a great write-up on why there isn't any difference between 1080i and 1080p. Geoffrey Morrison is writing with HD DVD and Blu-ray in mind as that is the only place you can get 1080p material right now. He explains it technical very well but also provides an abridged version at the end of the post. We highly recommend this post as it is filled with all the info we left out of our layman's post.
