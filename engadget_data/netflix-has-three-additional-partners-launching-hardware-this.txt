 Details surrounding Netflix's upcoming set-top box partnership with LG are still scarce, but that hasn't stopped it from announcing similar plans with four other unnamed hardware manufacturers that it expects will sell "millions" of devices per year. Feel free to guess, but the only details available are that the fourth company is a small one likely to launch sooner than Q4, while the other three (including LG) will turn on Netflix functionality in some of their devices in the fourth quarter. It's unlikely to wash away the bad taste of an HD price hike, but we like imagining that all the hardware needed to connect Netflix's all-you-can-eat streaming movie service to our HDTV is already in the living room (Xbox 360 & PS3, we're looking at you).
