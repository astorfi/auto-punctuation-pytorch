 Yeah, weknow it hurts that Sony Ericsson has no plans, at least as of right now, to ever release the P990 here inthe States, but here's something that might make you feel better: the QWERTY keyboard on this phone is pretty crappy. Tobe fair, five minutes is definitely not enough time to make a proper assessment, but the impression we were left withafter playing with the P990 at the Sony Ericsson booth is that the keys are way too small and not tactile enough foreasy typing. Anyway, to refresh your memory on the specs, the P990 runs Symbian OS 9.1 with the UIQ 3software platform, and has a 2.8-inch QVGA touch screen display, built-in WiFi (802.11b), Bluetooth, a two megapixelcamera with a "photo light," video calling, FM radio, MP3 and MPEG-4 player, and a keyboard (QWERTY, QWERTZ,AZERTY, or Russian) underneath the flip-down keypad.
