  Wondering whether Sony's PlayStation Suite will ever really leave its nest? While the SDK won't be out until next month, SCE Chairman Kaz Hirai just told us here at AsiaD that this Android-friendly framework's still open to all other manufacturers, and he emphasized that it "isn't an ecosystem where we want to keep everything within the Sony family" while pimping the three PlayStation Certified Android devices so far: Xperia Play, Tablet S and Tablet P. Kaz also confirmed that Sony's currently "in discussions with non-Sony companies to bring them onboard," but as to when this will come to fruition, the company will make those announcements "when it's time to go public with it," so we shall see.
