This 3.8-inch WCDMA phone is no match for many of the big players out there with its single-core 1.4GHz Qualcomm MSM8255 chip, but other than that it should be pretty sufficient for the average user. The specs include a 800 x 480 TFT display, Android 2.3.4, 512MB RAM with 8GB ROM or 1GB RAM with 16GB ROM (neither comes with memory expansion), slightly different casing design for both models, eight megapixel 720p CMOS camera and a much lighter body compared to its two predecessors -- we're looking at a reduction from 165g to just 120g (including the 1,500mAh battery) at 10.9mm thick. Despite the weight loss, this phone has kept the handy gesture area below the screen.

Sadly there's no word on release dates or prices for the S2, so again, come back in a bit for our hands-on photos from Engadget Chinese.

Update: We've now been told that starting today the S2 will be sold for RMB 2,990 (about $470) unsubsidized. There will also be a TD-SCDMA variant at some point for those hooked up to China Mobile.

Update 2: And our hands-on photos plus video are up now! Enjoy.
