  Wondering if Chrome OS has a future? Wonder no more. After Samsung and Acer ushered out Chromebooks of their own following Google I/O 2011, it looks as if Sony's planning to usher in one of its own prior to this year's gala. The VAIO VCC111 has just found its way into the FCC's database, signaling that there's only a minimal amount of time before this here machine is cleared for sale on US shelves. So far as we can tell, this is the first significant proof that Sony was (or is) dreaming of involving itself with Google's cloud-centric operating system, with the user guide clearly explaining the boot-up procedure for a "Chrome OS," and the keyboard clearly resembling that seen on the Series 5 from Samsung -- in other words, the Chrome-ified row of hot keys and an omitted Windows key. Judging by the photos, there's also a headphone port, microphone jack, HDMI socket, SD card reader, a pair of USB 2.0 connectors and an 11.6-inch display. We'll be keeping our eyes peeled for more; given where it's at, it shouldn't be long before Best Buy's database picks it up.
