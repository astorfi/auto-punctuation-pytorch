 In the grand scheme of things, having too many HDMI devices and not enough HDMI inputs is a problem most of us would love to have, but it's still good to know that there's companies like LINDY out there making dreams come true for the HD-obsessed. The company's new descriptively-named HDMI Switch Remote will give you three extra ports to connect HDMI or DVI sources (with an adapter) to your HDTV or projector, and it'll let you switch between them from the comfort of your couch with its handy remote control. Fully HDMI and HDCP-compliant, the unit should easily handle video up to 1080p and multi-channel audio, as well as resolutions up to 1600 x 1200 if you're using it with a DVI source. You can get one now, in the U.K. at least, for Â£149 (about $280 US).[Via Crowdedbrain]
