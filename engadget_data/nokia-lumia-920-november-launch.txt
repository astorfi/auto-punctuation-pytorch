Now, according to Reuters' "telecom operator" sources, a spokesperson from an unnamed eastern European carrier said that sales of the PureView-packing Lumia 920 will start in the second half of November, with larger countries landing the device earlier in the same month. Another source from a Nordic operator then followed suit, stating that they expected the phone to arrive in stores around mid to late November. We've reached out to our contacts, and will update if we hear anything more -- especially if it involves a price tag.

 Update: It's being reported that the Lumia 920 will arrive in the US on AT&T's network November 2nd.
