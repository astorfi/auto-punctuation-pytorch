Expected to belaunched this fall for as little or as much as €500 or €900 ($600 or $1,090 US) depending on options,Averatec's aiming to launch their device with XP, a touchscreen (which we assume will take advantage of Microsoft's Touch Pack UMPC suite),WiFi, GPS, 3G data, and a six hour battery life in a 7.3 x 3.5 x 1.3-inch 24 ounce package. So yeah, basically thisdevice might single-handedly solve just about every complaint the UMPC community (and we) have: price, battery life,keyboard, and wireless data. We'll believe it when we see it though, so keep your eyes out for Averatec this fall.[Via The Reg, thanks to everyone whosent this in]
