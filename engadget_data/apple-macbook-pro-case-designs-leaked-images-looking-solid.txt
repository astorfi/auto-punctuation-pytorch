AppleInsider says that it has received confirmation that the leaked images are in fact authentic, and we can safely say that the new design will include some minor, yet welcome design tweaks. Of most interest is a release latch that provides access to both the battery and hard drive. AppleInsider speculates that the easy HDD access could lead to an available SSD for the MacBook pro, which would only make sense. Finally, the illuminated Apple logo remains, and a more tapered design a-la MacBook Air is in the cards.
