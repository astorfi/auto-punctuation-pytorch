This hot little image, while grainy, clearly shows that stylized new-style "globe" logo we've been seeing as of late on its rear and bottom -- and with support for 3.6Mbps HSDPA data, GPS navigation, Windows Mobile 6, and Opera out of the box, we're just fine with this turning out to be legit. The tipster tells us that it won't be called the Q when it comes to the US' largest GSM network, though whether it retains the "q9" branding remains to be seen -- as does a release date. We suppose we can bide our time with an Amoi-sourced SMT5700 while we wait.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
