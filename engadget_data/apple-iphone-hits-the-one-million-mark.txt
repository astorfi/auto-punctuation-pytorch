"One million iPhones in 74 days -- it took almost two years to achieve this milestone with iPod," said Steve Jobs. But of course, it's never enough: "We can't wait to get this revolutionary product into the hands of even more customers this holiday season." Only time will tell if those aggressive price cuts and international sales can help the iPhone hit the 10 million mark in 2008.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
