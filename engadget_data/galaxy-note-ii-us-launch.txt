While this version of the form-defining phablet is destined for European, Asian and Middle Eastern-markets, the company promises a version of the device will hit American shores before the end of 2012, as you can see in the quote we've got from the company below.

  "Samsung Mobile is planning a U.S. version of Galaxy Note II, which will be available later in 2012. Building on the success of the original Galaxy Note, we're confident that the Galaxy Note II continues to redefine what consumers should expect from their smartphone and delivers a powerful, innovative and unique experience. Exact timing and retail channel availability is not being announced at this time, we will continue to share information as it becomes available."
