 Synaptics has been a serious roll of late, first introducing those luscious multitouch gestures to older trackpads, and last month extending its Gesture Suite to Linux and Chrome OS. Here at Computex, the company is expanding its TouchPad family of solutions, with the multi-finger PC TouchPad-IS range seeing the first update. Aside from being able to recognize four-finger gestures, the new platform prevents accidental activation of the cursor when a user's palm unintentionally contacts the TouchPad, and it also brings the aforementioned multi-finger capabilities of a touchscreen right onto a PC's trackpad. Next up is the new ClickEQ, which is hailed as the "industry's first hinge-less uniform force, uniform click depth ClickPad mechanical design." As you'd expect, this feels an awful lot like the glass trackpad that Apple's freshest MacBooks have, but you won't find us kvetching about getting a similar technology onto run-of-the-mill laptops and netbooks. 

Moving on, the company is also introducing new OEM customization capabilities for Synaptics gesture workflow technology, Scrybe, which will allow users to store specific trackpad settings and references so the whole family can control the laptop their own way. Sadly, there's no published ship date for any of these whiz-bang contraptions, but we're cautiously hoping to see it implemented in at least prototype form as we scour the show floor.
