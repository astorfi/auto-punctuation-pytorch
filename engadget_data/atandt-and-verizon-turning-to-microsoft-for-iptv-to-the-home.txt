       This doesn't get all that much attention -- at least not yet -- but Microsoft isn't placing allits bets on the Xbox 360 or Media Center in the battle to control the living room; they've also been pushing hard toget mixed up with how television is delivered to the home (insert obligatory joke here about your TV crashing). Comcasthas been testing Microsoft's Foundation software for cable set-top boxes for awhile, but they're hoping to be all overIPTV this year, they've recently announced that both Verizon and AT&T are starting to slowly roll-out IPTV overfiber using Microsoft TV IPTV Edition here in the States. There's almost a ridiculous amount of behind-the-scenesactivity both here and abroad -- a lot of people probably don't even realize that it's Microsoft powering their set-topbox -- and XChange has a detailed interview with Ed Graczyk, director of marketing and communications for Microsoft TVthat gives a good overview of their efforts.
