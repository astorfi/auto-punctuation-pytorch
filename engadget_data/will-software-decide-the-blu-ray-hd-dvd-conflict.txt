 As much attention has been given to the wavering of various Hollywood studios and PC manufacturers, a noticeable trend is developing among the makersÂ  of various CD/DVD burning software makers. They are by and large supporting Blu-ray.As
I mentioned earlier about the makers of Ashampoo, HD-DVD enthusiasts
may have quite a time burning disc's without the software to do it, and
now it is Cyberlink announcing their Power2Go suite will support
Blu-ray, no mention of HD-DVD.More after the jump.
 
          
 
 
 The only software I've heard mention support for HD-DVD is Ulead's InterVideo. Nero, Roxio, and now Cyberlinkare all Blu-ray only, at least for the time being. A lot of earlyadopters are people who look forward to being able to back up theirvideo in high definition on next generation DVD's or any other kind ofdata for that matter. If their software of choice only works on onekind of disc, why would they even look at the other?Now I maybe completely off, as none of us have the media much less any drives torecord with, and the time till any of the above are affordable is quitea way off. But as loudly as the HD-DVD group is shouting "HD-DVD is Real", could that be trumped by "Blu-ray Ready"?
