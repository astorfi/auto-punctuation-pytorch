The device is known only as the LU6200, but it packs a 4.5-inch AH-IPS display at 720p resolution, a dual-core 1.5GHz Scorpion CPU, an Adreno 220 GPU, along with an 8 megapixel AF camera and connectivity to the U+ LTE network (which supports a maximum theoretical download speed of 75Mbps). Further, users will find a 1.3MP front-facing cam, 1GB of RAM, 4GB built-in storage, an 1,830mAh battery, 801.11b/g/n and Bluetooth 3.0, along with support for DLNA, MHL, WiFi Direct and NFC. Specifically for the Korean market, the handset can also receive digital radio and TV broadcasts through terrestrial DMB. LG has launched a teaser page for this Gingerbread-powered smartphone, for which pre-orders are said to begin on September 26th -- although, there's yet no word on the pricing. It's certainly intriguing, though we'll gladly wait for a stateside version before raiding our piggy bank... again.
