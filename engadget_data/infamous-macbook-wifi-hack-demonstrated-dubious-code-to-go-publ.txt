David Maynor, who is now the CTO at Errata Security, broke the silence regarding the questionable WiFi vulnerability that he claimed existed in Apple's MacBook by actually demonstrating his findings in front of the crowds at the Black Hat DC event. The meddlesome duo elicited all sorts of backlash from Apple after the story surfaced, and a showing at the ToorCon hacker convention in San Diego was actually axed after Cupertino threatened to sue Maynor's now-former employer, SecureWorks. Yesterday, however, Maynor streamed rogue code from a Toshiba laptop while his MacBook (running OS X 10.4.6) scanned for wireless networks; sure enough, the laptop crashed, and he insinuated that the code could actually be used to do far worse things, such as control functions of the computer -- but interestingly enough, it wasn't noted whether the MacBook's WiFi adapter was Apple's own or of the third-party variety. The angst still felt by Maynor primarily stems from Apple's outright denial of his claims, only to provide an elusive patch that fixed the issue in OS X 10.4.8, essentially making its operating system more secure without giving David his due credit. Mr. Maynor also said that he would no longer attempt to work with Apple and wouldn't report any further findings to them, and while most Macs have certainly done their duty and upgraded to the latest version of OS X, users can reportedly expect a public release of the rogue code to hit the web soon.
