 We got a preview of Sharp's "Integrated Cognitive Creation" 60-inch 4K LCD during CES early this year, and now it's almost ready to launch in Japan. Branded the ICC PURIOS, it brings a new premium level above previous AQUOS models, thanks to not only the 3,840 x 2,160 resolution but also professional quality image processing that Sharp says brings "unparalleled realism and excitement." This panel is ready for use in video production, and the LC-60HQ10 is also proudly trumpeting its status as the first THX certified 4K display. All of that'll cost buyers, however and when the build-to-order models start shipping on February 20th, 2013, they'll run 2.62 million yen ($31,376). That might not too much to pay if you're mastering the next James Cameron flick, but we'll be keeping an eye out for slightly lower priced Ultra HD TVs next month in Las Vegas.
