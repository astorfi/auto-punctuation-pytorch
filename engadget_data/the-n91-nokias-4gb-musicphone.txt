Alright, not only did those leaked pics of Nokia's new two
megapixel musicphone turn out to be legit, they actually introduced the phone today, which was way sooner than we'd
anticipated. The Nokia N91 is part of Nokia's new media-centric N series, and apparently they're throwing down against
Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and Samsung and putting a 4GB hard drive in there, an industry standard 3.5mm headphone jack,
support for playback of MP3, M4A, AAC, and WMA audio files, and USB 2.0 so you can just drag and drop your files over
from your PC. Better still, the N91 has 3G (WCDMA) and both built-in WiFi and Bluetooth. Should be out sometime around
the end of the year.
