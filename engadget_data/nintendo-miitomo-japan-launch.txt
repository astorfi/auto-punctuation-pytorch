For people in Japan, the anticipation of Nintendo's first smartphone app will be over soon. The company announced today via Twitter that Miitomo, its long-awaited, free-to-play mobile title, is launching in Japan on March 17th. As a refresher, the game is expected to have a major social aspect to it, based around Mii avatar interactions between you and your friends.



          
 
 
 Unfortunately, Nintendo didn't say when Miitomo is coming to the US, Europe and other parts of the world, but that release date can't be too far away now. In the meantime, the best thing to do is pre-register for the app and make sure you snag a username you'll be proud of forever.
