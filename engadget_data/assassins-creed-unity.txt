We hope you're making good progress on Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, because there's already a sequel on the way. Ubisoft has unveiled Assassin's Creed: Unity, a follow-up that takes the stealthy game series to Paris during the French Revolution. Clearly, you can expect guillotines to play an important role. You'll get a tiny hint of the experience in the teaser video below. However, it's worth noting that the trailer only shows Unity coming to PCs, the PS4 and the Xbox One -- there's no mention of the Wii U or previous-generation systems. We've reached out to Ubisoft to check on platform support, but there's a good chance that the developer is focusing all its attention on higher-end hardware this time around.
