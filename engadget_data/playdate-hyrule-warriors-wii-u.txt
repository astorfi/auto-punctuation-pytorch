Welcome, ladygeeks and gentlenerds, to the new era of gaming. The one where you get to watch, and comment, as other people livestream gameplay from next-gen consoles. Because games! They're fun!


Nintendo fans have had it especially rough these past few years. The Wii U is getting better thanks to admissions from the company that there were some serious faults with the system, but, when it comes to software, games take a bit more time in the oven than a firmware update likely does. Today, we're taking a look at one of the scant few exclusive titles coming to Nintendo's latest home console for the holiday season: Hyrule Warriors. It isn't a proper entry in the Legend of Zelda series, though -- that comes next year... maybe -- it's an action game from the teams most famous for the Dynasty / Samurai Warriors franchises -- don't expect to be delving into any elemental-themed temples here. Instead, hone your hacking and slashing skills. How does it fare, though? Well, we're glad you asked! Starting at 7 p.m. Eastern / 4 p.m. Pacific we're going to be streaming the game right on this very page. Tune in then and see what the Hero of Time is up to this fall.
