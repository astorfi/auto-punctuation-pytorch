Initially, YouTube's live-streaming service was limited to select partners and special events, but that's about to change. Starting today, all channels in good standing with over 1,000 subscribers will be able to sign up for this broadcasting option. When using YouTube Live, account holders can insert ads, display multiple camera angles and add closed captions. Meanwhile, viewers can control a broadcast stream's playback by rewinding and skipping (previously aired content, of course) ahead Ã  la Google Hangouts On Air. To add YouTube Live to your channel, visit your Account Features page and click the "Enable" button in the Live Events section. Google notes that eligible accounts will start gaining access in the coming weeks, which hopefully gives you enough time to save up for a teleprompter.
