 
Oh yes it is. That special edition Halo 3 Zune is real, out, and up for pre-order exclusively through GameStop. Available June 15th (pre-order now), the $249 promotional Zune comes packin' a 30GB disk loaded with a flood of Halorific music, video and artwork. Although you've made your thoughts about Microsoft's would-be iPod killer abundantly clear, the tie-in with the hotly anticipated September 25th release of Halo 3 by Bungie Studio (owned by Microsoft) could generate some renewed Zune-buzz all but lost since its initial launch. Welcome to the Social Covenant kids. [Thanks, Russell D. and everyone who sent this in]
