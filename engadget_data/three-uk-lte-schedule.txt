 Three's CEO could teach Vodafone's CEO a thing or two about diplomacy. Whereas Vittorio Colao dismissed British LTE users as "technofreaks", Dave Dyson has merely said that he's "fairly relaxed" about upgrading Three's network. During a quarterly earnings report yesterday, he said he's in "no rush for LTE" and told people not to expect Three's newly acquired chunks of LTE spectrum to be brought to life until Q4 of this year. He intends to wait and see how O2 and Vodafone position themselves, and that's fine -- just so long as he sticks to the earlier promise not to charge extra for unlimited LTE data.
