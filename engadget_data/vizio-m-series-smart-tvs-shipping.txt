Back at this year's CES, all Vizio said about its brand new M-Series lineup of HDTVs was that they'd be hitting shelves at some point "later this year." Fast forward to today, and the company's announcing its 2013 M-Series Smart TVs are now shipping to retailers such as Best Buy, Amazon and Walmart, with interested folks being able to grab one starting at $400 for a 32-inch LED model. Speaking of which, Vizio also went ahead and modified the M-Series pricing scheme a bit, making some models a little more expensive and others slightly cheaper. For example, the Theater 3D-ready 80-inch Razor LED Smart TV (say that five times fast) is now $4,000, as opposed to the $5,000 price tag that it was announced with originally. You'll find the full MSRP list in the PR after the break, and do let us know in the comments below if you plan on snagging one of these for yourself.
