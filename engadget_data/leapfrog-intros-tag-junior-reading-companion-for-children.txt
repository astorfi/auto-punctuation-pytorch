Their latest offering, Tag Junior, is for the two- to four-year old age range, and it builds on the company's previous Tag Reading System tech. The toy "reads" aloud (via downloadable MP3s) using an infrared camera that can recognize letters and words on the page, and can store up to five books' worth of material at a time. The custom-made books for the device include such august characters as Winnie the Pooh and Dora the Explorer. Tag Junior will be available this summer for $34.99, with each book running $10.99. Anything that keeps them off the video games for a few hours a day is probably pretty cool.
