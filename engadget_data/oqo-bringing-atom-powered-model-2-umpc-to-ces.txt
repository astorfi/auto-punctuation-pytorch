But if you were overly optimistic that the Atom-powered prototype it showed off back in August (pictured) would eventually become a reality, you -- sir or madam -- take today's golden crown. In a recent Digital Experience! email blasted out to media members worldwide (full blurb is after the break), we're very clearly told that OQO will be on hand to demonstrate its new Model 2+. Said UMPC will pack a 1.86GHz Intel Atom CPU, a touchscreen OLED display, 2GB of RAM and global 3G connectivity. OQO even goes so far as to say that it will offer performance "up to twice as fast as its predecessor." Did our heart just skip a beat over a UMPC? Why, yes it did![Via GottaBeMobile]
