No word on when exactly we'll get to hunker down with a retail version of the device in the US, butNokia did mention that the E70 will follow later this month. We're sure you've heard plenty of the WCDMA 3G data, WiFi,QVGA screen, and miniSD this device includes, but it sounds so much sweeter with the knowledge that the phone is on itsway... to somebody.
