Earlier this week, LG said that the G2 successor would be called the G3 and launch before July -- nothing terribly shocking. Now we get to see what the upcoming device (allegedly) looks like, thanks to leaks from GSM Arena and a Korean site called Seeko. The two images seem to show different body plastics, though the device shown by Seeko (at the source) has no logo and could be a prototype. Other notable design changes from the G2 are narrower bezels and new rear buttons. Spec-wise, GSM Arena's tipster said it'll have a 3,000mAh battery, microSD slot and come in 2GB and 3GB RAM versions with 16GB and 32GB of storage, respectively. We're also expecting a Quad HD display, so hopefully it's more grippy than it looks in the pics -- we'd hate to break that.
