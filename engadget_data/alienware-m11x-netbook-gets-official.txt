Well, would you look at that: we've just gotten word on the M11X, a new Alienware netbook. It's got an 11.6-inch display, NVIDIA GT335M switchable graphics, a rumored 6.5 hours of battery life on integrated and "over 2 hours" on gaming mode. This bad boy will ship in the spring for less than $1,000. That's all we know for now, we'll update as we hear more.
