If a Metal Slime handset wasn't enough mobile-based Dragon Quest news for you, Square Enix has more to share. The firm recently announced that it's bringing the first eight Dragon Quest titles to Android and iOS, in sequential order, starting this winter. What's more, the company also revealed a new mobile game, Dragon Quest Monsters: Super Light, which could involve in-app purchases. All the titles are currently exclusive to Japan, with US pricing and availability yet to be confirmed. However, if Square Enix has taught us anything, it'll happen sooner or later -- and when it does, the games won't be cheap.
