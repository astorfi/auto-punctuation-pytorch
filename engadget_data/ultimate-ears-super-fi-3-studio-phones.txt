The upper-level iPod replacement canalphones market ruled by the likes of
Shure and
Etymotics has some new competition on the lower
end of the spectrumâ€”Ultimate Ears' new Super.fi 3 Studio phones only go for $100, but supposedly perform like their
pricier competitors with excellent bass response and up to 26dB of noise isolation. Is it just us though, or are all
these cans starting to look alike?
