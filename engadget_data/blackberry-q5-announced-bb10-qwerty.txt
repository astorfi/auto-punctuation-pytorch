This morning at BlackBerry Live in Orlando, Thorsten Heins kicked off the company's major annual event with a brief mention of the latest BB10 device, the Q5. It's a handset Heins is convinced will be a "big hit" for its target audience. The portrait QWERTY handset follows in the footsteps of the recently unleashed Q10, merging a 3.1-inch touch screen with hardware keyboard, but has a more specific bent: it's made for emerging markets. Due to be launched in a trio of colors (i.e., black, red, white and pink), the Q5 is being positioned as a low-end device that combines affordability, BB's signature physical keyboard and, of course, BB10. It's due to rollout this July in Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia. As for pricing, the company's remaining mum on that end, but with summer fast approaching, we should know soon enough.
