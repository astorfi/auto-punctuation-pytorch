This device stands to be every 12-year-old kid's dream, 'cept it'll be wasted on high-level operatives. UK-based
Cambridge Consultants look to release the Prism 200 early next year, a device that uses UWB-based through-wall radar
technology to give 3D feedback on human movement and location through walls up to 40cm thick. No word on pricing for
this pseudo-robotic looking thing, but you gotta figure anything earmarked for use in "time-critical situations" is
just begging to clean out a wallet. Or several.
