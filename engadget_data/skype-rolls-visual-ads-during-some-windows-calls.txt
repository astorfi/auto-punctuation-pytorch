As of today, Skype for Windows users who don't have any credit their accounts will see -- thankfully, not hear -- ads during pure Skype-to-Skype voice conversations. The ads won't disrupt calls or take over the interface, but the company's attempt to spin location-targeted sales pitches as a way to "generate fun interactivity" between callers isn't exactly leaving us warm and fuzzy. There's no mention of whether or not Mac or mobile users will get the ads as well -- not that there's exactly a rush to embrace them or the "additional commercial experiences" coming in the future.
