Instead of holding one, monolithic event in late September, Finland's phone giant is splitting the show into smaller, more targeted events. The first will start much earlier than planned, running between September 5th and 6th in Helsinki, but don't expect any big Lumia introductions: the early show is focused on carrier and store partners rather than any opportunities for a public hands-on. Details of more events are coming in the weeks ahead, and some of those gatherings we imagine will be more about new devices than wheeling and dealing.
