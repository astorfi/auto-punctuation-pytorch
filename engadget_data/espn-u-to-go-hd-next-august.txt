       Despite all the BCS BS, we still love college football -- especially when it's in HD. We've grown to expect more and more HD every season, and with ESPN and ESPN2 presenting all their games in HD these days, we should've seen this coming. As of next August, ESPN U is going HD and will become the forth ESPN HD network (ESPNews is the thrid). In addition to the biggest college sport being presented in HD; basketball, lacrosse, baseball, softball, volleyball, wrestling, and hockey will also get the HD treatment with a total of 200 HD events on schedule in the first year.
