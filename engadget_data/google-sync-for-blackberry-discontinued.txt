During its routine tradition, the company announced that Google Sync for the BlackBerry will no longer be available for download as of June 1st. Put simply, the company identified its app as redundant, as RIM provides the same contact and calendar sync services to its customers with native software. Also in the spirit of spring cleaning, Google is encouraging users to uninstall the Sync app and properly configure their BlackBerry handsets to take advantage of these services. Fortunately, those content to keep with the status quo will be glad to know that Google Sync will continue to function properly -- so even if you're feeling lazy on this fine day, it's all good. Those with motivation, however, will find instructions of how to make the switch in the source below.
