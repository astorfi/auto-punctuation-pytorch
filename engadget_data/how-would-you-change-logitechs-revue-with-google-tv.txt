Logitech was one of the first outfits to buy into Google's scheme to take over the television, with the Revue first out of the gate to provide Google TV access to existing sets. We had our fair share of gripes with the box, and while it definitely enabled quite the unusual videocall in a prior episode of The Engadget Show, we were never convinced said fun was worth the price. Enough about us, though -- how's your Revue treating you? Has it revolutionized the way you consume television content? Anything you'd change about it? Tweak the user interface? Broaden compatibility? Change up the keyboard? Let us know in comments below -- something tells us Google's still listening up for input.
