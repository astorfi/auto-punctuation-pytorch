Some guy managed to build a DIY "steady-cam" for $14 (those things which help keep TV crews
keep their videocameras from shaking while they're running around shooting reality shows), which might not sound like a
big deal until you realize that a professional Steadicam (that's the brand name) costs around $1,500.
