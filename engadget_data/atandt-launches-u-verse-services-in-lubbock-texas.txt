Thankfully, one more city has just been added to the list in the Lone Star State, as the provider's fiber-based TV, high-speed internet and voice services roll into Lubbock. Per usual, residents will have to call and see if they're within range, and of course, AT&T has vowed to spread the service to more and more communities in the coming months. Your guess is as good as ours as to what that really means, though.[Thanks, Anthony]
