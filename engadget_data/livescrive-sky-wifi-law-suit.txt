 Well, this isn't great. No sooner did we review the Livescribe Sky WiFi smartpen and then it suddenly ceases to exist -- at least in the British Isles. Livescribe has withdrawn the product from its UK store following an allegation that it is "infringing the trademark rights of British Sky Broadcasting." Other retailers have briskly followed suit, not least because they too have been threatened with legal action. It seems the risk of someone shopping for a premium TV service and then accidentally buying a cloud-connected note-taking device were just too great for the broadcaster to bear.
