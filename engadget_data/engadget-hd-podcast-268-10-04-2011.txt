 Check your Bingo squares -- we have a full on geek rant this week. While DVBLink's Boxee extender engendered nothing but peaceful conversation, we couldn't help but dig into the next two topics. Rumors of Microsoft's efforts to integrate cable TV into a unified search with its other Xbox offerings continue to swirl, which left us wondering just who is standing in the way of innovation.
