It's been awhile since we've seen a new tablet from Wacom. In the meantime, the company has given us a digital DJ interface, but not what we really crave -- a new Bamboo tablet with multi-touch support. So what do we have here? A brave tipster (who wishes to remain anonymous) has turned us onto some blurrycam photos suggesting that such a tablet is indeed coming out. Might the above pictured Bamboo Touch see the light of day with the impending release of Windows 7? Stranger things have happened! More photographic evidence is yours to behold after the break.
