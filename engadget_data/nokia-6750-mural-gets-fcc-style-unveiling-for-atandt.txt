You can clearly see AT&T's "CV" logo on a button for Cellular Video here, not to mention numerous references in the manual -- so yeah, we're pretty confident this thing has a date with destiny on AT&T, assuming it passes the carrier's testing. The 6750 "Mural" is a shiny, fairly attractive flip with external music controls, and if we had to guess, it's going to be running Series 40 since there's no Menu button like an S60 device would need. Kinda funny that it'd have a higher model number than AT&T's 6650 which is S60-based, but whatever -- at least we're getting another decent-looking Nokia around these parts, eh?[Via Phone Scoop]
