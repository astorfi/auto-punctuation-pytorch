 James Cameron seems to understand that the movie theater isn't offering much beyond what a home theater can these days, so he's trying to bring something new to the table. His new film Avatar, due in theaters in 2008, will be the first full length feature film to use a 3D high definition camera he's been working on for several years now. Our friend Mike at HD For Indies sat in on a panel with Cameron and his partner, cinematographer Vince Pace earlier this year where they discussed some of the specifics of the technology. It will be interesting to see if this new tech can get us out of our home theaters and into the movie theater to watch a love story between an alien and a hybrid human/alien set against a backdrop of racial discord. Sounds like a Blu-ray vs. HD DVD allegory.[Via digg]
