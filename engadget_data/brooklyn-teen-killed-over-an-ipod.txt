We try hard not to buy into all the hysteria over iPod thefts and mugging, but this is just completely and totally
tragic: police in NYC have arrested two Brooklyn teens suspected of killing a 15-year-old boy while attempting to steal
his friend's iPod. Apparently the two suspects were part of a group that approached the boys and demanded the iPod; the
boys refused and there was some sort of scuffle that resulted in Christopher Rose being stabbed in the heart twice.
