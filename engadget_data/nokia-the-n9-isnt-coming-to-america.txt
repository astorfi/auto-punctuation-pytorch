If you've been eagerly awaiting September 23rd so you can grab your very own Nokia N9 in America, the company's first (and last) MeeGo smartphone may not be shipping in your region after all. We've been reaching out to Espoo in recent weeks in an attempt to nail down a US ship date for the drop-dead gorgeous handset, and much to our chagrin, we received a rather disheartening reply:


"After the very positive reception to the launch of the Nokia N9, the product is now being rolled out in countries around the world. At this time we will not be making it available in the US. Nokia takes a market by market approach to product rollout, and each country makes its own decisions about which products to introduce from those available. Decisions are based on an assessment of existing and upcoming products that make up Nokia's extensive product portfolio and the best way in which to address local market opportunities."


Bummer. Moreover, the folks over at The Inquirer were fed an eerily similar line regarding a ship date in the UK, leaving us to wonder where exactly this thing is planning to launch. Regardless, we're still doing our darndest to get ahold of one for review, but it's becoming all the more obvious that it'll hardly matter to folks situated in the US of A. And that, friends, is a crying shame.
