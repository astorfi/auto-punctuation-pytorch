The 47-, 42- and 32-inch E3D models sport $899, $729 and $549 pricetags and a date of "coming soon," following the precedent of the 65-inch model released last fall. If that's not cheap enough, one of our readers has provided information that Walmart expects to have the E3D320VX and E3D420VX available for $498 and $698, respectively, starting in April. All of these TVs are 1080p (at least in 2D), have WiFi and Vizio Internet Apps built in (with a new IR remote - Update: pictured after the break -- instead of the old Bluetooth QWERTY one) and come with two pairs of passive 3D glasses. We've seen 3DTVs debut at under $1,000 before and more than a few of last year's models have dipped to $800~ by now, but with a starting price this low and cheap accessories, we wouldn't be surprised if Vizio is celebrating sales wins again next year.
