According to placeholders on the Bluetooth SIG's official website, HTC has a Diamond and Raphael "PDA Phone" queued for release in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. Unfortunately, this database isn't nearly as telling as the one maintained by the FCC, so we're at a loss when it comes to specifications, pictures and practically anything worth noting. One thing's for sure, though: the wait for more details just got a lot shorter.[Via Cellpassion]Read - HTC DiamondRead - HTC Raphael
