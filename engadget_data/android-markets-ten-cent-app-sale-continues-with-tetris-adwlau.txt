This latest batch includes games like Tetris, Reckless Getaway, Space Physics, and Toki Tori, as well as a couple of apps including the brand new ADWLauncher EX. Hit the source link below to start sending them to your phone.

Update: If you prefer, Amazon appears to be matching at least some of Android Market's prices on its own Appstore. And, as pointed out in the comments below, there's some stragglers in the Android Market from yesterday that are still only a dime, including Fruit Ninja, Air Sync, and Read it Later Pro.
