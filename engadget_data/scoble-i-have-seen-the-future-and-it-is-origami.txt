 We tried. Reallywe did. We wanted to limit today's Origami posts to the one weranÂ  this morning. Butwe can't resist the lure of Robert Scoble, whose haiku-like pronouncements on what Origami isn't graced ournewsreader a little while ago. According to Scoble (whose sources at Microsoft are, of course, impeccable), Origamiisn't an iPod killer, portable Xbox, OQO killer or PSP killer. So, what exactly is it? Coy boy Scoble isn'ttelling, though he says he's seen it, and that he'll buy one with his own money. We assume he won't be forced to dothat. He's more than earning his keep by feeding us these infuriating snippets.[Thanks, Kyle]
