Having played with some sort of cobbled-together Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc with a 2.4 build, the site says that we can expect an incremental build that seems to feature miscellaneous stuff Google might not have had time to include in 2.3 -- random things like a new animation when deleting icons off the home screen, to much bigger features like visible video calling hooks. Unfortunately, said hooks didn't seem to be tied to any video calling-enabled Google Talk client, but considering how early this build seems to be, there's reason to believe they'll add it in by launch time. It's an open question when this is coming -- or to what devices -- and when you think about Eclair's progression from 2.0 to 2.1, it could happen sooner than you expect.
