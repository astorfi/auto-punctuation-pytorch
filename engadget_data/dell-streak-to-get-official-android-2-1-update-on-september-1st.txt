We double-checked with O2 and were informed that it's actually targeting either the 1st or 2nd, so regardless, the eccentric tabletphone should be getting some sweet pastry later this week. We'll let you know if something goes wrong in the oven, or if the buttery aroma manages to seep into AT&T's upgrade path.

Update: Just as promised, the 2.1 download is now live. Simply go to Settings, "About device" and then "System updates" for the fresh delivery. If all else fails, just point your Streak's browser to the URL.
