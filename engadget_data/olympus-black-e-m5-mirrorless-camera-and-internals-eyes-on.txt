  By now we're quite familiar with the Olympus E-M5's attractive external appearance, but what does it look like on the inside? The company carefully disassembled its new flagship model, and displayed the components in ten layers for us to examine at CP+ in Yokohama, Japan. The image sensor module is perhaps the most impressive component, due in part to its five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization. We can also spot the magnesium alloy shell, main system board and top plate. Another display encased a compete E-M5 kit, with a lens, split right down the middle. You'll find a variety of views in the gallery below, along with a special treat: the all-black version of the E-M5, in all its smooth metal glory.
