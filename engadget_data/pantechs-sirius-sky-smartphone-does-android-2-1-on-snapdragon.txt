It's also helped along by an Android 2.1 install and a 3.7-inch 800 x 480 OLED screen that does look rather vivid in the above shot -- presumably taken indoors. 500MB of storage is offered internally by the phone while expandable memory bumps things up to 32GB, upon which pictures from the five megapixel camera can be stored for later mockery. The phone is said to be hitting Asian markets "pretty soon" and, while there are rumors of a US release, they're sounding a bit unsubstantiated at this point.
