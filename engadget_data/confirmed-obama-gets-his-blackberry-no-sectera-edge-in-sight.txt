According to Gibbs, Obama will be able to keep his BlackBerry, though only a limited number of senior staff and personal contacts will have access to his email address, and the data on the handheld will be subject to the Presidential Records Act. There was no mention of the NSA or the Sectera Edge, though he does mention some enhanced security. In Gibbs' words:"The President has a BlackBerry through a compromise that allows him to stay in touch with senior staff and a small group of personal friends in a way that use will be limited and the security is enhanced to ensure his ability to communicate, but to do so effectively and to do so in a way that's protected."Finally, a clear indication that for the first time in the 21st century, the President of the United States will act like it's the 21st century. You can watch it all go down in the video after the break -- just crank it to about 45:30. Now, on to this economic stuff we keep hearing about...[Thanks, Vipul]
