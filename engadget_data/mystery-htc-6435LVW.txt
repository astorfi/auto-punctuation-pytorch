All we can say for sure is that a previously unheard-of device called the HTC 6435LVW has appeared over at the Community Uploads section of the GLBenchmark site, scoring a ridiculous 121 FPS in the Egypt Offscreen 720p test -- that's more than twice the score of the HTC One X (LTE), and 20 percent higher than the current performance supremo, the Galaxy S III. But that's not all, because the benchmark listing also throws up some specs: notably a 1794 x 1080 resolution (could that mean a new HTC tablet with onscreen buttons?) and a Qualcomm MSM8960 processor (could it be the Pro version?). There are too many questions to contemplate, but here's one final detail: the Android ICS version is described as a Verizon build, so if this thing is legit maybe that's where it's headed.
