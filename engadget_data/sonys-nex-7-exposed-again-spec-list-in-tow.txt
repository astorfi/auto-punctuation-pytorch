Purported to carry the same 24.3 megapixel Exmor sensor rumored to be in the A77, the compact camera will also allegedly feature an OLED viewfinder and a 3-inch TruBlack LCD. Ostensibly, the 1080p / 24fps shooter also wields a magnesium alloy body, integrated flash and a new auto locking hot shoe. We have a feeling it won't be too long before this puppy becomes official, but until then feel free to leer at more specs and pics at the source link below.
