Right, so, we already know that Microsoft is making sure just about everyone -- from desktop owners to Windows Phone 8.1 aficionados -- get a Windows 10 upgrade for free within the first year, and we've gotten a look at how Windows 10 has evolved since we last saw it. Now it's time for the mobile nitty-gritty we were hoping for, as Microsoft's Joe Belfiore demoed a version of Windows 10 for phones and tablets smaller than eight inches.



Belfiore first dug into the core of the Windows 10 mobile experience, and at first glance it doesn't look all that different -- the Start Screen experience is nearly identical to its predecessor, with a grid of furiously blinking Live Tiles and the ability to set a fullbleed background image. The further you dig, though, the more you'll find things have changed.
