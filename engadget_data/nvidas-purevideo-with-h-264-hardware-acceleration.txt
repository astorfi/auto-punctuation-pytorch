Why bog down your CPU with mundane video decoding tasks when your GPU can do it foryou, right? PureVideo hardware decoding supports all of the standardMPEG-4 flavors such as H.264, VC-1, WMV and also supports the "soon-to-be-legacy"  MPEG-2 compression aswell.  NVIDIA's PureVideo technology will show up in both desktop and notebook products: the GeForce 6- and7-series will sport the new technology, as well as the nForce 6150 series of GPUs. Note that this should cover you in aPC solution for either Blu-Ray or HD-DVD since all of the usual suspects codecs are supported.
