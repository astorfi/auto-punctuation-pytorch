Does Acer do anything besides Ferrari-themed laptops these days? Sometimes it sure doesn't seem like it, this latest
one is something like their third or fourth one of these. Anyway, besides the red casing and Ferrari logo, they're
packing their new 3400 with AMD's new 64-bit 3000+ processor, a 128MB ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 graphics card, built-in
802.11g WiFi, Bluetooth, 512MB of RAM, a DVD+-RW drive, and a 15-inch display.
