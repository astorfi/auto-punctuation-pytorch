As you can see above in a slide apparently shown during LG's pre-IFA Dealer Days event, the Android-based tablet is now apparently known as the "Optimus Pad," and it's described as boasting "superior performance" and being "thinner and lighter than many competitors' tablets." Not much more than that at the moment, unfortunately, but here's hoping that "more information to come" teaser is a lead-up to a full announcement at IFA this week.
