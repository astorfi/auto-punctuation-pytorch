Thankfully, ASUS' 11-inch ultraportable is indeed the latest lappie to be put through the proverbial paces, and as expected, it performed like a champ -- considering it's wee size, of course. The machine didn't blow by any benchmarking sessions or anything, but again, it was never meant to be your primary gaming rig when heading off to a LAN party. All in all, reviewers found very (and we stress very) little to complain about, and even went so far as to call it "one of the best notebooks to hit the ultra-mobile market, ever." Not at all enthused about the MacBook Air or Lenovo X300? Then by all means, give that read link some love -- chances are the U2E is just what the doctor ordered.
