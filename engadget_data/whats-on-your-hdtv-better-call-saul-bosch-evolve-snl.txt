Sure AMC's Breaking Bad spin-off premiered last night, but tonight Better Call Saul is settling into its regular timeslot, and we can't wait to see (spoiler) again. This weekend the NBA takes a break for its all-star weekend ans Saturday Night Live celebrates its 40th anniversary (on a Sunday), but we'll be stuck on Amazon Prime watching new episodes of its series Bosch. Gamers can expect Super Stardust HD to make the jump from PS3 to PS4, while Turtle Rock presents its Left 4 Dead followup Evolve. Look after the break to check out each day's highlights, including trailers and let us know what you think (or what we missed).
