He sipped tea while ruminating a bit onwhat's up with the industry, and had the following to say when asked about the new MacBook: "The form factors areperfect, we don’t know how to make them any better." Hm, ok, hubris needle rising slightly. And about theOsbourne effect setting in on G5-based systems like the Power Mac, "... if you’re a business, you’rethinking, '...  I better get one of those quad PowerMacs [sic] while they’re still around.'" Alrightthen. And finally on the supposed lack of "iPod killers" at CES (looks like Newsweek forgot about the GigabeatS), "What’s going to happen is that Microsoft is going to have to get into the hardware business ofmaking MP3 players." Well, there you have it ladies and gentlemen, Steve Jobs officially predicted Microsoft'sgetting into the portable media hardware business. We'll check back with everyone on this in a year, sound good?
