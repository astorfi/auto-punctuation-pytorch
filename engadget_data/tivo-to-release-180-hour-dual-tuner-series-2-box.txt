The new box, model number TCD649180, features a 180-hour recording capacity, both USB andEthernet jacks for easy networking, and dual cable tuners -- although you can only record 2 regular cable or 1 regularand 1 digital channel simultaneously. Amazon lists the 180-hour box as available for pre-order at $350, which willprobably cut into the sales of the 140-hour version that goes for $40 more. [Note: Although no photo of the new modelis available, we imagine that it will look just like other Series 2 boxes, pictured]
