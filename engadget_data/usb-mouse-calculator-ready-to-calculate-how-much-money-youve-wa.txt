For other number-intensive tasks, the mouse will also double as a numeric keypad, and it appears to be small enough to pack away with your laptop for some number crunching on the go. If that's what you've been waiting for, you can get your fix now for Â£15 (or just over $30), which is sure more affordable than Casio's non-mouse USB calculator.[Via Coolest Gadgets]
