Announced at the same show two years ago with a $300 price tag, the base PS3 Slim model includes a 160GB hard drive. A lower price will provide a nice cushion for that $299 Call of Duty: Black Ops bundle, which just hit stores earlier this summer. Meanwhile, the 320GB model will see a $50 drop as well, with new pricing for both models kicking in immediately in the US and Europe, and August 18th in Japan. Sony also lifted the curtain on a €99 (about $140) budget PSP model, which adds a slick new design while dropping WiFi functionality. Because, really, who needs their handheld console to connect to the web? All that internet gaming stuff was so 2011.
