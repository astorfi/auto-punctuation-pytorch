This is a ATSC tuner with a twist, you set this little guy up on your network and wire it to your OTA antenna and whala you can now watch HDTV on any PC in your house. It has two tuners and an IR receiver for commands, but we are left wondering how easy it will be to make our networked PC emit IR commands in another room. The cool part is that it is supposed to support DVR software and works on all platforms. The question is, if it is supposed to come out this week how come they don't have a real picture of it? On the other hand this is the same company that brought us the TiVo Cache card for those of us TiVo users who have been around long enough to remember when they were the essential.If you want to try it out you can buy one from 9thtee online for $169, be sure to let us know how it works.[Thanks, Frankie!]
