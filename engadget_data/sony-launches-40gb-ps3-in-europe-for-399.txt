Announced today in London, the system that's been clamored over for what seems like ages now will "launch throughout the SCEE territories" on October 10th for €399 ($565), which means you don't have too awfully long to wait (or save up, for that matter) before getting your hands on one. Of note, the new model does feature just a pair of USB 2.0 ports rather than four, it no longer boasts the multi-memory card port and it is "no longer backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 titles." Also, the existing "60GB PS3 Starter Pack" will be reduced to €499 ($707), but only while supplies last. We'll keep our ear to the ground in case the news eventually impacts the US.
