Looks like Cingular will work with Chase, Visa, Nokia, Philips
and a host of other bigshots to test next-gen NFC
(near-field communication services, ala FeliCa)
for cellphones at Philips Arena in Atlanta. The main benefit of near-field technology is the ability to use a cellphone
to pay for products; just wave your phone in the general direction of a point-of-sale terminal at the Arena, and you
can buy your hot dogs and brew without missing half of the game. The test will be open to Atlanta Hawks season-ticket
owners, who will also have to have Chase Visa accounts
(Mastercarders might find this old hat) and be willing to
use Nokia 3220 phones modded with an NFC chip. We hope that Cingular and Nokia are at least giving the passholders the
phones. It's bad enough being a Hawks fan â€” these dudes should get something more for their loyalty than an offer that
requires them to ante up another $150.
