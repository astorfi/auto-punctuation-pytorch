Sure, during the MTV Video Music Awards we imagined not having to watch Russell Brand was a feature that should be included more often, but we didn't expect to see it tucked in among these other Blu-ray exclusive extras -- karaoke, the Pocket BLU iPhone remote control app, social BLU access, Mobile-To-Go support for taking bonus content with you and keyboard support. Anyone who buys the flick between September 28 and March 31, 2011 can also gain access to one of the following movies streamed to the player over BD-Live or directly to their mobile phone: Uncle Buck, Dazed & Confused or Life (Eddie Murphy & Martin Lawrence, not David Attenborough.) The flicks are notable not only because they appear to have been randomly chosen, but also since they're not available on Blu-ray yet. Unlike The Office, there's no promise of HD resolution here so the quality is still in question, but really, what Blu-ray release couldn't use an extra dose of John Candy? Check out all the details and extras in the press release after the break.

Aspiring record company exec Aaron Green (Hill) has the brilliant idea of rejuvenating the career of fading British rock star Aldous Snow (Brand) with a comeback concert at the world-renowned Greek Theater in Los Angeles. Dispatched by his boss (Sean Combs) to transport the notoriously dissolute Snow from London to L.A., Aaron has just 72 hours to wrangle the out-of-control rocker across the Atlantic. The seemingly simple assignment devolves into a thicket of groupies and parties, as Snow does his anarchic best to undermine his handler at every turn and Aaron does whatever it takes to keep his unruly charge on track.Visit: www.gethimtothegreek.net or www.facebook.com/gethimtothegreekUniversal Studios Home Entertainment is a unit of Universal Pictures, a division of Universal Studios (www.universalstudios.com).
