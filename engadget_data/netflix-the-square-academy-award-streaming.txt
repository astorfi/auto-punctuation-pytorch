Yesterday the nominees for the 86th Academy Awards were announced, and for the first time, that list includes a production that will be primarily distributed via Netflix (check here for a list of theater screenings). A documentary centering on the 2011 Egyptian revolution, The Square has already garnered recognition at Sundance and the New York Film Festival. Directed by Jehane Noujaim, it was the first major documentary acquired by Netflix and by all regards, it's a very good choice. After striking critical gold with a slew of TV shows and a few stand-up comedy specials, documentaries are the next focus for Netflix. Besides its first Oscar nominee, it already has The Short Game (trailer) and Mitt (trailer) under its hat. The Square just went live on the service this morning; watch it in full by clicking here or check out a trailer below.
