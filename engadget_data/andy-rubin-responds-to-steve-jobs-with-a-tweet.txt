Google's Andy Rubin -- the father of Android, as it were -- just uttered his first words on Twitter with the tweet you see above. From the looks of it, Andy (assuming this is him, the account is not "verified") is demonstrating how easy it is for anyone to download and compile the latest build of Android. Presumably Jobs will now join Twitter with a response like, "The definition of closed: shut up."
