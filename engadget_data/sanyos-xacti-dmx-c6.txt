As you have probably already guessed, this is the 6 megapixel version of the
XACTI DMX-C5 MPEG4 digicam and camcorder. In hopes of
being taken more seriously as a camcorder, they have
upped the recorded frame rate from 30 to 60fps. Other than that, nothing else has really changed (which is not
necessarily a bad thing): 5x optical zoom, tapeless recording to SD memory, and what appears to be the same 2-inch LCD
in that very light little package. Expect these to drop for about $655 in late November.
