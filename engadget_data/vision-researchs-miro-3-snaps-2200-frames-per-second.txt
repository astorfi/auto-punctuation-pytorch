 We've seen cameras with megapixel numbers that defy logic, and while Vision Research's latest camera doesn't quite do one million frames-per-second, it holds its own in the fast-snappin' game. The first member of the Phantom lineup, dubbed the Miro 3, is a lightweight, rugged device "targeted at industrial applications ranging from biometric research to automotive crash testing." Essentially, this little bundle of joy is meant to be strapped into daredevil-type situations in order to grab as many photos as possible within a split second, as it can programmed to snap 2,200 frames-per-second at 512 x 512 resolution, or up to 95,000 fps if you only need 32 x 32 images. It touts shutter speeds as low as two-microseconds, an ISO rating of up to 4,800 in monochrome, selectable 8-, 10- or 12-bit pixel depths, and a "number of external control signals allowing for external triggering, camera synchronization, and time-stamping." The Miro 3 looks to be available right now, but unless you need to capture stills of your next stunt, we wouldn't bother inquiring about the (presumably lofty) price.[Via Wired]
