If you happened to be watching The Walking Dead last night like everybody else, you may have noticed some clever new Android ads. One showed several Droid-looking characters checking their devices, with the smallest pulling out a cartoonishly-huge Android L smartphone. The others flaunted Android Wear and a tablet, while the "Be Together, Not the Same" tagline pointed viewers to a (currently dead) link. Naturally, that's led to speculation -- many think the device shown is the rumored Nexus 6 or X. That's a stretch, but we do know that Google has a surprisingly great new ad campaign hyping Android L on multiple devices, along with that mysterious link. With that, we do expect to see new stuff soon -- very soon.
