We've heard various bits and bobs about the M610i and K850i -- codenamed Elena and Sophia, respectively -- and judging by the shots above, they both are starting to look a little more legit. Specs are still unclear, though the word is the K850i will be packing a 5 megapixel camera with autofocus, xenon flash, a metal body, and judging by the pic above, a really crazy-looking key layout. The M610i will apparently replace the M600i as a business users' handset and add a 3.2 megapixel cam to the mix, a feature sorely missed in the M600i. No prices, availability, or concrete specs yet, but we'll do our darndest to keep the updates flowing as we get them.[Thanks, Michael and David]
