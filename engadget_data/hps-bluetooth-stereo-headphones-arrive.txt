HP has finally started shipping those Bluetooth Stereo
Headphones we first caught a glimpse of back in September, which are compatible with their h2200, h4100, h4300,
h5100, h5500, h6300, rx3000, and hx4700 series iPAQ Pocket PCs. They've even built controls into the headset itself, so
you don't have to fumbling around for your Pocket PC when you want to skip a track or adjust the volume or anything,
but they are serious about the headphones not working with anything except an iPAQ. A few people have reportedly tried
using them with other Bluetooth-enabled Pocket PCs, to no avail.
