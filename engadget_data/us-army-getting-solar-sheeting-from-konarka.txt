The US Army recently signed a $1.6 million contract with
Konarka Technologies to put the company's "power plastic"
sheeting into action.  The light-activated plastic sheeting can be incorporated into portable chargers for
batteries used for various portable electronics or even fashioned into large, power-generating tents, reducing the need
to lug around heavy generators.  The company is also working on weaving the plastic into camouflage-patterned
materials, so as not to stick out like, well, a giant solar panel in the desert.
