Pricing had already been announced at €370 ($465), but if you're interested in shedding an extra hundred for no apparent reason, Amazon Germany is now officially taking pre-orders for €469.50 ($590) in black -- just one of the five N8 shades Espoo will be pushing around the world. We think we'd recommend holding off on signing up for Amazon's enticing deal here, quite honestly -- especially considering the magnetic attraction we've got to that totally unapologetic orange version.
