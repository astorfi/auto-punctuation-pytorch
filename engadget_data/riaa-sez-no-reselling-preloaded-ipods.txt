Now that DAPs have been around for several years, and Apple keeps temptingus with new models, the market for second-hand players is growing substantially, and folks are offering up their oldunits preloaded with gigs of music. While some lawyers contend that the law is a bit gray concerning this practice, theRIAA considers it piracy and has started working with eBay to warn sellers of the consequences they face. Luckily forus, the buyers of every 'Pod we've ever unloaded have pro-actively requested that the drives get wiped -- who knew that60GB of Devo and Fugazi tracks would be so unpopular?
