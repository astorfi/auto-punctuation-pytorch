 Just as Facebook did a while back, Tumblr, too, has decided to rebuild its iOS application from the ground up. Inside this new version (3.2), daily users of the blogging service will find a completely redesigned Dashboard, which displays larger pictures and offers faster overall speeds when loading posts. In addition, Tumblr's also added "spiffy" notification previews to its iOS application, allowing folks to see when other users reply, like or reblog their posts -- oh, and better yet, GIFs now automatically play on the all-new Dashboard. The new Tumblr app's now live on Cupertino's App Store -- all you have to do is either hit the source link below or snag it directly via your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.
