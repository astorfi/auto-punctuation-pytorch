 Not completely sold on Canon's large sensor-packing PowerShot G1 X? The company's latest jumbo compact offers a comparable smooth focus effect, thanks to its super-wide f/1.8-2.8, 28-140mm optical zoom lens, with image stabilization that boosts your shooting capability by up to four stops. The camera, which is designed to replace the G12, features a 12.1-megapixel 1/1.7-inch CMOS sensor paired with a DIGIC 5 processor, enabling RAW shooting, 1080p video and a top sensitivity of ISO 12,800 all in a body that's significant smaller and lighter than its predecessor. There's also a super-sharp 922k-dot 3-inch LCD (no touchscreen here, not that we miss it) and a built-in optical viewfinder.

 The $500 G15 isn't set to hit stores until October, but we caught an early peek at Photokina today. A Canon representative also clued us in on the camera's naming scheme -- that jump from 12 right to 15. As we know, 13 is an unlucky number in North America and Europe, but the 14 was also avoided because the number four "sounds like an unlucky word" in Japanese. So, there you have it. Regardless of what it's called, though, the G15 is one powerful shooter, with a very solid design to boot. Though it is smaller than the G12, it's still far too large to fit in a pocket -- you'll likely walk around with this guy dangling from your neck. There's a mode dial up top, along with a dedicated exposure compensation dial, enabling more precise EV control. We weren't able to examine samples in order to evaluate the camera's bokeh capabilities, but Canon reps said that the effect is on par with the G1 X. You'll be able to get your own mitts on the G15 beginning next month, and you can catch our hands-on photos just below, along with a video walkthrough after the break.
