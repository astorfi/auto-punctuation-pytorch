The eagle-eyed posters at HowardForums might have spotted a clue, though -- the iPhone early-adopter $100 credit signup page clearly shows an iPhone running firmware v1.1.1, with a couple interesting additions: a setting for "Home Button," and another marked "International." The Home Button setting will likely bring the iPod touch's nifty double-tap music controller to the iPhone, but we have no idea what the International menu is for -- maybe for reducing some of those crazy roaming bills? Either way, we should know soon.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in][Via HowardForums]
