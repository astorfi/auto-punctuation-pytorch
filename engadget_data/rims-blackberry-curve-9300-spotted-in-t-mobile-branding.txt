Notice that T-Mobile logo at the bottom? That's the clearest indication yet that this particular 'Berry will soon be headed to T-Mob, but given that it's unlikely to support an upgrade to BlackBerry OS 6, your off-the-chart excitement level may indeed be unwarranted. At any rate, we're also hearing that Rogers in Canada will be snagging this at launch, but we'll be passing along official details just as soon as we get them.

Update: As it turns out, this actually isn't the first time we've seen a magenta-scarved Curve 9300, just the one that has us most convinced it's got a date with destiny. Not to mention stateside availability.
