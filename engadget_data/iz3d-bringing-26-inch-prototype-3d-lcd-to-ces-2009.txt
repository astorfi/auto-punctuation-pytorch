Even though its existing 22-inch 3D LCD has been around since mid-2007, the firm has recently hacked down the price and pushed it into retail outlets in order to drum up interest. At CES, it's bringing even more firepower in the form of a 26-inch prototype (pictured) that should do everything the current 22-incher does, just 4-inches better. Additionally, it'll have on display the Immersion Series, which places a trio of the iZ3D monitors together in order to better simulate flights and races. In case that's not enough, we're also told to expect a 22-inch widescreen 3D LCD that's console-friendly, meaning that the only thing standing between you and 3D Xbox 360 enjoyment is a wonky set of glasses and compatible software. We'll see how it all looks in around a fortnight.
