If you missed out on last fall's Xbox One sales, you're about to get a second chance. Microsoft is kicking off an Xbox Spring Sale on March 20th that will once again lop $50 off the Xbox One's price. And yes, that applies to any bundle -- the 500GB offerings start at as little as $299, and even that pricey The Division 1TB bundle will fall to a more reasonable $349. A handful of games (including Halo 5) will see a $20 price cut, too. The hardware deals will stick around "for a limited time," so you may want to act quickly if you're eager to play and don't want to wait until June to see what E3 will bring.



There's more coming soon afterward, too. On March 22nd, Microsoft begins a week-long Xbox Store sale that discounts games by 40 to 60 percent, including flagship games (like Fallout 4 and Far Cry Primal) and PC titles. It'll slash prices on movies and TV shows, too, and Xbox Live Gold members can get additional discounts of up to 10 percent. In short: if you're an Xbox fan with a little money to burn, you'll want to keep an eye out.
