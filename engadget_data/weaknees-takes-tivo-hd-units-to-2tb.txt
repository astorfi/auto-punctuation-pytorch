 Earlier this year, we saw that WeaKnees was offering up TiVo HD boxes with enough storage to hold a staggering 144 hours of HD content, and now the company is aiming to make a few holiday wishes come true by more than doubling that previous number. You heard right, TV packrats can now order up a TiVo HD Series 3 DVR from WeaKnees that can hold 292 hours of HD programming (or 2,800 hours of SD content). The DVR itself will house a 1TB SATA hard drive and come bundled with a 1TB external drive, and will cost you a whopping $1,599 (after $200 rebate, no less) to claim one as your own.
