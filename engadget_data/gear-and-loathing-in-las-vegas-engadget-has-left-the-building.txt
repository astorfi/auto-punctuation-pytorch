 
Hard to believe, but the 150,000 some-odd people that flooded into Vegas for CES have all gone home -- including your Engadget editors. Sure, it wasn't the most exciting CES in recent memory, but it wasn't without merit, either. Why, just think of the eight thousand HDTVs announced, blockbuster format war news, or iriver's unexpectedly show-stealing lineup. One thing's certainly for sure: you demanded we give wall-to-wall coverage of CES, and we'd like to hope we did you right. See you at CES 2009 -- and every day in between!
