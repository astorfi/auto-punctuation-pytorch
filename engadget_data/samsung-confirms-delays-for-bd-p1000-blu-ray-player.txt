Samsung has now confirmed rumors that thecompany's BD-P1000, its first consumer Blu-ray disc player, will be delayed from its original ship date of May 23 tosometime in late June. According to Samsung, the $999 player is being delayed due to "testing" needs, thoughwe certainly can't rule out the possibility that at least one of the "tests" the company is planning will bea check of the amount of BD media in themarketplace by the launch date. Samsung still says its player will be the first Blu-ray unit to hit the US market,though Sony'sBDP-S1 is currently scheduled for a July ship, so Samsung had better hope the tests are finished on time.[Thanks, Jim]
