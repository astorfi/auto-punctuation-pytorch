 Microsoft's deal to equip all of Fiat's newvehicles with Windows Automotive is starting to bear fruit: The first Windows-powered Fiats are due to debut at theGeneva Auto Show later this month. The system, now known as Blue&Me, will initially control the car's audio system,and will allow drivers to access Bluetooth cellphones via the car's audio system, control the audio via voice commandsand steering wheel-mounted controls, and have text messages read to them by the car's computer. A glove compartment USBport will allow the audio system to be expanded using any mass-storage compliant device. Future upgrades to the systemwill include GPS control and weather and traffic-monitoring systems. We assume that any upgrade that will put Windowsin the driver's seat is, however, a very long way away.
