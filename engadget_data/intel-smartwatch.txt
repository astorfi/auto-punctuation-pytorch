Intel is clearly committed to the wearable space -- in addition to smart earbuds and a smart headset, it just unveiled its own take on a smartwatch. The prototype it showed is completely independent of other devices for phone and internet access, and it's clever enough to handle location-based notifications. As with the other wearables Intel is announcing, the wristwear should be available sometime this year.
