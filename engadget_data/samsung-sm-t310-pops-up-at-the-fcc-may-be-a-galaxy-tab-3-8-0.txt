While there were few surprises when the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 swung past the FCC, we didn't expect additional tablets all that quickly. However, we're already looking at one today: a Samsung SM-T310 (the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 is the SM-T210) has just reached the US agency carrying 16GB of storage, Bluetooth and WiFi. The filing doesn't reveal just which product family is involved, but the 9-inch diagonal frame is about in line with that of an 8-inch tablet that isn't just a clone of the Galaxy Note 8.0. To us, that suggests the tablet may instead be a rumored Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 that would drop the S Pen and, by extension, the price. Samsung hasn't confirmed anything beyond incidental certifications and support pages for the SM-T310, but the FCC appearance hints that we'll learn considerably more in the near future.
