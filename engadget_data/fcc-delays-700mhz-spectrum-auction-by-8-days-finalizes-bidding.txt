 Back in August, it seemed pretty certain that the 700MHz spectrum auction would go down on January 16th of next year. Now, however, the FCC has officially delayed the auction by eight days to "provide interested parties with additional time after this announcement of competitive bidding procedures to develop business plans, assess market conditions and evaluate the availability of equipment for new 700MHz band services." Reportedly, the aforementioned parties only have from November 19th to December 3rd to fill out a short-form license application, and if all goes as planned, a "mock auction" should commence on January 18th, 2008.
