NVIDIA's new GeForce 9800 GTX+, hot on the heels of the GeForce 9800 GTX, bumps some specs with the help of its new, more efficient 55nm tech. The results include a 738 MHz core, 1836 MHz shader clock, 512MB GDDR3 memory (1000MHz), and 2- and 3-way SLI support. If we have to compare those specs to the stock card's, well, you're just not a GPU freak like some of us. Look for it in July for $229 retail.
