Improving audio quality is seemingly all the rage right now, and Rdio is looking to do its part to upgrade the listening experience. The music streaming service announced it's started converting its entire catalog to the AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) format, making 320 kbps its new standard. This means that while the audio will be improved, it'll still fall short of most of your CDs at home. In case you're wondering, Spotify offers three quality settings: 96 kbps (Normal), 160 kbps (High/Standard on desktop) and 320 kbps (Extreme/High on desktop) that's only available to premium users.



          
 
 
 During the process, Rdio has partnered with The Grateful Dead's Bob Weir on "Artist's for Quality" to further improve matters with the help of musicians. To keep things on the up and up, the company will work alongside artists and labels, continuing to bolster streams and overcome bandwidth issues. As of now, the higher quality won't hit your wallet for more money each month -- which is always a good thing.
