We know it's been a long time coming that
Netflix announced that they were
hopping into bed with TiVo on a movie download service,
but are we finally eking the first peek at their "Netflix Player"? Apparently the user in question who found this
noticed a "Downloadable" genre briefly exposed in his Netflix interface, and saw some registration form for the Netflix
Player serviceâ€”but it was nipped before he was able to get any further with it. Anyone seen something similar?
