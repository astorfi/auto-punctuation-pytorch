 So, you've ordered a brand-new draft-nrouter and want to get a laptop to match. Sure, you could always pick up a card and slot it in. But if you want aportable with the latest WiFi card built-in, you may want to take a look at the version of the Asus A6T being marketedby Asus and Airgo. The laptop includes an Airgo True MIMO card, which Airgo says is capable of throughput of up to 240MBps, along with full backwards-compatibility with existing 802.11 networks. While we don't expect Asus to sell a wholelot of these, if you want bragging rights to the laptop with the fastest built-in WiFi networking (when operating on acompatible network, that is), now's your chance.
