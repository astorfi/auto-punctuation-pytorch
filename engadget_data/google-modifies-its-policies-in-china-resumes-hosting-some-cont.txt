Faced with the possibility of China revoking its license to operate in the country (in addition to blocking the site), Google has now stopped automatically redirecting Chinese users to its Hong Kong website and is simply presenting them with a link to Google.com.hk instead. What's more, Google has now also starting hosting some content on Chinese servers again, including maps, music and translation services that it says cannot be censored, and which can be accessed on Google.com.hk from within mainland China. Google will continue to host its main search operations on servers in Hong Kong, however, and it still remains to be seen if these changes will be enough to ensure it keeps its license -- China will reportedly decide that on Wednesday.
