Panasonic has just unveiled a new plasma television which they claim to be the world's smallest PDP capable of
displaying 1080p content. The 50-inch
model, which is being shown at Japan's CEATEC 2005, had to overcome a number of technical difficulties in its
development. Most challenging was coaxing adequate brightness, stable discharge, and appropriate speed out of such tiny
pixels. Panasonic was able to achieve this breakthrough using new, proprietary methods as well as transferring some
technology from their 65-inch 1080p model. Better catch a flight to Tokyo if you want to pick one up, though; 50 inches
of 1080p goodness will only be available in Japan, starting November 1st (Note: model pictured is a 50-inch Panasonic
1080i plasma).
