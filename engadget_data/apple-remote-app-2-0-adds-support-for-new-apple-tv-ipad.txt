The interface is mostly the same -- a trackpad-like screen for ATV remote control and an iPod-like interface for more direct media playback -- but it's now optimized for the Retina display on the iPhone 4 and the larger screen size of the iPad. Since the new Apple TV is streaming-only, Remote also now has better support for controlling shared music libraries, making remote control of iTunes on your HTPC slightly easier as well. It's available now and it's free, so go grab it.
