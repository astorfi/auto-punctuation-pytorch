Unfortunately for amateurinterrogators, CIA-quality lie detection equipment is expensive and hard-to-find, so LEGO-enthusiast Michael Gasperi'sMindstorms-based "Galvanic Skin Response Sensor" may bejust the DIY option you need to liven up your next party. Basically a set of foil-lined velcro strips attached by 9Vwire to an RCX control brick, Gasperi's lie detector works on the principal that people sweat more when they'refibbing, so his device measures the skin's electrical resistance of whomever's getting grilled. One word of caution ifyou decide to build one of these on your own: unless you want to end up under the hot lights of a real interrogationroom, make sure to, like, keep your subject alive by powering your detector from batteries and not deadly AC.[Via Make]
