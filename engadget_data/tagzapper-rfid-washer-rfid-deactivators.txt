Wary of RFID tags giving your location away?
Trick those trackers with one of these two devices: the TagZapper (photo, at left) from West End Laboratories is a
lightweight, handheld device for deactivating RFID tags, preventing RFID scanners from working their magic. Likewise,
the RFIDwasher (photo, at right) also detects and destroys RFID in its tracks. Look for both devices to be in
production by the end of this year.
