There's no question that the hottest new video site these days is Hulu and every media streamer and HTPC software around it trying to get in on the action by offering a way to access the fast amount of Hollywood content on bigger screens. The latest in the mix is Windows Media Center via a plug-in called SecondRun.tv. Before you get too excited though, it should be noted it's still in a private beta, but the screen shots do look promising. Now if only the video and sound quality of Hulu wasn't completely unbearable on a 60-inch HDTV with surround sound.
