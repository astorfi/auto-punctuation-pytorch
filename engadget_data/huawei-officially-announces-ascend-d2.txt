 Chinese phone maker Huawei just pulled the lid back on its Ascend D2. The D2 features a 5-inch 1,920 x 1080 full HD display, a 1.5GHz quad-core processor, 13-megapixel rear-facing camera, 1.3-megapixel front-facing shooter, 2GB of RAM and Android 4.1. While the Ascend Mate may dwarf it, we're pleasantly surprised what Huawei's managed to cram in here. We've got a hands-on video and more impressions after the break.




 
 A mash-up of plastic and metal, the Ascend D2 feels slightly chunkier than HTC's Droid DNA. While its design doesn't leave much to the imagination, the device seemed like it should be able to handle a full day's work -- that 3,000mAh cell should help there. Images were bright and fluid on its massive screen and Huawei's lightweight Emotion UI didn't appear to compromise the device's performance on the 1.5GHz quad-core processor. On the top of the device, you'll find a micro-USB port for charging and syncing and if you shimmy down its right side you'll be greeted by the power button and volume controls. At the bottom of the Ascend D2 is a Dolby Digital Plus speaker with the standard audio jack rested next to it. As for the device's cameras, its primary 13-megapixel shooter bests the Ascend Mate's 8-megapixel sensor, while a 1.3-megapixel camera peers out the front. While we're looking forward to spending some serious alone time with the D2, pricing and release dates were absent from today's announcement, beyond arriving this quarter. Hopefully, Huawei will dish these details soon -- possibly in Barcelona.
