Chinese scientists have developed a robot that makes body movements and appropriate facial expressions, to be used
in preschool classrooms to help kids with rudimentary knowledge development. Named "Baizhixing" ("smart star"), the
little 35 cm tall robot is intentionally cartoonish and animal-like so as to be more readily accepted by young
children. Under the overalls, Baizhixing integrates control systems, mechanical structures, speech synthesis and
scalable networking technologies. Is it just us, or does this little guy look like an aging, pudgy, and stoned version
of Jen the Gelfling?
