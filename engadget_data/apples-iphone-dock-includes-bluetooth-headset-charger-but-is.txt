It was just posted to Apple's new iPhone Q&A page. What we don't know, however, is whether or not this is an optional dock or if it's the one included in the box (a "dock" is included with the iPhone). It's certainly not the stubby dock Apple pictured earlier. We're guessing it's a paid accessory which will likely cost you more than the Chinese knock-off.Update: Our sources let us know that it's included in the box with the headset -- no wonder it's gonna cost about $120.[Via TUAW, thanks Aaron P.]Read -- Included dockRead -- Q&A page
