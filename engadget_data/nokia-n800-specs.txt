       Alright, we had some unboxing porn of the new Nokia N800 for ya yesterday, but what we didn't post up were its specs. Fortunately Carrypad has all the gory details on the new Internet Tablet, which sports a 4.1-inch, 800x480 pixel touch screen, a 320MHz processor, 128MB of RAM, 256MB of Flash ROM, dual SD memory card slots, 802.11b/g WiFi, a built-in camera (they don't specify resolution), and Bluetooth 2.0. Apparently CompUSA, which carried the original Nokia 770, already has 'em for sale in some stores.
