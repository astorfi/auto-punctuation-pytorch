If you bought an Apple portable between October 2004 and May 2005, check your serial number â€” that laptop could be
hot, and not in a good way. Apple is recalling the batteries on a number of 12-inch iBook and Powerbook G4s and 15-inch
Powerbook G4s because an internal electrical short could pose a fire threat. Affected model numbers are A1061, A1078
and A1079, with serial numbers HQ441 - HQ507 or 3X446 - 3X510. You can get a free replacement via Apple's website, and
we imagine the process ought to be pretty smooth now that they've had
some practice with this type of thing before.
