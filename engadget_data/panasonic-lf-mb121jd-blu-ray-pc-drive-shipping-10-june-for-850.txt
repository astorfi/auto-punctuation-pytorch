The drive delivers on both 25GB and dual-layer 50GB Blu-ray discsallowing you to write at 2x (72Mbps) speeds to both BD-R / RE formats via a suite of bundled software. It also features8x write speeds to both DVD±R and DVD RW, 4x to DVD±R DL, 6x to DVD-RW, 5x to DVD-RAM, 24x to CD-R and 16xto CD-RW. Pretty much the same unit (and may well be) as the BenQ BW1000, but superior toboth the Samsung SH-B022(which can read but not write to DVD and CD formats) and the Pioneer BDR-101A which,oddly, the last time we looked, didn't support CDs at all. Panasonic also announced their 25GB and 50GB 2x discs whichwill hit the shelves starting April 28 just in time to prime the pump a bit.[Via Newlaunches]
