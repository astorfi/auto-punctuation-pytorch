There's nothing totally groundbreaking here -- but the 10.1-incher (unboxed in white) is looking fairly solid. This model, the D150-0B, boasts a 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270 CPU, 1GB of RAM, a 160GB hard drive, a 1024 x 600 display, and a 3-cell battery. Future iterations including the D150-1B and the D150-2B will include 6-cell battery and Intel Atom 1.66GHz N280 processor options. Check out a few more photos here after the break, and hit the read link for the full, lovely set.
