The new Dish Anywhere app is your portal for live streaming, powered by Sling, along with on-demand content direct from the web. As one of three apps designed specifically with Hopper with Sling owners in mind, Anywhere is tasked with displaying movies and TV shows directly from your set-top box at home. You also have access to the programming guide, and a full remote control for familiar navigation.

 We tried out the Anywhere app while connected to a Hopper on the same network. It took a few moments to connect, but once we were linked up, channel flips were speedy and content looked smooth, though it did appear to be a bit softer than HD. Naturally, the feed looked best on an iPhone, with the iPad only serving to magnify artifacts. In short, it's probably not yet time to retire your TV, but if you spend a lot of your time away from the living room and have the bandwidth to spare, the value proposition of a pricey satellite subscription just jumped up a tick.
