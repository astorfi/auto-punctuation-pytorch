Out of seemingly nowhere, Tesla Motors has just announced the lovingly refined Roadster Sport, which arrives with a hand-wound stator and increased winding density for lower resistance and higher peak torque. You'll also notice Yokohama Ultra High Performance tires, improved suspension with adjustable dampers and anti-roll bars that will be tuned to the driver's preference. The automaker is taking orders now in the US ($128,500 and up) and Europe (starts at â‚¬112,000), with deliveries slated to begin in late June -- oh, and if you're currently on the waiting list for a standard Roadster, you most certainly can scratch the upgrade itch.
