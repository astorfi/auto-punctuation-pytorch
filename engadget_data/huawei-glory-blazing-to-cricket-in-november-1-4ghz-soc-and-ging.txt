PC Magazine caught a glimpse of a pre-production unit, which features a 1.4GHz MSM8655T Snapdragon SoC -- the same as the upcoming Pre 3, which supports (but may not feature) dual mode GSM / CDMA for world roaming -- a 4-inch 854 x 480 TFT display, and an 8 megapixel AF camera with LED flash. While the manufacturer suggested its smartphone would be dual-core, the single Scorpion CPU associated with this chipset suggests otherwise -- though customers can rightfully expect an Adreno 205 GPU. Rounding out the components, you'll find a beefy 1900mAh battery, EV-DO Rev. A., WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, and 2GB of storage (with an available expansion slot). Interestingly, Huawei hints that we'll see a "surprising" multimedia solution that compensates for the lack of HDMI -- anyone care to place bets on MHL or DLNA? The phone will ship in November with Gingerbread (followed by an upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich), and is expected to retail for approximately $299. With such lofty components, it's easy to see where Cricket fans will be directing thanks for this holiday feast.
