Said proof comes via the certification gurus at TUV Rheinland who've listed both a P101UNA and P121UNA in their systems from Palm; P101 and P121 are the numeric codes for the Pre Plus and Pixi Plus, respectively, and "UNA" indicates a GSM variant (versus the deliciously underhanded "EWW" for CDMA). Now, neither AT&T nor Palm have given a lick of indication what two models they'll be releasing later this year -- but this is certainly a convenient coincidence, isn't it?
