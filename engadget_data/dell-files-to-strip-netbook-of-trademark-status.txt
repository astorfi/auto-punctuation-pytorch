It was only a matter of time before something like this happened, of course -- the word "netbook" is in such widespread usage that Psion's nastygrams are unlikely to have any meaningful impact, and the company's weasely claims that it was only going after those "making a direct financial profit" basically guaranteed it was chasing after one of the big players. Word to the wise, Psion: it's almost certain that you'll lose this legal battle, but the PR war is easily won -- and coupled with an interesting product, like, say, an all-new Ion-powered Psion Netbook, you could actually come out way ahead. Think about it, won't you?[Via thegadgetsite]
