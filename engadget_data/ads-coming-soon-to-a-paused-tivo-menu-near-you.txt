 This should make a lot of people unhappy. According to a press release issued today, TiVo will now offer ad space on its pause menu. Designed to outsmart those who fast-forward through the ads (we assume that's almost everyone at this point, right?) buyers will be able to target viewers of a specific show, or they can opt to "cast a wider net" and advertise within genres or keywords of program descriptions. Even if this means we'll be seeing ads for Shrute Farms beets during The Office, we're still going to hold out hope for the TiVo version of Adblock.[Via Zatz Not Funny]
