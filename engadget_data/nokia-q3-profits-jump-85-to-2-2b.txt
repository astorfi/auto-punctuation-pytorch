 While everyone else was distracted by some touchscreen thing, Nokia spent the past quarter absolutely dominating the worldwide market for low-end phones, and the results, announced today, seem like the company might have the right idea: Nokia's profits rose 85 percent to 1.56B euros ($2.2B) on a sales increase of 28 percent to 12.9B euros ($18.2B). Although the increase this quarter was chalked up to increased sales of phones that cost less that $40 in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, sales did fall in North America -- something Nokia will have to turn around if the company is to achieve its goal of a worldwide 40 percent market share. That's for another day, though -- for now, onnentoivotus!
