If you've ever stumbled across a juicy quote in a Reddit thread, you now have an easy way to share it on the web without losing context: Reddit has switched on support for embedding comment threads. All you have to do is visit a comment's permalink, grab the code and paste it into your blog or forum. You can include the parent comment to provide background, and there's a rather wise option to hide comments if they're edited -- your fellow redditors can't prank you by changing things after the fact. Give it a shot if you'd like to do more with that laugh-worthy AMA response than simply take a screenshot or post a link.
