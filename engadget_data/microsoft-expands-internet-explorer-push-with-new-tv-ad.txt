   Internet Explorer may still be the world's number one web browser, but Microsoft has a declining market share to deal with, as well as the small problem of folks hesitant to upgrade from an earlier version for one reason or another. The company's now making a new push to address both issues, however, and has today unveiled a relatively rare Internet Explorer TV commercial extolling the virtues of IE9. That ad continues the "beauty of web" campaign Microsoft has been promoting as of late, and focuses more on web-based apps and games than traditional web sites -- or, for that matter, the browser itself. What remains to be seen is just how big a marketing push Microsoft plans to put behind the new ad campaign, but it is an actual TV ad, not just a web ad.
