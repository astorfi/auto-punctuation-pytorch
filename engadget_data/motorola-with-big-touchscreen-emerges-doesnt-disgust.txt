Hard as it may be to believe, it seems that Moto might be working on some serious hardware to compete with... well, anything. We don't have any information on this device we're seeing here beyond what we can make out from the picture -- 5 megapixel Kodak-branded camera, big touchscreen, TV-out, and a xenon flash -- but the tip suggests that this could be Moto's first Android device. We tend to think that's not very likely, since we don't have Home or Back buttons on the front (which would also rule out Windows Mobile 6.5 without a Start button), but we suppose they could be hiding out on the side somewhere -- and frankly, we don't see Motorola blowing anyone away with a touchscreen version of its proprietary platform any time soon. At any rate, let's just hope this shot is real, and the phone's almost ready for retail.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
