 And they're off! Devs, engineers and the simply curious are, right now, pounding away at their keyboards trying to secure themselves a spot at Google's big I/O event for 2013. The $900 tickets ($300 for a limited number of "academic" passes) are on sale as of 7AM PT / 10AM ET at the source link. Of course, as usual, these babies probably won't last more than a few minutes so act fast. Though, if you miss out on your chance to attend, you can always live vicariously through us.

 Update: Well, that was quick. All those tickets were snatched up in about 50 minutes. So, if you didn't secure your spot, you're sadly out of luck. But don't worry, we'll be there and will make sure to tell you all about it. With as little gloating as possible, of course.
