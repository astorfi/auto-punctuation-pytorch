Ouch. Of course, this is a pretty standard tactic as far as major patent disputes go -- this is just a second front of the same war, and we'd expect Apple to lodge an ITC complaint of its own in due time. What could make this interesting is the ITC's power to ban imports of infringing products in relatively short order, so we'll be keeping a close eye on this one.
