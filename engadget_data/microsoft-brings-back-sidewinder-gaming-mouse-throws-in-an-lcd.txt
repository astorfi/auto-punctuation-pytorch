 Not too long after Razer resurrected the classic Boomslang, Microsoft is reviving the SideWinder line with the introduction of a decked out gaming mouse. For starters, the 2,000 DPI wired critter sports a Quick Turn feature that lets users "check their perimeter at any angle," a weight cartridge system, a variety of feet to match glide preferences, instantaneous DPI adjustment, and a cable management system to boot. Moreover, Microsoft claims that this is the first gaming mouse to arrive with an LCD built right in, which allows users to "easily keep track of key gaming actions, including their DPI and steps for recording macros." Of course, we'd recommend actually wielding one of these things before plunking down your $79.95 come October, but the specification sheet is mighty impressive, indeed. Check out the hands-on action in the gallery below.
