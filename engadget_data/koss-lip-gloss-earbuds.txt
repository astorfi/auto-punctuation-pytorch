 Awwww, ain't it so cute you just wanna puke? Koss is putting out a set of earbuds that is also a lip gloss compact. The Pop Gloss headphones will come in pink (of course), purple, blue and orange, with four "luxurious" lip gloss shades to choose from. According to Koss, these phones are perfect for "when sound is as important as appearance" because, you know (as Koss clearly does), appearance is usually what women are concerned with above all - functionality be damned! Then again, at $9.99 a pop, are we really gonna get a lot of sound quality out of these things, or are we just gonna have a really inconveniently messy carrying case for some cheap earbuds?
