 The enduring popularity of "Planet Earth" is compelling enough to its backers to convince them to go back to the well. The Discovery Channel and BBC's Natural History Unit are teaming up again to cover the poles of the Earth in "Frozen Planet." HD content captured from the Arctic and Antarctic? Sign us up! You've got plenty of time to continue enjoying that HDM copy of Planet Earth, though -- the new feature is not set to air until 2012. Yeah, that hurts, but quality takes time, friends. The real question is what HDM format this feature will emerge on (if any still exist); this is one title we'll be putting in our library wishlist.
