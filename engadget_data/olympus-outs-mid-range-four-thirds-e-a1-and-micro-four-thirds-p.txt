Positioned in the enormous gap between Olympus' flagship E-3 and E-520 shooters, the new E-A1 DSLR inherits the E-3's high-speed 11-point AF system, image stabilization with 5 stops correction, while featuring improved weather sealing around a housing we expect to be relatively compact by comparison. Available in Q1 2009 if things stay on track.As co-conspirators with Panasonic behind the Micro Four Thirds format, it's no surprise to hear that Olympus also has a tiny, mirror-less prototype camera to show off at Photokina as well. The only surprise is that it'll be on display under glass without a date, specs, or price.[Via cnet]
