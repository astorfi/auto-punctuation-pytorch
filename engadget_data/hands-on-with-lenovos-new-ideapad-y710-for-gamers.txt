The custom arrow key and system-monitor LCD unit replaces the numeric keypad, and it's rocking a Blu-ray drive and Dolby Home Theater certification -- which involves four built-in speakers plus a bottom-mounted sub that you can shut off when you don't feel like bumping it too hard. On top of that, it's got a second hot-swappable hard drive that sits in a carrier with a mini-USB port, so you can yank the drive and transfer files on the go. All in all, a sweet rig -- but check out how much bigger it is than the tiny U110 in the gallery.
