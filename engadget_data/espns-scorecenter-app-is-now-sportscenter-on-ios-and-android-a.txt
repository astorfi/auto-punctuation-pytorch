Say goodbye to ESPN's ScoreCenter app. Don't worry though, the sports broadcast network has renamed the popular mobile software SportsCenter alongside a redesign. The refresh brings video highlights, social functionality and personalized content to those looking to remain up to speed or follow along on-the-go. For example, you'll now be able to set favorite teams to quickly display content and get info on those clubs to the app's inbox. Clubhouses "for every team and league under the sun" serve up all of the latest franchise news in one convenient spot. Tweets from on-air commentators and shows are included with ESPN Now alongside access to WatchESPN content for easy streaming of live or archived events and much more. The latest version is now available for both iOS and Android devices via their respective app libraries.
