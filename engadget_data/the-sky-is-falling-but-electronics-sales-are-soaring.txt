People are cutting back on everything from vacations to vaccinations, yet are apparently still quite willing to open their wallets for new electronic goodies -- if you believe the group that represents all those goody makers, at least. The Consumer Electronics Association is saying that sales of gadgets and the like are surging compared to this time last year, with flat-panel TV sales alone up 40-percent. The explanation is that people are staying home more often to save funds, so are investing in home entertainment systems, videogames, laptops, and other miscellaneous toys to stave off cabin fever, particularly when they can find good deals online. Maybe that explains HD-DVD's continued success?
