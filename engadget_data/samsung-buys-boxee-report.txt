Several Israeli news agencies are reporting that Korean electronics giant Samsung purchased set-top box company Boxee today. The Tel Aviv-based company apparently got less than the $30 million it was reportedly seeking, thus coming up at a loss since being founded in 2007. Boxee's approximately 40 employees are said to be staying on, including president Avner Ronen. A Boxee rep tells Engadget "We can't comment on the accuracy of those reports." Samsung has not yet responded to our inquiries, but we'll update this post as we learn more.


Update: TechCrunch is also confirming the acquisition, and cites its own "reliable sources."


Update 2: Samsung confirmed the acquisition to us this afternoon. A Samsung statement reads, "Samsung has acquired key talent and assets from Boxee. This will help us continue to improve the overall user experience across our connected devices."
