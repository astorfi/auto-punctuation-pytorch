Despite Twitter making it easier to report cyber harassment, its measures still fall woefully short. To wit, game developers Zoe Quinn, one of GamerGate's biggest targets, and Alex Lifschitz have teamed up to form an online abuse help network. Crash Override says its goal is to provide a support network for victims of SWATting, doxxing and other maliciousness both preventatively and reactively. It accomplishes this by using "well-established, humane and transparent channels to disempower abuse and reduce the ability abusers have to perpetuate it." The outfit notes that in its trial runs it's effectively helped abuse targets head off SWATting attempts and lock down their personal information, too, all without resorting to more harassment. What's more, Crash Override counts whitehat hackers, infosec professionals and lawyers among its agents.



As The Mary Sue reports, the services offered are free of charge with Lifschitz and Quinn running everything with out-of-pocket funds. If you need their help or would like to lend a hand (Crash Override is a by victims, for victims organization), feel free to drop 'em a line.

In the past month we have prevented several potentially deadly SWATings and secured more people against hacking and doxxing attempts.
