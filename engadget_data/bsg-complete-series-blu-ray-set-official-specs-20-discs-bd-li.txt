 Finally, Universal has confirmed the rumors that Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series will arrive on Blu-ray July 28, packing the previously noted $349 MSRP for the 20 disc set. There's plenty of exclusive Blu-ray features planned, with U-control, DTS-HD MA soundtrack, an interactive guide to the ships and characters from the series, a BD-Live powered "Ultimate Battle" game, look behind the scenes with composer Bear McCreary and more. Not mentioned? Whether or not all that cash can buy a slightly better case design this time around.[Via TheHDRoom]
