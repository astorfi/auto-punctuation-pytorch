The Haus of BlackBerry's now accepting app submissions for the upcoming Will.I.Approved PlayBook tablet -- and just as promised, it's giving free PlayBooks to developers who get their work accepted and ready for the App World store before the tablet launches in North America. Limit is one per registered dev no matter how many times you submit or how simple / complex the app is, so long as RIM gives it the thumbs up. Interested in the grand prize of full acquisition? Sorry, that seat's been taken.
