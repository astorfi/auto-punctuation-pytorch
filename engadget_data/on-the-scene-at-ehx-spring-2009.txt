We spent the first day of the show scouring the floor for cool new stuff and overall came away disappointed. The show was much, much smaller this year and the demos in Demo Alley weren't that impressive either. There were a few gems though, so we went ahead and snapped a few pictures which are included in a gallery below. A few of the highlights were a first hand look at The Media Center University, a few new ways to run wires to our HDTVs, and an up close look at the new MX-6000 from Universal Remote Control.
