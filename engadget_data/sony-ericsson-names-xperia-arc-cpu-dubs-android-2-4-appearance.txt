We certainly did when we got the chance to handle one for ourselves at CES, but today we're less concerned with its exterior and more interested in what lies beneath. The 1GHz processor we knew about already has been specified as a Qualcomm MSM8255 and will be joined in the good fight against sluggish performance by an Adreno 205 graphics chip. On the software front, that random sighting of an Arc with Android 2.4 has been put down as a simple "misconfiguration" by Sony Ericsson, exploding a million conspiracy theories around the web. One encouraging note here is that SE (kinda) acknowledges its inglorious record with Android updates and promises recent changes have put it in "a good position to make sure that Xperia Arc will get later versions in a timely manner." We'll believe it when you make it, Sony.
