More specifically, he noted that the PS3 "is expected to soon offer a firmware upgrade to boost its Blu-ray interactivity functionality," but unfortunately, he failed to elaborate. One could hope that the update would bring along at least some of the niceties waiting in Profile 1.1, but until we get clarification (or are surprised by the actual release), we'll leave the speculating to you.[Via HighDefDigest]
