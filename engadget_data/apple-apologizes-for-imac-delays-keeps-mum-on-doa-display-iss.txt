The new iMac has been a huge hit and we are working hard to fulfill orders as quickly as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience or delay this may cause our customers.
 Considering the 27-inch Core i7 machines are both the major attraction of the latest iMac refresh and the source of the most headaches for Apple, it's quite appropriate that the company would address its failure to make more prompt deliveries, but we're troubled that there's no further acknowledgement of the widespread issues plaguing those who have received their deliveries. Ah well, we'll take what little corporate humility we can find, and if you're fretting about your own machine, you can check it out for some of the more common defects at the link below.
