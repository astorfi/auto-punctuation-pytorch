The ProBook models, the 6440b (14-inch) and 6540b (15.6-inch), have a starting price of $949, while the gunmetal aluminum-clad EliteBook 8440w and 8540w start at $1,299 and $1,499, respectively. Finally the more traditional platinum aluminum 8440p and 8540p start at $1,099 and $1,249. The differences between the six models might seem minimal to the untrained eye, but high marks like the spill-resistant drains in the EliteBook models, 24 hour battery option on the 8440p / 8540p might help make sense of the endless configurations that will be available among these models. Everything should hit virtual shelves in February, and there's PR after the break. 

Update: PCWorld claims that HP will also be offering up to 3x USB 3.0 ports on its EliteBook 8540p and EliteBook 8540w laptops.
