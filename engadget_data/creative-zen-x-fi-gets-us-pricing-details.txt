Announced earlier this week in Singapore, the well-equipped PMP should be available soon (no specific ship date is mentioned) in 8GB ($149.99), 16GB ($199.99) and 32GB ($279.99) models. Interestingly, the 8GB iteration doesn't seem to include built-in WiFi based on the cryptic header over at Buy.com, but we suspect we'll have to wait things out a bit longer before jumping to too many conclusions.[Thanks, Dr. Slo]
