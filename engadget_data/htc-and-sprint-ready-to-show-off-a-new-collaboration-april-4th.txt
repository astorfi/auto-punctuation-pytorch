   We just got invited to a special party put on by Sprint and HTC on April 4th to witness the latest collaboration between the two companies. Could this be the LTE-capable One X we heard about yesterday? No matter what it is, Dan Hesse and Jason Mackenzie will be there, so you know it's going to be kind of a big deal. We'll join the two head honchos there as well -- and we're definitely looking forward to it.  Update: TechoBuffalo has it on good authority that it'll be the One X (dubbed "Jet") unveiled in New York City, and will almost certainly boast LTE. Then again, so will Sprint's eventual edition of the Galaxy Nexus, which is growing more and more dated with each passing hour.
