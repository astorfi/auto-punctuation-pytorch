According to Nokia's press release, the patents in question have been licensed by some 40 other companies, "including virtually all the leading mobile device vendors," and Apple's refused to agree to "appropriate" license terms. That's pretty vague, actually -- it could either mean that Apple was willing to license the patents at a price less than what Nokia demanded, or it could mean that Apple refused to pay at all. We'll obviously be covering this one in great detail as it progresses -- stay tuned for a fun decade or so of litigation.  [Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
