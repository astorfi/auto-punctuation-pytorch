If you think the hottest thing about the
Moto PEBL is the way it pops open at
the mere press of a tiny button, but don't want to wait until you can actually get one from your carrier, you can
always pick up Takara's Oritatamisiki Keitai Opener, a Â¥980 ($8) attachment that you clip onto the side of a flip
phone. Push a button on the side, and it'll open your phone for you, sparing you the oh-so-difficult task of popping it
open on your own. It even comes in four colors to coordinate with most phones. Sounds like $8 well-spent, though if
you're lazy enough to want one of these, you probably don't have the energy to actually track one down from a Japanese
source.
