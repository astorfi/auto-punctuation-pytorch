Field report tidbits from Engadget's mobile insider, the Boy Genius.As Pete so eleganty reported earlier the HTC Excalibur -- or T-Mobile Dash -- will be coming stateside soon. How soon is still unconfirmed, but I've heard as early as the end of this month; review units have indeed already found there way into the hands of the paparazzi press. Stare at the T-Mobile logo, let it control you. Thanks to none other than super-producer Just Blaze for the teamwork on this one!
