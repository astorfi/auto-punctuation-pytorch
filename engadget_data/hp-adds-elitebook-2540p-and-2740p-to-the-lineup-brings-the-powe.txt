So did we, but apparently it needed just a little bit more time to pull the 12.1-inch 2540p and 2740p out of the oven. An update to the 2530p, the 3.8-pound 2540p still has the same magnesium alloy chassis that's met all those super-tough MIL-STD 810G military standard tests, but its innards have been freshened up with the alluring scent of Intel's 2010 Core processors. Prices start at $1,099, but in typical HP fashion it will be configurable online with tons of juicy options, including standard and low voltage Core i5 and i7 processors and a range of 7,200RPM and SSD drives. 

Up next is the 2740p which packs much of the same internal spec options as the 2540p (sans the low-voltage CPUs), but puts them into a convertible tablet form factor. Starting at $1,599, its capacitive multitouch 12.1-inch display now supports both pen and finger input and thus pits it head-to-head with Lenovo's ThinkPad X201t, though from our hands-on we found the 3.8-pound 2740p to be much slimmer and lighter. A lot of that has to do with its flush battery, but if adding some juice (and thickness) is your thing, you can add a slate battery (or two!) to the bottom of the system. Both the 2540p and 2740p will be available later this month, but hit the hands-on gallery below to get a look at these magnesium puppies up close.

"HP continues to implement the latest innovations to help large companies and SMBs exceed productivity expectations."The notebook PCs are the latest in the company's series of launches providing businesses a wide selection of products to refresh their aging business technology. Powerful and light notebook PCs for the road warrior Now offering standard voltage Intel processors, the HP EliteBook 2740p tablet PC combines the power and reliability of an HP business notebook PC with the flexibility of a tablet, making it ideal for users on the go. The 2740p starts at 3.8 pounds and includes a 12.1-inch diagonal LED display or optional outdoor-view display with less reflection and a higher contrast for easier viewing in natural light.(1) The touchscreen option allows users to get work done more intuitively and faster based on their choice of input methods. Multitouch gestures, finger taps and swipes across the screen allow users to navigate through applications and menus, as well provide access to information and websites. The HP EliteBook 2740p offers a variety of battery solutions for lightweight configurations, including a six-cell li-ion prismatic battery, which provides up to 5 hours of uptime, and an optional HP 2700 Ultra-Slim Battery that provides up to 11 hours when combined with the standard battery.(1,2) The optional HP 2740 Ultra-Slim Expansion Base(1) allows users to dock their notebook PCs to utilize peripherals without needing to constantly plug and unplug. This innovative expansion base includes a DVD+/-RW drive, fits neatly into a briefcase so the optical drive can easily travel, and supports DisplayPort so users can easily connect to an external monitor. The expansion base also has an eSATA port, allowing for connection to an external RAID array, HDD and to optical drives for fast and easy storage. The HP EliteBook 2540p offers business users a choice of Intel® Core™ processors in either standard voltage for maximum performance – a first for HP ultra-portable notebooks – or low voltage for increased flexibility with the convenience of an optical drive or secondary hard drive. As the lightest-weight offering in the HP EliteBook portfolio, the 2540p is equipped with a 12.1-inch diagonal LED display, optional 2-megapixel webcam with business card reader software and HP Fingerprint Sensor.

HP Long Life Batteries reduce overall battery waste by requiring fewer batteries to be used over the life of the PC. Both the 2740p and 2540p are engineered to meet the tough MIL-STD 810G military-standard tests(5) for vibration, dust, humidity, altitude, and high and low temperatures. They also are EPEAT® registered in the United States and offer ENERGY STAR® qualifying configurations. HP strives to use less material in products through improvements in product design and technological advances. In the company's efforts to reduce the amount of raw materials consumed and help protect natural resources, the HP EliteBook 2540p Notebook PC employs post-consumer recycled plastic resin in at least 12 percent of its total plastic content. Additionally, the EliteBook 2740p and 2540p come preloaded with a trial version of HP SkyRoom,(6) an affordable, high-definition (HD) videoconferencing software(7) that offers live, real-time collaboration for face-to-face meetings.

Innovations for the mobile professional Available on all new HP ProBooks and the EliteBook p-series, the HP DayStarter(10) allows users to get a head start on the day's activities with access to key information even before Windows finishes booting up. A customized display includes a calendar (12-hour time period) and battery charge state, and a Windows loading indicator appears while Windows continues to load in the background. The HP EliteBook and most HP ProBook notebook series also include HP QuickWeb, which allows users to access the web in seconds when the PC is shut down; HP Power Assistant, which provides total visibility over the notebook PC's reported power consumption, with tools allowing users to conserve power, stretch battery run time, and accurately monitor reported power needs;(11) and spill-resistant keyboards. Central Management for HP ProtectTools provides IT personnel remote functionality to deploy and manage key security policies across the entire business. For example, IT can centrally define and deploy security policies based on users and user types, monitor and audit client activity, and recover access for remote users who have forgotten their passwords.
