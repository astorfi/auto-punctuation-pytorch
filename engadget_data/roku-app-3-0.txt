Roku's mobile software just got a long overdue coat of fresh paint. The remote control apps for both Android and iOS now have a minimalist (and very purple) interface, as well as search that lets you track down content based on actors, directors and similar minutiae. It's now easier to control most any Roku device on the network, too. You don't have to use an account for most functions, and a single sign-in will automatically log in to every device linked to your credentials. There's still no iPad-optimized app -- really, Roku? -- but what's here is definitely worth grabbing from the App Store or Google Play.
