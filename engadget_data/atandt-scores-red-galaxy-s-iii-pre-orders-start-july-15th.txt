 Not a fan of the white or "Pebble Blue" shells the Galaxy S III is packed in, looking for something a little more sultry perhaps? Well, if you're an AT&T customer, you've got a new choice in fingerprint-highlighting plastic -- Garnet Red. The shade of maroon we were promised is exclusive to Ma Bell, and you can pre-order it starting July 15th at the usual price point ($199). If you want to get a glimpse of it in person first, you'll have to wait till July 29th when it officially hits shelves.
