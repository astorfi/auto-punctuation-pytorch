LG's tie-up with Google has been limited to Android in the past, but new evidence hints that the pair are teaming up for devices running Chrome OS. TMWatch has spotted that the company has filed trademarks for "ChromeOne," "ChromeDesk," and ChromeStation," which could mean we're going to get three new pieces of hardware running the browser-based platform. It's been coming for a while, considering that the Korean giant signed a patent deal with Microsoft covering future Chrome OS devices last year, and has since seen HP, Samsung, Acer and Lenovo dabble with Google's desktop software. After all, now that LG and Google have buddied up for the Nexus 4 and forthcoming Nexus 5, it looks as if everyone wants a piece of the Chrome OS action.
