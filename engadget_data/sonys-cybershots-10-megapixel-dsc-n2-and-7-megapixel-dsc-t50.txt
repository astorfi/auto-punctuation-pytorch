The CyberShot DSC-N2 is just what we expected following those leaked images and specs: 10.1 megapixels from a tiny 1/1.7-inch CCD, 52MB of on-board memory, a massive 3-inch touch-screen LCD, and an all-too-familiar image-stabilized 3x optical zoom lens in a 6.6-ounce followup to the DSC-N1. The DSC-T30 also got a bump with the announcement of a new top-end T, the 7.2 megapixel DSC-T50 which ditches some of the mechanical buttons 'round back by introducing touch-sensitive control to the existing 3-inch LCD. This 4.6-ounce cam still maintains the same Carl Zeiss Vario Tessar 3x optical lens with image stabilization but drops the built-in flash memory by 2MB to 56MB. Get your Sony Style, pre-oder on starting tomorrow or wait for these to go retail in October at $450 for the champagne gold DSC-N2 and $500 for the DSC-T50 in your choice of silver, red, or black. Peep the DSC-N2 after the break. [Via Digital Camera Review]
