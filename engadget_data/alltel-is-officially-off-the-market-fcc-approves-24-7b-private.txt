The two firms will pony up $24.7 billion (about $2050 per customers) to take Alltel, flush with cash and new customers, off the public market, with the expectation of closing the deal by November 22nd and paying some $71.50 cash per share to current shareholders. Two words: cha-ching.[Via MoCoNews]
