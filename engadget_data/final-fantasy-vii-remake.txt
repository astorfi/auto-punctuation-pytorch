Final Fantasy VII is being remade. It's coming to PS4 (at least first) and it's all beautiful and goosebumpy. That all-too PC version? Well, that's probably coming too. But this is what I, er, you wanted. The trailer is suitably obtuse, but there are glimpses of a guy with a gun for an arm and some blonde guy toting an oversized "buster" sword. Whoever that is. Get ready to squeal -- well, a little -- after the break.
