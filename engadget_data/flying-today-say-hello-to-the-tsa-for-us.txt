Like many TSA policies, they can take a few days to trickle down to the rank and file, plus your line compatriots could muck everything up by misunderstanding the fairly strict new guidelines for scanner-compatible bags, but hopefully somebody, somewhere is having a better flying experience this weekend.Update: TSA's official guidelines are here, the cheat sheet is above.
