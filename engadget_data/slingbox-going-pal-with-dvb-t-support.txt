Yeah, looks like that corresponds to the new UK PAL SlingBox we were expecting at some point, which according to SlingBox manual version 1.1.0.153 (PDF) will include broadcast DVB-T support, and is apparently due any time now. We'd like to take this opportunity to complain about not having integrated ATSC in our SlingBoxes, but we know it won't do us a ton of good until we get some more channels digitally broadcast anyway -- so to Europe we tip our hats, and say congratulations on your new gadget.[Thanks, Dave]
