NEW YORK - Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) posted the highest year-over-year quarterly revenue growth in the company's 11-year history in fourth-quarter 2011, fueled by continued strong demand for Verizon Wireless services and handsets, FiOS fiber-optic services, and strategic business products and services.  'Great Momentum for 2012'  "Verizon finished 2011 very strong, both in terms of revenue growth and by delivering an 18.2 percent total return to our shareholders for the full year, and the company has great momentum for 2012," said Lowell McAdam, Verizon chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Verizon Wireless produced particularly strong growth in the fourth quarter. While that diluted wireless margins in the short term, it is good news for revenue and margin growth over the long term, particularly given our leadership in the rapidly developing 4G LTE ecosystem."  McAdam added: "Wireline margins recovered from third-quarter pressures, and we expect wireline margin expansion in 2012. With recent strategic moves and our investments in FiOS, LTE, and global IP and cloud-based strategic services, Verizon has set the stage for accelerated growth across our business units, and we look to continue to build significant value for shareholders in 2012."  Verizon's total shareholder return is a combination of stock-price appreciation and dividend payments. Regarding recent strategic moves, Verizon last month strengthened its ability to provide fully integrated solutions by creating Verizon Enterprise Solutions, a sales and marketing organization, to harness all of Verizon's solutions for business and government customers globally. In addition, Verizon Wireless announced agreements to purchase AWS (Advanced Wireless Spectrum) licenses, an important step toward meeting customers' needs for wireless data and broadband services.  4Q and Full-Year Earnings Results  Due primarily to the impact of previously announced non-cash pension items, Verizon reported a loss of 71 cents in EPS in fourth-quarter 2011, compared with earnings of 93 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2010.  Adjusted fourth-quarter 2011 earnings (non-GAAP) of 52 cents per share exclude $1.20 per share, or $3.4 billion after-tax, due to the actuarial valuation of Verizon's benefit plans, and 3 cents per share for the early extinguishment of debt. This annual valuation adjustment, resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions, is in accordance with a Verizon accounting policy adopted last year. Comparable adjusted fourth-quarter 2010 earnings were 54 cents per share, excluding the impact of non-operational items, the largest of which was a gain from benefit-plan valuation of 44 cents per share.  On an annual basis, Verizon reported 85 cents in 2011 EPS, compared with 90 cents per share in 2010. Adjusted annual EPS (non-GAAP) was $2.15 in 2011, compared with $2.08 on a comparable basis (non-GAAP, excluding results from divested businesses) in 2010.  Consolidated Revenue Growth, Strong Cash Flows  In fourth-quarter 2011, Verizon's total operating revenues were $28.4 billion on a consolidated basis, an increase of 7.7 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2010. For full-year 2011, revenues totaled $110.9 billion, a 4.0 percent increase compared with 2010, when results included revenues from operations that have since been divested. On a comparable basis (non-GAAP), Verizon's 2011 full-year revenues increased 6.2 percent compared with 2010.  Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) totaled $29.4 billion in 2011. On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), EBITDA increased by more than $950 million in 2011 compared with 2010.  Cash flow from operating activities totaled $29.8 billion in 2011, and capital expenditures totaled $16.2 billion. Free cash flow (non-GAAP, cash flow from operations less capex) was more than $13.5 billion in 2011. From this total, Verizon returned $5.6 billion in quarterly dividends to shareholders in 2011, as the company's Board of Directors approved a fifth consecutive year of dividend increases.  Verizon Wireless Delivers Strong Customer and Revenue Growth  In fourth-quarter 2011, Verizon Wireless delivered the highest number of retail net additions in three years and strong growth in revenues, driven by increased smartphone penetration and increased retail postpaid ARPU (average monthly service revenue per user).
