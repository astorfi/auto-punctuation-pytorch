Apart from a new black paint job, the phone's specs remain the same as before, with a 2.0 megapixel camera, QVGA internal display, OLED external display, Bluetooth, and a microSD slot for expansion (a 64MB card is included); it'll also let you take advantage of Sprint TV and other Sprint PCS Power Vision multimedia services. Measurements come in at 3.98 x 2.05 x 0.47-inches with the phone weighing in at a mere 3.28 ounces. Getting it no strings attached will run you $329.99, but if you're willing to go through the usual contract signings and instant rebates, Sprint will let you have one for just $180.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
