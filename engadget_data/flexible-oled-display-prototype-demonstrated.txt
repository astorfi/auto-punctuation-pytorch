 The field of thin, rollable displays just got a little more crowded with thedemonstration of a flexible OLED display by Universal Display Corp. According to the company, its 4-inch prototypedisplay is based on flexible metal foil and is just 0.1mm thick; a comparable glass display would be at least 1 mm. Thedisplay is capable of displaying full motion video at a resolution of 100 dpi. Universal Display's research has beenfunded in part by the US Department of Defense, and prototype displays have been provided to military research labs.[Via the Inquirer]
