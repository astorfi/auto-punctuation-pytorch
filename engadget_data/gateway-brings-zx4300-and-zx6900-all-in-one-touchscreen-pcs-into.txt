The ZX4300 line, which is the lower-end of the two, gets served AMD's Athlon II X2 CPU, Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit), a 20-inch touchpanel (1,600 x 900 resolution), integrated ATI Radeon HD 4270 graphics, 4GB of DDR3 memory a 640GB hard drive, 8x SuperMulti drive, a bundled wireless keyboard and mouse, inbuilt WiFi, gigabit Ethernet, six USB 2.0 sockets and a pair of five-watt speakers. The Gateway One ZX6900 family sports a 23-inch LCD (1,920 x 1,080), and while the vast majority of the specs mimic the others we've mentioned, the Core i3 power plant is a notable reason for paying extra. Speaking of which, the ZX4300-01e is slated to first hit stores next month for $749.99, while the ZX6900-01e lands alongside of it for $1,019.99.

The ZX4300 line sees the addition of AMD Athlon II X2 processors and other powerful desktop components, making it one of the best performing all-in-ones in its price range. The larger and higher-performing ZX6900 Series also gets a boost from Intel's powerful Core i3 and i5 processors and the addition of a Blu-ray drive, making it ideal for home entertainment.The ideal solution for cost-conscious consumers, Gateway's all-in-one PCs easily double as a TV and/or home entertainment center, making them perfect for small rooms, such as a dorm, home office or kitchen. High-definition widescreen LCDs, powerful components and integrated wireless capabilities make it easy to play online content from a Hulu or Netflix account or connect to other online entertainment portals."Because all-in-ones integrate a desktop tower into the back of a flat-panel display, they typically use smaller, less powerful notebook components that don't require a lot of space," said Steve Smith, senior business manager of consumer desktops, Acer America. "However, Gateway was able to leverage the latest desktop components to give consumers the best of both worlds – powerful performance and lower cost, all in a stylish, space-saving design."The stunning Gateway One ZX Series resembles a sleek, glossy flat-panel TV with its ultra modern luxurious industrial design, and enhances the look of any room in the home.
