 In his second public letter in recent times, Steve Jobs has responded to high profile accusations from environmental organizations that Apple is not taking the matter of the environment seriously enough, with a point by point article that highlights Apple's record and puts forward improvements for the future. Going down the list of toxic chemicals usually found in computers, Steve highlights Apple's elimination of lead packed CRTs, compliance with strict European Union regulations regarding cadmium, hexavalent chromium and brominated flame retardants, the expectence that Apple will recycle 30% of the weight of all its products by 2010, and most interestingly, makes the announcement that Apple plans to "introduce our first Macs with LED backlight technology in 2007". There's no question that this little tidbit will be enough to satisfy the average Apple addict -- LED MacBook Pro anyone? -- but will the environmental brief be enough to placate the rather passionate Greenpeace?[Via digg]
