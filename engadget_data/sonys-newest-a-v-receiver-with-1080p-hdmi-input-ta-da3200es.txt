The TA-DA3200ES employs HDMI 1.2 in both inputs to transport the 1080p video along with the linear PCM 7.1 audio of Blu-ray. We got to warn you that this guy has loads of power as it can pump 120W per all seven of its channels at 8Î©. Now if you think you need that much power it is a good thing that Sony has included an auto calibration mic to detect and setup your speakers to work best with your room via test tones for you. The receiver has the standard array of legacy inputs that you would find on most high-end receivers but here's hoping that not many people are using the four S-Video ports.
