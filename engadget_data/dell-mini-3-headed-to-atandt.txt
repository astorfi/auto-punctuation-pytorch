We expect the specs to remain pretty much the same: 3.5-inch 640x360 display, Bluetooth, 3 megapixel auto-focus camera with flash, microSD, and GPS, though we'll have to wait to get that confirmed. And from the looks of that pic of a prototype supplied by Direct2Dell, this Android handset will be custom skinned for AT&T. Look for it to hit sometime in the first half of 2010. Bonus pic after the break.
