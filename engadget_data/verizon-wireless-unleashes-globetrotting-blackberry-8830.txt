 It would seem that the info we posted last week (it feels so good to be spot on sometimes) was right and Verizon was indeed set to release the BlackBerry 8830 today. While the hardware has been covered ad nauseam, the $199 price point -- if you sign a new 2 year agreement of course -- is a definitive plus for those of you just now taking the plunge to enjoy some of this brand spankin' new, worldwide Berryin' from Verizon. Also packed in your kit is the "Global Support Pack" which includes your SIM card and user reference guide to accessing the global 24 hour free tech support and a free calling card to do it with, no matter where you might be. Stay tuned for our hands-on.[Via PR Newswire.com]
