       Fujitsu has put a number on its recent recall of Sony-manufactured notebook batteries, with 287,000 Fujitsu notebook owners being affected. This latest figure brings the total number of Sony battery recalls in recent months to more than 7.5 million, of which the vast majority (5.9 million) are from Dell and Apple. Although this appears to be a pre-emptive recall -- as far as the company can tell, no Fujitsu laptops have actually exploded -- the company is still recommending that its users give them a call if their machine is one of the 20+ models listed.
