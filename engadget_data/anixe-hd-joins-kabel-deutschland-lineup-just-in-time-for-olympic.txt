 We already knew that Anixe HD would be covering select parts of the 2008 Olympic Games this month, but until recently, Kabel Deutschland customers have been left in the dark. Now, Germany's largest cable operator will be adding the aforementioned channel to its lineup just before the festivities begin, enabling subscribers to catch the action in athletics, triathlon, equestrian, cycling and sailing events. When the digital free-to-air station goes live this Friday, it will be the third HD channel offered by KDG next to Premiere HD and Discovery HD, both of which are pay-TV stations.
