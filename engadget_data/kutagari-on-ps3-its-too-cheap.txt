 Lest you thought Sony had managed to put the issue of Playstation 3 pricing behind them with defenses earlier this week by Kaz Hirai and Phil Harrison, Sony Computer Entertainment chief Ken Kutaragi has now weighed in with his verdict. Kutaragi has reportedly stated that the pricing of the PS3 is "probably too cheap," and he likens the console to a fine dining experience, saying that it's nonsense "to compare the charge for dinner at the company cafeteria with dinner at a fine restaurant." Based on what he calls the PS3's "amazing experience," he says "we believe price is not a problem." Meanwhile, Microsoft has responded to the PS3's pricing with a suggestion that you can eat at both the cafeteria and the fine restaurant by picking up both an Xbox 360 and a Wii. As Xbox head Peter Moore told Reuters, it makes good economic sense to "buy an Xbox and ... buy a Wii ... for the price of one PS3." Of course, if you're really hardcore and well-heeled, you'll pick up both of those, and grab a PS3 for dessert. Read: KutaragiRead: Moore
