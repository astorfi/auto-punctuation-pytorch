Now the Windows Portable MediaCenter is nearly upon us, getting a full list of specs and a rough ship date -- for the Japanese market, that is. Specslook basically consistent with what we saw at CES: both the 30GB S30 and 60GB S60 will include a 2.4-inch QVGA display,an FM tuner, and full compatibility with Windows DRM for both audio and video. They're expected to ship in Japan, inwhite, black and red versions, by the end of this month at prices of around $299 for the S30 and $399 for the S60. Andwe're going to have to decide whether to bite the bullet and pay the markup to pick one up through a gray marketshipper, or continue waiting for the eventual US release.
