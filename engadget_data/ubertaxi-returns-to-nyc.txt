Just a few days after receiving the nod from New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), UberTAXI has officially returned to the Big Apple -- with some limitations. For starters, automatic fare billing is not yet available, so passengers will have to pay drivers directly via cash or credit card. Uber warns that ride availability will be limited as the company is working on adding more cabbies to its system. Also, while New Yorkers can use a mobile app to call for a ride, drivers cannot be requested by SMS. Finally, the TLC's e-hail pilot program prohibits UberTAXIs from making trips to both JFK and LaGuardia airports along with accepting fares going outside of New York's five boroughs. Restrictive? Yes, but at least it's a start.
