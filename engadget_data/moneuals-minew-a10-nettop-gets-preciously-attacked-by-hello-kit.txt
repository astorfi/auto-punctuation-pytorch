That's the Hello Kitty-embellished MiNEW A10, or in other words, the most outrageous nettop to ever see the light of day. The wildest part is that existing A10 owners can even make their relatively sane looking machine morph into cuteness overload for the tidy sum of ₩150,000 ($123). Or you can just get a whole new rig that no one else has to know about for ₩540,000 ($443) -- totally your call there. One more frightening look is after the break.[Via Akihabara News]
