Now, granted, we had a pretty good idea that the sexy new ultrabook is headed our way soon, but hey, here it is, in the flesh, spotted by a blurrycammed tipster roaming around the Intel booth on the CES showroom floor. It's nice to know that the thing will be there waiting for us when those doors officially open on Tuesday.
