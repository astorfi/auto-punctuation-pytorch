Honda's new version of their ASIMO
humanoid robot is selling out and going to work for the man. After pulling
crossing guard duty and being a general bohemian, ASIMO
has been upgraded to handle office work with his new "total control system" that allows him to pull receptionist duty,
act as an information guide, or do delivery service. They've also improved his walking abilities, allowing him to walk
in sync with someone hand in hand, run in a circle, and reach the crazy speed of 3.7MPH. But if things don't work out
for him with these new levels of responsibility, ASIMO can always go back to being a bum, and is now even capable of
pushing a cart full of his belongings, allowing him to really embrace the lifestyle we know he was made for.
