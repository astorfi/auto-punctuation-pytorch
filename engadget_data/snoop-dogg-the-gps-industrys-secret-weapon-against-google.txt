Voice Skins, the same company that brought Homer Simpson to the world of turn-by-turn, paid tha cost to hire da boss himself, which is now available for $12.95 and compatible with all TomTom devices. The Doggfather telling us how to get to Taco Bell? Let's face it, sharp lefts really are so fly. Crank up the bass, videos are after the break.  [Thanks, Brandon]
