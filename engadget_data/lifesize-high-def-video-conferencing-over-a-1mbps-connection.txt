Our pal Om Malik has a little something today on LifeSize, a new company which has created a line of video
conferencing gear that combines some special software they've written with off-the-shelf components to deliver
high-definition video conferencing over a 1Mbps connection. Apparently there will be some excellent non-porn uses for
their high-def video conferencing system, and LifeSize are going after corporate customers looking for an alternative
to Polycom.
