 Just in case you've been longing to take a peek at the Garmin nuvi 880, you're in luck. This high-end navigator was sitting pretty for Mahalo Daily's Veronica Belmont here at CES, and as you've probably surmised by now, she was able to pick it up and snag some video. Yup, it's right beyond the break.
