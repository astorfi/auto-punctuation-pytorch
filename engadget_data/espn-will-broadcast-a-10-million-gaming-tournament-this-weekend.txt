If someone gaining an athletic visa to play StarCraft 2 or the staggering amount of hours spent watching pro gamers duke it out virtually wasn't enough to prove that competitive gaming is a real thing, maybe some mainstream support is. This weekend's massive $10 million-plus Dota 2 tournament, The International, will air live on ESPN 3. What's more, prior to ESPN 2's broadcast of the final match late Sunday evening, the network will host a preview show with expert analysis and even an interview with Dota 2-developer Valve's Gabe Newell. That the Worldwide Leader in Sports is giving the same kind of love to eSports that it does, say, basketball or even skateboarding is surely a sign of big things to come. The fans have been into it for awhile -- tickets for the event, held at Seattle's 17,000-seat Key Arena, sold out in an hour.
