We call it theater only because it's largely for show -- in order to take effect, the budget amendment would have to pass the Democratically-controlled Senate and be signed by the President, and neither of those things is likely to happen. What's more, the actual rules passed by the FCC have already been challenged in the courtroom by Verizon and MetroPCS, so it's not like the industry needs any additional help at the moment. Still, there's a part of us that's happy this issue is even being talked about at the highest levels, rather than being left to languish in administrative rulemaking hell like so many other FCC initiatives -- and we have a feeling we'll be talking about this for a long time to come.
