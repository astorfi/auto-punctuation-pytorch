The revamped Wi-Fire, which is more formally known as the HFWFG200, is said to be some 40 percent smaller and 30 percent lighter than the previous incarnation, yet it promises to maintain a solid WiFi signal while up to 1,000 feet away from the source. In one of those classic "two steps forward, three leaps back" moments, the company has added in support for Linux and OS X-based systems, though the device only works with 802.11b/g devices. In other words, you won't see 802.11n speeds out of this thing, and you'll still get looked at funny with it affixed atop your laptop's display. If you're willing to swap dignity for connectivity, you can get one headed your way today for $59.[Via HotHardware]
