PC Online managed to cuddle up with a black Dell Streak / Mini 5 prototype, which has "Model M01M" marked under the battery cover -- something not seen in the earlier teardown, and is probably the most official name to date. Spec-wise the M01M sums up what's been speculated all along -- 5-inch 800x480 touchscreen, Android 1.6, 1GHz CPU (presumably Snapdragon, as revealed by the teardown), WiFi, Bluetooth, 3G of some sort, 5 megapixel camera with dual-LED flash, front-facing camera, and the same 1530mAh battery as the one in the teardown. The price? Â¥7,500, which converts to a whopping $1,098 in US cash, but bear in mind that this doesn't reflect the M01M's actual retail price for whenever it might launch.
