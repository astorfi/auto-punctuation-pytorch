HBO has licensed Dolby Digital Plus for HBO Go which will enable HDTVs, Blu-ray players and game consoles like the Xbox 360 and PS3 to enjoy 5.1 (or more) channel discrete surround sound. A quick reminder, Dolby Digital Plus is the newer version of Dolby Digital -- that we've loved since 1997 -- and is capable of 5.1 or more channels and at a lower bitrate than its older brother.
