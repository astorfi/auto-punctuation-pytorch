 Get ready for the non-revolution: Intel has pushed forward the launch of its Bearlake chipset from May 27th to May 9th, which means everyone is prepping motherboards and DDR3 memory to join in the fun next week. Unfortunately, while there will no doubt be performance increases seen, DDR2's evolution in the high-performance area means DDR3 doesn't pack too much of a relative punch, and won't really pull away from current DDR2 speeds until it starts to hit 1.33GHz and 1.6GHz. Intel has publications under NDA until May 9th, but we're sure to see huge crop of benchmark results of Bearlake once the NDA lifts, and will prep our pocketbooks accordingly.
