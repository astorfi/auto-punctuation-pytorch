We'll start with the most interesting feature, which is a BTO option for up to 8GB of installed RAM available when you include a copy of Vista 64-bit. Beyond that, the M6300 is rumored to feature Intel Core 2 Duos from 1.8GHz up to 2.4GHz, with a 2.6GHz Intel Core Extreme X7800 topping out the line. It'll also come with options for NVIDIA Quadro FX 1600M, 2600M, or FX 3600M graphics cards. There will apparently also be options for 1440x900, 1900x1200, and 1920x1200 glossy and matte displays, and a Blu-ray drive configuration. The word is that this model could ship by August 31st, so at least you haven't got long to wait.
