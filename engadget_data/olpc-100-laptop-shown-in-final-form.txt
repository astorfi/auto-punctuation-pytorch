Well, we still can't know for sure, but accordingto Martin Varsavsky, who has recently met with project head Nicholas Negroponte, the pictures above are of the"winning design." We're not quite sure what he means by that, and we're not even sure which one of these twodesigns is supposedly destined for production, or if both are, but they do match up fairly well to most of the $100laptop specs. We're also unclear on whether the fabled hand crank is present on either design, but we do know that theyhadn't worked out all the technicalities of that part, so maybe it got the kibosh for the "final" version --if that is what we're really looking at.[Via Gizmologia]
