 Ubuntu users who've been thirsty for the first stable release of Valve's Steam Client can officially consider themselves quenched. After months of rigorous beta testing, Newell's platform has finally arrived in the Software Center for download. You'll be even more enthused to know that it's currently packing 100 games, all of which are temporarily discounted 50- to 75-percent (until Feb. 21st, 1PM EST) to get the party started -- Team Fortress players also get a "Tux penguin". And with that, we'll steer you to the source link below to download it for yourself.
