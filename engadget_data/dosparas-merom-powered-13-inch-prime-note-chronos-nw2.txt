In its base configuration, this 4.2-pound notebook sports a 1.66GHz T5500 processor, 1,280 x 800 resolution, 512MB of RAM, an 80GB hard drive, multi-format DVD burner, three-flavor WiFi, and a 4-in-1 card reader. If you're willing to pay more than the Â¥129,950 ($1,086) that this setup will run, another 20,000 yen ($167) will get you a 2.0GHz T7200 chip and a full 1GB of RAM. Both versions of the NW2 should be available immediately, but as usual with these machines, it's unlikely you'll find one at your local big box retailer anytime soon.[Via Akihabara News]
