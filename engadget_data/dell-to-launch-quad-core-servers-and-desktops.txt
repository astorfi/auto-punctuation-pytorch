 While we previously saw the first round of quad-core machines, we've yet to see one from a mainstream big name retailer. Dell's taken the lead on this one and is now offering servers and workstations with quad-core processors under the hood; both are expected to be available in early 2007. Dell claims, according to CIO, that the new chips can deliver 63 percent better computing performance, and 40 percent better performance per watt than previous builds. Of course, given those Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro benchmarks that that only brought a 10 percent increase over the previous Core Duo chips, we're guessing that those new quad-core figures are a bit exaggerated.
