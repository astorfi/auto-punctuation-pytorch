The new king of the phonecamera heap, in appearance at least, has arrived in the shape of LG's L-03C. It comes with a retractable 3x optical zoom lens from Pentax, a 12 megapixel CCD sensor, a Xenon flash, and a 720p movie recording mode. The L-03C is also intentionally styled to remind users of the more timeless compact camera designs of the past (and present) and it's only by entering the NTT DoCoMo OS and hitting up the dialer that you discover that it's also a cellular phone to boot. In spite of its 3-inch display and 800 x 480 resolution, this is still strictly just a featurephone, but it's sure put in a lot of work to make sure one of those features stands out. Look out for it in Japan from this January.
