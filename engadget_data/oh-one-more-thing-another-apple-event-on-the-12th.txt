Not even a month since their last big product launch, and already Apple's rounding up the
usual suspects for yet another event. Will it be to let
loose some new iPodsâ€”perhaps more capacious and featuring Bluetooth/A2DP headphone support? Or will it be for some new
high-end Macs? Or both? Or neither? Your guess is as good as ours, but we'll find out a week from tomorrow, 1:00PM
EST/10:00AM PST. Be there, or, um, find out from us.
