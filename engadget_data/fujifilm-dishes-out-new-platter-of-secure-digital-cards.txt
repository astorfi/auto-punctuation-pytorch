On the vanilla SD front, we're seeing a new 1GB SD and 2GB SD card, while those scouting a microSD card can key in on the new 1GB and 2GB flavors there, too. Stepping it up are the 4/8/16GB SDHC cards and the tinier 4/8GB microSDHC units. There's no mention of dollars and cents, but the whole colorful group should be on store shelves next month.
