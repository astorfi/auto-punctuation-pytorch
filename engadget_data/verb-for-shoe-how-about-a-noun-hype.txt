This holiday season you've finally got a gift to give the person who has everything. We mean
everything—because they're probably not stupid enough to drop a thou (US, of course) on the new Verb For Shoe,
the "physics defying" shoe from MIT spinoff company VectraSense. Though they won't explain how it defies
physics (nor do they give actual non-CG product shots) it does supposedly wirelessly communicate to your computer and
to other shoes (for inter-shoe e-business cards exchange), have adjustable air bladders, and a performance/health
monitoring system (not yours, the shoes'! Don't you know your Verb For Shoe's health is more important?) Look, in all
seriousness for a moment—we feel we must say this as sort of a public service announcement—MIT spinoff or not, if you
buy this shoe we're totally disowning you.
