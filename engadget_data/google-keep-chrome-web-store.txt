After laying down its foundation with a mobile app, Google Keep is expanding to your desktop. Now available for Chrome, the note taking service syncs with Google Drive for a seamless transition from phone to computer. The app runs in its own separate window for fast access on the fly. In addition to keeping your grocery list in the cloud, you can add photo attachments to your memos, so there's no excuse for someone bringing home the wrong kind of coffee. Should you find yourself away from an internet connection, the app also works offline which should sooth anxious Chromebook owners. If you'd like to see if there's anything noteworthy about using Keep on your desktop, head on over to the source link below.
