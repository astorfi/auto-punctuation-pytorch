Take one dash HTC Wizard /
Apache, a heaping spoonful of
HTC Universal, a pinch of
Zaurus, mix liberally with Japanese engineering,
bake at 375Â°, and you've got Sharp's new Universal killer, the W-ZERO3 / WS003SH being released on Willcom. Hm,
"Universal killer," didn't think we'd be saying those words so soon, eh? But this sucker runs Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket
PC, and has a 3.7-inch VGA touchscreen, 416MHz Xscale processor, 128MB of flash, 64MB of RAM, a MiniSD slot, mini-USB,
802.11b, W-SIM, and a 1.33 megapixel camera. Ah, this fickle heart, how easily swayed we are. Oh, and if you thought
the Universal was hugemongous, well, the W-ZERO3 is still freaking ginormous at 70 x 130 x 26mm (2.75 x 5.1 x
1.0-inches) and 220g (7.75oz), but that's a bit less than the 127 x 81 x 25mm/285g size n' weight on the HTC, so chew
on that.
