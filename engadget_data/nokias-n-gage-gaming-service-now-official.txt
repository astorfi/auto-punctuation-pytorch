 
Just as we expected, Nokia announced their totally revamped N-Gage gaming platform. An eco-sytstem now, covering software-enabled S60-based handsets, games, and a full-featured community-based service to link it all together. A new mobile gaming platform, if you will, which Nokia plans to extend beyond just Nokia devices. The service will offer tournaments, global rankings, and other events within the gaming community. Cost of games will cost up to â‚¬10, are free to try, and can be rented over varying periods. All available starting November. More as the information becomes available.
