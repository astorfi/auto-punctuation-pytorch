 Well hello there Mr. class-4 8GB SDHC card from Toshiba, it's always nice to meet another "world's first." Oh sure, other 8GB SDHC (SD 2.0) cards have been announced, but Toshiba claims that this is the first class-4 card to get so big. That rating equates to a guaranteed 4MB/s minimum write speed when these go on sale this January in Japan for an unspecified price. Fine Tosh, just give us a ring when you hit class-6, ok -- our FZ50 likes it real fast when shooting in continuous mode.[Via AVING]
