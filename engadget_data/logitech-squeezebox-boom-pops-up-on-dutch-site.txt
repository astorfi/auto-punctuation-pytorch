The Logitech Squeezebox Boom looks to be a nice way to turn your Squeezebox network digital audio into soundwaves with 802.11g, a digital amplifier, SqueezeNetwork online music service access, and a 7-day alarm for those of you with techy bedrooms. As for the speakers, they are 3-inch woofers with 3/4-inch tweeters bi-amplified by the aforementioned digital amp. Other notable features include an IR remote, 6-button presets, high-contrast VFD display, 10/100Base-T ethernet port, and a 1/8-inch stereo input. The Euro price is â‚¬279, which currently nets out to $431.44 US. We'd venture to guess that will net out to a sub-$400 price, but only time -- and economies -- will tell.Update: Hey, would you look at that -- the manual for the Squeezebox Boom is now live on the Slim Devices site. Looks like we'll be seeing this bad boy soon.[Thanks, Peter and LPD]
