Google expanded its chat / video conferencing offerings in a big way with its new Google+ Hangouts platform, and it looks like its intent on making it even more all-purpose in the future. Responding to a question on her Google+ page, the company's community manager for Hangouts and Chat, Dori Storbeck, confirmed that SMS integration is "coming soon," noting that it's been one of the most requested features. Storbeck further added that future versions of Hangouts will also support outgoing calls and other Google Voice features, but specifics remain light beyond that for the time being.
