According to a Computex invitation from ASUS, the outfit is planning to not only showcase the Eee PC 901, but also a brand new variant that will likely go mano a mano with the 10-inch MSI Wind. We quote: "[ASUS] would also like to specially extend an invitation to you to attend the official global launch of the new Eee PC 901 and 1000 series." There's no details beyond that right there, but it's plenty to whet our appetites on the heels of the 10.6-inch Eee PC 1001 evidence we've already collected. Oh Tuesday, you seem so far away.
