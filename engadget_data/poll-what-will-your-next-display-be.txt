For those content with their current RPTV / LCD / plasma, holding off until 2010 - 2012 in order to snag a large-size OLED may be the perfect choice, but we've all ideas there's a few of you out there dying to trade your set in for a projector. So, for those who have their lives all planned out, what's your next display going to be? A 1080p DLP beamer? A 32-inch OLED? Or maybe a 150-inch plasma (if they ever go mass market, that is), right? Let us know what's on your radar!
