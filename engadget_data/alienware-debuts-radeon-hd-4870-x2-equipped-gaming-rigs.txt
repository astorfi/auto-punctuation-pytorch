  Alienware has already stuffed NVIDIA's top-end GTX 280 graphics card into its Area-51 desktop, but if that's not your thing, you can rest assured that company is now offering the high-end comforts of ATI's  Radeon HD 4870 X2 as well. That option, which Alienware helpfully reminds us offers 2.4 teraflops of graphics power, is available in the company's Area-51, Area-51 ALX, and Aurora desktops, each of which also offer the even pricier option of dual HD 4870 X2 cards in a CrossFireX configuration. To go for that latter bit of excess, however, you'll also have to bump the power supply up to a full 1,200 watts, although we're guessing that won't be too much of a concern for anyone considering going this route.
