As with its predecessors, this is one big and burly laptop, with it boasting an 18.4-inch, 1920 x 1080 screen, a 2.8GHz Core i7 processor, NVIDIA GeForce GTS 250MNV graphics, up to 8GB of RAM, dual 500GB hard drives, and not just a Blu-ray drive, but a Blu-ray burner as the standard optical drive. No word on a price just, if you need to ask, but it looks like this one should be available in the UK in late October.[Via SlashGear]
