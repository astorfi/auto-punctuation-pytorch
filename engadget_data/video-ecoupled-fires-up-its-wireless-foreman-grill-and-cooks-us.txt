Well, as it turns out, there was an eCoupled engineer on our flight home from Vegas, and after showing us his wirelessly-charging laptop, he promised us a video of the Foreman in action. And... it's a video of a dude cooking a burger. Sure, the grill is wireless -- but come on, where's the showmanship? Let's at least put a hula hoop around it, people. That said, we can see a lot of potential for the tech if it gets ubiquitous -- let's just hope the sales team has a little more of the ol' vaudeville spirit in 'em, eh? Check the video after the break.
