Casey Hudson, the producer largely responsible for EA and BioWare's Mass Effect trilogy, is now Creative Director at Microsoft Studios, where he's working on HoloLens and Xbox games. Microsoft appears to be all-in on HoloLens development -- Hudson now works alongside former Lionhead Studios boss John Needham and he reports directly to CVP of Next Gen Experiences Kudo Tsunoda, who previously led Microsoft's Kinect Games initiative. Hudson relocated from Edmonton, Canada, to Redmond, Washington, for his new role.




Hudson says he's passionate about augmented reality and its potential to shape the way people interact with computers in their daily lives:

My primary focus will be the creative direction of HoloLens Experiences.... I feel that the work being done at Microsoft on mixed reality and holographic computing will have a tremendous impact on how all of us interact with technology in the coming years.

He'll also have a hand in developing "innovative new Xbox titles," and driving the creative focus of Xbox and Windows gaming. We'll see if Hudson can Shepard in a modern era of fresh, epic, augmented reality games at Microsoft Studios.
