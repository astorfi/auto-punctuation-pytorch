 Finally, we ultra-portable nerds in the US can experience the agony of deciding whether to part with $2,500 for the 32GB flash memory-based Vaio UX Micro. Dubbing it the UX Premium Micro PC, the device is a US-market version of the Japanese 32GB Vaio UX that will also be coming to Europe as the VGN-UX1XN. Like its European cousin, the Premium Micro will run Vista and sport a 1.3GHz Intel Core Solo U1500 processor, a 4.5-inch, 1024 x 600 pixel display, 1GB of RAM, a 32GB solid state disk, a Bluetooth 2.0, 802.11g, USB 2.0, Firewire, and Memory Stick Duo memory card slots, and it's also going to have integrated Wireless WAN with EDGE connectivity. You'll have until February to either save the two and a half grand or cut up your credit cards to prevent financial ruin; click on for another pic.
