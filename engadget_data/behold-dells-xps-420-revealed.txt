Core 2 Duo, Extreme, or Quad (up to 8MB) processor options
Intel X38 Express chipset, DDR2 800 (up to 8GB)
MiniView LCD 3 x 2-inch QVGA display (runs SideShow on the front, picture after the break)
Dell Xcelerator - dedicated media coprocessor for transcoding video streams to MPEG-4 formats. Can cut encode time on a 2 hour HD movie in half and use far fewer CPU cycles.
SATA II (with RAID 0 or 1 support)
PCI Express x16, gigabit Ethernet
(2) front USB, (6) rear, (2) internal; one front and rear 1394; one eSATA, frontal audio ports

Some MiniView display modes Default - shows time, date, month calendar, and system stats (including number of users connected) PC monitoring - Shows detailed system stats like CPU speed / temp, available RAM, fan speeds, and other info like Service Tag (so you don't have to keep that memorized anymore) Audio, video, or picture mode - controls media access and playback (duh)
