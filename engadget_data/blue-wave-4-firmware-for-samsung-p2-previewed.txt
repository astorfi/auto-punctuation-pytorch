Apparently all you P2 owners out there can look forward to customizable (and shareable) UI skins, some new Bluetooth-based games, subway maps, custom EQ settings, password controls, and voice recording sometime in the future, but we have no idea when. Until then, feast your eyes on the whole image after the break.
