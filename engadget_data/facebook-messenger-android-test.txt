Starting today, Facebook is testing a "faster and more reliable" Messenger app for Android users. For starters, the mobile software is getting a new look which boasts easier navigation of the chatting landscape. Tapping across the top of the app's UI and swiping left or right will now reveal recent convos, a list of those folks you speak to on the regular and a settings window. The ability to text folks who aren't your Facebook friends is also baked in -- so long as you know their phone number. Icons will appear in the friends list to let users know who is currently using the app as well. If all of those sound like welcome improvements, you'll have to wait it out as the beta will only include a limited number of Android faithful for now.
