Verizon's director of network technology Praveen Atreya, dropped the rather unsurprising news that the next natural step in the company's data evolution chain will be LTE-Advanced. Don't get your hopes up so fast, though: Atreya says it's still too early in the game to test the new tech or figure out its potential speeds (spoiler: they'll be disgustingly fast), so we're likely not going to see any widescale deployment for at least the next few years. Still, we're always looking forward to the next best thing, so learning that Big Red is following Clearwire's lead in adopting the technology is reassuring, to say the least.
