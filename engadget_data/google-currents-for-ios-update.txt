They may not be anything new to the Android faithful, but Google's today brought a few notable additions to the iOS version of Currents. First, the software now sorts audio playlists for any listening content that you fancy alongside the existing playback features. Version 2.1 of the app also displays articles in a vertical-scrolling format and allows for pinch-to-zoom on pictures should the need arise. If your iPhone or iPad has yet to alert you to the update -- or if you're looking to nab the reader for the first time -- you can snag the latest release via the source link that follows.
