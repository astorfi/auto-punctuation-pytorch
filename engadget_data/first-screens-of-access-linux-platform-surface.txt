The pics seem to show ALP running the Memo app in legacy mode, which meansthe OS -- which is supposedly shipping to manufacturers by the end of this year -- is finally ready for at least somelevel of testing. These screens of course don't give us much to go on as far as the purported GTK-based interfacepresent in the core OS, but the presence of the OS on a Haier phone does match up with what we've been predicting aboutthe Asian focus for ALP.[Via PalmAddicts]
