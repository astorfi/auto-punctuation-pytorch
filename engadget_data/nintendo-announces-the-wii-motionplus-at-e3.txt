The device, which attaches to the rear of the controller, will be used to tighten up and refine motion sensing on the Wii, and its tweaks will be levied in a new game that the accessory comes paired with called Wii Sports Resort. The console-maker says the MotionPlus brings 1:1 sensing to the Wii, which will enable detailed control heretofore unseen on the system. We're getting more info (and hopefully a hands-on with the little guy at some point) so stay tuned.
