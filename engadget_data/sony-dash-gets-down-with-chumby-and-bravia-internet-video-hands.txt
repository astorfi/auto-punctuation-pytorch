We took a brief moment to muss that 7-inch capacitive touchscreen served with 1,000s of Chumby applications and Sony's own integrated Bravia Internet video platform giving you access to YouTube, Pandora radio, and more. The device is powered by a Marvell processor (though Sony won't confirm that on camera) and felt pretty snappy on the prototype we handled. Seems practical as a bedroom internet appliance / alarm clock until you consider the $199 you'll pay when it launches in April. Check it in action after the break.
