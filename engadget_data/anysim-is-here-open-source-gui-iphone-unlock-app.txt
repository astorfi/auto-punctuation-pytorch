Unfortunately, the app's source code won't be released for a couple days yet, so if you want to see how the Dev Team got from iUnlock (and iUnlock Reloaded) to their "final" anySIM solution, you'll have to wait a little while longer. In the mean time, we've mirrored the tool here on our super-fast server farm. Oh, and don't blame us if it doesn't work or bricks your phone -- especially because we've yet to test this thing.
