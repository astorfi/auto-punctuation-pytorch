Seeing a split market that could easily afford one more, Quixun ("Quick Sun?"), a Japanese firm we'd never heard of until today loosed their QHD-M30W on the East, a WQXGA (2560 x 1600) 30-inch LCD the likes of which we've only seen, um, twice: in Apple's 30-inch Cinema Display, and Dell's oft lauded 3007WFP. On the specs end, expect a 300cd/m2 brightness, 400:1 contrast ratio, and 12ms pixel resonse -- yeah, not gamers' specs, but you're not buying this thing for its millions of pixels first, remember? It'll run you Â¥198,000 ($1,765 US) in Japan, a helluva lot less than what you'd pay for even the "budget" $2,200 Dell, but more like Apple, it's only got a single dual-link DVI port, none of them fancy TV inputs.[Via Impress]
