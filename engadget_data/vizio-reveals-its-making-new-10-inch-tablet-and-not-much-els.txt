From the looks of things, Vizio has decided to give its 8-inch tablet a big brother. Dubbed the VTAB 3010 according to the company's website, all we know is that it's sporting a 10-inch screen and that it's "coming soon" -- we've a sneaking suspicion that means by the end of the week.

Update: Well, it looks like Vizio's got even bigger plans for CES than we thought. Further digging on its website shows a new Blu-ray player with Google TV, a universal remote, soundbar and router will be debuting this week as well. Check the second source for more.
