After not surprisingly failing to get enough juice from a single 500mw USB port to fry an egg, Kaizo went all out and dropped six USB expansion cards into his PC, giving him a ridiculous total of 30 USB ports, all of which got re-wired to a modified USB cup warmer. In no time he had a hot, albeit small meal, and as far as well can tell, a still-working computer. Needless to say, this is one project we don't recommend trying at home, unless you've already managed to build a USB-powered fire extinguisher.[Via Dottocomu]
