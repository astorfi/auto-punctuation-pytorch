 Motorola: a name that oozes with apathy amongst gadget aficionados these days. But what if we added the words "Android" and "Social" to the mix, would you once again take notice of the world's most invisible number 1 seller of handsets? According to BusinessWeek, Moto's Google-ified handset will feature an "iphone-like touch-screen, a slide-out QWERTY keyboard, and a host of social-network-friendly features." BusinessWeek's sources say that the device takes its design cues from the Krave ZN4 while resembling a high-end version of the T-Mobile G1 from HTC (while selling for less). Apparently Moto has been shopping the spec-sheet and images around to carriers over the last few months in preparation for a Q2 2009 US launch (Europe in Q3 2009) for the MySpaceBook crowd. Unfortunately for Moto, we expect the market to be flooded with Android handsets by then. [Via TechDigest]
