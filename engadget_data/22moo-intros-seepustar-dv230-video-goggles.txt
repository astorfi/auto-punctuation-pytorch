While 22Moo's holding back on most of the specs for now, they do say that the Seepustars will give you a virtual 35-inch screen and can be used with just about anything with video out -- just don't be too disappointed if your brand new PS3 looks more like a PS1 after you hook it up to a pair of these. At least, we're guessing -- $250 will only buy you so much resolution. Look for these to be available later this month.
