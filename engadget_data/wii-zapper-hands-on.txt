The Wii Zapper is literally just a piece of plastic that you strap your Wiimote and nunchuck into -- it doesn't add any buttons or otherwise change anything about how the controllers are used. In other words, you don't even need this thing to play the games it's intended for -- which is good, because those with larger hands might have a hard time with it as is.
