Like there was ever any doubt, right? Netflix -- which serves up over one billion hours of video streaming to some 30 million members per month -- owes it to itself to keep track of which ISPs are killing it, and which simply need to be killed. Now, the outfit's finally ready to begin publishing its findings, ranking America's major Internet Service Providers based upon "actual performance across all Netflix streams." The shocker to end all shockers? "Google Fiber is now the most consistently fast ISP in America, according to actual user experience on Netflix streams in November."


Of note, however, Verizon's fiber-based FiOS offering came mighty close. Of course, Google's Fiber isn't available outside of the Kansas Cities region, while Verizon has (loosely) confirmed that it has no plans to expand the existing FiOS infrastructure beyond the 13 states that were lucky enough to get it. Broadly, cable shows better than DSL, while AT&T's U-verse -- dubbed a "hybrid fiber-DSL service" -- ranked quite poorly compared to both Google Fiber and FiOS. Head on over to the source for the full rundown, and feel free to begin the relocation process to Kansas. Good internet, good barbecue, Collin Klein -- what's not to love?
