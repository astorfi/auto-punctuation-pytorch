       We used to really like polls around here, and with the success of last week's poll, they might make a comeback starting with this format war poll. We want to know where you stand in this whole format war thing. Based on last week's poll, we predict that the majority of our readers will be dual format, with the minority being those sitting on the sidelines. While we know the opposite is probably true in the world of joe six-packs, it's still interesting to see where the early adopters stand.
