Yes, the FCC has spent a month of quality time with Dell's still unofficial, but very much upcoming, tablet and has given the go-ahead for its integrated 3G (the listed UMTS bands II, IV and V indicate compatibility with both AT&T and T-Mobile), Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR, and 802.11n WiFi radios. Labeling for the attached (and apparently not removable) door on the back of the device indicates an SD card slot, which will sit right alongside a SIM card port. The latter will presumably be used mostly to funnel data into the Dell tablet, but voice calls aren't completely out of the question either -- there's a (inactive) proximity sensor thrown in as well. Either way, Dell's almost sure to launch this device, expected to feature a 7-inch screen and Tegra 2 internals, at CES next week.
