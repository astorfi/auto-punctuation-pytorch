 We thoughtwe'd seen just about every direwarning about the dangers of gaming, but it turns out there's a new one. Sony has had its PSP posters yanked fromManchester train stations amid fears that the ads could encourage passengers to jump onto the tracks and be hit byoncoming trains. The poster in question reads "Take A Running Jump Here," and officials were concerned thatriders would take the advice literally. Somehow, we'd like to think that train passengers are a little smarter thanthat, but you never know. After all, New York subway riders have been known to engage in bizarre antics ranging fromsucking tokens out of turnstiles to daring to confront the big guy sitting with his legs sprawled across two seats(which may actually be more dangerous than following Sony's dubious advice).
