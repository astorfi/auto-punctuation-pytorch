Fans of CBS shows no longer have to use iOS to watch full, HD-quality TV episodes while on the road: the broadcaster has just released Android and Windows 8 versions of its namesake video app. As on Apple's platform, viewers can watch already-aired programming for free. Delays for show access range from 24 hours for off-peak shows to as many as eight days for primetime material. Neither client syncs with the CBS Connect second screen app, although the network promises Android integration in the fall. BlackBerry users also won't be left out -- CBS plans to launch a native BlackBerry 10 client before the end of 2013. If you're ready to watch NCIS on a Nexus 7 or a Surface, you can grab either of the just-released apps at the source links.

Synced Second-Screen Experiences and Connect Live's Weekly Video Chats

With CBS Talent Now Available on iOS and Coming Soon to Android

NEW YORK – Oct. 4, 2013 – CBS Interactive today announced its popular CBS App, offering full-episode streaming of the CBS Television Network's programming, is now available for Android and Windows 8* users and will be coming to BlackBerry 10 before the end of the year.

This fall, the CBS App will offer fans more programming than ever before for catch-up viewing, including every episode of CBS's new and returning primetime entertainment series eight days after broadcast. In addition, the app will offer episodes of many classic CBS shows like MACGYVER, STAR TREK and PERRY MASON.

Originally launched in March, the CBS App for iOS has been downloaded nearly 4 million times. In addition to full-episode streaming, the iOS app recently added the CBS Connect iPad App's synced second-screen experiences and social TV features as well as Connect Live, CBS.com's weekly live video chats with CBS talent. Both CBS Sync and Connect Live will extend to the Android app this fall.

"When we launched on iOS in March, we promised fans we would bring the CBS App to all major platforms by fall premieres. Today we are doing exactly that," said Jim Lanzone, President of CBS Interactive. "In addition, we're launching new social and second-screen features, as well as access to more content than ever before. We've seen a tremendous response to the app to date, and we'll continue to innovate on behalf of CBS fans in the weeks and months ahead."

The iOS app's recent integration of the CBS Connect App's social TV features includes synced second-screen experiences for nine of CBS's leading shows, including fall series CRIMINAL MINDS, CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, HAWAII FIVE-0, NCIS: LOS ANGELES, THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, SURVIVOR and THE MENTALIST, with more to be added.

"Digital has become an authentic part of the HAWAII FIVE-0 storytelling process," said Peter Lenkov, Executive Producer of HAWAII FIVE-0. "Through the CBS Connect App and now the CBS App, #H50 viewers are able to go beyond the regular viewing experience and get a deeper look at the show and our Five-0 team while they watch live or on-demand. The synced experiences offer our fans a great way to dive deeper into the storyline each week and find out some secrets about McGarrett and the rest of the Five-0 ohana!"

The CBS App offers popular shows from CBS's primetime, daytime and late night lineup, including 2 BROKE GIRLS, BIG BANG THEORY, ELEMENTARY, NCIS, PERSON OF INTEREST, THE GOOD WIFE, THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS and THE LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN, among many others. This fall, the app will also include full episodes of all the new fall entertainment series in CBS's primetime lineup in addition to the CBS App's newly introduced CBS Classics content.

Daytime and late night programming is available within 24 hours after initial airing, while most primetime programs will be available on the eighth day after broadcast.
