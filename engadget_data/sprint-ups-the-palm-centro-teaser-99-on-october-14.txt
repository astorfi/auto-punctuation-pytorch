 
Sprint just brought up their Palm Centro site and with it, a few more details to make the dealio all official-io. The "world's smallest Palm device" will cost you $100 beans after $100 mail-in rebate, minimum $25 data plan, and two year commitment to Sprint (and Garnet) when it launches on October 14th. We're also seeing a choice of a candy-red finish for the first time if black is a bit too staid for your tastes. Perhaps we'll hear a little more later today when the DigitalLife show kicks off in New York.[Thanks, Conrad A-B.]
