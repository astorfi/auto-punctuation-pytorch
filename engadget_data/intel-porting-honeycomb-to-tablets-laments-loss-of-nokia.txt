But sometimes, if you listen closely enough, you'll be treated to a nugget of product strategy in between those bursts of mind-numbing financial data. Intel's call was just such an affair, with chief Paul S. Otellini providing a quick update on Intel's tablet and smartphone plans. Regarding the emerging tablet market, Otellini said that Intel will have "quite a bit of tablet demonstrations" at Computex running MeeGo, Windows, and Android operating systems. "We're heads down on a number of designs on tablets on all three of those operating systems," he added. Regarding Android, Intel's fifth CEO said, "We've received Android code – the Honeycomb version of Android source code – from Google, and we're actively doing the port on that, and expect to be able to ramp those machines over the course of this year for a number of customers." Yes, we're looking at you right now Acer -- wink, wink. 

Regarding smarpthones, Otellini told reporters and analysts, "In terms of phones, obviously, we lost Nokia, which took a lot of the wind out of the sails for phones this year. We've redirected those resources onto a number of other major accounts focusing on carriers who want their own devices and also own handset manufacturers. They are all based on Medfield." With regards to timing, Otellini observed, "The limit in terms of them getting to market is going to be the interoperability testing of the networks at this point in time. I would be very disappointed if we didn't see Intel-based phones for sale 12 months from now." Us too Paul, us too... ARM's not exactly standing still.
