 We've been tracking the releases of different variants of the SlingPlayer software for quite a while now, so to see that Sling Media has finally shown off a working version of their SlingPlayer client for Palm OS doesn't quite have the wow factor it might have done a few months back. Still, it's nice to know that Palm users are finally assured the ability to view their media wherever they bring their Palm. According to Zatz, Sling is aiming to launch the final version of the software in Q1 2007, with a public beta coming sometime in the next 30 days -- you better watch out there Sling, we'll hold you to that! Meanwhile, Blackberry owners everywhere continue to collectively tap their fingers on the table.
