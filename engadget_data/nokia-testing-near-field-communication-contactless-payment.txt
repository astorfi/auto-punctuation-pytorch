For whatever reason Nokia decided to make a bunch of big announcements on, you know, Election Day, which is fine
since they're a Finnish company and shouldn't have to work around stuff like the American polticial calendar or
anything (and most of the stuff isn't meant for the US market, anyway). It's just that if they were hoping for maximum
impact they could have done all this last week, or perhaps waited a few more days. Anyway, besides unveiling the 7710,
the 3230, and the 6020 today, they also announced a new pilot program in Hanau, Germany where people can use Nokia's
3220 handset, along with a special Near Field
Communications attachment that'll let people wirelessly pay for rides on the local bus service using their
cellphone.
