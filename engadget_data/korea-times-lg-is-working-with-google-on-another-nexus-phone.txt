According to the Korea Times, LG's now looking to repeat the magic and is already working with Google on a Nexus sequel. Presumably another phone beyond that Optimus G sequel we've been promised, there's no word yet on whether we'll see any new Google-branded hardware at this year's I/O event. We reached out to an LG spokesperson, who told us that it doesn't comment on rumor and speculation, although the meeting wasn't all about the Nexus series. LG is also apparently looking for more cooperation with Google on TVs and other future hardware -- Glass was apparently mentioned in passing.
