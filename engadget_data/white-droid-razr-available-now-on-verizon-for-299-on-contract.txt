Verizon's white-framed, branding mash-up -- the Droid RAZR -- is available today in-stores and online for the same $299 on contract price as its austere sibling. So, you can fork over the cash to flash this awkwardly-angled device or, y'know, just hurry up and place an order for the Galaxy Nexus. Get'em while they're white hot!
