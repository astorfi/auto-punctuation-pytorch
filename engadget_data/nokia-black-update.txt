Nokia likes to bundle Microsoft's Windows Phone updates with a set of its own improvements specific to the Lumia line, and the latest such version -- known as the Black update -- is finally making its way to the Lumia 1020 on AT&T. In addition to the standard firmware enhancements that comes as part of the "GDR3" update to Windows Phone 8 (such as screen rotation lock, custom ringtones for specific types of notifications and the ability to close running apps in the app switcher more easily), you can also enjoy some of the same imaging features that were integrated into the Lumia 1520: the Nokia Camera, which combines the Pro Cam and Smart Cam into one fantastic app, and other unspecified performance enhancements. You'll also get the new and improved Glance Screen also seen on the 1520, Bluetooth 4.0 LE support, better battery monitoring and other miscellaneous stability fixes. The download is hitting our devices right now, but as usual, it may take a while to roll out to everyone.
