The display features one of those 22-inch widescreen panels that are apparently the new hawterness for Vista, and of course that new brushed aluminum design that Dell is slowly rolling out to its new displays. There's a standard 1680 x 1050 resolution and DVI-HDCP plug, but otherwise this one's a bit light on features -- though we're sure that won't matter too terribly much when you're busy yukking it up with Vista Gadgets and other fancy new OS features.
