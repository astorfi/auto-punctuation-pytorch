That looks like it's about to change, however, with one of the first now coming to us from Fujitsu by way of the FCC. Like the company's other T4000 series tablets, this one boasts a 12.1-inch display along with built-in Bluetooth and 802.11a/b/g WiFi, and it gets its processor upgraded to a 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo T7700 (other specs are still a bit light). As with most of these other Santa Rosa leaks, however, there's no official word on pricing or availability, although we don't expect we'll have to wait too long for that.[Via PC Joint]
