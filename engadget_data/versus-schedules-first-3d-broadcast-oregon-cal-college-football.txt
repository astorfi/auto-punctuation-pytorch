The first game, TCU/San Diego State at 4 p.m. will be the first ever to feature iRL3D that lets viewers on PCs view highlights in 3D on Versus.com, while it will launch a full 3D broadcast during the second game , Oregon/Cal at 7:30 p.m. Multichannel News has the details, quoting VP Mark Fein saying the network decided this was the time since the broadcasts feature two teams currently ranked in the top 5. Like ESPN's broadcasts, the 3D version will have its own announcers and Versus says it's already signed up Comcast, Cox, FiOS and Time Warner to broadcast the game and is negotiating with other carriers. No word yet on exactly which channel the broadcasts should appear on, but we'll keep an eye out.
