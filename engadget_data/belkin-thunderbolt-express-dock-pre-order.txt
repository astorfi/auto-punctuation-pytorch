 Unless there's any more last-minute tweaks, those fussy perfectionists at Belkin are ready to lift the cloche on the Thunderbolt Express dock. We'd originally seen the unit at last year's CES, but the company postponed the launch after adding a trio of USB 3.0 ports and eSATA to the hardware. If you didn't give up and shell out for the Matrox DS1 in the meantime, you can pre-order the Thunderbolt Express today for shipping next week.

 Update: eSATA, which was added to the roster last summer, was ultimately dropped from the final production version.
