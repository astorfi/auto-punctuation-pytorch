 
The latest version of BlackBerry App World is now available to all, and it includes a number of welcome additions. First off, RIM has dropped the $2.99 minimum from paid apps, so now BlackBerry developers can release $0.99 and $1.99 apps just like everybody else. It's also easier to buy those apps now, with credit card and carrier billing becoming available, and the new BlackBerry ID function lets you both perform those credit card payments and to easily move all your apps over to a new BlackBerry device when the time comes. RIM has also enacted a few new app discovery mechanisms for hunting down those "Super Apps" (BlackBerry users know what we're talking about), but it's not all gravy: the developer revenue split is down to 70 / 30 from RIM's original exception-to-the-rule 80 / 20. PR is after the break.
