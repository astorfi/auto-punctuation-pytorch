Now several sources have told Droid Life not to expect our first taste of Ice Cream Sandwich until the week of Black Friday at the earliest. In fact, a leaked roadmap photo seems to suggest Big Red customers won't be able to get their hands on one until after the busiest shopping day of the year, when it launches as part of Samsung's "Holiday Portfolio." If our disappointment was a flavor, we'd be Neapolitan -- three shades of sad.
