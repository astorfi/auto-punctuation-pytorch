That'll get you two fans that promise to keep your laptop from melting whatever surface it's on, plus three USB ports and, most interestingly, a slot that'll accomodate any 2.5-inch hard drive you might have laying around. Of course, there's always the slight chance that things could go completely haywire (or simply fall apart) but, if you want to give it a go, you can get your order in at the link below.
