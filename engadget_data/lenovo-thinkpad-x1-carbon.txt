   Yes, that laptop you see up there is called the ThinkPad X1 and yes, it's the successor to the X1 we reviewed around this time last year. But, folks, this isn't your typical refresh. The X1, once a 13-inch system, has grown up into a 14-inch ultraportable, now being marketed as an Ultrabook. Despite gaining an inch in screen real estate, though, it manages to be both thinner and lighter than its predecessor: 3.0 pounds and roughly 18mm (.71 inches) thick, down from 3.7 pounds / .84 inches. (As the name suggests, carbon fiber is the secret ingredient.) Chances are, you won't have the luxury of comparing the two systems side by side, but coming from someone who reviewed the original, we can assure you the difference is noticeable, even going off of sheer muscle memory. That bodes well for people picking up the X1 for the first time.  But those aren't the only changes the X1 has undergone. Lenovo also bumped the resolution from 1366 x 768 to 1600 x 900, and made some subtle tweaks to the backlit, spill-resistant keyboard. 3G connectivity is also a major selling point, though that was an optional feature last time around, too. As you could've guessed, it packs an Ivy Bridge processor, coupled with Intel's vPro management technology and (we assume) integrated graphics. Like the last-gen model, it makes use of Lenovo's RapidCharge tech, which allows the notebook to re-charge up to 80 percent capacity in 30 minutes. Unfortunately, though, the company's staying mum on battery life claims for the time being. Another teensy detail we don't know? Price. So far, we only know it'll go on sale sometime this summer. Until then, though, check out some teaser shots below, along with a short hands-on video after the break.
