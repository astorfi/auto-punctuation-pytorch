This isn't quite as cool as the Neo Geo joystick, but
hey, what is?  Radica Games has just announced Play TV Legends Street Fighter: II
Special Champion Edition, a standalone unit that includes two authentic Sega Genesis controllers that plug
straight into your TV.  The device also comes loaded with the classic Ghouls and Ghosts, and retails for
$34.99.  Yeah, it's a bit pricey considering you can get Street Fighter II compilations for about the
same price, but you gotta love anything that keeps the 2D fighting alive.
