 This most definitely isn't the first 4K camcorder to leak out of JVC's stable, but it sure feels like the company is getting further from fantasy and closer to reality. At CES last week, the outfit's latest prototype was as small as we've ever seen, with that object shown here being capable of logging clips at 3840 x 2160 pixels. It's just barely bigger than the 1080p models already on store shelves, and it's equipped with new internal processors that are over twice as fast as the silicon used in the firm's current lineup. Sadly, we're no closer to learning a release date or price, but the results shown down in the source link have us all kinds of hopeful for something within the next dozen months. Right, JVC?
