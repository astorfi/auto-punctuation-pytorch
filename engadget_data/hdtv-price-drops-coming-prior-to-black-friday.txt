 Earlier this month, we found that North American TV shipments were up a whopping 28% year-over-year, yet some analysts are strongly suggesting that across-the-board price drops are near. Granted, one research institute already predicted that flat-panel prices would decline substantially in 2008, so it's not like this assumption is brand new or anything. Nevertheless, Andrew Abrams, executive director and senior analyst at Avian Securities, is proclaiming that a "substantial" drop could come in October, leaving us to wonder just how cheap sets will be on that fateful day-after-Thanksgiving. Any wild guesses out there?
