 Answering the question of "what can't fit on 75GBs of the Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story Blu-ray release?" Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has revealed its first BD-Live extras. For this flick, High-Def Digest says viewers can download three exclusive mini-featurettes based around the Derek Stone character played by Bill Hader, a "Coxologist". Physically present on the two disc set are a bunch of other extras including commentaries, making-of, deleted scenes and more. No word what's in store for The 6th Day owners, but we imagine it's something similar.
