The $400 USB Follow Focus looks to be a much more simple solution. It's quite simply a knob in an aluminum enclosure that connects over mini-USB. Plug it in and welcome to your next Oscar -- or Emmy, anyway. There are a suite of buttons that can be used to define focal presets and it has compatibility with most Canon HD DSLR shooters. The results? Check the two videos after the break and see for yourself.
