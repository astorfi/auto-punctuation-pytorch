 We kindof thought the first remedial school jobs to be phased out by robots would be ridding those clueless nerds of theirannoying positions of power as hall monitors, but Wakamaru isstepping right up to premises security guard. Deathly threatening as ever, the bright yellow plastic robot will bestanding sentry at a primary school in Tokyo, monitoring students movement and demanding IC-chip based identification.No ID? Watch out, because Wakamaru will take a picture of you and totally tell a teacher (literally, all the Wakamarucan do is ring the administration to come help if it thinks something unsavory's going down).[Via dottocomu]
