 
Just a reminder to everybody, our first seasonal charity auction, Gears of Peace, is over today -- bidding ends at about 10:00AM PST / 1:00PM EST. We know you might feel a little silly about plunking down a few hundies to play some Gears with Engadget and Major Nelson, but if you split it up between a few friends it won't seem as bad. Plus it's 100% deductible and 100% of the proceeds go to Save Darfur, so let the bidding begin!P.S. -To those who bid but don't win -- don't let that stop you from donating to the charity of your choice this holiday season.
