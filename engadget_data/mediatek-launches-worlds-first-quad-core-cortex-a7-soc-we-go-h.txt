 There's a new player in the quad-core SoC game and it's called the MT6589. MediaTek announced today that it's launching the world's first quad-core Cortex-A7 SoC and gave us the opportunity to take it for a spin -- in prototype form, of course. The MT6589, which includes the aforementioned quad-core Cortex A7 1GHz+ CPU, also features a PowerVR Series5XT GPU, high-performance multimedia support (13MP / 3D camera, 1080p video and display, Miracast) and a built-in 42Mbps HSPA+ / TD-SCDMA-capable dual-SIM dual-active radio. By combining competitive performance with high thermal efficiency and low power consumption in an affordable package, MediaTek's new chip is well suited for a wide-range of smartphones and tablets running Jelly Bean and beyond. The MT6589 will be available in devices starting Q1 2013. Check out the gallery below and hit the break for our impressions and benchmarks plus MediaTek's videos and PR.

While our hands-on time was extremely limited we managed to run some benchmarks on Alcatel's prototype -- namely Quadrant, Vellamo 2 and AnTuTu 2 / 3. As you can see in the table above, the scores are generally lower than the competition, but the results are still decent enough. Both handsets felt snappy despite neither using final software or hardware. What's more impressive is how efficient the MT6589 appears to be in MediaTek's videos below, both in terms of heat dissipation and power management. We'll reserve judgement until we're able to test a production device equipped with the company's new quad-core Cortex-A7 SoC, but it sure looks like 2013 is going to be an interesting year in the chip business.

 Update: It turns out Qualcomm beat MediaTek out the gate: this is actually the world's first quad-core Cortex-A7 SoC.

 Update 2: We reached out to MediaTek and it clarified that the MT6589 is the first commercially available quad-core Cortex-A7 SoC, with devices shipping in Q1, ahead of Qualcomm's chip.

   An advanced smart device platform delivering leading power efficiency and multi-media experience without compromising performance

   Drives competitive advantage in the mid-to high end mobile device ecosystem

   TAIWAN, Hsinchu – 12 December, 2012 – MediaTek Inc., a leading fabless semiconductor company for wireless communications and digital multimedia solutions, announced the launch of the MT6589, the world's first commercialized quad-core System on a Chip (SoC), available for mid to high-end Android smartphones and tablets worldwide. The new quad-core SoC integrates MediaTek's advanced multi-mode UMTS Rel. 8/HSPA+/TD-SCDMA modem, a power-efficient quad-core Cortex™-A7 CPU subsystem from ARM, PowerVR™ Series5XT GPU from Imagination Technologies, and is delivered in 28nm process technology. As a leader in Dual-SIM technology, the MT6589 is also the world's first HSPA+ smartphone platform supporting Dual-SIM, Dual-Active functionality to address increasing multi-SIM demand around the world. The integration of these compelling features makes the MT6589 a universal platform that delivers premium multimedia capabilities with extremely low power consumption for an outstanding user experience. It also enables handset makers to reduce time to market, simplify product development and manage product differentiation in a more cost effective way, for any market worldwide.

   "The ARM Cortex™-A7 is the most power-efficient applications processor ever developed by ARM. We are pleased MediaTek is the first company to combine a quad-core Cortex-A7 and leading edge 28nm manufacturing with TrustZone® for system-level security. The MT6589 system-on-chip brings the performance and features associated with high-end mobile devices to mass-market smartphones and tablets," said Laurence Bryant, director of mobile solutions, ARM.

   The MediaTek MT6589 quad-core solution supports 1080p 30fps/30fps low-power video playback and recording, a 13MP Camera with Integrated ISP, up to FHD (1920x1080) LCD displays, and enhanced picture processing for DTV-grade image quality.
