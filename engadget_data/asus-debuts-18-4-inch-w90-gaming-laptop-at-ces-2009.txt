 
Got an itch for a gaming laptop that's big enough to span the laps of both you and your lover? ASUS has you covered. Here in the desert, the outfit has introduced a potent 18.4-inch gaming rig with a 1080p panel, twin ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4870 X2 GPUs, three RAM slots (a world's first, mind you) stuffed with 6GB of DDR2 memory, a Core 2 Duo processor, a half dozen (seriously) Altec Lansing speakers and a Turbo Gear function that will enable users to overclock the system and boost performance by as much as 25%. A few more configurations are available, including one with a 17-inch panel, an NVIDIA graphics option, dual HDDs, an optional Blu-ray drive and enough ports to put your average desktop to shame.
