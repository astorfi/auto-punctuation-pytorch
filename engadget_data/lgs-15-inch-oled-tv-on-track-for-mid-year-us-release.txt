 It's a little sad when the world's largest production OLED television measures just 15-inches diagonally but that's the unfortunate state of the panel business at the moment. Nevertheless, there are still plenty of fans (including us) waiting for LG's EL9500 OLED television to ship outside of South Korea. According to OLED-Display, LG hopes to bring the flat-panel wonder to the US sometime in the middle of 2010. Of course, it'll still cost somewhere around $2,500 by the time it lands but hey, at least you'll have the option for local retail and support.
