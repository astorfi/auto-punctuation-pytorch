According to the company's Dennis Moore, the device we're seeing here "is not a product launch or announcement," but simply a demonstration of just how amazing and utterly life-changing the OQO + Atom combo is. Really guys, if there's so much love in the house, why not get this thing on the production line?[Via jkkmobile]
