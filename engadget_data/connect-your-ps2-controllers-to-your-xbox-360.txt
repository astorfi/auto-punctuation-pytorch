XCM's just released some photos of its latest adapter prototype, the XFPS 360, which include a pair of USB plugs, two PS/2 (the boring kind) jacks, and a place for your beloved PS2 (the fun kind) controller. In some ways, this is just a role reversal for that Xbox controller to PSP hack we spotted last year, don't you think? Anyway, the XFPS 360 hasn't quite yet entered mass production, so we've got no price or availability deets for the time being.[Thanks, Bob E., via MaxConsole]
