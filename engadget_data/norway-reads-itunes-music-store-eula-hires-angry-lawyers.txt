 While the rest of us are blindly clicking away those EULAs to get to the booty behind, some stalwart Norwegians actually took the time to read the terms and conditions over at Apple's iTunes Music Store and got mighty miffed in the process. Calling the agreement "grossly unreasonable" which, among other complaints, requires Norwegian consumers to consent to English law while the music store reserves the ability to change the rights to the downloaded music even while disclaiming all liability for possible damage their software may cause -- er, Sony BMG rootkit debacle anyone? Sure, the Norwegian Consumer Council singled out iTunes to make a high-profile point since Apple's agreement is not all that dissimilar from all the other click-through agreements we ignore. In fact, the council now plans to go after the other downloading services operating in the country. Of interest, however, is that the initial complaint also wanted to force Apple to open their FairPlay DRM like the French (and Danes) before them. However, that complaint was apparently ignored without comment by Norway's Consumer Ombudsman. Apple now has until June 21 to voluntarily change the terms or risk yet another costly lawsuit.[Via MacRumors]
