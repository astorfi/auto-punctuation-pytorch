 If you're eager to load up a Windows Phone or Windows 8 PC with dedicated Gmail or Google Drive apps, it's time you ease up on the anticipation, as Mountain View isn't bent on bringing apps to the platforms thanks to a lack of interest. "We have no plans to build out Windows apps," Google Apps product management director Clay Bavor told V3. "We are very careful about where we invest and will go where the users are but they are not on Windows Phone or Windows 8." That might sound grim, but Bavor added that a change in user base would warrant applications brewed up by Page and Co. As it stands, however, Google's focused on polishing its iOS and Android efforts, so Redmond devotees should get mighty comfortable with the search giant's web-based offerings.
