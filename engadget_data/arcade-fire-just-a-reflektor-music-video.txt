Arcade Fire already knows how to immerse its fans in a web music video. For its new "Just a Reflektor" video, though, it's also bringing smartphones into the action. The band's Chrome-based project links a PC to a mobile device through a webcam, turning the handheld into a visual effects controller -- halos, reflections and wireframes in the video adapt to every movement. As the experiment is open source, viewers can even tinker with the web code (primarily JavaScript and WebGL) to build their own masterworks. Whether or not you're a fan of Arcade Fire's indie rock, you'll likely want to give "Reflektor" a look for curiosity's sake; just don't be surprised when the video looks back.
