   Not long after handing its Android application a video-friendly refresh, SugarSync's back with more updated goodies. Now, the sweet Dropbox adversary is stuffing version 3.5.1 with some productivity and social-driven bits. The rejuvenated app, which won't ask anything of your wallet, is boosting its sharing features by allowing you to handout contacts, files and folders via Zuck's social network and that famed 140-character box. Facebook and Twitter's integration doesn't stop there, SugarSync's letting anyone grab 500MB of extra storage at no cost by referring other humans through the aforementioned sites. Another new feature is the on-the-fly file management, which essentially allows you to copy, move and delete any of your docs while you're on the go. Eager to give it a try? It's up for grabs at the source link below or you can get it directly from your Big G-approved device.

Increasing Productivity, Sharing, and Free Space  SugarSync's Cloud service already enables users of all mobile devices to access, sync and share all of their files and folders – not just one folder – while on the go. And SugarSync's Android app was the first to provide automatic syncing of your photos, folders and videos from your mobile device to your computer via SugarSync's AutoSync technology almost a year ago.  Today, SugarSync is announcing that it has added several new features that enable you to be as productive on your mobile device as you are on your computer, including:  · Enhanced Sharing – SugarSync has always enabled you to share with your contacts, and now you can also share files or entire folders from the app directly with your friends and family on services like Facebook and Twitter. You can now easily share that large folder of videos from your vacation to all your Facebook friends and Twitter followers. Or send those photos to your email contacts. You can even SMS files or entire folders to anyone in your address book. Sharing what you want, how you want, where you want has never been easier.  · Managing Files and Folders on the Go – You're used to being able to organize and manage your files and folders on your computer. Why not on the go? SugarSync for Android now lets you copy, move and even delete files or folders, making the mobile app experience more similar to that of the desktop or Web client experience. It's like having a remote control for your computers via the Cloud.  · Easily Earn More Free Storage – On SugarSync.com, we've always made it easy to get more free storage by referring friends. Today we're making it just as easy to earn free storage from the Android app. Just tap the present button on the top right section of the app's home screen and choose where to share your referral link: Facebook, Twitter, email, SMS, or more. For each friend who joins SugarSync for free, you both get 500MB of additional free storage on top of the 5GB we start you with. And for friends that use your referral link to sign up for a paid account, you both get an additional 10GB free!  "The proliferation of today's powerful smartphones and tablets is drastically increasing the demand for robust Cloud services that can enable you to be more productive while on the go," said Laura Yecies, CEO of SugarSync. "SugarSync continues to lead the way in mobile Cloud innovation, and with these enhancements to our SugarSync for Android app, we are making it easier to accomplish the tasks you frequently do on your computer – like sharing, managing and controlling your files and folders – all from your Android device."  Availability & Pricing  The free SugarSync for Android app is available now and can be downloaded from SugarSync's site or from the Android Market. SugarSync offers a free 5GB version of the full service, with larger plans ranging from 30 GB to 1TB and starting at just $4.99/month. To learn more, please visit our pricing plan page.
