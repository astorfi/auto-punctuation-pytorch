 
Well, isn't this a pleasant surprise! Lenovo's expanding its ThinkPad Edge family once again, and this time it's adding the 11.6-inch Edge 11. Just like the X100e, the "notbook" -- our word for an ultraportable that looks like a netbook but isn't as slow and weak -- is available with AMD's single and dual-core Nile platform, and also Intel Core i3 / i5 processor options. Certainly you're thinking it sounds and looks like a nice laptop, but Lenovo's not planning to release it stateside anytime soon. Apparently, the X100e will continue to be the 11-inch option in the US, while the Edge 11 will be spreading its wings overseas -- the AMD version will start at $450 and the Intel version at around $550. Of course, we could keep telling you about what the machine is available with and without, or we could just point you in the direction of our piping hot review. Although, before you jump over to a new tab you may also want to check out the full press release after the break or peruse some of the glossy press shots below. How's that for options?
