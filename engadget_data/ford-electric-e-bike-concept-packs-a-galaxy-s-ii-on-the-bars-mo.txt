It's a concept bicycle from Ford called -- wait for it -- the E-Bike Concept. It packs an electric motor built into the front wheel that can power it up to a maximum speed of 25 km/h, driven by a 9.2Ah battery. Or you can power it the conventional way by pedalling, torque conveyed to the rear wheel over a carbon belt. (Oily chains are so last century.)

Perhaps even more interesting is what rests up on the handlebars. No, that's no iDevice -- refreshingly it's a Galaxy S II. Through some custom software, riders will be able to change suspension modes and of course monitor battery charge, not to mention get a little assistance from Google Navigation and maybe pump out some Pandora too. The word "Concept" in the title here and the spindly frame design should give you a clue about when this thing will see production -- probably never. But, we'll be back with an update if that ever changes.
