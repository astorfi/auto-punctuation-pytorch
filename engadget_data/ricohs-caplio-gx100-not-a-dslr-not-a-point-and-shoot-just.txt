The new shooter neatly bridges the DSLR and compact shooter set by offering a 10 megapixel, 1/1.75-inch CCD sensor coupled to a 24 to 72-mm wide (3x) zoom lens with optional 19-mm conversion lens to get even wider. The Smooth Imaging Engine II takes care of the image processing while CCD-shift-type vibration correction helps keep the blurring to a minimum. Around back you'll find a 2.5-inch LCD with 170-degree viewing angle. Otherwise, you can opt for a hot-shoe attachable electronic viewfinder which, besides being useful on a sunny day, provides 100% image coverage with synchronized focal length and no parallax error. It even supports those new(ish) SDHC cards and AAA batteries for those times you find the rechargeable flat. All this in a highly compact, 25-mm thin chassis with RAW support. When and for how much are the critical questions we're all asking.
