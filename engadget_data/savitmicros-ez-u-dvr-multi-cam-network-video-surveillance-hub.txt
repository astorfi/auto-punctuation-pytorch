So maybe you're either paranoid or really keen on getting a multi-cam recording of your next soiree. Either way,
this EZ-U DVR device (which is not, contrary to popular belief, a UFO) from SavitMicro sounds like it could handle the
duty with aplomb. It handles inputs up to four RCA video inputs simultaneously (looks like you can get a "double unit"
device that handles eight ins, or perhaps you can chain two together to get whatever "2 unit" means) without tying up
four separate machines. It records in MPEG4 format and is being touted as easy to setup and use â€” so maybe if home
surveillance isn't your bag, it could still make a decent gift for any of the less technically-inclined paranoids in
your life.
