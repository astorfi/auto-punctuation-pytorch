 Just because Nokia hasn't committed to making a direct successor to the original N-Gage doesn't mean there won't be focused devices in the pipeline to support its next-gen gaming platform. Although the N73 and N95 are apparently the only launched models that'll support its game download service when it launches this September, neither device is well-suited to the rigors of a hardcore game, and that's where the new handset comes into play (pun intended). Though details are scant, the Wall Street Journal reports that it'll have dedicated game keys, "among other features," for the expressed purpose of making life a little easier on the on-the-go gamer. As long as we can dispense with the taco talking, we're game (again, pun intended).[Via MocoNews]
