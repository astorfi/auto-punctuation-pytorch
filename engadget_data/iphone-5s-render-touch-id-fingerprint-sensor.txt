We're just a few hours away from Apple's big iPhone press conference, and Nowhereelse.fr has just posted this render (from a "very reliable" source) that claims to show the iPhone 5S. The most notable change shown is of course, the home button, seemingly minus the usual squarish target and called the "Touch ID sensor". That is expected, considering repeated rumors (check out our roundup) including an apparent confirmation tonight from the Wall Street Journal, that Apple's next flagship phone will include a fingerprint sensor. Whatever the truth is, it will be unveiled at 1PM ET, and we'll be there liveblogging every minute.


Update: Yes, that's it! Check out all of the official info on the iPhone 5s and its Touch ID fingerprint authentication system right here.
