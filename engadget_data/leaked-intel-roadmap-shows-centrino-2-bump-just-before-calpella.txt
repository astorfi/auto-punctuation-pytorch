A completely separate, slightly more suspect Digitimes rumor tells of a possible Core 2 Quad Q9600 CPU of unknown speed and power. Regardless, we won't get to bask in their awesomeness for very long, as the switchover to the Calpella platform (and Clarksfield) will follow quickly in the 3rd quarter of 2009. Will the rumor-mill never cease to torture us? [Via Electronista]Read - Intel Clarksfield & Ibex Peak-M Chipsets In Q3 '09Read - Intel planning Montevina Refresh
