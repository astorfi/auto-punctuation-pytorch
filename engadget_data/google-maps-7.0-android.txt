Google showed off its new maps UI for desktop and mobile back in May, and now the update is slowly rolling out for Android 4.0.3+ devices. At its event Google said this new version is bringing a more personalized experience, while the changelog reveals new navigation data with "live traffic updates, incident reports and dynamic rerouting." Ratings, reviews and other info have also been pushed to the front in an effort to help users find out more about local places, and on tablets an "Experience" feature should bring enhanced indoor walkthroughs. Assuming you haven't already booked your own ticket to the desktop beta, check out Google's PC-centric video preview after the break, or our hands-on impressions here. The description is live in the Play Store, but you may need to go another route if you'd like to snag the latest APK before the download rolls out to everyone.
