 
Kids of all ages love tablets, but not every tablet is suitable for fingers covered in peanut butter and jelly. We're thinking the latest from LeapFrog would handle that situation without complaint and, with its chunky construction, should make it home undamaged after show and tell. It's the LeapPad Explorer, shipping this summer, a 5-inch color tablet will let kids draw, play games, and of course learn all about reading, writing, and arithmetic. There's also a built-in camera and, while we're guessing FaceTime support isn't likely to be coming in a future update, there is an animation studio app that will let kids have fun with whatever video they record. It's all enough to make one very jealous of Junior, and an MSRP of $99.99 doesn't even sound that bad.
