It's a great picture, almost ripe for an official press release -- but as far as we can tell, there's nothing official about it. The phone, which is said to be bringing Android to a new, cheaper target demo the same way the Touch Viva did for WinMo, has popped up on a Vietnamese message board -- it's not on, unfortunately, but you can clearly make out the presence of enough Android-required buttons to deduce that there's some Google code under the hood here. We still can't decide how usable that giant nav pad is going to be, but hopefully, we have a chance to find out for ourselves sooner rather than later -- we're obviously not visiting Vietnam enough.[Thanks, vuhai]
