You'll now be able to play GIFs on Pinterest, meaning your cooking, exercise-inspiration and arts-and-crafts boards are about to get a lot more lively. Sure, you've probably seen a GIF or two on the site already, but the new ability to view the graphics in their full, animated glory without clicking through is definitely welcome. And thanks to a play/pause button, you'll be able to start and stop them as you please. According to the Pinterest blog, GIFs will soon be available on the mobile apps -- for now, though, they're limited to the desktop. Now if you'll excuse us, we'll be porting our favorite animated photos from Tumblr (along with an Engadget classic or two) to a brand-new board.
