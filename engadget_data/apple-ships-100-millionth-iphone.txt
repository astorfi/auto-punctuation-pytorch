At it's event today, Steve Jobs revealed that the company recently shipped it's 100 millionth iPhone, and that it sold 15 million iPads in 2010 -- a figure he points out is "more than every tablet PC ever sold," and one that translates to $9.5 billion in revenue and a more than 90 percent market share. Jobs also noted that there's now 65,000 apps specifically for the iPad compared to just 100 for Honeycomb tablets, and he even got in a bit of a dig at Samsung's now infamous (and misquoted) comments about its Galaxy Tab sales for good measure.
