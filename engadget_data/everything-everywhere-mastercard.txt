The pairing will leverage the existing Orange Cash standard to get users onto the service, building out a person-to-person payment system similar to Pingit as they go. It's reportedly angered rival networks Vodafone and O2, still smarting from last week's 4G news, who were co-operating on a unified mobile payments service called "Project Oscar" that would have standardized the system nationwide. Given that Vodafone has partnered with Visa and O2 is trying things out on its own, perhaps the next time you choose a phone, you'll have to side with your card-provider of choice, too.
