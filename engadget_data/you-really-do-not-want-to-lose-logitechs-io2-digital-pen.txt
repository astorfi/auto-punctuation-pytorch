Logitech's first io digital pen hardly revolutionized that whole writing thing the way it was supposed to (might
have had something to do with regular pens and paper working just fine), but they've just unveiled a second version of
their Digital Writing System called the io2. Like the first one, the io2 automatically captures and digitizes whatever
it is you're writing (as long as all that jotting and sketching is done on special paper), where it can imported via a
USB cradle onto your PC. The main improvements of the io2 are better handwriting recognition and a wider selection of
compatible paper. It'll probably be the most expensive pen you ever own (absolutely do not lose this one), but on the
other hand it's still way cheaper than investing in a Tablet PC.
