Merely ten days after the D5000 was formally introduced to the world -- and just hours after Amazon's pre-order page went live -- we're now being told that Nikon's first DSLR with an articulating display will be shipping in three short days. Starting on April 27th, the cam will begin making its way out to those who pulled the trigger early on... at least in kit form. We don't expect the body-only configuration to leave the docks for at least a week or so later, but you can rest assured we'll be giving one a go and letting you know if it's worth the cheddar.[Thanks, Jonathon]
