There are other states that have minimum sentences, and other states that require some sort of tracking of sex
offenders after their release, but Florida's new law makes them the first to require mandatory lifetime tracking via
GPS for those convicted of sex crimes against children 11 and younger. Governor Jeb Bush signed the law, which also
mandates a 25 years to life sentence, in response to the killing of 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford. The Jessica Lunsford
Act was drafted and pushed through quickly after lawmakers discovered that the man who had murdered Jessica was a
registered sex offender. It passed both Senate and House unanimously.
