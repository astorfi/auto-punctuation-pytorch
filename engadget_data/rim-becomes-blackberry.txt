 RIM CEO Thorsten Heins just announced that Research in Motion is no longer known as "RIM," and will be simply known as "BlackBerry" going forward. "We have reinvented the company, and we want to represent this in our brand," Heins said. The company's new tagline, as seen above, is "One brand. One promise." Of course, given that RIM BlackBerry only makes BlackBerry devices, that's the logic there.

 "We have transformed ourselves inside and out, and we have defined a revision, a dedication to the boundless opportunities in mobile computing," Heins added. "Our customers use BlackBerry. Our employees work for BlackBerry, and our shareholders are owners of BlackBerry. From today on, we are BlackBerry everywhere in the world," he said. The company's stock ticker is also reflecting the new name (it's now "BBRY"), so the change is being reflected literally everywhere.
