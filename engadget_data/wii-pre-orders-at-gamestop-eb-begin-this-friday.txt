 We're not really expecting PlayStation 3 or even Xbox 360-level scarcity for Nintendo's Wii come this holiday season, but just in case you want to be certain-sure of a Wii on launch day, and won't be around NYC to grab the console from the very hands of Reggie Fils-Aime at the Nintendo World store, GameStop and EB Games look like they'll be offering up pre-orders for the system this Friday. Apparently The Wiire just got confirmation on the October 13 date straight from GameStop, but our pals over at Joystiq haven't quite had that luck, only confirming that pre-orders will begin sometime this week. It'll cost you somewhere between $25 and $50 to get your name on the list, quite a bit less than the $100 you'll have to fork over for a PS3 -- which is to be expected.[Via Joystiq]
