So far as we can tell, this is T-Mobile USA's 2H 2010 handset roadmap, and as you'd expect, it's chock full of Android. Aside from news of impending Dell netbooks and 16 total phones, we're paying particular attention to the upcoming Samsung Vibrant (locked for July 21st), the HTC Vanguard (set for September 9th) and an HTC Schubert (pegged for November 17th). We're guessing that the latter is that 1.5GHz 'Scorpion' that we heard about back in June, and we'll obviously dispose of quite a few tears should that not be the case. In related news, it looks as if the myTouch 3G, Cliq and Cliq XT could be seeing their long-awaited updates to Android 2.1 this August, so there's that.
