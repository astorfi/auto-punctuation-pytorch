 Bad news if you're an AT&T customer in Missouri or Kansas: the company just confirmed there's a widespread outage affecting inbound and outbound calls, text messages and mobile data. It's unclear if every market in Missouri and Kansas is off the grid right now, but users on Facebook and Twitter are reporting problems in major cities like Springfield, Kansas City, Wichita and Topeka. AT&T hasn't shared any more details about the issue or when it expects to restore full service; just that it's working on it.

 Update: An AT&T rep has confirmed to us that service has been restored.
