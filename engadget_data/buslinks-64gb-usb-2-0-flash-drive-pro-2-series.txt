Apparently they've also got a 32GB (not shown) and 16GB drive for $1,500, butseriously, if this isn't some kind of sick joke catering to our obsession with solid state memory, you know exactlywhich one it is we'll be promptly devouring as soon as we can sell off enough excess gear and internal organs to affordit. You can run an OS off a flash drive, right? Ok, good.[Thanks, Andrew]
