It may still not be enough to satisfy would-be cable-cutters, but the latest version of ESPN's WatchESPN app for Android does bring with it a fair number of new options for those looking to do more viewing away from their TV. That includes on-demand clips of news and highlights that no longer require you to be signed in with a login from your cable provider, which all come wrapped in a revamped interface that's said to be designed from the ground up for Android phones and tablets alike. One big new feature is exclusive to tablet users, though: they'll be able to watch live Monday Night Football games in the app (a feature that does require a cable login).
