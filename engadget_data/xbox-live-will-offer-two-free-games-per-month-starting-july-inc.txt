In the run-up to the Xbox One's launch, you'll be able to pick up two titles each month, gratis -- if you're an Xbox Live Gold member. If it sounds familiar, it's because it sounds a lot like one of the benefits Sony's PS Plus has offered its subscribers. The Live UI on the older Xbox 360 console will also be getting a refresh, catching up with the more modern styling we've seen teased on the Xbox One.
