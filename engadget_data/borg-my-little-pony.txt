I really wish this Borg Pony had reared its vein-spattered synthetic head during the early teen-angst years, maybe I
wouldn't have traded the My Little Pony set to a neighbor for a 3rd-degree copy of Another Bad Creation (Coolin' At the
Playground Ya Know, anybody?). Yeah, I got duped (both literally and figuratively), but if I had had a creative bone in
my body maybe I would have transformed the ponies into edgy/creepy art pieces like this. The artist even sculpted a
tiny working LED headpiece as a Borg laser device, though she really should have networked of slew of Borg ponies (am I
taking this too far?). Well, 10-year-old-me probably wouldn't have had the heart to attach tubes to Petal Blossom's
shank or shave off Apple Jack's tale, I just wish I hadn't given up the stable to the sounds of "Iesha".
