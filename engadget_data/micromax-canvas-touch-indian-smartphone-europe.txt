You'd be forgiven for not knowing Micromax, but it's a name that might get a little more familiar in the future. The Indian smartphone manufacturer has hired Hugh Jackman to be its pitch person, and the first product you'll find him carrying is the surprisingly tasty-looking Canvas Turbo. The Turbo is a 5-inch aluminum-clad smartphone with a 1,920 x 1,080 display that's backed up by a 1.5GHz MediaTek chip and 2GB RAM. On the imaging front, there's a 13-megapixel camera and a 5-megapixel front-facer, while the whole thing is running Android 4.2.1. If there's a downside, it's that there's no microSD card slot to complement the 16GB of on-board storage, but the fact that it's retailing for 19,990 ($325) should soften the blow a little. This handset launches in India tomorrow, but the company will be trialling sales in Russia later in the year -- and if that's successful, you'll begin to see Micromax smartphones entering more markets in Europe throughout next year.
