Still no Clip+Sling sharing, but the new 60-minute buffer, EPG, and on-screen SlingRemote certainly makes this a worthwhile update. We've also got good new for those of you waiting for the SlingBox PRO-HD to ship -- Sling says "any day now" in accordance to their late September pre-order promise. Righteous.[Thanks, Martin]
