 If the DS hasn't managed to catch you in its deathly, irresistible, touch-sensitive grasp by now, Jam Sessions just might be the title that pulls it off. The "game" is basically a guitar simulator, and while you can play along with built-in songs if you so choose, the real power of Jam Sessions is in the improvisational aspects: you can pretty much play thing the like a guitar, and that's where Ubisoft's Performance Bundle comes in. You can pick up one of these First Act amp / Jam Sessions bundles in November (the game itself hits this month) and really crank the tunes -- and finally annoy your neighbors in a way you've never quite managed with Guitar Hero.[Via DS Fanboy]
