We don't know, but BBLeaks claims that they come "highly regarded as real from one of our best connects." But before getting too worked up, it's worth noting the bizarre similarities between these grabs (San Francisco, the weather widget colors, Haiti tweet, and font) and the slide pulled from that "Super Apps" developer webinar back in February -- images that RIM called nothing more than mockups of nothing important at the time. Still with a consumer-focused, BlackBerry slider rumored to be making its first appearance next month at RIM's own WES show, well, who knows. Really, does anybody know? Webinar image after the break for your clinical comparison.
