Intel Core 2 Duo L7500 CPU (1.6GHz, 4MB, 800MHz)
Windows Vista Home Premium
11.1-inch widescreen WXGA (1,366 x 768) LED-backlit panel
Intel's GMA X3100 graphics set
120GB 4,200RPM hard drive
2GB of RAM
dual-layer DVD writer (external)
1.3-megapixel camera
10/100 Ethernet, WiFi and optional Bluetooth
2.4-pounds with 4-cell battery
Dimensions: 10.8- x 7.7- x 0.72- through 0.88-inches

You'll also get a 1-year warranty, a trio of USB 2.0 ports, FireWire / VGA sockets, a 6-in-1 multicard reader, Mini-PCIe / ExpressCard slots, audio in / out and a pair of stereo speakers. It should be noted that the 4-cell battery is only rated for 2-hours of use, while the rig can withstand up to 8-hours if the 7-cell Li-ion expansion pack is utilized, too. You may also notice a slew of retailers carrying a $1,999 model starting in mid-May -- those come stocked with 3GB of RAM versus the standard 2GB on the $1,899 model.
