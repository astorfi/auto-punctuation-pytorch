The supercomputer formerly known as Jaguar recently got an upgrade that was significant enough to earn it a new moniker, and it turns out that was also enough for it to claim the top spot on the latest Top 500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. Now known as Titan, the Cray-developed supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory edged out the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Sequoia supercomputer for the number one position, reaching 17.59 Petaflops per second with the aid of 18,688 NVIDIA K20 GPUs and an equal number of AMD Opteron processors. As EE Times notes, however, the other big story with this list is the strong showing for Intel's new Xeon Phi co-processors, which have just starting shipping to customers and have already found their way into seven of the supercomputers on the list, including one in the top ten (the Stampede at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas).
