Can't tell you how we got our hands on this image, but what you're looking at is a real live shot of the Xbox 360 that someone sneakily snapped with their cameraphone at Microsoft's Xbox360 Revealed launch party in Los Angeles last night. Also note the presence of a hard drive attachment up top, the white controller, the Xbox Live headset, and what looks like that EyeToy-like camera peripheral we've been hearing about.
