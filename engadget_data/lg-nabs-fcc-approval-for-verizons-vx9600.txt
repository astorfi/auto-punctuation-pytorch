Latest in that trend should be the VX9600, having just passed through the FCC's danger-fraught passages on its way to a presumed release on Big Red down the line. It should be a pretty interesting device, too -- as most in the VX9000 series tend to be -- thanks to a 3.0-inch 480 x 240 display, a "game pad" of some sort, and a detachable QWERTY keyboard. Not a lot to go on there, granted, but this is FCC documentation we're talking about here. More on this one as we get it.
