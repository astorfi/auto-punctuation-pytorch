Ruh roh, Raggy, the lawsuits are flyin' again â€” Apple is now after Thought Out, a company with a line of iPod
accessories under the name "iPed." Apple's attack hounds lawyers sent a letter to the company
yesterday, saying that the line of iPed iPod stands (pictured, right) "could confuse consumers." Thought Out says the
name is derived from the word "pedestal," as in, an altar upon which to place your little white god. They're holding a
neutral stance on how to respond to the order. Well, maybe there is a silent minority of folks somewhere rushing out to
pick up these iPeds and being very confused when they realize that iPod stands themselves don't actually make any
sounds. Maybe. But dude, Apple, you gotta know this is such
bad karma.
