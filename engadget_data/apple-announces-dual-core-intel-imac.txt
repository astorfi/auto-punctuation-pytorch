 If you've been waiting on the edge of yourseat to see which Mac model would be the first to include an Intel processor, you can breathe again. The firstIntel-based Mac is going to be the iMac, which will include a Core Duo processor running at 1.83 or 2.0 GHz, along withan w ATI Radeon X1600 graphics processor. Most of the other hardware specs appear unchanged from the current versions ofthe iMac, including 17 and 20-inch displays and built-in iSight cameras. The software bundle will include the newversion of iLife unveiled at Macworld, along with Front Row. Pricing is similar to that for current-until-an-hour-agoiMacs, starting at $1,299 for a 17-inch version with a 1.83 GHz processor, 160GB hard drive and 512MB RAM. A 20-inchversion with 2.0 GHz processor and a 250GB drive is $1,699.
