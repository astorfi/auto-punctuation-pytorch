We still don't have a specific day, but we do at least have a month: March. The phone is said to be coming to the US first, and Verizon will be the exclusive carrier domestically. Things are even more vague about when it'll be coming to VZW, nothing beyond "early spring," but March certainly falls in that window. Lots more details in our Sony Ericsson MWC liveblog.
