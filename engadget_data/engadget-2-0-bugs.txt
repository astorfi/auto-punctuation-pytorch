       Hey man, nobody's perfect. We've put some serious time into our new software, but it's not until you put it in front of an audience of millions that you'll really know whether you got it right. So please, let us know if something isn't working correctly for you -- and if for some reason that problem happens to prevent you from leaving a comment, you can hit up our problems form to tell us what's up. You can also leave us your suggestions on how to improve the new Engadget, but please go easy, we're going to read every one of these and we want to make sure the bugs get worked out before we can start rolling out new stuff. Thanks everybody!P.S. -Before you leave a bug, CLEAR YOUR CACHE -- and then try again. Thanks!
