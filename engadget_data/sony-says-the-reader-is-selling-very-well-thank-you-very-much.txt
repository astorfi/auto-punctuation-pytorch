Fujio Noguchi, Deputy President of Sony's e-book division, indicated that the gadget is its most popular item in the Sony Style store, with the Touch Edition selling the most units. He says that his focus is on "readability" and that the company will continue to use e-paper, good news for those with sensitive eyes, but that Sony has no plans for a color Reader until color e-ink screens are of sufficient quality. So, for now, you'll just have to buy yourself the one on the left above if you're looking to tickle your cones.
