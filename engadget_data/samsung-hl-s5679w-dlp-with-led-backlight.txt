Hey, Samsung, while you're under the hood, why not killthat color wheel too? Oh wait, they did that too with red, green and blue LEDs, which is killer because there's no goldat the end of that rainbow effect. The new tweaks give the HL-S5679W a sweet seven-second startup time and 20,000 hoursof little lamp lives. There's no wobulation in this 1080p set,it's full 1920 x 1080 in a progressive format with dual 1080p inputs. Samsung states these will handle 1080p signals,so if it's the real deal, these should be paired up PlayStation 3's, no? Watch for it in April around $4,200.
