Windows 8.1 preview was the first big announcement to come out of Build 2013, but Ballmer's not done with the software goodies. Turns out, Facebook, Flipboard and NFL Fantasy Football apps are coming to Windows 8. Naturally, we haven't seen what these (presumably) Metro-styled apps will look like, but it's good to know they're coming, right?


Update: The folks at Flipboard have uploaded a (very) brief video of their new Windows 8 app, and we've embedded it after the break for your viewing pleasure.
