  Honestly, it never made much sense to begin with. Between Android, Windows Phone 7 and Bada, what could Samsung possibly want with another mobile OS? Yet, the rumors persisted that Sammy was going to snatch up, or at least license, HP's recently quasi-retired tablet and smartphone platform. Well, the speculation can officially be put to rest -- Samsung CEO Choi Gee Sung told a group of reporters at IFA that the company would "never" pursue a webOS deal, and bemoaned the trend of "acquiring an operating system." Of course, things could change, but we wouldn't count on it -- sounds like the company's developers already have plenty on their plate.
