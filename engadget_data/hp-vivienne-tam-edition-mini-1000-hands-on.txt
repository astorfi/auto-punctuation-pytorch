The 10-incher's got a fiery design plus a 1.6 GHz Intel Atom with 1GB of RAM, and an up to 60GB hard drive. We were particularly enamored with that silver mesh hinge. It's defintely a fashionable item -- and if that's what you're into it's got a starting price of $699. Check a gallery of this gal (and it's matching mouse!) after the break.
