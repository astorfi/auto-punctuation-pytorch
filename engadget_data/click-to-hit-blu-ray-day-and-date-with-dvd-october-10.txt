 Sony Pictures is continuing the day-and-date release trend with the Adam Sandler movie Click, due October 10 on DVD and Blu-ray formats. They'll still be going with MPEG-2 encoding, an uncompressed 5.1 PCM soundtrack and unfortunately the same extras as the standard DVD. Highdefdigest indicates a $38.95 MSRP for the title, just like the recent day-and-date release of RV, currently selling for $27.25 on Amazon. While it's nice ot see Sony getting one of their big summer movies out on the format, it would be more appealing if they had worked in some BD-J interactive features related to the movie plot, centering around a remote control that can control...anything.
