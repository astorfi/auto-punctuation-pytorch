 If it's ICS, you can be sure it ain't fresh. And Alcatel seems to know that, but it's offering a base version of its non-HD One Touch Evo 7 tablet that runs that so very 2011 Android OS anyway. Yes, this is the very same 7-inch "modular" slate we saw at this past CES, except now it's made an appearance at the FCC, indicating market availability on the horizon. Just in case you need a refresher, Alcatel's outfitted the tab with a WSVGA (1,024 x 600) display, single-core 1GHz Rockchip CPU buffered by 1GB RAM and 4GB of internal storage -- nothing to get excited about, really. All the goods are here on display, from test setup shots to its user manual. So, feel free to peruse the source below for a glimpse at the official docs.
