Now, the BlackBerry handset has been pampered by a full hands-on treatment from the Vietnamese folks over at Sohoa. Unlike its other adventures, though, this one presents far less speculation. As we'd previously heard, the device is in fact running BlackBerry OS 7.1, as well as being equipped with that undisclosed single-core CPU, 512MB of RAM, 3.2-megapixel rear shooter and a 1450mAh battery. Per the translation, Sohoa also notes the Curve 9320 offers a "better keyboard" and is thinner than the rest of the Curve lineup. There's an extra photo for your viewing pleasure after the break, but for the entire rundown be sure to check out the source link below.
