That's right folks, Steve Jobs, (recently described by CNBC's Jim Goldman as "simply hating" Eric Schmidt) was having coffee with him, just this afternoon! A Gizmodo tipster sent this photo (and a few others) of the pair having a nice, civilized time at Calafia in Palo Alto earlier today, sort of taking a bit of steam out of the idea that they've ended their "beautiful friendship." Now, call us cynical, but we're willing to bet the two ventured into this very public place together just to disprove the recent rumors of the failed relationship. Hit up the source link for another photo of the two (plus one of a very plate-less Jobscar).
