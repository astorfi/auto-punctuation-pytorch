The Manus VR glove promises to take handheld controllers out of virtual reality, allowing players to use natural hand and finger motions within immersive, digital spaces. It's compatible with the HTC Vive, taking advantage of that system's Lighthouse positional tracking tech, and pre-orders for its first-ever developer kit open in Q2 this year. The kits cost $250 and should ship in Q3.



The Manus VR developer kit includes a USB dongle, a pair of washable gloves and two wrist-mounted holders for the HTC Vive's controllers. The gloves have an eight-hour battery life and a programmable vibration motor for tactile feedback, plus an open-source SDK. 

Manus VR is a Dutch team that started up in 2014 with the goal of creating the world's first consumer VR glove (no, the Power Glove doesn't count). Manus VR will be at the Game Developers Conference next week and so will Engadget, so stay tuned for some hands-on -- or on-hands -- impressions. And keep in mind, the HTC Vive starts shipping on April 5th.
