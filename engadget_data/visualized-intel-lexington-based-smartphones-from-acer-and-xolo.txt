 At Intel's press conference today here in Las Vegas we got a chance to see smartphones from Acer and Xolo based on chipzilla's Lexington platform. This new SoC follows in Medfield's footsteps but is targeted primarily at emerging markets. It scales up to 1.2GHz, supports 1080p video and features HSPA+ with dual SIMs. We were not given any specs and were only allowed to look (in fact we got in trouble for touching) so stay tuned for the details as we find out more. Until then, go ahead and take a look at our gallery below.
