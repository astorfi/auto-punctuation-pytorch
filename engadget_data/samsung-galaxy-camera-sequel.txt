We had a feeling the little Galaxy S4 Zoom wouldn't be the final word in Samsung's Android-powered camera lineup for 2013, and now it seems that a truer successor to the high-spec Galaxy Camera is indeed on its way. As quoted by the Korea Times, JK Shin has confirmed that a "mirrorless camera that runs on Google's Android software" will launch at the company's forthcoming event in London on June 20th, which will likely also show off other Galaxy-branded products. Assuming no mistranslations have gotten in the way, the reference to a "mirrorless" camera implies the existence of an interchangeable lens system, suggesting that the new Galaxy Camera might be more akin to Samsung's NX range of cameras than to its cheaper point-and-shoots. If that's the case, then this could be a significant upgrade in terms of sensor size and image quality, but at this point there's still very little we can say for sure.
