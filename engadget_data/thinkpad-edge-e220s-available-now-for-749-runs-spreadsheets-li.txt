Today it's the ThinkPad Edge E220s getting some "buy now" love. This more budget-friendly, 3.25-pound ultraportable is shipping to consumers starting at $749 with a 250GB hard drive, Intel HD 3000 graphics, a Sandy Bridge-class Core i5, and a paltry 2GB of RAM. You can bump that to 4GB and a Core i7, but any further upgrades will have to be performed after-market. We're sure you didn't expect to do a ton of heavy tasks, like video editing, on a 12.5-inch screen anyway.
