Google's continuing to romance the casual gaming world with the unveiling of Roll It, the company's latest Chrome Experiment. The title emulates that old boardwalk classic skee ball, utilizing your smartphone to aim and pitch the ball and the browser to emulate the familiar ring-sporting game alley. You can also play along with friends by sharing your handset, because there's nothing sadder in this world than solitary skee ball. Google's pitching Roll It, along with the recently announced Racer, as "a hint of what's possible when web experiences are designed for a multi-player (and multi-device) world." In the meantime, you can access the game at the source link below -- or just check out a demo video after the break.
