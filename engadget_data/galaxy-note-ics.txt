When it arrives, it'll add the latest edition of Google's OS and the "Premium Suite" full of stylus S-pen friendly apps like S Note, Shape Match and My Story to your 5.3-inch phablet. The company is yet to confirm the launch, but several European users are already on the ICS bandwagon, with others expected to join soon -- but let's be honest, it's gonna feel like decades until that blessed notification pops up.
