Even more iTunes phone details, if you can believe it: a source involved with making the commercials for the new
handset has confirmed for us that it will only hold 100 songs because Apple is worried about cannibalizing iPod shuffle
sales. Our source also says that these first iTunes phone ads will be "music-based spots with people calmly walking
down the street on the phone with their shadows and reflections dancing wildly beside them."
