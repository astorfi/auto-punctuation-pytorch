 Palm's always been pretty cozy with the homebrew community, and now, with a donation to WebOS Internals, HP's showing that they've got love for hackers, too. Just in time for the lover's holiday, HP announced plans to donate a ProLiant DL385 server to the independent developer's resource -- a gift worth $10,000 and packing 32GB of RAM and 8TB disk space. Considering all the new devices we saw at the webOS event this week, the added capacity comes at just the right time. We always thought diamonds were a nice gesture, but we suppose, in this case anyway, nothing says I love you like an HP ProLiant.
