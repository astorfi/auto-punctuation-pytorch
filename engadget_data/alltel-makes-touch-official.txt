 As we reported last week, Alltel has now become the second major US carrier to offer the CDMA version of HTC's Touch. Not unlike Sprint's version, the diminutive, finger-friendly Windows Mobile 6 Professional device has been customized for Alltel with a fourth panel on the home screen that essentially acts as a portal into the carrier's content deck (whether that's a feature or a blight, we'll leave to the readers to decide). Alltel's site is still taking preorders at the moment, but expect to be able to find them in store and online either today or tomorrow for $199 on contract after rebates.
