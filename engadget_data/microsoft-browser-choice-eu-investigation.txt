European regulators are back on Redmond's back, following suspicions that the megacorp may not be complying with the deal it struck all that time ago. Specifically, the allegations focus on versions of Windows 7 sold since February 2011 that came preloaded with patches, and which may not have displayed the all-important browser selection screen that offered up IE alternatives like Firefox and Chrome.

 The EU's concerns have already been bluntly expressed by Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, who said that Microsoft "should expect sanctions" if the "infringement is confirmed" by the investigation. Almunia added that this is the first time his commission has been faced with a previous offender potentially failing to meet its antitrust commitments.

 Update: Reuters reports that Microsoft has acknowledged a "technical error" that meant it "missed delivering the BCS (browser choice screen) software to PCs that came with the service pack 1 update to Windows 7." The company apologized for the problem and said it has taken "immediate steps" to fix it.
