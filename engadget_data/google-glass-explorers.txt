What would you do if you had Glass? Google asked you to share your plans last month, offering up 8,000 coveted reservations in the search giant's "Explorers" program. Now, the company has finally selected the winners, and plans to send out order invitations "over the next few days." Sadly, invite recipients will still need to hand over $1,500 (plus tax) for their very own set, and the program is currently limited to folks in the US, but this was still the best opportunity to get an early look at Glass, making it a very appealing program, despite the cost. Google received many creative applications, including a proposal from JetBlue, but only individual users will have an opportunity to make a purchase this time around -- the company says that it's "working on connecting with businesses in other ways." Congratulations to the lucky winners -- feel free to send us a tip when word finally hits your Google+ or Twitter inbox.
