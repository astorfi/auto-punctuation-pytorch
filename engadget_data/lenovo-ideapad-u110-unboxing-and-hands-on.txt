Made available for order just this week, Lenovo's latest ultraportable is high on style (and way high on gloss) and possesses the price tag to prove it. Meander on into the gallery below for a veritable plethora of unboxing and hands-on shots -- and rest assured, impressions are on the way.Update: Impressions, notes and video are all live. Check 'em out right here. Oh, and a few more comparison shots with larger machines were added to the gallery.
