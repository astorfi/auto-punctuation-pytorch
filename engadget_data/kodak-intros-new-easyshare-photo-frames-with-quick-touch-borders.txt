That feature lets you scroll though photos simply by sliding your finger along the border, as well as giving you control over all the frame's other functions via the interface pictured above. Apart from that, the frames appear to be pretty standard fare, with the M820 and M1020 models boasting 8 and 10-inch screens, respectively, along with the usual audio and video support, 128MB of built-in memory, and accommodations for all the most used memory card formats. If that's more than you need, you can also opt for the 7-inch P720 model, which hangs on to the Quick Touch border but drops everything but the most basic photo frame features. Look for all three of 'em to start shipping on April 16th, with the P720, M820 and M1020 setting you back $120, $180, and $230, respectively.
