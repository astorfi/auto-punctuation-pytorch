The evidence keeps piling up for a Samsung smartwatch that has yet to materialize. Most recently, Dutch site Galaxy Club uncovered a US trademark filing for "Samsung Galaxy Gear" that was published at the end of July. Though a separate application for "Samsung Gear" was submitted in late June, the latest paperwork manages to be a bit more concise and potentially revealing. The documents submitted to Uncle Sam describe an object using the "Gear" moniker as such:



Wearable digital electronic devices in the form of a wristwatch, wrist band or bangle capable of providing access to the Internet and for sending and receiving phone calls, electronic mails and messages; wearable electronic handheld devices in the form of a wristwatch, wrist band or bangle for the wireless receipt, storage and/or transmission of data and messages and for keeping track of or managing personal information; smart phones; tablet computers; portable computers



Sure, the language focuses largely on a high-tech, wrist-worn device, but hardware bearing the "Gear" name could just as likely be a phone or tablet. Of course, JK Shin and Co. could even be staking claim to the alias without concrete plans for a particular product. Maybe we'll be able to put all this guessing behind us after the South Korean manufacturer's September 4th event -- but we wouldn't bet on it.
