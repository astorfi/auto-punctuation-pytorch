After months of drooling over images of the game's accompanying hardware assortment, the star-studded title has finally landed on store shelves, and according to Electronic Arts, copies haven't been hanging around for long. In a report posted yesterday, EA noted that it moved "hundreds of thousands" of boxes over the Thanksgiving weekend, and judging by most every review we've seen, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. 'Course, with so much critical hardware packed in, it's not terribly surprising to hear that some early adopters found a few flaws, but it seems that EA has fessed up to the issues and is offering VIP treatment (read: immediate replacements) to those with jacked up axes. Now that you've had some time to work out those vocal cords, brush up on your drum rolls and mosh in your own living room, inquiring minds are dying to know how you would have done things differently. We've already given you a shot to vouch for your rhythm game of choice, but haters and posse members alike can feel free to step up to the proverbial microphone and voice your wishes. Would you have thrown in a Telecaster rather than a Strat? How about embedding an accelerometer in the microphone in order to accumulate kudos for mindless twirling? Totally bummed by the omission of a wildly flamboyant mic stand a la Steven Tyler? Whatever your beef, don't hold back on this one -- your All Access pass to remixing Rock Band has (un)officially been granted.
