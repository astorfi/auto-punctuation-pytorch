  If you're anxiously awaiting Motorola's upcoming lineup, get ready for a little more Yahoo than you may have expected. The two have announced a love-fest that will ultimately result in Yahoo's "Go" bundle of garden-variety tools and apps being "prominently featured" on some of Moto's handsets starting in the first half of '07. You might recall Go making a cameo on Cingular's Nokia 6682; from the press release, we've no reason to expect anything wildly different when it shows up on the Capris of the world. As long as we don't find a dedicated "Y!" button etched into the keypad of our RAZR K1, we dig.[Via Phone Scoop]
