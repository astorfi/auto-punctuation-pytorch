When Rakuten launched the beta for its Wuaki.tv any-way-you-want-it video service in the UK, it left out the mobile apps that many crave. The company is rectifying that mistake today by officially bringing its Android and iOS clients to the country. There are few surprises for those who've used the apps in Spain, although the necessary Android update brings an option to rate shows. There's also more platform support on the way -- Wuaki.tv says that Brits will get access through game consoles and smart TVs later in the summer. As long as you're content with watching videos over WiFi, you can grab both apps through the source links.
