Of course, Palm and Sprint have been trying to spin the launch as a bit more low-key than the usual Apple hysteria, and so far it looks like things are pretty quiet -- actually, we haven't heard a peep about lines anywhere so far, which seems a little strange to us. So what's going on out there? Anyone camping out tonight? Setting multiple alarms? Drinking all night and getting to Best Buy with no pants on? Or is everyone waiting for Monday?
