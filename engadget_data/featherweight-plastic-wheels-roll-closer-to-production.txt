The firm's research team has reportedly developed fiber-reinforced plastics that enabled trial wheels to last some 250,000 kilometers without falling apart, and they are hoping that designers will soon have "more latitude in their choice of material." The next challenge, however, is convincing regulators that non-metal rims have what it takes to be a safe addition to your next vehicle, but barring any major catastrophes in future test scenarios, you won't find us complaining about wheels that weigh (and cost) less.[Via Autoblog]
