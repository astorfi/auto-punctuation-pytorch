When it arrives in October, it'll offer navigation, traffic and IQ routes to tempt users away from Google's bundled navigation applications and onto the company's paid service. The terse teaser is bundled after the break, but until the GPS maven opens up about its new platform, we'll just have to be patient.

   ~ New app set for October release ~

  IFA, Berlin, 29 August 2012 â€“ TomTom previews its new navigation application for Android at IFA today. TomTom navigation, map and traffic technologies will be incorporated into the new app.

   TomTom's on-board maps, IQ Routes and HD Traffic will give Android users the freshest map, the fastest routes and the most accurate arrival times. The application is set for release in October 2012.

   "We aim to make TomTom content and services available to as many devices and platforms as we can," says Corinne Vigreux, Managing Director at TomTom. "Bringing TomTom navigation to Android smartphones is, therefore, a significant milestone for us."

   This announcement follows the recent release of the TomTom Hands-free Car Kit for Smartphones. The kit allows users to charge their phone and mount it in clear view. An in-built speaker then delivers the highest quality audio for loud and clear navigation instructions and calls.

   More details, pricing and availability will be announced closer to the launch date.
