Turns out it's not just Macs getting an OS update today. Apple has now also released version 7.0.3 of iOS -- a decidedly less major upgrade, but one that will no doubt be welcome to anyone having technical issues since updating to iOS 7. It's not all bug fixes, though. The update also brings with it support for iCloud Keychain to let you share passwords and credit card info across your various devices, along with a new password generator for Safari that will help you choose more secure passwords. You can find a rundown of all the promised fixes at the link below.
