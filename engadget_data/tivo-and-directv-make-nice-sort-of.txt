 A newagreement between TiVo and DirecTV has the two companies on quasi-friendly terms, with TiVopromising three more years of service to DirecTV TiVos, and both companies promising not to mess each other over withpatent rights. This comes on the tail of TiVo's suit against Echostar forpatent infringement, so we can't help but thinking DirecTV decided to keep their TiVo enabled customers hooked up tomonthly TiVo service, which was setto expire in about a year, in exchange for a bit of patent-related grace when it comes to their own DVRs. Can't youjust feel the love?[Via ZatzNot Funny]
