 While companies like Canon and FujiFilm prefer to fly in the face of PMA and announce their cameras well ahead of the trade show, others, like Leica, have decided to hold their cards 'till the last minute and show off 'em at the show itself. Leica's latest offering, however, shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone familiar with the company, with the camera maker once again sharing the spotlight with Panasonic, unveiling its take on the Lumix DMC-FX30 in the form of the C-LUX 2. Apart from the spiffy new design, however, the two cameras are otherwise identical, with the same wide-angle lens with a 3.6x optical zoom, 7.2 megapixel CCD, 2.5-inch LCD, and 848x480, 30fps movie capturing capabilities. Leica has also seen fit to throw in an oh so generous 64MB SD card, as well as a copy of Adobe Photoshop Elements. You'll also, of course, have to pay quite a premium for those Leica bragging rights, with the C-LUX 2 set to demand $499 when it rolls out in May, available in your choice of black or silver.[Via Crave]
