After much clamoring, Foursquare has found a way to tuck it back in, starting with BlackBerry and iPhone users. A pull or a tap now filters between check-ins worldwide and just those from friends gallivanting around town -- just in case you'd rather not see your international friends enjoying the weekend before you do. Android phone owners will have to take Foursquare's word that their update is "coming soon," but those who can get it today on other platforms will likely appreciate knowing exactly when it's time to join friends at that fourth consecutive bar.
