There are few things worse than doing a full product teardown, only to find that, well, you're not likely to get that thing back in one piece anytime soon. By all accounts, however, it was pretty smooth sailing for the folks at iFixit when they took the new Nexus 5 to the surgical whitebox (one utterance of the word "flustercluck" aside), ultimately awarding the LG-made handset an 8 out of 10 for repairability. That high score comes thanks to a modular design that allows for the relatively easy replacement of things like the headphone jack and speakers. The screws here are standard and the adhesive is "mild." Looks like we've got a night of minor surgery ahead of us.
