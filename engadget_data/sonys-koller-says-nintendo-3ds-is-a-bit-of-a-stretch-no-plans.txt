Speaking with IGN, SCEA Director of Hardware and Marketing John Koller confirmed that Sony's "focus on 3D right now is on the console," and added that "the amount of interest in 3D from the retail side and game publishers is off the charts." No surprise there, but things get a bit more interesting when Koller is asked about the 3DS, with him saying that while he thinks "it's an interesting move", he'd "like to see where they go from a demographic standpoint," adding that "8 and 9 year-olds playing 3D is a little bit of a stretch given where some of our research is right now." Of course, Nintendo usually gives as good as it gets, and it should have plenty to say when the 3DS makes it debut at E3 later this year.
