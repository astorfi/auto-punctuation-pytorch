That's all we know for now, but recall that John Gruber at Daring Fireball hinted that Apple was working on a "multi-touch trackpad gadget for desktop Macs" back in October just before the revised white MacBook was released. Obviously nothing's come of that yet, but it all seems to fit -- either that, or Apple's trademark attorneys are just trying to cover their bases. We'll see what happens.
