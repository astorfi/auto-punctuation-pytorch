Promised since the phone's initial launch, Moto's now saying that the new build is "scheduled for deployment by early September," so barring a miracle, we can probably toss out those dreams of getting it by late August -- and we can certainly forget the rumors that it had already started going out. Clearly we'd like it sooner rather than later, but hey, if they're hard at work squashing bugs as we speak, more power to 'em -- we're all for stable releases.

[Thanks, ARR]
