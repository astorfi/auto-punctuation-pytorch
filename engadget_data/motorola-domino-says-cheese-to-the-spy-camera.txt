If nothing else, the Domino+ (aka XT531) at least earns the extra character in design alone, brandishing a unique-looking candy white shell in its candid photo shoot. Meant to be a budget Android handset, it packs an 800MHz Qualcomm MSM7227, 512MB of RAM, Android 2.3.4, a five megapixel shooter, and a 3.5-inch HVGA display. For a phone that's expected to sell for roughly $340 (off-contract, of course) in China, it has at least a few half-decent specs to carry around. It'll be available in both white and black at a yet-to-be-determined date. At the given price point, it'll be interesting to see if this Domino has an effect on the company's sales in China. Yes, we had to.
