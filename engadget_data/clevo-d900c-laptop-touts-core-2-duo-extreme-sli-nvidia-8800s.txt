The Clevo D900c (which could likely be rebadged as a Sager 9260 and / or Pro-Star 9191D) is a 17-inch monster that packs quite a wallop under the presumably toasty hood, including an option for Intel's Core 2 Duo processors, dual 1GB NVIDIA GeForce Go 8800 graphics cards, up to 4GB of RAM, up to three hard drives in a RAID 0/1/5 array, 7.1-channel audio, built-in stereo speakers, the ability to house dual optical drives, integrated TV tuner, 1.3-megapixel webcam, and a flash card reader to boot. You'll also find a smorgasbord of ports and connectivity options, including WiFi, Bluetooth, FireWire, 56k modem, USB 2.0, and DVI / S-video outputs. Of course, with horsepower like this, we highly doubt the 12-cell Li-ion will last much over an hour (if that) under full strain, but we're fairly certain you won't be using this 11.9-pound beast solely on your lap much at all. We know you're wondering, so if you've been eying a mobile gaming rig and have around $2,700 (or much more for the juiced version) laying around, you can snag one sometime in the April / May timeframe.[Via NotebookReview, thanks Andrew]
