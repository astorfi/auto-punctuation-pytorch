   The last time we saw NeuroSky's MindSet brainwave-controlled gaming headset, the company was partnering with Sega -- now the peripheral-maker has teamed with Square Enix to produce what we hope will be a "mind-blowing" (groan) demo at this year's Tokyo Game Show. If you'll recall, NeuroSky has been pushing its unique brand of mind-controlled gaming since way back in 2005, but it appears the technology has become increasingly attractive to notable game-makers as of late. On Thursday, the two companies plan a demonstration of the in-game powers of relaxation at TGS in what appears to be a perfect example of Neo-like godliness. The whole thing goes down October 9th, so be there or be Square. Enix.
