The US may have beaten the UK to the punch on Chromecast hardware, but us Brits now have access to another thing the Americans don't: live premiership football. Following news that it was expanding its apps to support the Â£30 streaming accessory, BT today switched live the necessary features to allow Sport subscribers to beam content from their iOS or Android device directly to their TV. Of course, you will need a BT Broadband package or be BT Sport subscriber to gain access to the live streams. If you've already met that requirement, then it's a simple case of hitting the "Cast" button in either of BT's official apps to enjoy football, rugby, Moto GP, tennis or UFC coverage on your nice big flatscreen.
