 We're sure this has precisely nothing to do with the Opie and Anthony situation, but we're hearing that XM has temporarily stopped broadcasting -- Orbitcast claims they haven't had a signal since noon EST, with reports to them and us about service outages nationwide. Anyone else having problems with their XM feed? Sound off in comments!Update: Orbitcast got the following statement from XM: "We are experiencing a temporary degraded performance issue, which has affected some of our customers. We expect to return to normal service levels this evening."
