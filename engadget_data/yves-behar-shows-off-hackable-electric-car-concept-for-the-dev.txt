He terms it "hackable" and "modular," with an electric base, interchangeable parts (the symmetrical back and front portions, for instance), and a flexible design for many uses. There are a lot of parallels with the OLPC project, including a direct focus on the needs and constraints of the developing world and a bit of that "XO" logo if you look closely enough. Unfortunately, there aren't many more details at the moment, and nobody's signed on to build it yet, but given Yves's track record it's not inconceivable that someone might bite.
