 Yeah, that Series3 HD recorder is great and all, but it's about time TiVo started talking about an HD DVR with even a semblance of competitive pricing -- $800 + service just isn't cutting it anymore, especially with Windows Vista's CableCARD support looking oh-so-promising. Luckily, TiVo CEO Tom Rogers has some encouraging words for us in his quarter results commentary, stating: "We will be highly focused this year on launching a lower-priced, mass appeal High Definition product." Sure, that doesn't quite explicitly guarantee an cheap HD TiVo this year, but we figure that in nine whole months they can probably (hopefully!) come up with something to relieve this situation.
