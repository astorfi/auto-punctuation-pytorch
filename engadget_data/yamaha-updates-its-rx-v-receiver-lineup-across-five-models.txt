 
It's late February which means it's time for Yamaha to roll out new receiver models across its bread-and-butter RX-V receiver lineup. Right on cue, Yammy has introduced five refreshed models, ranging from the RX-V765 to the RX-V365. The top four models now feature 4 HDMI inputs, and 1080p upscaling of analog inputs has now been sprinkled across the top three models. On the audio side, all models save the RX-V365 now play nice with Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD MA. One thing is for sure -- with prices ranging from $650 to $250, these features combined with Yamaha's typically solid performance will put a lot of pressure on other offerings, both in the Yamaha family and out.
