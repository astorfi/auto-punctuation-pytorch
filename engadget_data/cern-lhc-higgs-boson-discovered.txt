It's not everyday you get to tour CERN, the international particle physics research facility that spans the border of both France and Switzerland. It's even more rare to go down into the sprawling facility's tunnels to see an inactive and under repair Large Hadron Collider -- currently, the world's most powerful particle accelerator. But that's just what we did this past week, as we spent some quality time with CERN's physicists and visited the dormant LHC, as well as two of its detectors: ALICE and CMS (pictured above). There'll be much more to come from our trip to CERN, so stay tuned. But for now feast your eyes on the birthplace of the Higgs Boson discovery.
