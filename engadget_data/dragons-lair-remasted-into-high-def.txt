 Anyone around the early laserdisc scene has to remember Dragon's Lair. The game shipped with the Pioneer LD-V1000 and became an instant classic. The game wasn't as immersive as many people wanted and only offered the player a few options on how to control Dirk the Daring but even still, it was the first game to offer live motion graphics way back in '83. Well, the game is getting remastered to high-def by Digital Leisure and will be re-released on PC DVD complete with 5.1 surround sound. The game should be ready by the holiday season.You might want to check out the trailer too.
