After all, while the $5,000 notebook may have built-in 3G networking,Bluetooth, WiFi, 1GB RAM, a black "piano lacquer" finish, an eight-hour battery and a weight of about 2 1/2pounds,Â  we sort of expect something marketed as a "truly aspirational product" to have at least alittle bling. Where are the diamonds? Where'sthe gold? Where's the leather trim? Never mind. Where can we get one?
