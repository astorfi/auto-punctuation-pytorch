       Altec Lansing just announced the M812, a complete wireless speaker solution for the iPod. The set features a dock and speaker which communicate to one another via 802.11g, as well as an IR remote. Altec Lansing claims that audio can be transmitted as far as 100 feet, but your mileage may vary if you have other devices connected to your network. The speaker itself has two 4-inch woofers and a 1-inch tweeter, with the most notable feature that each speaker can be assigned a left / right channel so you can put a pair of them together for a true stereo experience. Better still, the word from ol' Uncle Alt is that one dock can be linked to a maximum of 9 speakers. The dock also sports an FM tuner and an auxiliary input for connecting other portable media players that aren't the iPod. Should be available this spring.
