 
With NAB kicking off today in Las Vegas, it's no shock to see Panasonic's P2 format gracing the headlines early on. Today, Fujifilm has announced that it will introduce the E-Series P2 memory cards for the Panasonic P2 professional video system, and said lineup will include 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB options. We're told that the trio can hit a maximum transfer rate of 1.2Gbps when used with compatible hardware, and the cards' lifespans are rated for five years of use when recorded once daily at full capacity and up to ten years when used at half capacity. Check 'em later this summer (save for the 64GB model, which ships this autumn) for $440, $640 and $1,000 from least capacious to most. The full release is just past the break.
      

 

FUJIFILM SHOWCASES NEW P2 MEMORY CARDS AT NAB 2009"E-Series" Offers Improved Transfer Rate at Lower CostValhalla, NY, April 20, 2009 â€“ FUJIFILM Recording Media U.S.A., Inc. today announced that it will introduce the Fujifilm E-Series P2 memory cards for the Panasonic P2 professional video system at NAB 2009 in Las Vegas, NV. The E-Series includes 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB P2 memory cards, and offer users a high capacity, lower cost media option for use in compatible P2 system hardware. "The new E-Series extends Fujifilm's P2 offering with an affordable card line that is perfect for a wide range of users," said Tom Volpicella, vice president of business development, Professional Products, FUJIFILM Recording Media U.S.A. "The E-Series cards are ideal for broadcasters, professional and freelance videographers, and also offer distributors and rental facilities an opportunity to extend their product offerings to their clients." Fujifilm's E-Series P2 memory cards offer an impressive maximum transfer rate of 1.2 Gbps when used with compatible hardware, made possible by a newly developed high-speed memory controller.

Offering the high reliability and durability that professionals require, each card is also designed to stand up to challenging conditions in any environment and is shock, vibration and temperature resistant. As a card approaches the end of its life cycle, a notification is automatically displayed in the LCD/viewfinder or the card reader's display. Compliant with the Cardbus Type II specification, Fujifilm's E-Series P2 memory cards are adaptable to laptop and desktop PCs equipped with a PC Card slot. Additionally, the memory cards can store content in a complete range of P2-supported frame rates and formats, from high definition to standard definition and from DVCPRO to AVC-Intra 100. As with all Fujifilm P2 cards, each E-Series P2 memory card comes with an individual serial number and is equipped with a write-protect switch to eliminate the possibility of accidental loss of material.
