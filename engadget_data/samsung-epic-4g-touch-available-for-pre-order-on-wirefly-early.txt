As if there's any concern about pushing inventory of the Samsung Epic 4G Touch -- Sprint's variant of the Galaxy S II -- Wirefly is making the phone even more enticing by slashing $50 off the cost, bringing it down to $150 when signing up for a two-year agreement. Doing the math a different way, lighter on the checkbook plus a Samsung Galaxy S II equals happiness. Head to the source link to check out the deal.
