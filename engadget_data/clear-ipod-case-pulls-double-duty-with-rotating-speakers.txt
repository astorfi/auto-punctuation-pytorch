We're guessing the reason shelves aren't flooded with 'em today has quite a bit to do with the presumably lackluster sound quality / output potential. Nevertheless, those hoping to find just a case for their precious new iPod classic need look no further, as the rotating speakers case for iPod is here to make your dreams come true. Reportedly, the $60.72 enclosure works just fine with 80/160GB iPod classic models as well as 30/60/80GB 5G iPods, but considering that each of the stereo drivers pumps out under 1-watt per, you should probably plan on tossing this bad boy over your right shoulder like we did back in 1985 in order to hear anything.[Via popgadget]
