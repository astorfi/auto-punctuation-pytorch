Pre-orders are now being accepted via the online Sony Style store; each camera comes as a kit with either the 16mm lens, or for an extra $50 the 18-55mm. Thus, we're looking at a minimum of $549.99 for the NEX-3 with 16mm, up to a penny under $700 for the NEX-5 with the more versatile eye. Lenses aren't yet sold separately, so make your choice wisely, and while you can gawk at the accessories -- optical viewfinder, A-mount lens adapter, and stereo mic, among others -- they're not yet taking your credit card details for anything but the kit right now. What's that... you wanted the camcorder? Keep dreaming, for now.

Update: The NEX-5 and NEX-3 are now also available for pre-order in Europe (kitted out with the 16mm glass) at price points of €599 and €499, respectively. [Thanks, Edin]
