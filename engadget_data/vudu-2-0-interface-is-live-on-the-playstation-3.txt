 
Just shy of a month after it launched on the PlayStation 3, VUDU has begun delivering its newly revamped interface on the game console. It should be there once the app is opened, but just in case you're not near a Sixaxis or the (now supported) Move controller check out our gallery for an idea of what the new layout look like. Oh, and if you're getting your 1080p HDX streaming via a different box or smart TV widget then keep an eye out, the company's support page say the PS3 and LG devices will be the only ones sporting the new look through January, with all the rest getting it later on.
