       Sure, here at CES we're scouring the floor of the Las Vegas Convention Center (and hotel suites in a roughly three miles radius) for all the latest tech toys to write about. But that part of our work isn't exactly fun to watch. Fortunately, we have you covered with live news and entertainment from our stage all week long. From daily previews and recaps, video game competitions, interviews with tech's biggest names and even a chance for our dear readers to join in the fun, there's pretty much always going to be something to watch. Best of all, it'll take you no effort at all to keep on top of the myriad goings ons. You'll be able to watch every minute of our stage programing right on the homepage. And it all kicks off here in 24 hours. Check out our entire schedule (in Pacific time) for the week below.
