For those too young to remember console games that debuted in 1984, Excitebike saw players racing from right to left and leaping off dirt ramps while attempting to speed to the finish. Think of it as a proto-Trials without the modern physics technology and you've got the basic idea. The Excitebike Arena track updates the aesthetics of the NES classic for the Wii U, but as you can see in the footage below the break, is otherwise an unmistakable homage to one of Nintendo's lesser hits.

The first Mario Kart 8 DLC pack is slated to launch at some point in November. It will feature an $8 price tag, but fans willing to go as high as $12 can grab both the first DLC pack and a second, Animal Crossing-themed DLC pack to be released in May 2015.
