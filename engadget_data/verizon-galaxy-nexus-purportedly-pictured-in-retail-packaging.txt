  We've already seen one Verizon Galaxy Nexus turn up at the Samsung Experience store in New York, and now some images of another unit have surfaced on the XDA forums showing the smartphone in what's purported to be retail packaging. This could well be another demo unit given the plain white box, but the red interior and other materials inside suggest that this could well be the real deal, and that a launch is presumably imminent. As for an official date? Verizon is still only saying "soon."[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
