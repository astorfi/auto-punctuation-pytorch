Forum posters at Missing Remote noticed a $282 fire sale for the HTPC cable TV adapters going on eBay Friday, before prices dropped precipitously at Buy.com ($264), and an Amazon third party ($265). Lesser known Erwin Computers currently claims the lowest price, while Ceton's official Amazon listing and those of other resellers like Cannon PC and Fluid Digital remain at the $399 MSRP -- for now. The choice is yours -- wait for official word and to see if prices drop any lower or click the buy button now and get some (network sharable) cable TV reception for your computer in time for the second episode of Teen Wolf on MTV.
