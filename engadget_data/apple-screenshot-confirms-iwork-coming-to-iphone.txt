It's since been replaced by a shot that reads "Open in 'iBooks'," but it certainly seems like the iWork suite will eventually make it across the iOS range from the iPad. While we're not going to pretend like that's nearly as big a deal as Microsoft integrating Office into Windows Phone 7, it's still a welcome move, as we know more than a few people who'd like to make some work-type edits on the go. Why we didn't get a peek at this today we don't know, but we've got a feeling we'll hear more about it as June 21 gets nearer.
