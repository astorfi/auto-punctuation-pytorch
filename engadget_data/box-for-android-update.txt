 Cloud storage provider Box seems to be in overdrive lately, with a new Windows 8 app out and having announced improvements to its cloud platform and speedier uploads for businesses. Turning its attention now to Android users, Box has bumped up the app on Google's mobile OS to version 2.0, bringing in features like file previews for 75 different file types, offline folders that indicate when they're out of sync, and a feature-rich transfer manager. In addition, you can jump straight to the app when you tap on Box shared links, instead of having to fiddle around with the sign-in process on your mobile browser. The ability to add descriptions to files and folders should also come in handy for those with a meticulous streak. Convinced? The source link has the goods.
