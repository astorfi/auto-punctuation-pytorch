Sony is starting up the fall refresh cycle with "never-before-seen" Alpha models, which will be shown off at an event on August 24 alongside the NEX-VG10 and some 3D-capable Cyber-shots. We've no way of knowing what's in store, but if you're in a speculative kind of mood, Sony Alpha Rumors suggests the new shooters will include a semi-transparent mirror (most intriguing!) and a pleasingly fast 10fps burst shooting mode. That's enough to whet our appetite, now bring on the full dish of details already.
