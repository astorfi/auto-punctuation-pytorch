 The 56-inch OLED TV Sony trotted out at CES may not be headed to the consumer market, but it is becoming a reality, at least in the professional sector. The company showcased a pair of 4K OLED prototypes at NAB 2013, outing a 4,096 x 2,160 30-inch model as well as a 3,840 x 2160 56-inch display. Both panels boast of wide viewing angles and low color shift, promising accurate signal reproduction for industry pros working with 4K content. No word yet on pricing, but interested parties can look forward to upgrading sometime in next year. Sony also announced a refresh for its existing line of professional OLED displays. The A series will replace seven older SKUs, again promising better viewing angles and color shift than the previous generation. Hit the break for the official press release, item skus, and a quick break down of what products the A series will be replacing.
 Update: The 30-inch 4K OLED prototype is looking at a 2014 release date, while the A series monitors will be available in May.

"At this level of production, color accuracy and reproduction are critical. With these improvements in viewing angles, color shift and additional enhancements, professionals are now even better equipped to critically evaluate any type of signal."
