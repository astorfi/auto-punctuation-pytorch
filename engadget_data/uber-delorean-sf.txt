If you're a Back to the Future fanatic who wasn't able to snag a DeLorean on eBay or hitch a ride in a time-traveling taxi cab, then you might want to head to the City by the Bay this weekend. Uber has partnered with GE as part of the latter's Brilliant Machines campaign to offer rides in, yes, a DeLorean, but only in San Francisco and only for the following three days. They'll be operational some time between 12 to 9pm on Friday and between 12 to 6pm on Saturday and Sunday -- you'll know a DeLorean is available if you see an option pop up on the app (as seen in the screenshot after the break). However, Uber told us there'll only be four of them on the road. Due to the limited availability, you're restricted to just 15 minutes per trip and only one passenger per vehicle. The company's pulled publicity ploys like this before -- remember the ice cream trucks and those $3,000 helicopter rides? -- but we have to admit this one makes our inner Marty McFly smile. So if you're feeling lucky, take a trip to SF and try your hand at hailing one of these 1.21-gigawatt-powered beauties. Be sure to ask the driver if he can reach 88MPH.
