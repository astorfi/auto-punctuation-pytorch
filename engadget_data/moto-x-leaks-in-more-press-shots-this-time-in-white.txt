And the saga continues! Hot on the heels of this morning's leaked renders comes a couple more press shots of the Moto X, courtesy of @evleaks -- this time in glorious unicorn white. There's not much more to mention here other than it's a lot easier to spot the mics front and back and to get a feel for the texture that adorns the rear. It looks very much like the svelte handset Eric Schmidt recently flaunted at the annual Allen and Co media conference. Not a fan of the existing hues? Motorola's been pretty clear the phone will be available in custom colors -- we're longing for a beautiful shade of purple ourselves. With the official Moto X launch slated for Thursday August 1st, we're only days away from getting all the details, so stay tuned for more.
