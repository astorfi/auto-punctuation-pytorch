For veteran gamers who enjoyed Doom and Quake, it's the end of an era -- id Software co-founder John Carmack has left the game studio to concentrate all his efforts on his Chief Technical Officer role at Oculus VR. It was just too "challenging" to divide attention between the two companies, he explains. id's Tim Willits says in a statement that the departure won't affect any existing projects, but it does leave the firm without the insights of one of the game industry's brightest programmers. However, his exit is good news for VR fans; Carmack can now pour all his energy into developing cutting edge wearable displays. Check out our recent video interview with him after the break.
