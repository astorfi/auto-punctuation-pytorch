Bad news: It'll cost Brits Â£3,489 (about $4,944) -- that's more than twice the price of the same set sold in the US. Look, we knew the European price hikes were coming from Sony in 2009, but we weren't expecting this. Then again, if you're the type who thinks dropping a couple of thousand Quid on an 11-inch television makes sense, well, you probably won't even notice.[Via OLED-Display]
