We've received reports from the Dayton / Cincinnati, Ohio and Raleigh / Durham, North Carolina regions that TWC has indeed started to roll out the freshened-up Navigator. Granted, there's still some bugs in there to be worked out, but hopeful souls are looking at the change as one that'll precede a smattering of new high-def material. We can't say for certain that the new EPG signifies that more material is on the way, but do chime in below if your Navigator has suddenly morphed into one eerily similar to that shown above.
