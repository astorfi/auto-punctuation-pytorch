 In addition to their XPS gaming rig, Dell also bumped the specs on their 30-inch widescreen 3007WFP LCD today. The Dell UltraSharp 3007WFP-HC now covers 92% of the NTSC color space for "richer, more dynamic colors" via a Wide Cold-Cathode Fluorescent Lighting (W-CCFL) backlight. It still features that same, sweet 2560x1600 (WQXGA) resolution we can't live without while shaving the response down from 14 to 8-ms. Available sometime later this year for $1,699 -- yeah, that's right around $400 more than the 3007WFP.
