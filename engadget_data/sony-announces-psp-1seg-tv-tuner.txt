That technological distinction of course means that the device won't be making its way to North America (at least in its current form), but PSP users in Japan will soon be able to pick up some digital TV signals for the not unreasonable price of Â¥6,980 (or about $57). There is a catch, however, in that the device is apparently only compatible with the new, slimmer PSP -- hopefully not a sign of further things to come from Sony. If that's not a deal-breaker for ya, you'll be able to grab one on September 20th.[Via PS3Forums, thanks Stan]
