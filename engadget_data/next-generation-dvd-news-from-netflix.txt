 The online DVDrental giant Netflix certainly made a splash yesterday, announcing that they would be renting out both HD-DVD andBlu-ray discs as soon as they become available. This is somewhat surprising, as Netflix's CFO had previously declared Blu-ray the winner, but withthe constantly changing landscape, it appears they have decided better to support both than to risk backing a loser.Now more information hascome to light, as they have also revealed they will not be charging any additional fee for high-definition DVDs.They state the content cost for them will be the same, so is it possible that there won't be a premium price for nextgeneration DVDs? At this point we still really can't know how this will effect the end consumer, but high-definition TVowners who already subscribe to Netflix or are thinking about it are assured of easily available content, no matter whatformat they choose.
