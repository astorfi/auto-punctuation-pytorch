The X320 is sporting a 1.6GHz Intel Atom Z530 processor, while the Intel CULV-equipped X340 will be available in two configurations: a 1.2GHz Celeron M 723 and a 1.4GHz Core 2 Solo SU3500. MSI's Director of U.S. Sales Andy Tung says he expects the trio to run for around $700, $750, and $999, respectively. If that's not enough, two more X340 models are coming in May, in 1.3GHz Core 2 Solo SU2700 and a Core 2 Solo SU9600 options. No word on the 15.6-inch widescreen X600 model, but we're hoping to see it sooner rather than later.
