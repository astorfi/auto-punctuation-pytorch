The latest of evidence backing up that shocking fact are two separate rumors that cover some familiarly territory, but with a bit more weight than before. The more convincing of those are some purportedly authentic iPod touch parts that have turned up on a number of Chinese websites, which clearly show a hole on the front of the device that's presumably for a front-facing camera. That's backed up by some fresh comments from an exec at UK retailer John Lewis, who said that a major iPod touch refresh is coming in September, and that it will match many of the iPhone 4's features, including a 5-megapixel camera with HD video recording, a gyroscope and, yes, FaceTime support.
