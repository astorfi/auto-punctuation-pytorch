Ah, wonderful, the point of intersection where the two most rumored-about companies come together. As if Google
doesn't really have their fingers in enough pies with enough rumors already (it's only been nine posts since
our last), The Street has it that Apple's set to announce
an iTunes Music Store partnership with everyone's favorite search engine. What that means (or how they'll tie it all
in) is obviously very unclear, but isn't it fun to think of all these different couples pairing off and hooking up? It
is summertime, after all.
