This 24-incher is meant for those working on HD video content and thus features a 1920x1080 resolution with 10-bit advanced image processing, 1000:1 contrast ratio, 178-degree viewing angle, and inputs including HDCP-enabled DVI-D, component, composite and two high end HD/SD auto-switching SDIs (serial digital interfaces). Also announced is the DE-V20L1D which shares the specs of his big bro only with a 20-inch, 1680x1050 panel and 800:1 contrast ratio for a more frugal ¥400,000 (about $3,402). You'll see the 24-incher drop first in December, with the 20-incher set to hit Japan in late January. [Via Impress]
