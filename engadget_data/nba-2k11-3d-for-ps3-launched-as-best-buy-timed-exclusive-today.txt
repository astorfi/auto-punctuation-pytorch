The only apparent difference in this version is its support for stereoscopic 3DTVs (not the first sports title this year to do it, Madden 2011 features anaglyph 3D on any TV with a code, but really, why try?), but for now you won't be able to get it anywhere else. Already have the game or plan on pick it up elsewhere? Expect a software update adding 3D to all PS3 versions (no cross-platform 3D for the Xbox 360 version on this one, leave that to Call of Duty: Black Ops and Crysis) in January according to Ron from 2KSports, for now enjoy the new trailer for the 3D version (embedded) and expect a post on the official PlayStation Blog.
