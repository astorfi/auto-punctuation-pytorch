 Well, it's officially late August, meaning that the bit of buffer between Intel's Core 2 Duo desktop and mobile launches should be over any day now. Word on the street is Monday's locked and loaded for a barrage laptop releases with their latest powerhouse dual core mobile processor -- the one some may still know as Merom -- on board. (And thus, we ask for your forgiveness in advance when we have a slew of laptop write ups early next week.) In other words, if you were considering snatching up a laptop this weekend -- PC or Mac -- you'd probably be best off waiting until at least next weekend to do it; who knows what kinds of goodies we'll see in a couple days, right?
