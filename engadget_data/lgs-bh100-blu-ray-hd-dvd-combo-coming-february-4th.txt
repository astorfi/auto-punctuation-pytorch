 LG already told us that its new dual format player would be available in the first quarter of 2007, but we are surprised that we are already receiving unconfirmed reports from Best Buy employees that the date is going to be February 4th. Apparently the BH100 is already live in the company's system, according to our tipster. This isn't as surprising as seeing it on Best Buy's website almost instantly after the announcement, but we're still wondering what LG plans to do if the DVD forum disaproves its lack of support for HDi. We understand that rules are rules, but it's hard to imagine the DVD forum suing the only company to make a standalone player other than Toshiba.[Thanks, Derek]
