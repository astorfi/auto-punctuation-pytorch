We believe Sony just proved it's the master of teasing flexible laptops by using a piece of paper and basic origami skills to tout its upcoming VAIO PC. If we understood the clip correctly, the device can take the form of a laptop and a tablet, but it looks like it can flip around for use in a third position as well. Sound familiar? That's because Lenovo's Ideapad Yoga 11S has a similar form -- tell us we're not the only ones who smell competition. If you missed the teaser video when it went up briefly last week, check it out after the jump. You won't be able to glean info other than the hybrid's forms from it, but you won't have to wait long anyway -- the PC is slated for an IFA 2013 reveal.
