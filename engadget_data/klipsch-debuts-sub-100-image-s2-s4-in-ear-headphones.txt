That'll still get you the same proprietary, oval-shaped ear tips as Klipsch's pricier earphones though, along with a so-called moving coil design with controlled dampening, and a "hot rod" dual magnet motor structure on the S4. The S4 set also comes bundled with a few bonuses like a cleaning tool and a "crush-resistant" aluminum case, while the S2s get stuck with a basic cloth case and a slightly less flashy solid black finish. Look for the S4s to roll out first in April, with the S2s set to follow sometime In July.[Via SlashGear]
