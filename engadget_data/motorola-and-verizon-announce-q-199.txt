Final specs include EV-DO (duh), Bluetooth 1.2, stereo speakers, and the rest of the spread we've come to know all to well about this thing. The best part, however, is that you'll be able to order online starting May 31 or buy in store June 5th for a paltry $199 (after $100 instant rebate and two year plan, of course), with EV-DO enabled data plans to run between $80 and $170 per month, depending on your usage. And don't you even think about tethering this thing, mister.
