 No, you still can't have one (not yet, at least), but we've received a number of tips directing us Modaco forums, where admin Paul claims to have rooted Google's not-so-mysterious Nexus One. We can't validate the "superboot" file works, but the adjacent picture has popped up from another forum member as apparent anecdotal confirmation. Instructions for Windows, Linux, and OS X users can be found along with the necessary materials. What do you say, hacker community, any chance we can get multitouch loaded into the device before it ever becomes official to the world at large?
