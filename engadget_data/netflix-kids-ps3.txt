   Netflix is doing everything it can to court that "under 12" portion of the market by expanding its "Just for Kids" service to the PS3. Also available on Apple TV, Nintendo Wii and online, it offers pre-selected content that's suitable for any audience, including classics like Wallace and Gromit, Power Rangers and Thomas the Tank Engine. Just try and stick to those Thomas episodes pre Series-13, when they moved to all-CGI: that stuff gives us nightmares, let alone the little ones.
