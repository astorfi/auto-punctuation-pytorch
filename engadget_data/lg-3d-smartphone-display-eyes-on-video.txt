Sharp's already planning to bring its autostereoscopic wares to US shores at some point during 2011 and today LG's busy showing off a prototype of its own, right here at CES. It's a 4.3-inch panel, pumping out glasses-free 3D (using the parallax barrier method) and is presently embedded in an enormous demo box, but the ultimate goal is to have it in media-centric handsets. To be honest, yes, there's some glasses-free 3D effect going on, but for the most part we just noticed the two frames splitting and didn't find the video before us enhanced in any major way. The best parts might even have been the ones that didn't have any 3D-ification applied to them -- the display on show is certainly a lucid and bright one. Skip past the break to see what we're talking about.
