Evoking the days of when consoles shipped with actual games, Oculus just announced a second bundled title for its upcoming Rift VR headset: Lucky's Tale, a platformer from Words with Friends creator Paul Bettner. Earlier this month, the company also revealed that Eve: Valkyrie will also come every Oculus Rift. For the most part, Lucky's Tale looks like a typical platforming title along the lines of Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie -- the big difference is that the Rift serves as a virtual camera. But even if it doesn't look very original, another free game will certainly make the Rift more appealing to mainstream consumers. While there's still no official launch date or price, Oculus says the Rift will launch in the first quarter of 2016.
