 We assumed that theTiVo revolution would eventually convince the entire advertising industry to just close up shop and find a new outletfor its scary powers of persuasion, yet time-shifted TV has actually caused the wily advertisers to evolve and adaptlike some strain of superbacteria, and they continue to surprise us with innovative ways to subject us to theirmessages. Take a new ad from the restaurant formerly known as Kentucky Fried Chicken that premiers this week, in whicha "secret" message is encoded such that it is only visible while the commercial is being viewed in slo-mo.Now the concept of hidden ads in-and-of itself seems quite effective--even the most die-hard commercial skipper stillhas to watch the screen to avoid missing the beginning of the next segment, so a fast-forward-viewable message is alikely evolution--but KFC is stepping it up a notch and actually providing an incentive for people to seek outthe ad, offering a free sandwich to those who can regurgitate the hidden phrase. Imagine that: there may soon be a daywhen we record shows not because we enjoy them, but because advertisers have told us that they'll give us free swag ifwe comply.[Via PVR Wire]
