Pocket-lint claims that Redmond plans to officially launch 6.1 at CTIA next week -- April 1, to be exact -- though there'll be a wide gap between any announcement off in Vegas and actual availability on retail handsets, so it really doesn't mean a whole heck of a lot to consumers right away. Question is, what's more anticipated: 6.1 or the X1 itself?[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
