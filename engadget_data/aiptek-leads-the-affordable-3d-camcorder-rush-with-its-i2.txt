Aiptek was showing off its i2 camcorder, a Flip-like device (even with a pop-out USB connector) that has been augmented with a second five megapixel CCD. It's capable of recording 720p video and is set to retail for about $250, making it a relative bargain. The camera is set to launch in Asia in July, where we figure it'll take about 30 seconds for someone to paint one up like Domo Kun.
