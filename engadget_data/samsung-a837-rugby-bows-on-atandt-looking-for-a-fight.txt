 
It's not every day that AT&T launches a phone that meets military specifications for dust, water, and shock resistance -- in fact, AT&T claims it's the first time ever, despite the Motorola V365's street reputation as a tough piece -- so take note, especially if you've got butterfingers or a job that involves rolling around in a mud pit. The Samsung a837 Rugby won't win any hearts with its charming good looks, but it's got 3G data, push-to-talk support, and a 1.3-megapixel camera to take quick and dirty shots of your dangerous endeavors that'd make your average flip beg for mercy. Grab it now for a shade under $130 on a two-year activation.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
