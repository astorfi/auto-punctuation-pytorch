Thomas Seifert, the temporary solution to the problem created by Dirk Meyer's departure from AMD's top spot, has had a pretty comfy ride reporting the company's latest quarterly results. The pecuniary numbers themselves ($1.65b revenue, $375m net income) were tame and unexciting, but Seifert got to make a pair of juicy milestone announcements. Firstly, on the mobile and ever-so-efficient front, he noted that 1.3 million Fusion APUs (Accelerated Processing Units) have been shipped to partners since AMD started deliveries in November, and secondly, in terms of discrete graphics chips, he disclosed that the Radeon HD 5000 and HD 6000 series DirectX 11 GPUs have surpassed the 35 million units shipped mark. To give you some perspective on what that means, sales of Nintendo's bestselling Wii console are hovering somewhere around the same figure. So yes, AMD, your wagon has momentum, but shouldn't it have a driver too?

Our customers recognize that Fusion APUs are at the core of delivering the world's most vivid digital experiences."Quarterly Summary  Gross margin was 45 percent, down one percentage point sequentially primarily due to lower microprocessor average selling price (ASP).

Operating income was $91 million, compared with $164 million in Q3-10 and $161 million in Q4-09. Microprocessor ASP decreased sequentially and was flat year-over-year. The sequential decrease was due to lower notebook and server ASPs.     AMD kicked off the next era of vivid computing with the launch of the industry's first Accelerated Processing Units (APUs) aimed at providing better experiences on the types of visual and data-intensive applications that are becoming increasingly popular. Our first AMD Fusion APUs combine a low-power x86 microprocessor with DirectX®11 capable graphics to deliver optimized mobile experiences. Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba plan to deliver affordable thin and light mobile PCs based on the new APUs that offer full 1080P HD experiences and long battery life. Key software partners announced support for AMD Fusion APUs, including Adobe, ArcSoft, Corel, DivX and Microsoft.
