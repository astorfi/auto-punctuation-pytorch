They'vealso got a Precision M90 and M65 for you to sink your teeth into, featuring Core Duo chips (what else?), 512MB QuadroFX graphics, IEEE 1394, an oversized three-inch touchpad, and a 17-inch 1920 x 1200 display on the M90; the M65(pictured) will get a Quadro FX with TurboCache (no dedicated graphics memory), dual battery option, and a 15.4-inchdisplay. The Precisions, which we haven't heard from a little while, are intended to be a little higher end than yourrun of the mill Latitudes, though, so expect to pay for the privilege with baseline price tags of $2,239 and $1,849,respectively.[Via Mobility Site]
