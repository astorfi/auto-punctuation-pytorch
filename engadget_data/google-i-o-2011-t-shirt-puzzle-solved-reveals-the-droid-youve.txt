The picture above contains a series of dots and dashes, which our friends at MobileCrunch recognized as Morse code. Using the line breaks as spaces (new characters), the code then reads:


	.... - - .--. --. --- --- .-.-.- --. .-.. .- ....- -.-. -.... ...-- ----.


	That translates to a URL, which we've linked to below. We won't spoil where it leads, in case you're feeling noble enough to try decoding it for yourself.
