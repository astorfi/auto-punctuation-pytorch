Zink has updated their site to say that their "digital polaroid" will be shipping in late 2007, which will hopefully mean a fall release date. Zink has also released some of the Integrated Digital Camera and Printer's specifications, which aren't altogether that interesting -- it has a 7 Megapixel CCD, 2-inch display, and SD memory card slot, just so ya know. All we care about is how good the printer is on this chunky combo unit.[Thanks, Piper]
