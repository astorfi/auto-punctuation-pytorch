 So you've got a rad high-def set with 1080p resolution and HDCP-compliant HDMI inputs. But we're betting whatyou don't have is a wireless HDMI chipset from Radiospire to help you send uncompressed 720p or 1080iprogramming at up to 3 Gbps. Radiospire created the chipset for OEMs so we're waiting to see who will be the first topick it up, but the technology wisely uses the 3.1 to 4.8 GHz bands so the signal doesn't get crossed with those anemic802.11a, b, and g transmissions. We'll be watching for a 1080p flavor in the second half of the year, and hope they upthe output range beyond the current 15 feet.[Via HDBeat]
