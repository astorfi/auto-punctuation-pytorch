We discussed the recent Cortex A50 announcement and ARM's broad history -- including key products like the Nokia 6110 and how the company's chip designs have "changed how people compute and lead their digital life" over the past five years. We also talked about the scalability and flexibility of the ARM architecture, from embedded systems to smartphones and tablets to servers. So what's in the pockets of one of the most important people in the chip world? A Nexus 7 and a global Galaxy S III, it turns out. Go ahead and watch the full interview above.
