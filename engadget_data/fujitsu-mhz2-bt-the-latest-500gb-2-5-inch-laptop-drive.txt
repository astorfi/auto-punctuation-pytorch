Fujitsu's new MHZ2 BT is the second drive to hit the half-terabyte mark, but just like the Hitachi 500 gigger it's a non-standard height (12.5mm), meaning you won't be able to slap it in most laptops or enclosures -- unless you're willing to shave out an extra ~3mm of surrounding matter. Expect 'em out in May.
