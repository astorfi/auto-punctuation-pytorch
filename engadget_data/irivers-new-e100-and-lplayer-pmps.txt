       If iriver's PMP lineup isn't quite extensive enough for you yet, the E100 and LPlayer might fill that void in your heart where a QVGA screen should be. Both players take a cue from the Clix+ and offer D*Click navigation, along with 320 x 240 screens, FM tuners and voice recorders. The E100 rocks a 2.4-inch LCD and built-in stereo speakers, with flash capacities at 4GB, 8GB and 16GB, and a slot for microSD expansion, while the LPlayer sports a 2-inch LCD and 1GB, 2GB and 4GB capacities. Sadly, we haven't tracked down pictures of these, and there's no word on price or availability for either.
