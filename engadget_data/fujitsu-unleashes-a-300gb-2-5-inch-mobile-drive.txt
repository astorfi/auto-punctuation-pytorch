 Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later: tiny, 2.5-inch, laptop-sized hard drives have hit the 300GB threshold. Yep, Fujitsu has just announced its latest line of mobile hard drives, the MHX2300BT series, about nine months after reaching the 200GB barrier. Apparently this new 4200RPM SATA 2.5 line includes a seek time of 1.5ms, has a 1.6W power draw, and sports "high shock tolerance" -- although we would suggest that you not test that last one out. This new 300 gigger is due to hit the streets in early 2007, but we've got no pricing info for the time being.
