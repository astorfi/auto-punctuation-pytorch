 Amidst all the Nexus excitement from yesterday, Google just hit the 700,000 Android app milestone in its Play Store, according to Bloomberg. That would put it near par with Apple, who announced just last month that its App Store hit that same figure. Like Cupertino's iOS shop, Play (which started off as the Android Market) has been peddling its robot wares since 2008, though the store opened several months after Apple's. Google may have been set to trumpet the new figure during the Nexus launch yesterday as they did last June at I/O, but a certain Sandy may have wrenched that plan -- so, we're still waiting for a formal announcement.
