The edge-lit LED and 1.1-inch thin C7000 series hits in 40- 46- and 55-inch sizes, with plenty of other features to go along with their 3D and 2D-to-3D conversion abilities. There's access to Samsung Apps & Internet@TV, Skype, AllShare DLNA media streaming, and tweaks that promise to automatically adjust picture and sound for any content source, from a thumb drive to a Blu-ray player. Best pleasant surprise? Price. The UN46B7000 model we reviewed last year started with a $2,999 MSRP (currently down to $1,929 on Amazon), while this year's UN46C7000 (shipping April 16) has a preorder price of $2,599. The 40- and 55-inch versions are similarly priced, at $1,999 and $3,299, respectively, though those necessary 3D glasses are left out of the package as an optional and as yet unpriced accessory that will likely eagerly claim any remaining room in your budget.
