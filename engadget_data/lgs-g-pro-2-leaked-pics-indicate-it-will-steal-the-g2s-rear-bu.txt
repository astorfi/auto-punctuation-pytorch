LG only just announced that it's launching the G Pro 2 phone next month, and now two pictures that claim to show the device have surfaced on a Korean forum, DC Inside. Following up on last year's 5.5-inch Optimus G Pro, the pictured device features a rear-mounted button setup mirroring LG's most recent flagship phone, the G2. The pics lack accompanying details, although Android Community mentions rumors have hinted at a size bump to 6-inches, support for faster LTE-A networks, a Snapdragon 800 CPU and 1080p screen -- it's also unknown if the G Pro 2 will follow the G2's software tweaks with "knock on" and QSlide multitasking. Check after the break for one more picture -- we should have all the details confirmed by the time the Mobile World Congress 2014 event begins in Barcelona on February 24th.
