  While its corporate parent Viacom continues to tussle with Google over who is liable for user uploaded content, Paramount Pictures has struck a deal to offer its movies for rental on YouTube / Google Play in the US and Canada. According to Google that adds up to around 500 new movies becoming available on the service over the next few weeks including hits like Ferris Bueller and The Godfather. Those catalog titles are currently available on 48hr joypasses for $3.99/$2.99 (HD/SD) each, while newer titles like Hugo are $4.99/$3.99. Also worth noting is that now the folks at Mountain View can count five of the six major studios (Fox is still out) among their offerings. We'll see if this signals a thawing relationship between Google and the studios upset that pirated copies of their content are so easily found via Google's searches (doubt it), but at least Android users can look forward to more easily accessible content.
