There have been some more academic inquiries into this
concept, but it looks like IIP is the first to commercialize this retinal implant technology, which combines an ocular
microchip with a small video camera integrated into a pair of glasses to restore limited vision to patients with
hereditary blindness. The processing duties are handled by a microcomputer clipped to a belt, which takes visual
information received by the glasses and converts it into electrical pulses that stimulate the patient's optic
nerve.
