One of the only two booths we did find that wanted anything to do with Redmond's media software was Amulet Device's voice-activated remote for Windows 7 Media Center -- Vidabox was the other one. Overall it seemed to work, but didn't do what it was commanded on every attempt, which is what one might expect from beta software. As you can see in the video, the company has optimized many of the screens for voice control, but you can use the old favorites if you prefer too.
