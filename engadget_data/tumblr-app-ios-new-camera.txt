 After a complete refresh of its iOS app and full-on iPad support, Tumblr's keeping the updates coming for the Apple set with version 3.3. The main tweak is with the camera, which the microblogging company's taken from a fairly barebones affair to one in which you can adjust the flash, add a rule-of-thirds grid and access galleries by swiping up from below. Other features include the ability to create photosets straight from the app, double-tap posts to like and easily change your avatar or add URLs. The latter will seek out the title of an article when you type in the web address -- always a bonus on a site where pop culture references flow like water.
