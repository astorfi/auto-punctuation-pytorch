Verizon's going to be releasing a slider called the U620, which will come with VCAST Mobile TV, the rebranding of the MediaFLO mobile television service that is poised to go tête à tête with Vue. Beyond that, you've got some EV-DO data, stereo Bluetooth, a 1.3 megapixel cam, a MicroSD card slot, and speech-to-text voice recognition action up in there as well. While this scant info may just seem like a tease, it's all we've been able to glean from the depths of the interwebs for the time being -- as usual, we'll update as best we can.
