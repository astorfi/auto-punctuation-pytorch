The active headphones clip onto the back of your ears and transmit sound through the skin and cartilage, creating what the company calls a "sensual new surround sound." We're not exactly sure what that means, but it's generated by a battery-powered amp that runs for six to eight hours on a 90-minute charge, and it's yours now $110 in limited quantities.[Via Popular Mechanics]
