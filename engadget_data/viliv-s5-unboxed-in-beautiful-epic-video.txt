Well, until now, maybe. jkkmobile's got an exhaustive video unboxing which shows the device off quite nicely -- its 4.8-inch haptic touchscreen looks super responsive -- and overall, this UMPC is shaping up to be one decently impressive piece of work. They're expected to ship around May 8th in the U.S. for $599. Video is after the break -- it's a little long, but be sure to stick with it until the end, when Ilsa takes off in a plane for America, leaving a teary-eyed Rick on the tarmac. You won't be disappointed.
