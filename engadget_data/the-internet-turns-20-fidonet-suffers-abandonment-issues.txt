Over roughly the next year and a half he had built HTTP, HTML, WorldWideWeb (the first web browser), CERN httpd (the first server software), and the first web server (http://info.cern.ch), paving the way for an unprecedented era of human communication and interconnectivity. We're not entirely sure how 4chan, Bert Is Evil, or Tila Tequila fit into all of this, but we'd sure miss them if they weren't here (well, not Tila Tequila -- definitely not Tila Tequila). The visionary chats about cyberspace past, present, and future after the break. [Via Daily Wireless]
