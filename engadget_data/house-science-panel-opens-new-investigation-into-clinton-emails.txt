Hillary Clinton already has the FBI and a Senate judiciary committee on her tail about her private emails possibly containing classified info, but now it looks like she has to face yet another inquiry on the matter. Two days ago, House Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) opened a second congressional committee to investigate the security of those emails.



In particular, Smith is focusing on the four companies involved: Platte River Networks, which maintained the server; Datto Inc, which backed it up in the cloud; SECNAP Network Security Corp., which installed a security monitoring service; and Fortinet, which provided the encryption software. Smith's committee has already sent letters to all four requesting further information.

Smith's investigation is done in very much the same vein as an existing inquiry by Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) into the emails. Johnson has also been working with Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to look into who at the State Department level approved her use of her personal email setup and how that happened.

"A high profile government official deviating from established information security requirements raises significant concerns," Smith said in a statement.
