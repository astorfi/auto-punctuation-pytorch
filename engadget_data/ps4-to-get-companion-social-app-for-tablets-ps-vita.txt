Sony's just begun to show us what's been up its sleeve for the PlayStation 4, and it turns out that it's got social networking and the second screen on its mind. Gamers will be able to share ten second video clips of their gameplay, stream play sessions online to friends and "keep in touch with the evolving world of your game, regardless of your location." The network will also learn a player's likes and dislikes, and automatically download content it figures users will dig. Hirai and Co. are also planning PS Vita and tablet apps for folks to partake in the social experiences when they're not near their PS4.
