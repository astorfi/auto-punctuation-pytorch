Those that just can't wait to find out more about this sucker should check out Pop Photo's very early first impressions. Although they don't have a lot of conclusions to make about it in their first 24 hours of testing, there's certainly a sense of excitement in the air about a smallish point and shoot equipped with an over the top 14 megapixel FOVEON X2 CMOS pulled right out of Sigma's SD14 DSLR.[Thanks, Tano]Read - Sigma's price n' dateRead - Checking out the DP1
