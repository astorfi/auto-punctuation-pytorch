As soon as itgets around to issuing its final rulings, anyway, whenever that is (the Times said it could be as early as February).Supposedly issuing said rejection is to be the USPTO’s “next office action,” but it just won’tmatter if it’s not sorted before NTP’s case is ruled upon. Remember, RIM cannot further appeal in thecourts to buy themselves time, and have been given an express imperative to settle with NTP by James Spencer, theDistrict Court Judge presiding over the case. But if RIM can stall their negotiations until the USPTO can file theirfinal rulings —before injunction against RIM is instated — the case would probably be overturned. Exceptthat apparently NTP co-founder and patent attorney Donald Stout stated their intentions to appeal the USPTO’sfinal rulings (can they do that?). Makes one wonder though; if these patents are so extremely invalid, then why did thePatent Office approve them in the first place? They certainly could have saved everyone a lot of trouble over there bynot working the approve first / invalidate later angle.
