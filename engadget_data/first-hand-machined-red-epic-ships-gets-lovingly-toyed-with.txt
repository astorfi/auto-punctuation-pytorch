In case you've arranged to find yourself with a similarly jawdropping Christmas present in the mail, you can find pictures of what to expect at our source links below. The links will also do quite nicely if you haven't experienced that feeling called "jealousy" in a while and would like a refresher course. 

Update: OffHollywood is shooting up a storm with the EPIC-M right now, and you'll find more gorgeous pics and impressions at REDUSER and their Twitter account.

[Thanks, Charlie and Patrick]
