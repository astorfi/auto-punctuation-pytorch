Maddocks, the SteamPunk Frankenstein PC case mod is monstrously, beautifully cobbled from -- among other things -- a church vent and some cold cathode tubes. When the backlighting is fired up it's quite breataking to behold, though -- at over eight feet tall -- we're not sure we'd like to see it in our own parlor, we can certainly admire the beast from afar. One more daguerreotype after the break, but hit the read link for the whole set.
