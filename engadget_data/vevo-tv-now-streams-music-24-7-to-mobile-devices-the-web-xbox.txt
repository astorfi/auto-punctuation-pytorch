 Vevo, long known as a source of music videos on YouTube, has just launched its own, standalone music video service called Vevo TV. The streaming music channel is on 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and it'll feed your craving for the latest Adele, Rhianna and/or Bieber videos on your TV, PC, or mobile device. At launch, apps are available for Android, iOS and Windows Phones, in addition to Xbox and Roku. Naturally, PC owners can go to vevo.com to watch it on the web as well. Programming comes in hour-long musical genre-themed chunks that are curated by Vevo staff, and the service is currently available in the US and Canada.
