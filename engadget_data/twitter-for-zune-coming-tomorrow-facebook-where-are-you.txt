Coupled with November's release of 3D games, by our count that leaves only Facebook left as the promised Zune app officially registering M.I.A. More details for tomorrow's release in the morning, and with so many Twitter apps available on other platforms as case studies, we'll be expecting some good things here, mkay Redmond?
