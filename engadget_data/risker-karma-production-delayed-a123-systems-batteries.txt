Since A123 slowed its battery output after the filing, the automaker has been too short on batteries to continue churning out vehicles. Fisker anticipates resuming production after the ill-fated outfit is auctioned off, but it doesn't expect to know the outcome of the sale until mid-December. If your Karma's lithium-ion pack goes kaput in the meantime, there's still hope. As of now, the company says it has enough batteries in stock for customers who need replacements.
