LG's got something cooking, and it's looking to let us in its kitchen in New York City on August 7th. Naturally, the important details -- like what we'll be seeing -- are nowhere to be found just yet, but given LG and Qualcomm's recent teasing of a new Optimus G packing a Snapdragon 800 SoC, it seems this could be a smartphone-centric affair. We'll have to wait and see until the dog days of summer, of course, but we'll be there to bring you the action when the time comes.
