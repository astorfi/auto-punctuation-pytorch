It's called the Thing-O-Matic, an appropriate name given that it produces things and does so automatically. It's built around version 2.0 of the Automated Build Platform, enabling the endless creation of widget after whatsit, spitting results out the front before moving on to the next with no manual intervention required. The device connects via USB, like any self-respecting printer these days, and can be yours for a mere $1,225.
