Amazon knows that although a number people prefer (or need, in some cases ) audio over visuals to absorb published works, it's still very important to provide a pleasant experience on the design front. In light of this, the Audible Android app has now been updated with a completely redesigned user interface, bringing along an enhanced navigating experience and an easier, more simplified way to manage your library. Audible listeners will also see a new "chapter-level" progress bar within the player, while other under-the-hood tweaks were made to improve the general performance and stability of the application. You don't have to wait to download version 1.5, as it's available as we speak from the Google Play store.
