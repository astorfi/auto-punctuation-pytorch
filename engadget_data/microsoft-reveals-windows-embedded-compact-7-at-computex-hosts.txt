 
We know, you're probably eager to brush off yet another "embedded" operating system, but here at Computex, Microsoft is giving the naysayers a reason to think twice with the official debut of Windows Embedded Compact 7. Showcased along with a number of Windows 7 handhelds and slates at the company's monstrous booth, the public community technology preview of the new OS is being made, with the goal to get this onto lightweight ARM-powered devices that either aren't powerful enough for a full-fledged copy of Windows 7, or are simply aimed at a different market. Put simply, it's yet another product that Microsoft can offer up and coming device makers who may otherwise consider MeeGo, Android or a plethora of other mobile OS options. We've got an interview session lined up with Steve Guggenheimer, corporate vice president of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Division, for later today, but we just couldn't wait to show you all of the Windows 7 and Windows Embedded Compact 7 tablet PCs that were impossible to avoid. Hit the gallery below (or video past the break) for specs and the like, and don't blame us for those plastic covers -- Microsoft wasn't about to rip 'em off, as a fair amount of these are super early beta units.
