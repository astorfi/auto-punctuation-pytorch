As if that recently announced trio of Desire smartphones wasn't enough, HTC today introduced a couple more, this time in Taiwan. Meet the Desire 700 and Desire 501, both aimed at the mid-range market in said Asian territory. For its part, the 700 (pictured above) features a 5-inch, qHD display alongside BoomSound speakers, an as-of-yet undisclosed quad-core Snapdragon chip Spreadtrum's quad-core 1.2GHz Shark SoC, 1GB RAM, 8GB of internal storage and a 2,100mAh battery.


The 501, on the other hand, packs those same traits but with a smaller 4.3-inch, WVGA screen and a dual-core 1.15GHz ST-Ericsson U8520 -- oh, and it comes in a few different colors. HTC is pricing its dual-SIM-packing Desire 700 at NTD 13,900 (about $470), while the Desire 501 will be available with a cheaper NTD 9,900 price tag.
