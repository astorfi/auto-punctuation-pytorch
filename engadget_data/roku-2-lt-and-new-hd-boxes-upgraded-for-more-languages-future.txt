First up there's a few new features included right away like support for Spanish and German in the UI, performance optimizations and playback improvement for channels like MLB.tv and GBTV. More interesting however is the prospect of what's to come, as it also note "under the hood" preparations for new channels and features, promising upgrades for the iOS and Android remote apps soon. Like the last upgrade, the new version is getting pushed to Roku 2 and LT boxes now, while new HD boxes should see it next week.
