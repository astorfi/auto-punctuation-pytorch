According to details provided to us, we now know that the entire rear cover slides off with the simple removal of a pair of under-mounted screws. Unusual for all-in-one PCs this sleek. That gives enthusiasts easy access to the 3.5-inch SATA disk, optical disc drive, discrete graphics card, and 2x DIMM slots for memory upgrades. There's also a fair bit of polish with nine touch-capacitive media buttons (volume, play/pause, FF, etc.) along the right-side bezel which remain illuminated indefinitely when sensing (via proximity sensor) the presence of your fingers. The buttons automatically dim as you move away. The optical drive displays a blue arc outlining an inserted disc but does not offer any type of manual, forced eject -- a Dell field service call is required to remove any stuck media (gulp). Complete specs after the break, all sorts of sexy in the gallery.Update: Oh, and this model features a 20-inch 1,680 x 1050 display according to the new specs -- not 22-inch as we originally heard. Of course, there are likely to be different sized models released so we're not disappointed, yet.
