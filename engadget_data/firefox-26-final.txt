Firefox 26 has exited beta at last, and it includes a few big treats for Android users. The mobile browser now includes a promised home screen with quick access to favorite pages, bookmarks and the Reading List. There's also new optimizations for Intel-based devices, and searchers can switch to Bing or Yahoo if they'd rather not rely on Google. Desktop users aren't completely left out of the update parade, mind you; the full-size software no longer launches Java plugins automatically, and Linux users can play H.264 video with the right add-ons. Whichever new Mozilla client hits the spot, you can download it today through one of the source links.
