  HTC's been far from quiet since unveiling its One series to the masses, and today the company's continuing the trend by launching three new devices in China. This trio makes up HTC's Dragon lineup, which our partners at Engadget China first met at MWC. Leading the way is the 4-inch HTC VT T328t for China Mobile, featuring Sense 4, an S-LCD, WVGA screen, a 1GHz CPU alongside 512MB of RAM, the famed Beats Audio and of course, it's running a flavor of Android ICS. As for the VC T328d (Telecom) and V T328w (Unicom), they're both rocking similar specs as the VT model, with the exception of dual-SIM card slots on each. All three Dragons are expected to be available by month's end, but save for the T328w costing 1999 yuan (around $320), pricing remains a mystery.

 Update: The series has since been renamed to "New Desire," so these are the New Desire VT, New Desire VC and New Desire V, respectively.
