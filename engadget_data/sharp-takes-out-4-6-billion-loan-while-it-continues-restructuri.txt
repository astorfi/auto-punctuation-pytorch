 Much of the business news out of Japan from Sharp hasn't been good, but for now at least it's worked out a loan agreement to keep rolling. It's still pursuing a deal with manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry / Foxconn that would provide a much-needed injection of capital, but those talks have reportedly stalled. Until something happens there it has a 360 billion yen ($4.6 billion) syndicated loan worked out with a couple of Japanese banks that runs until June 30th 2013. We're still not sure how Sharp will proceed with all this, but hopefully an agreement can be reached that brings its sweet IGZO LCD tech and any other new screens it will be showing off at CEATEC next week to more devices.
