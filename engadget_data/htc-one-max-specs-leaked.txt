The One Max is far from being HTC's best kept secret -- we've seen leak after leak of the rumored larger-than-most device over the past few weeks. To make things better (or worse, depending on who you ask), Nowhereelse.fr editor Steve Hemmerstoffer has tweeted an image which includes what could be the HTC One Max's full spec list. Aside from mentioning the same 5.9-inch, 1080p display and 3,200mAh battery we heard about not long ago, today's leak suggests the One Max is set to feature a quad-core, 1.7GHz Snapdragon 600, 2GB RAM, Android 4.3 with Sense 5.5, Bluetooth 4.0 and options for 16, 32 or 64GB of built-in storage. If this turns out to be true, then there's no doubt the Taiwanese company will have an Android powerhouse in its hands, right there alongside Samsung's Galaxy Note 3. The good news is that it looks as if we won't have to wait much longer to learn all there is to know about the HTC One Max; in the meantime, head after the break to check out the purported spec sheet in its entirety.
