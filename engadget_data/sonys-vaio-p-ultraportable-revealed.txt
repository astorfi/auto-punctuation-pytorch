By on display we mean, on display as these shots were taken off the display monitors in Sony's booth. Engadget was first in the world to reveal the P from the FCC specs so it seems only fitting that we bring you the first authenticated pictures dontchathink? The Sony Picturebook... it lives again at CES!


P.S. Sorry for the blur, best we could do before the security hammer came down across our knuckles.
