It features the famed 9.7-inch color E Ink panel, the first of its kind, and offers the rather spectacular resolution of 1200 x 1600. We managed to spend a few precious moments with a prototype unit and were impressed by the solid and thin construction and the excellent viewing angles on offer. Sadly, there's plenty of bad news here too: the E920's colors are muted and not really on par with what you'd expect from even a mediocre LCD, refresh rates are pretty glacial, and the touchscreen functionality is of the resistive kind, meaning you'll have to resort to using the integrated stylus for navigation. The biggest downer, however, is that China, the first market for this e-reader, won't be getting it until May at the earliest. That's a long time to wait for a $500-ish slate. Video after the break.

Update: There was some initial confusion about the device's name and specs, which has since been rectified and the post updated accordingly. [Thanks, Michalis]
