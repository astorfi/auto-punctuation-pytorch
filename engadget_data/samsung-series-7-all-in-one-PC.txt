The company is also teasing a Series 7 all-in-one PC, a desktop that we can only imagine was built to run Windows 8 (notice that those cheeky blokes in Sammy's marketing department aren't even showing a Win8 screen in that lone photo you see up there). As with the Series 5 hybrid, Samsung is revealing maddeningly little about specs. We do know it responds to both voice input and hand gestures -- both uncommon features for a desktop, especially in that combination. We don't even know the screen size or resolution, but we're told this panel is capable of recognizing up to 10 fingers at once. Lastly, Samsung says the stand is made of metal and the display is slim, but you probably already gathered that. And that, folks, is all she wrote, but we'll be sure to report back with more details between now and when this goes on sale, presumably sometime after Win8 ships this fall.
