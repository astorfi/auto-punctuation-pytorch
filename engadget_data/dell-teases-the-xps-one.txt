Apparently the machine is "The end of the PC as you know it," which is definitely news to us, but hey, maybe we've known a lot of PCs. No more info than that, but interested parties can punch in their email addresses to receive info like ship dates...oh, we have those too. Damn. Well, it's a pretty picture, at least.[Thanks, Joshua]
