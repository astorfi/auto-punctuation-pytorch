The chunky 10.9mm blower packs a whopping 1,700 mAh battery that promises 630 hours of standby. Beneath the water-and-dust-proof shell is a Gingerbread phone with the usual array of features: 8.1 megapixel camera, mobile wallet, One-Seg TV reception, and cable-free sync. It's also squeezed in wireless charging and the ability to pair the phone via Bluetooth to the forthcoming Casio G-Shock GB-9600 watch, which will notify you of your incoming calls and emails. Ladyphone users who aren't interested in playing Dick Tracy can fire up the Medias Beauty App, which will offer "professional beauty advice" -- handy for those of us who can't find the time to keep our makeup all nice.
