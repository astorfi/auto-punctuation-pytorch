Yup, looks like Sprint's new Sanyo MM-9000 handset
will indeed be one of their opening-ceremony EV-DO devices after all. Further to its credit the device should have a
QVGA 260k color display, 64MB of both flash and RAM, a 1.3 megapixel camera, and a MiniSD slot. It's supposed to debut
for $379.99â€”not too shabby at all.
