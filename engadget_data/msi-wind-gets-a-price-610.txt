 We've gotten a ton of info on the MSI Wind, but so far pricing details have been a closely-guarded secret. Good thing we've got wonder-importers Expansys to help us out, though -- they've just listed the Wind at the pretty decent price of $610. That's not bad for a 10-inch screen, 1.6GHz processor (supposedly an Atom), 1GB of RAM, an 80GB disk and XP, but let's hope things get even cheaper when this thing hits the US for real.[Via UMPC Portal]
