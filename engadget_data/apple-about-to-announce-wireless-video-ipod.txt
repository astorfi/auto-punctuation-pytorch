       When it comes to Apple's product roadmap, to say there's an enormous amount of buzz and milling of rumors is a ridiculous understatement. Believe it or not we tend to have to disregard the majority of rumors floating around (or that get sent in to us); that said, when not only one, but multiple trusted sources get in touch to let us know Steve Jobs & Co. are supposedly finally about completed with the wireless / video iPod, we have to take note. Supposedly they're preparing to announce the device in the very near future, which we've been told is both wireless and widescreen (both features we've been waiting for the iPod to take on, since, well, forever) -- you didn't think last month's new nano / new shuffle / iTV event was going to be it for the rest of the year, did you? We'll keep you posted.
