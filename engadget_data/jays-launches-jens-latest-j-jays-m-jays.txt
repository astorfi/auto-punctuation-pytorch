 
We were wondering when Jens Nylander would be back to announce more JAYS products, and here we are, sitting on j-JAYS, and m-JAYS. So let's break this down, shall we? The j-JAYS (shown right, above, compared to JAYS' current d-JAYS), are actually aimed at Sony Ericsson Walkman phones, with the the m-JAYS (shown after the break with white j-JAYS) serve as a cord extender with mic and answering phone (in case you wanted to do more than just listen to music on your mobile); the d-JAYS are full-size device (i.e. 3.5mm) headphones, aimed at more regular use. j-JAYS, m-JAYS will set you back 495 SEK (listed in here for $50), 295 SEK (~$30), and will be sold through Swedish 3 stores in December before eventually making their way to the US -- sorry, no firm dates for Stateside launch just yet, but their US site says December as well.
