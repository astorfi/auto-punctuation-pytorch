 Exercise nuts looking to pick up one of the Nike+iPod Sport kits to enhance their workouts can finally place their orders on the Apple site, and can expect delivery of their purchase in four to five weeks. At $29, the kit is quite the bargain too, except that it won't do you much good without the hundreds of dollars of electronics and specialized footwear necessary to record and analyze every aspect of your morning jog. Luckily, Nike has been busy releasing several pairs of sneakers with that dugout under the sole for the wireless sensor, so even if the nano continues to remain a relatively pricey luxury, you should eventually be able to buy a pair of compatible kicks that won't break the bank.
