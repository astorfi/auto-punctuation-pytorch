 Proton is showing off what seems to be the first production LED based LCD at Computex '06. They have plans to produce a 32 and 42-inch LCD in the third quarter of this year - and let us tell you, we can't wait to see 'em. These displays are impressive with the 42-inch have a 1080p resolution with a contrast ratio of 1,200:1. The little brother sports a resolution of 1,366x768 and a contrast ratio of 1,000:1. These are rather nice looking HDTVs but to be honest we are kind of afraid of what the price is going to be. Whenever we find out though, we will let you know.
