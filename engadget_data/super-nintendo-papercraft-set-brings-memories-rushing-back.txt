       Remember the first time you completed a full race on Super Mario Kart (frustrating finish and all)? If you've somehow let less important things push those blissful memories aside, take a glance at ryo007's beautifully assembled papercraft set and see if doesn't start to come back. This palm-sized kit features a detailed SNES console, a couple of controllers and a hollow version of Super Mario All-Stars. Best of all, the creator has hosted a template in order for you, closet SNES lover, to create your own. Finding where you put those scissors, however, may still be a challenge.[Via technabob]Read - SNES papercraft templateRead - SNES papercraft assembled
