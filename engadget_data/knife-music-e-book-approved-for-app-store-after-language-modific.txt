Essentially, the author decided to submit a copy of the novel sans a few foul words, with him noting that it was "more important to have people check the book out -- along with the whole concept of e-books on the iPhone" -- rather than take some stance for personal liberties and whatnot. For those interested, it's ready for download as we speak at no charge, but if you're the indecent type, you'll have to manually add in those swears as you go.
