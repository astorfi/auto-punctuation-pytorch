Over the course of the next 18 months, top speeds will increase from 100 Mbps to 120Mbps, as part of a Â£110 million ($169 million) initiative. Users on 10Mbps, 20Mbps and 50Mbps plans, meanwhile, will see their speeds and bandwidth usage limits doubled, at no extra charge. The upgrade is slated to begin rolling out in February, and should be complete by the middle of next year. Competing company BT, meanwhile, was quick to point out the similarity between Virgin Media's new campaign and its own upgrade. "It is no surprise to see that Virgin are following our lead by doubling speeds," BT said in a statement. "We announced we would do this for our fiber products last autumn and so they are trying to catch up with us."
