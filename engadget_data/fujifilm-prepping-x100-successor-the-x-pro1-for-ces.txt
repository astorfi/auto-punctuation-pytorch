  Between the X-S1 and various superzooms and point-and-shoots, Fujifilm unloaded an ungodly number of devices on us last night, ahead of next week's CES gadget blitz, but that doesn't mean that the company doesn't still have a few tricks up its camera-making sleeves. Take this interchangeable lens shooter, the X-Pro1, which is said to be the successor to its awesome X100. According to information offered up by Wells Fargo Advisors, the compact system camera will bring a 16-megapixel APS-CMOS sensor, a hybrid view-finder and will have three interchangeable lenses available to it, an 18mm (27mm equivalent) f/2.0, 35mm (53mm equivalent) f/1.4 and 60mm (90mm equivalent) f/2. An image of the reported device (see above) has also popped up courtesy of a scan from French magazine, Reponses Photo, which claims that the camera will be seeing a March release. It's hard to say how much of this is spot on, but there seems to be a good chance that, at the very least, the company's got some more surprises planned for the big show -- we'll no doubt find out soon enough.
