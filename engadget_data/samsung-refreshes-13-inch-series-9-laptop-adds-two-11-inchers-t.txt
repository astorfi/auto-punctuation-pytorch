Of course, that's dog years in the world of consumer electronics -- the company has just refreshed its premium 13-incher, adding a Core i7 processor option, a 256GB SSD (up from 128GB), and 6GB of RAM to the highest-end model. While Samsung was at it, it added two 11-inch models, the lower-end of which which starts with a Core i3 processor, 64GB SSD, and 2GB of RAM. All told, you'll find two 11-inchers and three 13-inch models, ranging in price from $1,049 to $2,049, leaving the one we reviewed three months ago $300 cheaper. Full PR and a list of basic specs after the break.
