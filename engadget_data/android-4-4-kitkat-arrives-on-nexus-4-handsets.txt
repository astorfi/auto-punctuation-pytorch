Last week, Google announced that KitKat would arrive on the Nexus 4 and data-packing Nexus 7 models "soon." Well, it appears that around seven days was the wait time as Android 4.4 is rolling out to last year's Nexus handsets -- a day after Verizon starting pushing the update to the Moto X. We've seen multiple reports of the update's arrival with the promise of improved performance and a wealth of new features in tow. Keep an eye on those notifications, as the latest version of Google's mobile OS should be on it's way to your Nexus 5 predecessor.
