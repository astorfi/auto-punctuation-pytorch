If you grab the internals of MobiBlu's
DAH-1500, mix them in a bag with "cute," "shiny," and
"NW-A1000," and steal a
moniker from Motorola, you might end up with
the EZAV EMP-700 Pebble. With its 64x48 OLED display, USB 2.0, MP3 and WMA playback, FM tuner, voice recording, and 12
hours of battery life, you be the judge. We're not sure on what kind of storage they're offering, and there's no word
if this little guy is going to be entered into the world's smallest MP3 player contest, which would be too bad since
we're starting to miss those daily forays, but it ain't quite the lightest at 0.7 ounces, making this Pebble sound like
quite the brick.
