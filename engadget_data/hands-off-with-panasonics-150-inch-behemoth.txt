But after your eyes adjust to the sensory overload, it's truly a beautiful thing. The 4k resolution of the set was clearly stretching the source material, but everything still looked pretty sharp, blacks were black and motion was smooth. We chatted with a Panny rep who said this won't be out until 2009, but we slipped him a fiver and he promised to meet us out back with one of these after the show.
