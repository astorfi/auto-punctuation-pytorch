After nearly a month of bickering from Epic 4G owners, a Sprint forum administrator has finally come forward with glowing news about this so-called 3G upload issue: a fix is coming, and soon. If you missed out on the story, users were finding that their 3G uploads were being capped at around 150kbps, and a ginormous thread over at the carrier's message board has grown as the problem has persisted. Just today, though, one dshoem01 has provided the following snippet:

"Good news - an update will be released tomorrow 9/30. It will be rolled out over a 4 day period so not everyone will get it on day 1. I will have the standard MR information (fixes included, rollout schedule, etc) available tomorrow morning and will post it in a new featured thread."
 Note that this doesn't specifically say that the 3G caps will be fixed here, but why else post this newsflash in the very thread that surrounds the issue? Rest assured, our fingers are firmly crossed. 

[Thanks, Bradley]
