However, for some units, the latest version of Google's mobile OS is going to be too "compromised" to use properly. In that event, it's pledging to give you $100 credit off one of its brand new handsets, which are being unveiled today. It's not given details about how you go about claiming that credit, or when the program begins, but as soon as we're told, we'll let you know.
