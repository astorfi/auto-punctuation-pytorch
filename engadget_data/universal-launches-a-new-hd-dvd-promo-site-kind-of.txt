This announcement might be a premature as the site seems only 40% done, but Universal launched a swanky, new HD DVD promo site. There really isn't anything to do on the site just yet but it appears that HD DVD owners are going to be able to download additional content and even purchase "exclusive products while you watch the movie." We're curious to see how the "Best Buddies" is going to work; inactive button says, "Send your favorite clips to your friend" -- sweet. Some might wanna check out the pre-launched site, but we'll drop a note when the site is 100% operational.
