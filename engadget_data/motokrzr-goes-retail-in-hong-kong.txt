 Sprint, Verizon, and Cingular customers could well be in full holiday cheer before they get their freezing hands on Motorola's hotly anticipated MOTOKRZR (alias Canary, alias K1), but for peeps on Hong Kong's SmarTone-Vodafone network, it seems the seasons' greetings have come a bit early this year. The best RAZR since... well, the RAZR has gone live on the operator's website, retailing for HK$3,180 (about $400) on contract -- a smidge steep, perhaps, especially considering that they're pawning it contract-free for an extra HK$100, which by our humble calculations works out to about 13 bucks. Nonetheless, we're guessing they won't have trouble finding customers at the going rate.[Thanks, Brad]
