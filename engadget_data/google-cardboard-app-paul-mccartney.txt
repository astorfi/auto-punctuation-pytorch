Google took the VR world by surprise when it introduced its $20 DIY headset, Cardboard. Still, to this day, there's only so much anyone can do with it. Thankfully, there are third-party developers like Jaunt, which recently created a virtual reality experience that lets you share the stage with none other than Paul McCartney. With the app for Google Cardboard, you'll have the chance to immerse yourself in a performance of "Live and Let Die" from the legendary musician, featuring a 360-degree view, stereo 3D and deeply engaging audio. Jaunt states this is its first cinematic VR experience released to the public, adding that it will soon be bringing it to the Oculus Rift. Oh, and did we mention the app is free?



          
 
 
 It's worth mentioning that, as virtual reality continues to grow, you can expect and more content like this in the future. Naturally, that will be made possible by developers having access to budget-friendly projects such as Cardboard (official or unofficial), as well as others including the Oculus Rift and Samsung's Gear VR. In other words, you should be very, very excited for what's yet to come in VR.
