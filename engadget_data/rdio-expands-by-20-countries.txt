After launching a free, ad-supported service in North America and Australia, Rdio is keeping up the momentum by rolling out its paid service in 20 new countries. Those include swaths of South America including Argentina and Venezuela, along with South Africa, Israel and Hungary. That brings the total to 51, ranking Rdio second by country ahead of Spotify but well behind Deezer, which services a whopping 182 nations. If you're in one of the new regions and okay with having a machine guess your musical taste, you can grab it at the source for most platforms.
