Well itlooks like those Microsoftees are coming around, since spy photos of this chocolate controller have started to surfacearound the internets, sending confection loving 360 fanboys everywhere into a frenzy. We're still holding out for thewhite chocolate version, but there's plenty to love here for early adopters and dark chocolate aficionados.[Via Joystiq]
