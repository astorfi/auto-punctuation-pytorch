For its part in the Global Forest Watch, the search giant is providing tech (namely, Earth and Maps) that allows virtually anyone to monitor deforestation on a massive scale. Let's say you want to peek at how much of Brazil's rain forest has been clear-cut in since 2008. You can do that. Even better, you can look at how much has been replanted -- sadly, not a lot -- if the mood strikes. The website's interactive map also allows users to see just which industries are doing the damage, the extent of tree-top cover and a whole lot more. No, Google making data visible isn't exactly new, but this application might be the first to have a lasting impact on the environment.
