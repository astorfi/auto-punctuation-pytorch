The phone is free of physical keys, with a completely smooth face and vibrating haptics to denote key "presses." There's a nav wheel in the middle, which might not be the revolution Motorola is touting it as, but sure looks nice. The handset has 3.5mm headphone jack, 2GB of flash storage, a microSD slot, FM radio and a microUSB plug. The phone is Linux-based, and Moto is quite proud of its audio fidelity, but we suppose the proof is in the listening. No launch or price info just yet.
