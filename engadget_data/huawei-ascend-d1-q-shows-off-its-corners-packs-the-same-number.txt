A handful of official-looking images reveal a possible new flagship, the Ascend D1 Q, toting some curves and color detail -- at least on the speaker grill and camera unit. Sidestepping the slimline looks seen on the P1 series, the D1 Q is rumored to be the powerhouse of the set, supposedly housing a quad-core processor -- which would explain that Q suffix. With that annual mobile show just days away, expect to see some more concrete specifications very soon.
