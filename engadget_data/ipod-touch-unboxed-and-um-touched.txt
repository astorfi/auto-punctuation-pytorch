 
Yeah, we know we're running slightly behind on fooling around with a retail iPod touch, but we've finally got one here. You already saw our first impressions when we played with it at launch, but as the days have gone on, we've just become bewildered by a number of things, like: why does the screen look so different from the iPhone's? (More on that later.) Why'd Apple switch back to the shiny, scratch-magnet rear casing? Why can you add contacts, but not calendar appointments to the touch? And what was their methodology in selecting apps to use on the touch and not on the iPhone? While we ponder these questions (and many more) check out the full unboxing and hands-on gallery. More to come.
