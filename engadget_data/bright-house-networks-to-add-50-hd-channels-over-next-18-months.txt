 Not even three months ago, we got word that Bright House Networks would be adding eight new HD channels to its lineup, but now that number has skyrocketed with an announcement promising some 50 high-definition channels within the next 18 months. Reportedly, customers will see the first HD additions on February 1, 2008, as six unspecified channels are tossed in. Christian Fenger, president of BHN's Central Florida division, proclaimed that it would "triple" its HD offerings over the next 1.5 years by adding content that was "compelling, entertaining and of interest to its customers," and the firm also noted that the expansion was being made possible because of its "hybrid fiber-coaxial network architecture and long-standing relationships with the programmers."
