That's what we heard yesterday, but after doing a little digging of our own, our advice is simply, don't hold your breath. A source within Acer has told us that the company has no plans to hold a press conference at the Taipei show, and that a global launch event will be held in New York on May 25. The "significant news" Acer has to share this spring will be revealed then, but it doesn't seem like it'll entail Chrome OS devices either. 

So, what do we make of all of this? If we had to bet, we'd say that Chrome isn't quite ready for prime time yet, as others have been reporting. But Acer has been known to show early prototypes of devices behind glass at trade shows -- we saw the Android Aspire One under lock and key at Computex last year. Who knows what will happen in the next few weeks with Google I/O, this Acer event and Computex, but we just have a feeling we'll be waiting a bit longer for the company's Chrome OS systems to hit the market. Though, that doesn't mean it won't launch them in the second half of the year like originally promised.
