Now, mention piano lessons on the Nintendo DS and watch them squirm in confusion, a definite improved reaction that's all thanks to Easy Piano, which is now shipping to retail. It's a $40 game (of sorts) plus 13 key mini-piano that, if you're lucky, your children might confuse for the Guitar Hero: On Tour controller. Upon it gamers can learn to tickle the (plastic) ivories and even compose their own tunes of up to three minutes in length. That's not enough for a proper concerto, but plenty for your little wunderkind to get an early taste of chiptuning.
