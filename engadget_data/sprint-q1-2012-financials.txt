 
 Sprint Nextel has just deployed its Q1 2012 financials and it's a bit of a mixed bag, with a five percent net revenue growth over this time last year and a whopping 1.5 million sales of that iPhone it paid so dearly for -- twice as many as it sold last quarter and, of those, 44 percent were new subscribers. That helped to drive an overall postpaid subscriber growth of 263,000 but, despite some good news, the company is still suffering a $255 million operating loss and a $863 million net loss. Sprint reaffirmed its LTE plans, a pilot launch of six cities sometime in the middle of this year, with 12,000 sites going online before 2012 turns a year older. Will it be enough? Tune in next quarter to find out.
