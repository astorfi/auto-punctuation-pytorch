 While it's bad news that the Wii won't be region-free, we hope that these new snaps will lift your spirits. An anonymous tipster just sent us five photographs of the Wii developer kit, and we only have one thing to ask our friends at Nintendo: did ours fall off the back of a FedEx truck? Seriously though, we know that developer kits come in colors that the public never gets, but perhaps Nintendo could one day take a page out of Apple's playbook and charge a premium for this snazzy green -- it is, after all, the color of money. Make sure to check out the quartet of photos on the next page.
