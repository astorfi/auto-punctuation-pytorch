Nothing here that's going to make us shy away from the king of the hill, Dell's 3007WFP, but it's got on-par specs for it's $2000 price tag: 2560 x 1600 resolution, 400cd/m² brightness, 1000:1 contrast ratio, 6ms pixel response time, 178° viewing angle, 4 port USB hub, and DVI (and only DVI) input. Still, it's a step above the Apple on the hardware end, and Samsung displays aren't nothin' to thumb your nose at -- it's just a hard sell when Dell's behemoth is going for as much as $500 less.
