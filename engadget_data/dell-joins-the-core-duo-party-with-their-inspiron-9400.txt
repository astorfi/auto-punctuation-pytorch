 The new Inspiron 9400laptops from Dell (aka the E1705) don't make many changes from their hefty but powerful 9300 line, butthey have a change of heart with options for 1.86GHz or 2.0GHz Core Duo processors in the 17-inch lapsters. They docome with Windows Media Center 2005, which can take advantage of an optional external USB TV tuner, and the nVidiaGeForce Go 7800 256MB graphics card should do the trick for most apps. The 'books are available now on Dell.com,starting at $2000, so if you haven't been holding out for Yonahfor the portability, you can get at these relatively soon.[Thanks, Michael]
