After hearing that BDs were popping up in rental kiosks around the Northwest, it's now looking mighty official that Blu-ray Discs will be headed to its rental boxes around the country. As of now, the firm has made space for a dedicated Blu-ray section on its website, though it's currently empty and waiting for occupants. Impulse renting of BDs? Now there's something the BDA won't mind hearing.[Thanks, Michael]
