As good a deal as the Moto G might be for frugal smartphone shoppers, it doesn't have speedy LTE data; for some, that's practically a deal-breaker. However, it might get that often-sought upgrade relatively soon. Amazon has posted listings for two unannounced Moto G variants with "universal LTE," including one in a previously unavailable white hue. Detailed store pages are sadly missing, but both entries mention a $220 price (slightly above the $200 you'd pay for a 16GB 3G model) and a June 30th ship date. We'd also expect these to work only with GSM-based networks like AT&T and T-Mobile, so don't count on there being a Verizon equivalent.



Sounds good, doesn't it? Unfortunately, it's hard to determine how much Amazon really knows. The picture of the Moto G LTE clearly isn't for the current edition, but the launch details could easily be little more than placeholder info. A June release would line up with earlier rumors from Xataka, though, and it's not far-fetched to see this model carrying a slight price premium. We may get the full scoop before long, at any rate. Motorola is holding a big event on the 13th -- many expect it to focus on the Moto E, but there's nothing precluding an update to the company's existing budget handset at the same time.
