We get the full unboxing treatment, a detailed teardown, and finish up with some delicious, light-paneled modding. While we can't really gather much beyond what we already know, the drive appears to be a Philips Lite-On DG-16D4S -- just in case you were wondering about that one. There's a video below showing off this one's new, modded exterior. 

[Thanks, Thomas C]
