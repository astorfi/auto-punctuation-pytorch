 Wouldn't it be great if your car could actually read information to you? We're not just talking about reciting driving directions (that's so 2001), but rather an audio version of RSS feeds, specifically Yahoo Japan, Sony's So-net "lifestyle blog" and Nissan's travel guide blog. (C'mon Nissan, no love for Engadget Japanese?) It appears that this new addition to the Carwings system, which already provides ho-hum GPS navigation will also pack a 30GB hard drive so you can rock out to Pizzicato Five if you get bored of that mechanical voice. If you attend the Combined Exhibition of Advanced Technologies (October 3 - 7) to be held at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba, you can check out the updated Carwings system -- if you do, be sure to let us know how distracting the synthetic voice is while zooming down the road.[Via TechNews]
