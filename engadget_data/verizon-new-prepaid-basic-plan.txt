 For some time now, Verizon and other carriers have slowly but surely shifted focus from "dumb" handsets to ones that are much more intelligent, with data-driven shared plans being one of the strategies that corroborate this move. Today, however, Big Red's gone back to basics, announcing a novel prepaid plan for folks without a smartphone -- which will go alongside the company's existing $50, all-you-can-have offering. With the new Basic Plan, Verizon's giving would-be customers a $35 option which serves 500 anytime minutes (sorry, no mobile-to-mobile) as well as unlimited mobile data and text messaging. Hey, don't be ashamed, there's definitely nothing wrong with keeping it vintage -- and, above all, saving cash.
