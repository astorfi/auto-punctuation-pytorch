If it's not the lure of delicious new gadgets, it's stone cold bribery. Either way, the reasons to stay slumped on the couch are evaporating quicker than the sweat off a runner's head. Adidas looks set to slay some more, too, as we've learned the sports giant is opening up its miCoach fitness-logging platform to third-parties. The as-yet announced set of developer tools could see your miCoach workouts incorporated into a whole new range of new apps. Nike did something similar a fair while ago with its Nike+ platform, something that helped apps like Lose It and MapMyFitness make use of the all that hard-earned NikeFuel. But, if you're a three stripes kinda gal/guy, then the idea of miCoach spreading its wings to find its way into, say, a life-logging app, or wellbeing tracker is probably just as appealing. Of course, there's still some new compatible hardware on its way, if you're still craving a bit of (calorie free) self indulgence.
