Ain’t nobody loves a good gimmick like we love a good gimmick — so move over iPod thumb, there’s a new extremity ailment in town.It’s called “blue thumb,” apparently, and Toronto’s Park Hyatt Toronto’s Stillwater Spahas just the thing you need: an $80 “BlackBerry Balm Hand Massage.” Yeah, you heard us. Basicallyit’s a hand massage with “BlackBerry Balm” (which we understand is a synthetic creme formulated frommelted down handhelds) for people who use their thumbs a lot. So basically it’s a hand massage. So basically P.T.Barnum was right.  [Via TechDirt]
