New iPhones mean new software to go with it. So, with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus going on sale soon, that means iOS 8 is on the way as well. Apple just confirmed the next-gen operating system will arrive next week, on September 17th, as a free download. In particular, you'll be able to download it for every iPhone from the 4s on, every iPad starting with the iPad 2 and the fifth-generation iPod touch.




Included in the update is Apple Pay, a new feature that allows iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users to make payments via NFC. Otherwise, not much has changed since we last saw iOS 8, back at WWDC in June. Key features still include interactive notifications, an improved mail app, Spotlight search, support for third-party keyboards, Apple's new HealthKit application, audio messages and improved integration with other Apple devices, like Macs. We'll have a review up at some point but of course, you can also just download it for yourself.
