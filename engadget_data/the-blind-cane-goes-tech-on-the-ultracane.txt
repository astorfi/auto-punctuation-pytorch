We can think of a few more interesting names for the UltraCane than "the UltraCane" (unfortunately, it seems like
they thought of and glossed over the "BatCane"), but no one's going to deny that that boring old teflon-tipped cane
could use an upgrade or ten. This guy's got echolocation sensors (yes, like a bat) that convey data haptically to the
grip on the handle, letting the user feel a map of upcoming obstacles. A little steep for £400 (about $770 US), but not
constantly getting dog dirt all over nice white cane might be reason enough to belly up—don't forget to charge that
battery!
