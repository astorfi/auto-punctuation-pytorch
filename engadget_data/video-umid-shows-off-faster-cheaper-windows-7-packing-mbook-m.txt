After all that it wasn't exactly well received thanks to a high price, a screen that didn't open far enough, and USB ports that sadly required dongles. UMID is now demoing the completely dongle-free M2, said to be ultimately available with your choice of either a 1.2 or 1.6GHz Intel Atom processor. Memory has been bumped up to 1GB to support Windows 7, the case has been tweaked, the hinge now opens further, and there's an optical "mouse" integrated into the bezel with a sensor on the right and two tiny mouse buttons on the left. A non-functional version is lovingly caressed after the break, while working models are said to ship before the year is up with prices starting at $499. Let's hope this one doesn't follow the same, circuitous path to retail that its predecessor did. [Via jkkmobile]
