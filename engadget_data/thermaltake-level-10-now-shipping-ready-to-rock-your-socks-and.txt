 
Thermaltake's Level 10 PC chassis, a 47-pound beautiful behemoth in every way, has completed its almost exactly 9-month march from a March design unveiling to a "now shipping" retail page on Newegg. At $849.99, it ain't cheap, but let's not forget what's really important here: it fits three Blu-ray writers. Happy shopping / minor debt!

[Thanks, Keenan]
