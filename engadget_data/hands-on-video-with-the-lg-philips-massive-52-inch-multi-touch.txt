The 1920 x 1080 screen rocks an interesting infrared image sensor to get data about hand placement and movement, and is capable of doing all kinds of gesture and area recognition from two separate touch points. Check the gallery to get a better view, and watch the video if you're excited about the prospect of a flipping, zooming Google Earth on a screen with multitouch.
