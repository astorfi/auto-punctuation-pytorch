We hope you really dig the 6-pounder's "onyx blue metallic" finish, as it's the only available color option at present. If you're still hanging with us, you'll find a 15.4-inch LCD, 1.66GHz T5500 Core 2 Duo CPU, a whole 2GB of RAM, a massive 200GB 4200RPM hard drive, dual-layer DVD burner, 802.11a/b/g, and even a fingerprint reader to boot. Toshiba apparently felt these impressive inclusions could cover up the lackluster Intel GMA 950 integrated graphics, missing Bluetooth, substandard XGA resolution, and the lack of gigabit Ethernet. Anyways, the machine does muster a nice selection of ports, including PCMCIA, ExpressCard, 5-in-1 flash reader, S-Video out, 4-pin FireWire, and a foursome of USB 2.0 ports. Presumably catering to media-centric buyers, Toshiba includes Windows XP Media Center Edition and a reported "4.22 hours of battery life" to watch at least a couple decent flicks while on the move. The snazzy blue A105-S4344 is currently available for $1,399.99 (after rebate).[Via Laptoping]
