The latest hit in the saga comes via GigaOM, who has confirmed with Tesla CEO Elon Musk that the Model X will finally -- finally -- see a public unveiling on February 9th. Details beyond that aren't yet known, but Musk seems adamant that the first paying customers will see theirs in "late 2013," with 15,000 units per year being pushed out starting in 2014. We'll let you know if get an invite, deal?
