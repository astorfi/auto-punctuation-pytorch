That aside, we're sure these new TRI-UA512 AXPC USB headphones are just peachy. It's always rather dubious to hear we're going to get "true" 5.1 surround sound out of a pair of cans, but with four speakers in each ear, things are going to get at least a tad bit directional. There's a removable mic included for VoIP or game chat on the quick, and an in-line volume adjustment doohickey has controls for all four speaker sets. Looks like you can grab one of these sets for $60-$80 at various online outlets, which isn't bad for what you're getting -- just don't expect to be blown away here, we won't.[Via I4U]
