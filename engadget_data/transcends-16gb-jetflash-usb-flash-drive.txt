 In addition to that 4GB SDHC card announced earlier, Transcend is also slipping us a big ol' USB flash drive today. Their 16GB JetFlash drive shares the stylings of their 8-gigger but doubles the capacity and increases read/write times to an impressive 25/20MB/s. Yeah, as usual, Transcend is not the first to reach 16GB, but at least they've arrived. Well almost anyway, 'cause without a ship date or knowing if this drive will sneak in for under a grand we just don't know how to feel right about now. Why you gotta treat us that way Transcend, why?[Via Impress]
