Here's some double-edged news, the significance of which depends on whether you just bought an Acer Iconia W3 or were holding off for something with better components. Acer spokeswoman Sterre Swank, quoted by Tweakers.net, has revealed that a successor to the pioneering eight-inch Windows 8 tablet will be out in September with a thinner, lighter build and possibly an upgraded IPS display. In other words, the existing model could be made obsolete within a few months of being on the market, and we're seeking confirmation of this directly from Acer.


Switching the display would certainly solve one the most serious gripes we raised in our review, but we don't know yet if there'll be an impact on the price tag, which stands at $380 for the W3. Also, as we get closer to the end of this year, it makes more sense to wait for Windows 8 tablets with next-gen Atom processors (known as Bay Trail), as the current Clover Trail chips are already straining under the weight of existing desktop applications.
