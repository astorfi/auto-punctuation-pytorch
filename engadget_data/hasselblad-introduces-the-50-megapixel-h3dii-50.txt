Building on the H3DII-39 back, the 50 features a 36 X 48mm Kodak sensor twice the size of other full-frame DSLR sensors that generates 300MB files at 1FPS. Pricing hasn't been announced, but don't expect this bad boy to come in under the $37K pricetag of the 39 when it launches in October -- especially since Hasselblad says anyone who buys a 39 now can trade up to the 50 later for the difference in price and instructions on how to properly sleep on beds made of money.[Thanks, Douglas]
