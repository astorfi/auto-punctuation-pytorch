As of right now, iTunes 9.0.2 is available via Software Update, and with that comes compatibility with Apple TV 3.0, an "improved look and feel," and an easier-to-explore iTunes Store. Hop on past the break for the full changelog, and feel free to get your download on now if you're still not scared of blindly installing software from Cupertino.

Update: Looks like it killed Pre sync -- now, act like you're surprised!
