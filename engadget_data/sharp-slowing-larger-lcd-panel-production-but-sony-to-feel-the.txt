Sharp however hasn't verified these claims and dutifully reiterated its expectations to meet sales forecasts for the fiscal year of 2010. If true though, the decision is unlikely to affect production of Sharp's own panels anyway, since they're made at the Kameyama plant in Mie Prefecture, which in contrast to 2008, will supposedly maintain its current production rates. Instead, other TV manufacturers like Sony will experience the pinch, as a result of billion dollar joint venture deal inked last year, which moved production of their 40-inch and above panels to the Sakai facility in question. Philosophically though, if a few less Bravia panels roll off the production line, and no recession-burdened consumer is around to mourn them, would we even care?
