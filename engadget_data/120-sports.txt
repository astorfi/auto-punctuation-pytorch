Dubbed 120 Sports, the newly announced channel is a collaboration between the MLB, NBA, NHL, NASCAR and Time Inc., with the general goal being to deliver video content to fans in a speedy manner and all day long. Unlike the NFL's Now network, 120 Sports' bread and butter will be two-minute segments, which it plans to use for news, highlights and analysis as well as original stories -- sorry, no live games (one day!). Along with being able to stream from the desktop site, there will also be apps for smartphones, tablets and more "connected devices." But here's the best news: Once 120 Sports launches this spring, you won't need a pay-TV subscription to access it.
