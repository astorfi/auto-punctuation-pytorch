 The big company'slittle camera division that could has been doing it over and over for years now, and CNET Asia caught a preview oftheir new DMC-TZ1, thesmallest 10x optical digital camera around. They seemed to find the 5 megapixel shooter's OIS and pixel binned 1600 ISOto be decentÂ  (despite the expected exaggerated noise at higher ISOs, of course), and its travel functions useful-- though its unique folded optics design seemed to impair zoom-in time, and the TZ1's removable lens cap raised aneyebrow or two. CNET still seemed to find it "very good," though, so being that it's a straight up point andshoot, if you're cool going without manual camera functions this thing might just be in your future.[Via DP Blog]
