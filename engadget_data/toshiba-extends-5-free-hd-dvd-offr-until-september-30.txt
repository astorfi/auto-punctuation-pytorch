 We are shocked, SHOCKED to find out that not only does giving away movies and lowering prices increase HD DVD hardware and software sales, but now Toshiba has announced it is extending its "The Perfect Offer" of five free HD DVDs from a selection of 15, via mail-in with the purchase of any Toshiba HD DVD player. Originally set to run through July, the promotion has been extended until September 30th, so you might be able to find out if that Harry Potter box set has any HDi special features before choosing a side in the format war. Still, with the base HD-A2 player at a price of $299 and several free movies in the mix, Toshiba's certainly hoping to grab the attention of remaining fence sitters and current Blu-ray owners alike.
