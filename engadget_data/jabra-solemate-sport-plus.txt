Jabra's Solemate was a sneaker-themed alternative to Jawbone's Jambox, and now the company wants to hoover up those customers who want a slightly smaller Bluetooth speaker. The Solemate Mini promises all of the usual acoustic bells-and-whistles despite only being the size of a coke can, packing an eight-hour battery as well as a line-in, Bluetooth and NFC connections. Users will able to pick one up in a choice of red, yellow blue or black -- color choices that'll also come to the bigger model in short order. At the same time, the company is upgrading its Sport headphones with a shock-and-sweat-proof design as well as an FM radio. The Solemate Mini will launch globally for Â£99 (we expect dollar prices to be in the same ballpark), while the Sport+ earphones will retail for $79.99 with three months' free subscription to Endomondo Premium thrown in as a happy little extra.
