 Though you maybe in a heap of trouble with your home town rag and residents, oh five teenage girls from Portage County, Ohio, wesalute you and your April Fool's prank: dropping or suspending seventeen Mario Bros. question cubesaround town. Now, granted, if we saw something like that on April first in our fair city of New York, it might seem alot more commonplace than Ravenna, Ohio, but the point still stands -- if you think Al Qaeda ever played SMB, you'veprobably forgotten that those games inspire the good in people, remember? The controller smashing huffy puffy videogame addicted 11 year old good in people, in fact. Unfortunately that didn't stop the HAZMAT and Fire Departmentcrews from stepping in to defuse the situation, so to speak, and for it the five girls could face serious criminalcharges. Too bad, because if those guys would have just jumped up and hit them from beneath they might instead havewalked away with a sweet power-up (or an extra man).[Via Joystiq]
