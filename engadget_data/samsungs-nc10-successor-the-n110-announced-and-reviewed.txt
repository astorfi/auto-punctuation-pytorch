From what we can tell this new N110 is mainly a style refresh, offering the same keyboard 1.6GHz Atom N270 processor, memory, and storage of the NC10, as well as the bigger battery and more usable touchpad the company added to the recent special edition -- now clad in a sophisticated, red-rimmed, matte exterior. With battery life topping eight hours in real-world usage, and a price of $469, this one picks up where its predecessor left off and seems like a good choice for those who want a little more style with their netbooking -- or who are too impatient to wait for the NC20.
