In addition to that teaser image, oh-so-beautiful FCC shot, and mistakenly-posted specs page, CNET's uncovered this pic of the rectangular netbook with its lid open. We can't really tell if the machine pictured has that crazy 8-inch 1600 x 768 display we'd heard about, but there's a lot of the VAIO TT in those lines -- so much so we're wondering if it's a 'shop, albeit a super-hot one. Of course, there's no word on pricing, but we're hoping it's somewhere close to reasonable -- we'll find out in just a couple weeks at CES.Update: We knew it looked a little too much like the TT -- it's a 'shop. Oh well, at least we can dream.
