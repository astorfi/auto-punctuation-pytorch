       There is currently an FCC mandate in effect that requiresall Cable companies to provide their customers a STB with a functional 1394 (FireWire) port on request. This mandatewas agreed to by the Cable companies (yes they all signed it) and went into effect on April 1st, 2004. Backthen I tried to get one and let me tell you, it wasn't easy. Shortly after another Tampa resident called the CEO ofAdvance/Newhouse Communications, (the parent company of Bright House Networks) the boxes became available.
      

 

This box lead me to write the article "how to record via 1394 using Windows XP".Not too long after that I bought an HD TiVo and gave my SA3250HD with functional 1394 port back. Recently I discoveredit was possible to use a 1394 equipped STB to record with Windows Media Center. I decided to give it a try so I couldstream cablechannels to my Xbox360. Before you ask, 5C ruined my plans.I headed down to the Bright House Networksoffice to get a STB. I was disappointed by how difficult it was to get a STB with a functional 1394 port, even thoughit's been almost two years since the mandate went into effect. Am I theonly one or do all the cable companies make it this difficult?
