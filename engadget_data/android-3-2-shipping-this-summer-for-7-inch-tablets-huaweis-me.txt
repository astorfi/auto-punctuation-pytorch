 We knew that Android 3.2 was little more than a tailor-made edition of Android 3.1 for 7-inch slates, but even after speaking with Huawei, we weren't exactly sure when it would be rolling out to things other than its own MediaPad. Our pals over at This is my next managed to confirm that it'll be landing as early as this summer, and for better or worse, it'll be the last major Android release prior to Ice Cream Sandwich hitting retail devices in Q4. Moreover, it's bruited that v3.2 will bring support for Qualcomm CPUs as well as NVIDIA's Tegra 2 chipset, which could lead to HTC's Flyer getting an upgrade of its own. As for more current plans, it seems as if the Motorola Xoom -- a slate that was just recently updated to 3.1 -- will see another point increase in the coming weeks, which should give us a solid indication of what to expect software-wise with the MediaPad drops a few months later. Speaking of which, both CNET and M.I.C. Gadget were on-hand in Singapore for a look at the show-floor model of that very tablet, and you can feast your eyes on the pictorial proof down in the source links below.
