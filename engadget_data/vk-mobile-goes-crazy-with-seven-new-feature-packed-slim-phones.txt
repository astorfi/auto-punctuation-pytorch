The VK200 nearly unabashedly steals its keypad fromthe SLVR, but things get moreinteresting with the 4 megapixel shooting VK2200 and of course the VK7000. This last one manages UMTS, dual cameras(1.3 megapixel and VGA), and a microMMC slot all in a 0.4-inch thick form -- and looks pretty sexy to boot. We tip ourhats to you VK, and to your lawyers.
