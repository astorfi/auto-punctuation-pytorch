 
After a massive promotional push, Monsters vs. Aliens early results are promising, with an estimated $58.2 million box office take over its opening weekend, 56% of that from people viewing the movie in 3D. Still, after dropping $175 million on worldwide promotions alone, you can bet Dreamworks Animation is expecting a bit more in the future to justify its investment, and carry over to its future films, which, if you haven't forgotten will all be in 3D. Early reviews gave the 3D effects a much better rating than the Super Bowl ad, so let us know, was it enough to get your family in the theater this weekend or anytime in the future?
