Sony was entirely absent from Europe's annual Gamescom tradeshow last month, but the electronics juggernaut isn't going to sit out the premiere event on its home soil, the Tokyo Game Show. In fact, the outfit wants everyone to watch it tonight during a livestream. The keynote's scheduled for an English broadcast and we've embedded the live player right below. What can we expect come 3AM ET? Probably an update on how many PlayStation 4 consoles the company's moved since it last announced that 20 million number, and maybe even a hard release date for the console's big 3.0 system software patch.



Oh and probably a lot of info about third-party games because that's what Sony tends to do at these types of things. Could a hard street date and price for Project Morpheus happen? There's a possibility, but the company has to save something for Paris Games Week. However! It won't be too long before we all find out together.

*An earlier version of this article noted the stream started at 2 am. It has been corrected to reflect this.
