 
It was at last year's CES that we first got our hands on iRobot's Looj, and while easy gutter cleaning is something most homeowners can appreciate, the thing did have some issues that left many users tossing the things out with the decomposing crud it was supposed to fling. Enter the Looj second generation, which includes a flexible auger that should keep the thing from flipping itself over, a tool-free battery door, and a faster reverse speed to get the thing back to your ladder in half the time. Nothing revolutionary, but some much-needed updates that will be available this spring for $129, and we were impressed with the sheer spite the thing displayed against a mock gutter full of faux leaves.
