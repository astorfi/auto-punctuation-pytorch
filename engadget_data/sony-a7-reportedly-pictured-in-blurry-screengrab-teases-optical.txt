Remember that full-frame mirrorless shooter Sony's expected to release? Sony Alpha Rumors claims to have found an (admittedly low resolution) image of the fabled camera. The blurry shot shows a little more than half of the rumored camera's face, teasing undefined outlines of the device's control wheels, as well as a protruding bump that could hide an traditional viewfinder. The rig looks a bit like a mash up between Sony's A900 and the mirrorless NEX-7, borrowing elements from both designs. The camera is rumored to launch later this month, and is expected to come in 24- and 36-megapixel variants (respectively called the A7 and A7r).
