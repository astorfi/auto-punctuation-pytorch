As the name suggests, the device will let you dust off your collection of Huey Lewis and the News cassettes and enjoy 'em in spruced up digital form. What's more, those looking to revive the art of the mix tape can use to system to make as many copies as they like, with settings available for both metal and CrO2 type tapes. According to Digital Lifestyles, UK retailer Firebox will be offering the device for "just under Â£100" (or $204) sometime before the end of the year, although we presume it'll also be available elsewhere. Still no word on a USB 8-track deck though.[Thanks, Simon]
