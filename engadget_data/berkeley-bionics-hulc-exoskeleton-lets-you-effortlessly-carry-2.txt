HULC not only increases your human payload, but it also "decreases [your] metabolic cost". In other words, it seems Berkeley Bionics developed this thing for extremely lazy people, those who lose their breath easily, or for those on what they call "long duration missions". This is no joke, though -- the company is taking orders for the suit already.[Via Switched]
