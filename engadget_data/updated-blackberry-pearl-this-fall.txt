 Though we're still not convinced SureType is worth the trouble (especially when beauts like the new Curve are kicking around), rumor has it RIM is hard at work on the 8100 Pearl's successor, the aptly-numbered 8120. Expect features to include a 2 megapixel camera (up from the Pearl's 1.3 megapixel unit), integrated GPS, and the long-overdue WiFi support RIM's been spouting off about as of late. If this all pans out, we can apparently expect Canada's Rogers -- a GSM carrier with 3G capabilities -- to get it in September of this year with an unnamed US carrier grabbing it a week before that in black, red, "titanium," blue, and gold.
