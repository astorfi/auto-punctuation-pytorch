The long-awaited (by someone, we're sure)
ESPN-branded cellphone service is now scheduled to launch
during the Superbowl, next February. Best Buy has been tagged as the exclusive retailer to carry phones for the new
service for its first 60 days, while online signups will be available via the Mobile ESPN web site (the service was
originally branded ESPN Mobile, but the name was flipped last month in order to "truly reflects the service's ultimate
mission: to literally serve avid sports fans with one-touch, real-time access to immersive and personalized sports
content from ESPN."). Mobile ESPN is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), with the actual service to be provided
by Sprint, with the initial handset to be produced by
Sanyo.
