 Ever wished you could reproduce those super-slow-motion shots taken by the pros. Now you can, with a catch. Casio's new EX-F1 can record full motion video at 1200fps. That's enough frames to catch water droplets fall in unbelievably detailed flight. Unfortunately, the EX-F1 scales things back to a tiny 336x96 resolution at that full 1200fps. Still, the results are startling even when set at 300fps (with the bonus of a much higher resolution) when compared to a typical camera's 30fps recordings. See for yourself after the break.
