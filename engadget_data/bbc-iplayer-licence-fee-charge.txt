The BBC's budget is getting squeezed, and as such, everyone who uses its service is going to be made to pay up. Lord Hall, the BBC's Director-General, has announced that he's pushing to close the famous iPlayer Loophole, adding around £72 million to the corporation's budget. Currently, only Britons who watch live broadcasts on TV or online have to pay the £145.50 annual fee -- but around 500,000 homes avoid the charge by only watching shows after they've aired. The move will require approval from government, but we can't see it resisting -- the other option to save money is to axe BBC Four, and that just won't do.
