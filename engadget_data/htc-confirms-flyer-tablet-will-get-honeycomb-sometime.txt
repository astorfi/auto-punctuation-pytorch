It's now finally chimed in on the matter again, however, and replied to a question on Twitter by saying that it "will be offering a Honeycomb upgrade when it's made available." Of course, that statement's noticeably lacking a specific date (or even a hint of one), and it may well be wise to not hold your breath for an upgrade anytime soon given Google's recent talk of a tighter grip on Honeycomb. Still, it looks like it's definitely still on the table as far as HTC is concerned.
