There aren't many details (like price, release date and internals), but we do know it's running one of those new Tegra 2 chips. Up front there's a pretty nice 10-inch capacitive display, which is plenty responsive. Like other tablets we've been seeing, the device is a bit thicker and heavier than we'd like, but hopefully that paves the way for some substantial battery life. We might still not know the "why," but the "how" is certainly coming together.
