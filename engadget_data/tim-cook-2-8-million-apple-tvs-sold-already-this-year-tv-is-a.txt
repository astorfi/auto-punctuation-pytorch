 
 Still pontificating onstage at D10, Apple CEO Tim Cook was inevitably queried by Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg about the ongoing Apple TV rumors, though for now he only referred to the company's existing set-top box. He revealed that Apple sold 2.8 million of the hockey pucks last year and has already moved 2.7 million in 2012. As Steve Jobs did repeatedly before him, he mentioned that TV is something "many people would say that this is an area of their life that they aren't pleased with" and explained Apple's key questions: Can we control the key technology? Can we make a significant contribution beyond what others have done in this area? Will this product be one that we want?

 Walt pressed for more info and even dug into the Apple TV's limited content offerings, but Cook quickly shut things down (to knowing laughs from the audience) without revealing any plans for a TV set, IPTV service or anything else. He did however say that he doesn't think Apple "has to own a content business", as Netflix, Amazon and Google are developing, indicating that it hasn't had an issue (for the most part) getting content.
