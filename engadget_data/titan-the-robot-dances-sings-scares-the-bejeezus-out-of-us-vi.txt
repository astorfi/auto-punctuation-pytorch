Well, we won't spoil it for you. Let's just say that at eight feet tall (and with tons of menace) we have to wonder if Titan the Robot could be stopped should some sort of cinematic "glitch" should cause him to "freak out" amongst the onlookers at Dubai's GITEX 2009. Like most man-made disasters, this one starts innocently enough: with a show-stopping rendition of a Paul Anka tune. Curious? Peep it after the break. Just make sure you don't get close.
