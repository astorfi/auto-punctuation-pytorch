While we already knew that Verizon slipped support for AWS-based LTE into its edition of the Galaxy S 4, it didn't say how those extra frequencies would come alive. The carrier's Mike Haberman has just cleared the air(waves): he tells Bloomberg that Samsung's flagship will get a software update to support AWS bands. Haberman hasn't said when the patch will arrive, although it's contingent on the higher-capacity 4G network rolling out in the next few months. The GS4 isn't likely to be alone, whatever the timing. The Nokia Lumia 928 also supports AWS, and we've reached out to learn if and when the higher-tiered Windows Phone will get an upgrade to reach its full potential.
