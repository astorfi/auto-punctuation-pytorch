First up is the 22-inch VX2265wm LCD, announced last year and sounding quite similar to the Samsung 2233RZ from yesterday. It's a 1680 x 1050, 120Hz panel with a 2ms response rate, enabling it to tackle the quick cycling that will be required to reproduce a 3D image. The other addition to the line is the PJD6220-3D DLP projector, an updated (or at least renamed) version of the company's existing PJD6220, illuminating 1024 x 768 pixels at 120Hz and a respectable contrast ratio of 2000:1. The projector is due next month for $1,499, while the VX2265wm drops in the next few weeks for a rather more reasonable $399 -- another stat that happens to match Samsung's offering.
