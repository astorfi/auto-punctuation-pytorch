Windows 10, the new operating system from Microsoft, will be available as a free upgrade for one year after launch for current Windows 8.1, Windows 7 and Windows Phone 8.1 users.

"I'm very excited to announce that for the first year after Windows 10 is available we will be making available a free upgrade to Windows 10," Microsoft EVP of Operating Systems Terry Myerson said during a conference today.

For anyone gaming on Windows, this means one fewer roadblock to keeping that library current. Xbox will receive "core components" of Windows 10 in an update this year, and Microsoft is poised to deliver Xbox news during today's conference.



Great to have Xbox/Gaming in a Windows event today. Make sure you stay watching until the end of show, cool stuff there. #Windows10
