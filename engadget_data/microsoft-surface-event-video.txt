We thoroughly covered this morning's Microsoft Surface event, but the company opted not to livestream it through its own channel. That doesn't mean the folks from Redmond didn't bring a camera crew to capture the entire thing, however, and now the resulting footage is available through the magic of internet streaming technology. If you want to hear every word Microsoft had to say (and see every detail) about the latest and greatest Surfaces, head here to take advantage of the opportunity.
