Said document simply (and ominously) shows "Launch Delay" in the N75's row, indicating that S60 fans could be in for more of a wait to get their US 3G on -- as if they haven't waited long enough already. Let's end this little tid bit on a bright note, though, shall we? There's a red variant of the Pearl in the pipe, which may very well make for RIM's least business-oriented product yet (our apologies if your original black and gray piece is starting to look a little drab now). No word on a launch date there either, but we're guessing -- nay, hoping -- that there are fewer technical hurdles involved with the color changed than with the N75.
