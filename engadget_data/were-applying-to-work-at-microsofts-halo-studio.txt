Into the ground, perhaps, but a run nonetheless, one characterized by reams of poorly composed text, startlingly accurate self-deprecation and the uncanny ability to be simultaneously biased for and against everything ever. And to think, all we had to do was sit around in our underwear and furiously mash the keyboard with our palms.As we've proven to be quite adept at this activity, we've decided to redirect it towards the very similar career of creating video games. In fact, Microsoft's Careers site has just alerted us to the company's yearning for a "technical and highly talented program manager" in "Microsoft's new Halo Studio." We've played Halo quite a lot, actually, so we're sure our skills will be more than "instrumental in helping to lead the development of the engine that will power future experiences for the next generation of gaming platforms." Right, so Halo 4 for the NextBox 360. Easy.Alright, so our "expertise with DirectX, Xbox SDK, leading content-creation packages, or other games-related technology, or a track-record in shipping technically challenging entertainment titles" might not be ... there ... and we might not describe ourselves as "highly-motivated self-starters," but ... uh. Maybe this isn't for us after all. We'll just throw together a few reams of poorly composed text about it instead.[Via Gameguru. Thanks, Sameer]
