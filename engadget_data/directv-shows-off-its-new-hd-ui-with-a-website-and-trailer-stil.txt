 

That slick, speedy new interface DirecTV recently pushed out to beta testers is officially getting hyped with a new landing page and (unfortunately not embeddable) video trailer. It advertises all the features we'd heard about, including the facelifted HD graphics, "lightning fast" scrolling, visual browsing experience and personalized recommendations. The HD UI is still without a release date however, and while we'd probably put it it ahead of the DirecTiVo on the company's current priority list, let's not forget who we're dealing with here. Hit the source link for the orientation materials, there will be a quiz later.

Update: You can now view the video here, embedded after the break, thanks to our friend Dave Zatz!
