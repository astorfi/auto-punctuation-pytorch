Did you recently grab a 360-degree camera like the Bublcam or Ricoh Theta? You'll have an easy way to show off your all-encompassing footage very shortly. A YouTube spokesperson has confirmed to both Engadget and Gizmodo that its service will be adding support for 360-degree videos in the "coming weeks." It's not clear what the technical limitations are, but the update will undoubtedly require a way to pan around those videos -- this isn't simply a matter of raising the ceiling on file sizes. However it works, you can expect to see a lot of immersive online cinema in the near future.
