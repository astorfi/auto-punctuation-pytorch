 Looking for candidness? We aren't too sure we believe these numbers, but a new writeup from Hollywood Reporter has it that Blu-ray Disc sales in the United Kingdom are up a mind-melting 396% for the year to date. Yep, 1.5 million units have been moved, which -- if accurate -- gives a clear indication of just how quickly consumers on that side of the pond are siding with Blu in this post-format war world. Purportedly, the figures were derived from the British Video Association, and the report with this nugget also had data regarding the upward trends in both DVD sales and theater attendance. But hey, when there's all of five or so HD channels to watch, it's not too shocking to see citizens get their high-def fix via another method.[Via GameFocus, image courtesy of WikInvest]
