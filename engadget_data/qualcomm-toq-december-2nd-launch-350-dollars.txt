Where mobile devices are concerned, Qualcomm's normally a behind-the-scenes player, but that's all set to change next month. The company has announced that its Toq smartwatch is coming to the market on December 2nd. Big Q had said that it would knock out a limited run of the hardware back in September, but unlike other next-gen wearables, this one wouldn't be limited to a select few. Packing a Mirasol display, wireless charging and stereo Bluetooth audio, the Toq will set you back $350 -- assuming that you haven't already spent that amount of cash on its most immediate rival.
