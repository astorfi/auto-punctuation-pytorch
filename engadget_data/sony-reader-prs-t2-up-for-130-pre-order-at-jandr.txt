J&R's pre-order page reveals that the 6-inch touchscreen WiFi-only device is packing a 800 x 600 E-Ink display, a battery promising two months life and a built-in stylus. Software options include six dictionaries, Evernote Clearly, Facebook for Reader and a free copy of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The electronics superstore has the device listed as "coming soon," and when it arrives, will set you back $130 -- but, as its write-up notes, that's the price you pay to avoid being bothered with adverts.
