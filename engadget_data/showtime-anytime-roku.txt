If you subscribe to Showtime, you'll now be able to watch Homeland on your Roku. Previously only available for mobile and desktop, the Showtime Anywhere app gives you access to both current and past episodes of the premium cable's original series, including Dexter, House of Lies and Nurse Jackie, in addition to live broadcasts. A "my list" feature lets you organize your favorite programs, and the app lets you resume watching where you left off on another device.


Roku shared this news on its blog today, complete with a list of which providers will get access to the Showtime Anytime app: AT&T U-verse, Brighthouse, Cablevision's Optimum TV, DirecTV, Time Warner Cable, Verizon FiOS and "more to come." (Missing from that list, of course, is Comcast, which is poised to acquire Time Warner.) Current Showtime subscribers can add the channel through their Roku accounts.
