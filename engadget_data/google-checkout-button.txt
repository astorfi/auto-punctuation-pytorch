Google has just made shopping on your Android phone much easier. The folks in Mountain View have outed a new Checkout button that enables one-click purchases. Instead of having to shuffle through a litany of steps to pick up that next birthday gift, you'll only need to tap once, then confirm the payment info via Google Wallet and shipping details in order to complete a shopping session on your mobile device. Of course, this will also allow users to avoid the headache of having to input payment info in each site where they want to make a purchase.
