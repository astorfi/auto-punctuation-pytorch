 Alright everyone, calmyourselves, we have some news: not a year and a couple of weeks since the day we first wrote about the Nabaztag, it's found a USdistributor. You'll never guess who's picked it up, too. Ok, ok, we'll tell you, it's ThinkGeek. We know, you'reprobably hyperventilating right now, especially if you were the intended recipient of a WiFi rabbit from Engadget's Valentine's Day gift guide, butgot flimflammed out getting it because it was previously only available from French sites. Well, it's time to put up afuss, because this thing'll set you or your kind, gift giving significant other back $150 -- about right, includinginterest, if they never got you anything for Vday. Bienvenue en Am√©rique, lapin.[Thanks,Veronica]
