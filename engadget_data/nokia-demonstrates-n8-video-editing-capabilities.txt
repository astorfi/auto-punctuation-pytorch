Of the two, the video editor seems to be the most impressive -- it'll let you add both photos and videos to a storyboard, trim clips, and add and customize titles and transitions, to name a few features, and do so with what seems to be a relatively simple to use interface. You'll also of course be able to take advantage of the N8's support for USB On-The-Go, which will let you pull photos and videos off of any USB drive if you need to edit video in a pinch. Head on past the break for the complete video demonstration.
