As the image above so clearly shows, a Nike+ compatible heart rate monitor could be on the way, and it'll function exclusively with Cupertino's only camera-toting iPod. AppleInsider was told that the product launch was actually scheduled for yesterday, but it was held up for reasons unknown and may not ship until 3058. Too bad -- we just know that you were waiting for this very device to start your workout regimen. Ah well, what's another dozen months of kicking back and ingesting Ho Hos, right?
