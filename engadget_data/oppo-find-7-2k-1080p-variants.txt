You may cringe at this "Find 7 [are] coming" line, but it's actually an intentional typo, as Oppo's releasing its Find 5 follow-up with two screen resolutions. You see, back in December, the Chinese company teased that its next flagship phone will be using JDI's (not LG's) 5.5-inch 2,560 x 1,440 (538 ppi) panel, which is even sharper than the 6-inch counterpart on the Vivo Xplay 3S. Then to confuse us, earlier this week a Find 7 benchmark showed up on GFXBench with a 1080p display instead, along with a Snapdragon 800 SoC and Android 4.3.


We've since checked with our own sources, and we can now confirm that said device will indeed be offered with more than one display option to please everyone: 2K aka Quad HD for the spec chasers, and 1080p for the humble users. We also understand that other specs may differ between the two versions, so if all goes well, we'll take a closer look at the Find 7 variants in Beijing's 798 Art Zone on March 19th.
