Today, however, the application's reached version three-dot-oh, which means there's a slew of new goodies in tow. Among some of the fresh features is an all-new guide for television shows, movies and sports that's solely based on personal preferences, while recommendations, clips and related articles have also been added in this new version. That's not it, though, GetGlue now lets folks set alerts for upcoming events, as well as earn "stickers" for watching their favorite content -- think badges on FourSquare. Best of all, the iPad app's still free of charge, so anyone interested in v3.0 can give the App Store link below a quick tap to get on with the gratis download.
