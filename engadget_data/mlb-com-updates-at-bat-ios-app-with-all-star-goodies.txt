Even the most ardent baseball fans have to admit it's a long season. So it's perhaps wise that MLB.com has just trotted out an update for its At Bat iOS app just before the All-Star break, all the better to get you in the mood for the more interesting second half. First off, it'll let you access the All-Star week hoopla like the home run derby and the game itself. You'll also get new tweaks like in-progress game highlights and custom MLB news push notifications, while iPhone users will see a brand new UI and real-time game day data. All that should carry you into the playoff stretch and the next update, assuming MLB.com follows form from last year -- at which point, hopefully your team's still in the mix.
