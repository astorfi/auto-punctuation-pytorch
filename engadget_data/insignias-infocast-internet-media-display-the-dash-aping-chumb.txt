Sure enough it's now available online, and is also sitting on a shelf at every local store we checked, meaning this is perhaps the quickest and easiest way to get your cuddle-free Chumby on. At $169 it's $30 less than the Dash, meaning it makes a little more sense than Sony's option, but whether or not it's actually good value depends on just how smart you need your alarm clock to be.
