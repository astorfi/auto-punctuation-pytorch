       We got live and personal with the Neuros OSD unit, which is currently in "beta," but should have some decent software capabilities once those open source whiz kids work their magic. There's nothing much to see as far as the unit itself, but it's not too bad in the looks department, and should be small enough to sneak into most home theaters unnoticed. You know the drill, more pics after the break.
