 After launching a line of Intel packing VivoBook's, Asus is letting AMD in on the action with a  Trinity APU A8-4555M-powered model that's just scored an FCC ticket to ride. The 1.55 kg (3.41 lb), 13.3-inch, 1920 x 1080 multitouch model looks to be targeted to the multimedia crowd with a 128GB SSD, 500GB HDD, 4GB max RAM, 720p camera, Bluetooth 4.0 and Bang & Olufsen ICEpower sound tech. It's already popped up in Europe for around â‚¬900 ($1,150) and appears to be headed to India now, but there's no indication if or when US AMD lovers may be able to grab one.
