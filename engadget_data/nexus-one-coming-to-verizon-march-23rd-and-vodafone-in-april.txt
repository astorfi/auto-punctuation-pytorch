Without further ado, today we've got whispers care of Neowin that the recently-FCC'd CDMA device is launching on Verizon's network March 23rd, perfect timing for the beginning of CTIA. And while that fits pretty neatly into that initial "Spring 2010" launch window, there's really no way for us to corroborate at this point other than just taking their word for it. You can wait diligently, can't ya?
