We've naturally heard all about the phone already from dubious sources, and even reviewed the purported device, but now that they've got one in hand up on a stage, we suppose we'll have to set aside all of our doubts. So, the nitty gritty: 3.7-inch AMOLED display, 1GHz Snapdragon processor, compass, GPS, accelerometer, light and proximity sensor, 5 megapixel camera with LED flash, 3.5mm headphone jack, and a multicolored LED under the trackball. There are also two mics onboard, one on the bottom and one on the back, for the purpose of noise cancellation Ã  la Motorola's CrystalTalk, and the phone is naturally running the brand new Android 2.1. The phone is actually HTC branded, unlike the pre-release versions we've seen, and can be custom engraved with two lines of text at the time of order, for that extra personal touch (there's a picture of the phone's back after the break). The phone is available today off contract with a T-Mobile compatible radio for $529 unlocked, shipping to the US, UK, Singapore and Hong Kong, or with a two year T-Mobile US contract for $179 (both with free overnight shipping in the US). Most surprisingly, the phone is also headed to Verizon this Spring, and Vodafone will score the device eventually as well.

Update: Tony couldn't resist, and he managed to capture each step of the checkout process while ordering an unlocked Nexus One today. Hit up the gallery below if you're into that whole "living vicariously" thing. Thanks, Tony!
