Xbox Music landed on iOS with a big splash, but the absence of offline playback hurt its appeal for frequent flyers and anyone else whose internet access isn't guaranteed. That won't be a problem now that Microsoft has updated the app with offline support. Tunesters just have to flick a virtual switch to cache playlists for listening in any situation. The move won't lure subscribers away from rival services that have had offline playback for a while, but it's hard to object to a little more convenience for Xbox Music loyalists.


Update: Nearly a week later, Microsoft has rolled out offline playback support to Android users as well.
