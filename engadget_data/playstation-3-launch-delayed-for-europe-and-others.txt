 Oh man, not again. Sony just announced that the European launch of the PlayStation 3 will be delayed. So instead of seeing a worldwide launch of the PS3 in early November which nobody really expected anyway, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, Africa, and "Australasia" will see the console shipping in March. Sony blames the delay on production issues with blue laser diodes needed for the Blu-ray (and HD DVD) Disc drives. Stockholders, beware.UPDATE: According to Kaz Hirai, the production issues with the blue laser diodes will also mean that North America and Japan can only expect 500,000 units at launch. As a result, Sony has officially reduced its estimate of 4 million consoles shipped by the end of calendar year 2006 to a more conservative 2 million. [Via Joystiq]
