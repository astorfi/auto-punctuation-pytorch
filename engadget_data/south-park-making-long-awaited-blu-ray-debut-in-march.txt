For the first time ever, the calloused crew will be seen on Blu-ray format when the Complete Twelfth Season BD launches day-and-date with the DVD set in March 2009. All 14 uncensored episodes will be presented on a three-disc set, with each in 1080p and boasting Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround sound. Sadly, we're still waiting to hear an MSRP and whether any of the prior seasons will follow suit on BD, but there's a good chance that studio execs are waiting on sales numbers from this one to determine the latter.
