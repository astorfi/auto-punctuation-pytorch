Say it ain't so! Apparently the next bond film, Casino Royale, will do without an older, more distinguished Bond
(he'll be a spritely 28) but more importantly—brace yourself—it's going to go off without Q and his gadgets. Seriously,
they're writing Q out of this one. The film's screenwriter, Paul Haggis, is calling this a Bond "reinvention," but a
007 flick without Q's toys, that's like a day without sunshine, or like an Engadget post about an upcoming movie… just
plain wrong.
