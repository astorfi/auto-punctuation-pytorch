Line is updating its iOS app with a trio of features designed to keep you nestled to the free messaging service for as long as it can. The biggest addition is an in-app browser, which negates the need to switch over to Safari (etc) when someone shares a link. Users will also discover German, Italian and Portuguese language support, not to mention a choice of themes -- including a tasteful pink version that'll sit well with your smartphone, game console and sports car.
