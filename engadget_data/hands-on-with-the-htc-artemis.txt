So we were stoked and all about the HTC Artemis that was due out, but it wasn't anything keeping us up at night. But then we got our hands on one last night, and it was way thinner and sleeker than we'd imagined, especially for a GPS-equipped handheld. That scroll wheel felt just like a Sansa e-series (except even more solid), and dabbed in the middle was a scroll ball a la the SideKick 3 and Pearl. It was a little overwhelming, but we can understand their need to overcompensate for input options when not equipping it with a keyboard. Oh, and do click on for some more shots.
