Now, just in time to satisfy your sweet tooth for Halloween, Verizon decides to drop the White Chocolate this coming Tuesday with the following pricing: Full Retail $360, one year $230, and two year (yikes!) contract it's $180. Not too bad until you figure out the only thing different about this is the color -- and according to the spec sheet, it doesn't even come with the speakerphone update. Bad Verizon, bad.
