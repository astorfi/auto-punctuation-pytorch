Thanks to a keen set of eyes (and an overly-eager Sony Ericsson employee), we present SE's latest unreleased Xperia, the Acro -- a refinement to its recent Gingerbread-wielding Arc that you most certainly weren't meant to see. Duplicating the core specs of its sibling, Sony's future stuntman takes it a step further, performing infrared and NFC communication, while also showcasing its DTV reception skills -- you know, so the locals can get their fill of zany game shows on the commute. Like its kin, the Arc features a 1GHz Snapdragon MSM8255, 4.2-inch display and an 8.1 megapixel Exmor R sensor, just like the one you may or may not see in future iPhones. Even though the TV function is decidedly intriguing, we know you're just considering beaming bits of IrDA glory to your graphing calculator. Hey, there's no shame in that.

Update: Based on the model number, we're pretty sure the Acro is destined for KDDI's au brand.

[Thanks, Chris]
