Today, the company is growing its E-mount family of lenses by three, now offering a total of seven compatible lenses. Shipping in October, the Carl Zeiss SonnarT E will take the helm as Sony's flagship optic, delivering a 24mm fixed focal length and f/1.8 aperture, with a minimum focus distance of 16 cm and a sky-high $999 price tag. Also packing a speedy f/1.8 aperture, the $300 E 50mm OSS doesn't sport Carl Zeiss branding, but it does include built-in image stabilization and a circular aperture, promising smooth defocus. Both lenses will ship in December. Hitting stores in October, a new telephoto lens, the $350 E 55-210mm compensates for its sluggish f/4.5-6.3 maximum aperture with optical image stabilization while offering 3.8x magnification. And finally, Sony's LA-EA2 A-mount adapter lets you use your full-size Alpha lenses with the NEX cameras without losing functionality, thanks to built-in Translucent Mirror Technology and a dedicated AF motor. NEX-3, NEX-5, and NEX-C3 owners will need a firmware update to take advantage of the adaptor, but if you already have a collection of A-mount lenses, $400 may be a reasonable price to pay for full compatibility when it ships in November.
