The cat's out of the bag, and a rogue Samsung executive is the one who's been untying the strings. During a chat with the Korea Times, Samsung's Lee Young-hee blabbed that we'd see both the Galaxy Gear and the Galaxy Note III being announced at IFA on September 4th. The mobile VP added that the oft-rumored "wearable concept device" wouldn't come with a flexible display and will be a companion gadget for your smartphone -- but declined to offer any more detail about what we can expect from the flagship phablet. Never mind, however, because pictures purporting to be of the Galaxy Note III's front have emerged over on HD Blog, and you can catch a full gallery down at the source.


Update: Here's even more pictures purporting to be of the Note III from ETradeSupply. The site is claiming that the third generation device will measure in at 5.69-inches. [Thanks, Lucas]
