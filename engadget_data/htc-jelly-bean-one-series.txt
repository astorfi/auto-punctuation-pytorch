 Tucked away at the bottom of HTC's announcement of the One X+ is a pleasant piece of news that's sure to make One X and One S owners happy. Android 4.1, alongside HTC's Sense 4+ UI, is set to arrive on the devices at some point this month. As a disclaimer, this likely won't apply to AT&T's One X or T-Mobile's One S, since the refresh will likely take additional time to make its way through carrier testing -- HTC reps confirmed to us that the October timeframe is specifically for the global versions. Here's to hoping this doesn't mean we'll have to wait until the 31st to get our hands on Jelly Bean.
