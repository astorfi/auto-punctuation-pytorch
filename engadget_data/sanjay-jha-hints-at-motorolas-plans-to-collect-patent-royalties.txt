If you haven't noticed, the mobile patent wars have been heating up lately, and Motorola hasn't exactly been sitting quietly on the sidelines. In the past year, the company's been in the courtroom with a number of major players, including Apple and Microsoft, and now the outfit seems poised to go after other Android handset makers. According to Unwired View, during a keynote speech at the Oppenheimer Technology and Communications conference, CEO Sanjay Jha signaled that Motorola could soon go on the offensive when it comes to the competition:


		I would bring up IP as a very important for differentiation (among Android vendors). We have a very large IP portfolio, and I think in the long term, as things settle down, you will see a meaningful difference in positions of many different Android players. Both, in terms of avoidance of royalties, as well as potentially being able to collect royalties. And that will make a big difference to people who have very strong IP positions.



If Motorola does indeed intend to differentiate itself from its competitors by clutching tightly to its patent portfolio, could we soon see a replay of Microsoft's recent royalty collection binge? We'll just have to wait and see.
