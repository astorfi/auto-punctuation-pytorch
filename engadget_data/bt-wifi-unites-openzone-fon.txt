 Just when you were finally beginning to understand the difference between Openzone and Fon, British operator BT has decided to merge them into a single hotspot service called BT Wi-fi -- creating what it claims is the "world's largest wi-fi community." Access already comes free and unlimited with home and business broadband connections, so there's "no need to pay for 3G or a dongle" so long as you're in a relatively densely populated area. The re-branding should have little impact on how you use the service, except that the old network names will gradually be replaced, but then a bit of unification often has unexpected benefits.
