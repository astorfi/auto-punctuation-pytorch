 It was hinted at back in September 2009, now it appears certain that Nike will deliver a Nike+ heart rate monitor iPod accessory to the US on June 1st. The following Nike forum post by a long-time contributor and a suspected Nike employee has set heart valves aflutter:
"I have a U.S. launch date for the Nike+ compatible heart rate monitor. It will officially launch on June 1, 2010, although it may reach some retail outlets slightly sooner. It will reach Canadian markets in June and will launch internationally in summer 2010, exact date to be determined."
 We might buy one just to prove that we're still alive.
