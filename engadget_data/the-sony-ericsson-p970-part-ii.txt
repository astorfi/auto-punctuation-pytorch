 So we have another contender for the rumored smartphonethat may come to be known as the Sony Ericsson P970/P980 (you know, the stripped down version of the Symbian-powered P990). In this iteration (which looks a lot more real than the lastclaimant), the device takes on more of a Treo/hw6500 form factor, although the keyboard arrangement looks even strangerthan that on the Blackberry 7100 series. No more deets yet, butwe'll tracking this one with our usual ferocity. Read on for a comparative pic with a W800...[Via Club SonyEricsson]
