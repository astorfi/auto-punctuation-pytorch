So here you go, the 22 countries scheduled to go live with the iPhone 3G on July 11th:

Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and the US.

$199 for 8G and $299 for the 16GB model... in the US at least and with a 2-year contract. The remaining 48 countries listed after the break will get theirs "later this year."
