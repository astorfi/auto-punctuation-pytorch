The most interesting is the LX900 line (pictured above) which is due this Summer -- still waiting on a price -- available in sizes ranging from 40-inches to 60-inches and will of course do Full 1080p 3D with help from RealD's active shutter glasses. But even if you aren't into 3D, we're sure you'll appreciate the new local dimming and built in WiFi so that you can stream all kinds of content via internet services or your home's DLNA network. Like the LX900, the HX900 does 3D, but the the active shutter glasses and 3D transmitter are sold separately. If you are interested in the rest of the lineup then don't hesitate to click through and read the entire press release.
      

 

Show full PR textLAS VEGAS (CES BOOTH #14200), Jan. 6, 2010 – From black-and-white, to color, to digital, Sony Electronics is once again setting the new standard for how televisions look and perform. Today, the company introduced its 2010 BRAVIA® LCD HDTV line featuring its first 3D HDTVs, a new innovative and stylish Monolithic Design Concept, and LED backlighting.The new Sony televisions are another example of how Sony is providing consumers with networked products that enhance the home entertainment experience by offering built-in Wi-Fi® (802.11) for easy access to BRAVIA Internet video, BRAVIA Internet Widgets and personal content through Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) certified™ home networks.The line is made up of 38 models ranging in screen sizes from 60 to 22-inches. The LX900 series offers integrated 3D functionality with Sony's 3D active shutter glasses and built-in 3D transmitter, while the HX900 and HX800-series are 3D capable using Sony 3D active shutter glasses and 3D transmitter (each sold separately). The 3D models incorporate a frame sequential display and active-shutter glasses that work together with Sony's proprietary high frame rate technology reproducing full high-definition 3D images."Sony's 3D HDTVs leverage the breadth and depth of the company's expertise to create an entirely unique experience at home that draws you closer to entertainment than ever before," said Jeff Goldstein, vice president for Sony's television business. "Sony will continue to own the living room by delivering TVs that work synergistically; both in function and design." Models in the LX900, HX900, NX800, and NX700 series feature Sony's all new Monolithic Design. The design concept aims to change the entire TV viewing environment by delivering the most innovative, stylish, and high-quality experience possible.With quality materials forming a simple, flush viewing surface with crisp edges and a smooth border, the models blend into the home's interior and allow viewers to focus completely on beautiful on-screen images without distraction from unnecessary decorative elements. Also, a unique six degree upward tilt option offers a more natural, comfortable viewing experience.Central to the slim profile Monolithic Design is Sony's Edge LED backlight. Designed to deliver deep blacks and brilliant whites, the design allows for a slim form factor and an outstanding contrast ratio helping the new models impress not only when they are displaying beautiful images, but also when turned off as they blend into the home's décor.BRAVIA XBR-LX900 Series 3D HDTVAvailable this summer, the BRAVIA XBR-LX900 series features integrated 3D functionality and screen sizes including 60 (XBR-60LX900), 52 (XBR-52LX900), 46 (XBR-46LX900), and 40-inch (XBR-40LX900). The full HD 1080p (1920 x 1080) models feature Edge LED backlight, Sony's new Monolithic Design and Motionflow™ PRO 240Hz motion compensation technology, which helps produces smooth images in fast moving content such as sport and action movies. Sony's 240Hz technology also reduces the mixing of images of 3D content assigned to the left and right eyes, while the BRAVIA Engine™ 3 full digital video processor uses a collection of enhanced algorithms to significantly reduce noise, enhance overall image detail, and optimize contrast so every scene produces sharp, vibrant, life-like images.The LX900 models also feature Sony's new OptiContrast panel. Designed with a clear surface treatment and a resin sheet sandwiched between the LCD display panel and glass plate, the OptiContrast panel minimizes the reflection and refraction of external and internal light producing deeper images with superior black levels even in bright rooms.The models include integrated Wi-Fi for an easy connection to broadband home networks. Once connected, users can access thousands of streaming movies, videos, music and more from Netflix, Amazon Video on Demand, YouTube™, Slacker® Internet Radio, Pandora®, NPR, Sony Pictures, Sony Music, and over 25 total providers through the Sony BRAVIA Internet Video platform.Also, with the touch of a button, users can access the latest in news, weather, USA Today sports, Yahoo Finance, Twitter, Flickr photos, and FrameChannel through small applications called BRAVIA Internet Widgets. The widgets can be uniquely positioned anywhere on the TV screen for a custom viewing experience.The models also feature playback of personal content including digital pictures, video, and music through USB and DLNA® certified network connections.Another new feature is Sony's Intelligent Presence Sensor with face detection. The sensor detects if you've stepped away from the TV or are not watching the screen and automatically dims the backlight. After an extended period, the TV will turn off if no one has re-entered the viewing area. Additionally, the Intelligent Presence Sensor's newly added Position Control feature detects a user's viewing position to deliver optimized video/sound balance, while the Distance Alert feature helps to keep small children at an eye-friendly distance. The models also offer Sony's BRAVIA Sync™ for easy operation with other BRAVIA Sync devices such as AV receivers and Blu-ray Disc™ players, and TVGuide® on-screen channel guide.BRAVIA XBR-HX900 Series 3D Ready HDTVThe XBR-HX900 series 3D ready (with the addition of Sony active shutter glasses and transmitter, both sold separately) full HD (1920 x 1080p) models feature Intelligent Dynamic LED backlight and Sony's new Monolithic Design. The model's full-array LED backlighting improves contrast and dynamic range by local dimming that controls the LED backlight level by area so that detail is maintained in the dark areas, while other areas are driven near peak brightness. The technology reduces unnecessary light emission resulting in true and deep blacks compared to conventional LED backlit models.The models also feature Sony's new ambient sensor that automatically optimizes the TV's color and brightness according to the room environment and lighting conditions for optimized settings. Featuring screen sizes including 52 (XBR-52HX900) and 46-inches (XBR-46HX900), the model offers four HDMI 1.4 inputs, one component input, one composite input, one component/composite selectable inputs, and a PC input (HD15) with PC/TV picture-in-picture.The models also feature:Monolithic DesignMotionflow PRO 240Hz motion compensation technologyOptiContrast panelUSB Wireless-LAN adapter for easy wireless network connection (sold separately)BRAVIA Internet Video and BRAVIA Internet WidgetsBRAVIA Engine 3 with Intelligent Image EnhancerUSB and DLNA photo/music/video playbackBRAVIA KDL-HX800 Series 3D Ready HDTVAlso 3D ready (with the addition of Sony active shutter glasses and transmitter, sold separately), the BRAVIA KDL-HX800 series will be available this summer in screen sizes including 55-inch class (54.6-inches measured diagonally) (KDL-55HX800), 46 (KDL-46HX800) and 40-inch (KDL-40HX800).The full HD 1080p (1920 x 1080) models utilize a Dynamic Edge LED backlight with local dimming for improved contrast and dynamic range.
