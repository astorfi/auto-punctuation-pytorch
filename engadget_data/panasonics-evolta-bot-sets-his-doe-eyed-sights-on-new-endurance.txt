This time, however, he's been tasked to pedal his adorable little heart out on a miniature tricycle. The plan is to take this year's Le Mans race by storm and break some sort of world record for distance traveled by a robot -- though we're not sure how exactly that's defined, since EVOLTA isn't exactly a speed demon. This new version of the bot has been completely revamped to ride a bike and follow an infrared path blazed by his superiors. A couple of videos are after the break.  [Thanks, Alex]
