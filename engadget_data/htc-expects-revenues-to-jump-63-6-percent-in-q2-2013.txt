But despite its worst ever quarterly profit earlier this year, it's banking on a substantial turnaround over the next few months. During an earnings call today referencing its audited results, HTC said that its outlook for Q2 2013 includes a revenue jump to around $2.4 billion -- a huge increase from $1.45 billion registered in Q1. HTC CEO Peter Chou said that the company was fine "in terms of cash flow," and that it would continue to support both Android and Windows Phone hardware in the near future. How about those recent supply woes? "We are working as hard as possible to meet the demand everywhere." The company, however, wasn't giving away any handset sales figures, something that the competition does enjoy flourishing.


When asked whether he was concerned with its recent hardware being copied, Chou was frank: " In this industry, everything can be copied. I think there's no point [in] thinking you can prevent this... but whether they would get this original quality -- I think the most important [thing] is that you are first."
