You knew a new Uncharted was coming to the PlayStation 4 -- it was inevitable, really. And tonight at E3, Sony just capped off its E3 press event with a teaser trailer of Naughty Dog's next title in the franchise: Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. We didn't get much beyond a short scene of the series' hero Nathan Drake waking up bruised and walking through a jungle, but judging by the game's title, this could also be the last we ever see of Drake. Take note, the snippet of footage Sony showed was apparently captured directly from the PS4, so prepare for some absolutely gorgeous visuals. Expect to see the next-gen title arrive sometime in 2015.
