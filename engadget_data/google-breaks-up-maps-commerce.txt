 It looks like the shakeups at Google this week aren't over yet. Following Andy Rubin's departure from the Android team and some "spring cleaning" that stuck a fork in Google Reader, The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that the company is breaking up its mapping and commerce unit. According to the paper, maps will now be a part of Google's search unit, while commerce will fall under the advertising group. What's more, the WSJ also reports that the head of that soon-to-be-former unit, Jeff Huber, will be moving to Google X, the lab responsible for projects like Glass and Google's self-driving car.

 Update: Jeff Huber has now posted a brief statement on both Google+ and Twitter. He says, "finishing up my first decade at Google, and excited to return to my startup roots and begin the next one at Google X!" A Google spokesperson has also issued the following statement: 
  "Jeff is an extraordinary executive. He just finished his first decade at Google -- having worked on some of our most complicated issues like ads, apps, payments and geo -- and now he is eager to work in more of a start up like environment."
