Really, there's nothing much in the Alpha A100 we weren't already speculating based on the previous specs reported on the interwebs, but at least now the details are a little more fleshed out: its 10.2 megapixel sensor is a Super HAD (Hole Accumulated Diode) CCD with Super SteadyShot OIS, anti-dust filters and vibration, and Bionz Image Processor hardware; the camera also features the Minolta A-lens mount (of course), a 2.5-inch anti-reflective display, 3fps burst mode, 600 shot lithium-ion Stamina battery,CF and Memory Stick Pro Duo (via CF adapter), and a sweet feature that initiates autofocus when you look into the viewfinder (so you don't have to waste time with the half-press). Not bad, but we're honestly a little worried about the price up in this piece. We'll keep ya posted.Update: and the price! $999, "expected to ship on or before July 28th, 2006" according to the SonyStyle page. Oh, and DP Blog also has some sweet info on the 20 or so lenses announced for this thing as well, better check that out before you make any buying decisions. There you have it ladies and gents, enjoy. Thanks, Steve.
