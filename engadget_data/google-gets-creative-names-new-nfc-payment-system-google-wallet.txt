 Yesterday, anonymous sources said that El Goog and Sprint would debut a new NFC payment system on May 26th -- otherwise known as tomorrow. Today, a leak allegedly from The Container Store appears to have spilled the beans on the moniker for Mountain View's mobile money method: Google Wallet. Not the most creative cognomen, but at least it sums up the service succinctly. Still, it's no Ice Cream Sandwich, but we'll find out how it tastes live at tomorrow's event.

Update: Eagle-eyed reader Steve pointed out that looking up the WHOIS info for googlewallet.com does indeed lead you to Mountain View, though this was created way back in 2005. You may recall that Google Checkout was initially known as Google Wallet, as reminded by InformationWeek, but we just noticed that the URL is now plain dead instead of taking us to a Google error page, as it did minutes ago. Very intriguing.
