Much as we love saying "L'Amour" in a breathy whisper, we're probably not the target demo for Nokia's new "L'Amour
Collection" of fashion phones (though we did hear a rumor that Nokia was bringing Enigma out of retirement for the
launch party). Read on for details about the Nokia 7380, 7370, and 7360.



    We already hit up the Nokia 7380 yesterday, butin case you missed it, this one?s a follow-up to the 7280 that runs Series 40 and has tri-band GSM/GPRS, a twomegapixel digital camera with flash, and a 208 x 104 pixel, 65,000 color display. Retail price should be about?500.

 
 Next up is the Nokia 7370, a tri-band GSM/GPRS phone that?s really the pick of the three (if you?re looking for amore full-featured handset, that is). This one runs Series 40 and has a QVGA (320 x 240 pixel), 262,000 color display,a 1.3 megapixel camera, video ringtones, stereo speakers (very, very tiny stereo speakers), Bluetooth, and anintegrated FM tuner. Expected retail price: ?300

 
 Rounding things out is the Nokia 7360, a, um, more budget model that runs Series 40 and has a lower-res 128 x 160,65,000 color display, a triband GSM/GPRS, and a VGA camera (no mention of Bluetooth). Should retail for ?200.
