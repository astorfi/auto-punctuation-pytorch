Apparently, the aforementioned outfit has inked a deal that will land its DLP Cinema projectors in "each IMAX Digital projection system to be deployed to commercial exhibitors around the world from mid-2008." Unfortunately, all the gory details we crave were left out -- starting with a list of cities in which to expect these DLP-powered venues -- but thankfully, the release did manage to spare the whole "it's the mirrors" tagline when getting the point across.[Via AboutProjectors, image courtesy of Pathe-IMAX]
