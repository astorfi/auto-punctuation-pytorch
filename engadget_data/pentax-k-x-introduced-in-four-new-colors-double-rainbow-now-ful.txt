Just months after Pentax introduced the latest round of colors to hit its long-standing entry-level DSLR, along comes a new foursome to consider: chocolate, beige, olive and pink. We actually witnessed the last one there back in mid-February (go on and guess, we'll wait), but now the whole group is up for sale on the company's webstore for $649.95 each. Too bad Pentax seems more interested in pumping out more exterior variations than a bona fide K-x successor, eh?
