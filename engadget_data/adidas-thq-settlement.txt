  Adidas and THQ have decided to down swords and settle their differences out of court. The German sportswear company was lobbing $10 million worth of litigation at the software house after it failed to produce a tie-in game for the miCoach intelligent football boots soccer cleats. The game will now be finished off and published by another one of Adidas' partners after both parties were "properly compensated for their important contributions" (read: they split the bill). Hopefully we can expect the software to arrive soon as we're aching to find out how many meters we cover in our usual games of five-a-side.
