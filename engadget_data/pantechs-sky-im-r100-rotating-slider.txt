We guess we can understand adding a rotating screen to your slider, if it does DMB -- Pantech's SKY IM-R100 doesn't, yet holds on to the impossibly complex form factor. In fact, the form factor is the most interesting thing about the handset, which packs a 2-megapixel camera, media player, microSD slot, and not much else. Sure, you might drop some vids on that memory card that benefit from a landscape display, but might we simply recommend you turn the phone sideways? As you might guess, this one doesn't stand a snowball's chance of making it outside South Korea's borders, and for once, we're just fine with that.
