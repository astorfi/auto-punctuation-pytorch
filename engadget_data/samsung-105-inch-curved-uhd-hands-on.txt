Admit it: if you had the means (and the space) you'd absolutely want to own Samsung's 105-inch curved 4K television set. Unfortunately, the vast majority of our readers can meet neither of the aforementioned criteria, which is why you must live vicariously through us. We're happy to provide this much-needed public service. You're welcome.


What's it like? Well, the mammoth set is impressive to behold, and as you would expect, it delivers Samsung's hallmark saturated colors and crisp picture... for the most part. Unfortunately, during our brief time watching the set, it looked like the TV or video feed was malfunctioning, as we saw some occasional pixelation and a single line flash on screen once or twice. Regardless, that 5,120 x 2,160 resolution is truly stunning, even if its 21:9 aspect ratio makes it a bit of an oddball -- which is why we only got to see panoramic shots of cities and landscapes instead of regular movie or TV programming. Still, after this, going home to our meager 50-inch set will be tough.
