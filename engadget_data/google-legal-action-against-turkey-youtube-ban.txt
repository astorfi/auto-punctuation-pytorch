Remember how a Turkish court ordered an end to the country's YouTube ban? Well, that decision has already been reversed -- and Google has launched an all-out legal assault in response. The search firm has filed a complaint with Turkey's Constitutional Court protesting the block, to start with; it's also appealing the reinstatement of the ban, and it's suing to negate the decision altogether. The company doesn't have more details to share at this stage, but a spokesperson both acknowledged the court battles to us and said it was "obviously very disappointing" that the censorship is still in effect. It's too early to know whether the anti-ban campaign will prove successful, but Twitter's recent victory suggests that Google has a fighting chance.
