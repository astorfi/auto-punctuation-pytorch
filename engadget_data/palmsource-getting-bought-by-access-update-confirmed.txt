Haven't been able to confirm this, but we've just received a report that Access, a Japanese company that makes
software for mobile phones, has successfully raised the financing needed and has made a bid to scoop up
PalmSource for the princely sum
of ¥30 billion (just over $270 million). Why? Well reportedly Access is looking for a way to expand the market for its
cellphone browser (which is currently used by many of DoCoMo's FOMA 3G phones), and since both Symbian and Windows
Mobile are largely closed off to them they've apparently decided that what they need is to have their own operating
system. And that's where PalmSource comes in — the company has been struggling lately, and the idea here is that Access
will market the OS, complete with Access software, to Asian OEM manufacturers (which is supposedly PalmSource's
strategy too, but whatever). We don't know yet whether this is for real, but stranger things have happened, we'll say
that.

UPDATE: Confirmed! Access just issued a press release minutes ago. The deal is for $311.3 million
in cash. No clue yet how this deal will affect Palm, PalmSource's sibling which got the hardware part of business after
the two companies split up in 2003. Reuters has the story

here.
