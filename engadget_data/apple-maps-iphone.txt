Apple just announced that it's bringing "fantastic updates" to Maps on the desktop, including the ability send directions to your iPhone and back. That feature will arrive with OS X Mavericks, and a brief demo showed how you could map your route to a restaurant, then instantly bring up the same map and directions on your iPhone with a couple of taps, when you're ready to go. Maps will be built-in to the Calendar, Contacts and Mail, as well in Mavericks, letting you map any address directly from those apps. You'll be able to check out the new features when the OS arrives this fall, or via a developer's preview, available later today.
