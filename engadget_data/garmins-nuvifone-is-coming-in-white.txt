Garmin just shows a black version of its phone -- which is still slated for Q3 at a purported $500 pricepoint -- on its own site, but perhaps this teensy supposed leak means there's more news in store for the Nuvifone camp in the near future.Update: Turns out this is just an inverted shot of a black phone, so sorry to disappoint.
