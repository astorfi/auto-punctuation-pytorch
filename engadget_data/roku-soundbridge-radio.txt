It's been a few months since we last heard a peep out of Roku Labs, but they're back in effect and going straight
after Bose and Cambridge SoundWorks with their new SoundBridge Radio, a WiFi-enabled Internet tabletop radio which
they're hoping will replace that clock radio by your bed (note the nice and large snooze button). $399 ain't cheap for
a fancified alarm clock, but the SoundBridge does all the usual stuff you'd expect from a regular SoundBridge, like
stream music from your PC over your home network (it supports playback of WMA, AAC, MP3, WAV, and AIFF audio files) and
tune into Internet radio stations (it comes preprogrammed with a directory of about 50 stations and you can manually
add stations yourself). Also comes with an AM/FM tuner if you can't quite complete the transition to Internet radio,
and you can set the preset buttons for any combination of AM, FM, or Internet radio stations (you can also program one
of the presets to automatically play a specific iTunes playlist stored on your PC). Should hit stores in early
November.
