It's nothing personal, that's just the pecking order; we just hold them in such high regard that when they slip up, say something stupid, or just do that thing they always seem to do to piss off their customers, we're there to give 'em a slap on the wrist -- just like we would other any company. This time we're going to have to give them the benefit of the doubt -- we want to give them the benefit of the doubt, because we really don't want to believe Sony would drop the infinity sign (which, of course, closely resembles an toppled figure 8) between the P and S (we presume for PlayStation) in a supposed trademark application they filed for their PlayStation controller with the Japanese patent office. We can't prove this is actually legit, but that's the word on the street according to GameFront.de, whose PooS logo image (above) doesn't even look close to the regular PlayStation / Spiderman type we know they've become so anal about using everywhere. Our advice: don't believe the infinite amounts of hype, until further notice we're calling BooS on this one.[Via Digital Battle]
