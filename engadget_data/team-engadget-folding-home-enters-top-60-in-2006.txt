Congratulations to everyone donating those spare cycles! And don't you worry -- wedidn't forget about our last Team Engadget Folding@home contest. For everyone who plugged away to meet our 2,000 pointgoal we've got a winner for ya: roder, will you please stand up? You won yourself a Tokyo Flash watch!Butwe aren't done yet; everyone who makes it to 8,000 points by President's Day (that'd be Monday, the 20th) willautomatically be entered in the running for a sweet Tokyo Flash watch, with the winner to once again be picked by ourgood friend, the random number generator. So get cranking everybody, we've got some diseases to beat! Want to know more about Folding@home? Go here.  Want to check out ourteam page? Go here.   Ready to join? Ok!
