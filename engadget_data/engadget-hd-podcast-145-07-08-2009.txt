       Wait -- an Engadget HD podcast without any Media Center news? There, there now, MCE-folk -- we manage to fit in some good stuff that's at least HTPC related and Ben tips his hand about Microsoft's new DRM scheme. We also manage to get behind a couple of scenes this week -- Steve talks about his trip inside Dolby's lab and Ben talks about how to get a set-top box situated behind equipment closet doors. Join us on our hour-plus romp through the week's news and come clean on our obsessive-compulsive videophile ways along the way; and with only a couple of minor tangential detours (cars and BSG, mostly).Get the podcast[iTunes] Subscribe to the Podcast directly in iTunes (MP3). p[RSS - AAC] Enhanced feed, subscribe to this with iTunes.[RSS - MP3] Add the Engadget HD Podcast feed to your RSS aggregator[Zune]Subscribe to the Podcast directly in the Zune Marketplace[MP3] Download the show (MP3).Hosts: Ben Drawbaugh, Steven Kim, Richard LawlerProducer: Trent WolbeProgram00:01:00 - Comments from Engadget HD Podcast 143 - 06.24.2009 00:16:36 - Cable companies miss tru2way deadline, insist it's no big deal00:26:05 - Sci Fi / SyFy switch takes effect tomorrow, still doesn't make any sense00:31:17 - Engadget goes behind the Dolby logo00:45:19 - How to relocate a HD set-top-box and still have it work with an HDTV00:54:10 - You know you're a videophile if...01:00:15 - Auzentech joins the HD audio HTPC party01:06:15 - TiVo HD upgrade program helps you save as much as $10001:11:10 - Pioneer refreshes, lowers prices on its Elite receivers01:11:50 - Ask Engadget HD: How can I get my home theater ready for 3D, right now?01:13:46 - Mobile DTV standard in the US gets raised to "proposed standard" status     LISTEN (MP3)LISTEN (AAC)LISTEN (OGG)
