 In contrast to the Sony Xperia T, HTC's latest device just hit the FCC without offering many details -- but fortunately we have a pretty good idea of what it is anyway. Identified as the PM63100, we've seen this particular model show up on benchmark results as the HTC One X+, a rumored revision of the current flagship. As you may recall, the benchmark claims that the One X+ features a Tegra 3 quad-core processor clocked at 1.7GHz. Happily, the FCC-approved phone also throws in LTE connectivity (sporting AT&T-friendly bands 4 and 17 in addition to 2 and 5), fulfilling NVIDIA's self-made prophecy that we would see Tegra 3 devices with the next-gen tech by the end of 2012. Sadly, the federal docs don't show us much more than what you see above, but it's an indication that we may not have to wait too much longer to learn more.
