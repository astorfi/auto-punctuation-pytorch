Set top boxes everywhere just cried out in agony. Amazon announced this morning that its full lineup of 2014 series will be shot in 4K. The retailer-turned-TV-studio likely considers the move a bit of future-proofing, given the limited options for actually watching such shows in their intended resolution. The list of 8.3 million pixel programs features five new pilots, including Chris Carter's The After, Roman Coppola's Mozart in the Jungle and Jill Soloway's Transparent.


Update: We received clarification from Amazon -- seems the 4K shoots pertain to full series and not the already-completed pilots.
