 The eagle-eyed guys atPhoneScoop got some playtime with Samsung's upcoming T709 slider (since we're sure you read everyword of our CES coverage, you no doubt remember that this GSM model sports a1.3-megapixel camera with shutter speed and metering adjustment, EDGE, speakerphone, training-free voice command, and alittle feature known as WiFi) and stumbled across an in-phone reference to a "T-Mobile wireless router." Thiswould seem to indicate that: 1. This phone will be available through T-Mobile (duh), 2. T-Mobile is planning to releasea wireless router (double duh), and 3. The T709 rocks UMA tech for seamless WLAN to WAN voice handoffs. Such handoffsallow homeowners with dead spots in their cellular coverage (dead spots? with T-Mobile? Never!) to fill in the gapswith numerous WLAN extender options like the intriguing AuraGrid.
