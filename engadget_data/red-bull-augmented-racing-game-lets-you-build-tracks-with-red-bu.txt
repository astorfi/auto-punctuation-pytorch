In addition to a plethora of in-game advertising, the new Red Bull racing game for iOS devices also has an augmented reality component that lets you build tracks simply by lining up actual cans of Red Bull on the floor -- at least twelve of them for a complete track, and only Red Bull will do, apparently. Not surprisingly, the game itself is free, and you can grab it in the App Store right now to try it out for yourself. Or you can just head on past the break for a video demonstration if you'd prefer to leave the Red Bull on the shelf.
