 Motorola's been making good with Verizon as of late, and according to the Wall Street Journal, the two just signed a deal to "ensure some of its upcoming smartphones will be heavily promoted" by the carrier." The article goes on to say that Motorola is planning to launch a pair of such devices on VZW this year, with the obvious platform choice being Android for both. Our best guess would be the 4.1-inch Shadow / MB810 for one, but as for the smartphone? No clue. Even with great choices like the Incredible and EVO 4G on the market, like we said on last week's Engadget Show, there's never been a better time to wait on a new mobile purchase. Better yet, does this mean we can finally start retiring the original Droid from television? Thanks.
