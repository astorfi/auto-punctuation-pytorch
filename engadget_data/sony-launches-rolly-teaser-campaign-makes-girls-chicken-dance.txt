No details other than confirmation of its audio entertainment roots. By the looks of things, we'll be getting the full poop around September 10th when the "Rolly Special Party" kicks off. Gotta say, it's been awhile since we've seen Sony market a new product so heavily. And with keywords such as "communication," "small," "share," "free," "shuffle," and "kurukuru" (translated: go round and round) splattered around the page, color us intrigued -- although barely after being subjected to a gaggle of giggling chicks in the throes of the chicken dance. See what we mean after the break, if you dare.[Via Engadget Japanese] Read -- Rolly special party registration Read -- Rolly-show Blog Read -- Rolly
