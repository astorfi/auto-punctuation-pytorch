More free storage? Lower prices? It's all good news from Microsoft today: The company just announced that it will begin offering 15GB of free storage to OneDrive users, up from 7GB. For those of you keeping track, this latest move brings OneDrive in line with its biggest rival, Google Drive, which also also offers 15GB of free space (other competitors such as iCloud and Dropbox don't offer nearly as much complimentary storage). Meanwhile, Microsoft said that within the next month, Office 365 users will get 1TB of free space, up from 20GB. This, too, is a welcome change: That generous 1TB cap was previously reserved for Office 365's business users only.



          
 
 
 Finally, Microsoft dropped the price of its monthly plans to $1.99 for 100GB (down from $7.49) and $3.99 for 200GB (down from $11.49). In fact, the prices are so low that the company chose to eliminate its 50GB monthly plan; the fee would have been so nominal (25 cents or so) that it may as well have been free. The good news is that whether you use OneDrive or Office 365, existing users will automatically see their storage limits go up. In other words, it's not like you have to be a new customer to take advantage of this. Enjoy, and turn on OneDrive's automatic photo-uploading if you haven't already -- we're pretty sure you'll have enough space now for all your stuff.
