As you might expect, the network was no small undertaking even considering the size of the town, and involved an "experimental license" from the FCC, network infrastructure from Spectrum Bridge, and a slew of equipment that Dell, Microsoft and the TDF Foundation contributed to the local school and computer center. No word on anything like actual speeds just yet, but we're guessing the Claudville residents will be plenty pleased regardless, as they've been stuck with nothing more than dial-up or expensive satellite internet until now.
