The program -- called Learning On-the-Go -- will bring wireless broadband connections to students off campus. The devices will include mobile phones and laptops, enabling students to have internet connections when they're not at school. Starting in the 2011-2012 school year, 35,000 elementary and secondary school students will be impacted in Colorado, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Ohio, Georgia, Texas, Michigan, North Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama, California, New Mexico and Iowa. The total cost of the program is estimated to be $9 million, but it'll certainly be paid back in all those Facebook visits during off-school hours, right?
