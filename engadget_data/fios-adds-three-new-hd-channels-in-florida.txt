       According to Bryan Schnieder of TampaHDTV.com, FIOS in Tampa FL has added three new channels to their HD lineup. It is safe to assume that FIOS customers everywhere can expect the same three channels soon. Once again a provider adds new channels without any announcement at all and on Saturday the Food Network HD showed up on channel 840, HGTV HD on channel 841 and Lifetime Movie HD on channel 845. Of all the HD channels available today not currently carried by your provider, these are probably the most sought after. Once again Verizon keeps the heat on their competitor, in an attempt to lure customers away from their current provider.
