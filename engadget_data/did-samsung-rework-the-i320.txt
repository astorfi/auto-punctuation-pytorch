We like conspiracy theories just as much as the next guy, and Sammy is doing their best to feed our rumor mill today with these seemingly incongruent pictures of two SGH-I320s side by side. Yes, we're as concerned as you that the model's hands appear to be attached backwards, but stay on task, folks: the device on the left appears to be lacking highlighted numeric keys and a slightly different D-pad. The device on the right, by contrast, looks essentially like the one we've shown you before. Go ahead and tweak that thing until you're blue in the face, Samsung -- we're just happy to know you haven't scrapped it. Hopefully you'll come to the party in time to do battle with the Q and Excalibur, eh?[Via the::unwired]
