We were surprised to find it lacking the same, touch sensitive controls found on the Chocolate. Instead, the Shine is equipped with a spinning thumb wheel across the midriff which scrolls like butter. The feel is solid, not heavy, and the slider springs with a satisfying pop into place to revel that laser etched keypad. We didn't put it though a rigorous suite of tests by any stretch of the imagination. However, it certainly looks like a winner based upon first impressions. Check the gallery for more pics.
