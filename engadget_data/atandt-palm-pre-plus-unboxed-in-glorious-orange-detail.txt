A tipster was kind enough to send us these photos of an AT&T Pre Plus escaping its creamsicle confines and powering on for the first time. This doesn't look like a retail unit, likely one of AT&T's "practice" Pre Plus models that were supposed to ship earlier this month or some other promo phone, but regardless we're guessing that we're not far from yet another group of subscribers being able to massage the keys on this slider.
