 FCC chairman and general ass-kicker Julius Genachowski is siding with his commissioner Mignon Clyburn this week, noting that Verizon's response to the Fed over its $350 "advanced device" early termination fee didn't really satisfy everyone's curiosity. He's not ready to talk about the FCC's next move in the case -- we're guessing another lengthy open letter is in order -- but he assured media on hand that "the bureau is looking into" the situation. In the meantime, just don't get tired of that Droid too fast, alright?
