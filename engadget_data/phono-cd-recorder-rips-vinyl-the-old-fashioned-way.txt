Just in time for Father's Day, we've got the
perfect gift for your dad â€” if he's an aging ex-hipster with a huge record collection and a distrust of computers, that
is. The Phono CD Recorder is an all-in-one turntable, AM/FM radio and CD burner in a retro-style wooden cabinet. At
$499, it's a lot more expensive than hooking a turntable up to your PC to do the burns, but for the Luddite looking to
convert that record collection, it could be a much better deal than buying new CDs of music you already own. (Of
course, the sound quality is probably mediocre, especially when dealing with old vinyl, but if dad's hearing has
mellowed a little with age, he'll never know the difference!)
