	LG aren't letting up on the LTE hardware. While we've only just shaken hands with AT&T's Nitro HD, this Verizon-branded 4G handset packs several design cues (and specifications) from its rival network cousin. The LG Spectrum has already appeared -- albeit fleetingly -- in a database listing and is likely to be the successor to Big Red's Revolution. Pocketnow reckons that the phone will rock a 1.5GHz dual-core processor, a high-definition display running at 720p and an eight megapixel shooter, although it's hard to make out much for from these shots -- aside from that protruding camera module. Regardless, life's most certainly looking good for LG fans.
