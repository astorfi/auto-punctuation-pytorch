As expected, the X200t replaces the X61t, and specs for the new machines are right in line with that transition: available processors range from a 1.2GHz SU9300 Core 2 Duo to a 1.86GHz SL9400 chip, RAM maxes out a 4GB, there's a 128GB Samsung SSD option, graphics are integrated GMA 4500MHD, and WWAN, WiMAX and UWB are optional. Notable changes from the X61t in particular include a dual swivel hinge, an LED backit 1280 x 800 screen, and claimed 50% improvement in battery life to 15 hours, reduced touch pressure with a Wacom digitizer, and built-in GPS when the WWAN option is ordered. Prices should start at $2325 when these start going out in October, less for the X200s -- we'll have a hands-on for you ASAP, but there's a vid after the break to hold you over.
