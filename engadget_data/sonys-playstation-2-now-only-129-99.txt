Yeah, that was a long time ago, butif you still don't have one, don't feel like getting a 360 orwaiting any longer for the PlayStation 3 -- whenever the hell that'll be released -- or just want another PS2for around the house, you'll be pleased to know Sony once again dropped the price on the PS2. Now the diminutiveconsole will run you $130, down twenty bucks since the console's standing price since its last cut about two years ago.They're still not gonna beat out Nintendo's ever-cost effective $99 GameCube, but hey, when it comes to games, we knowfor a lot of people it just ain'tabout the price.
