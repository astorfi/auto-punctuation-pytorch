 
We doubt they mean this Saturday, but sometime between now and the first day of Winter, we'll have another HD channel. We have high hopes for MGM HD, as our favorite HD network tend to be the 24 hour variety channels like HD.net Movies and Universal HD. Rather than simulcasting and upconverting most of their content, these networks grab the best HD programming around and show it 24x7. MGM has a very large collection of movies to show and will also have original HD content, like award shows and behind the scenes features of the their newest movies. Like most new HD channels these days, only DirecTV has announced a carriage agreement, but we'd be surprised if we didn't see this channel pop up on various providers all over the US.
