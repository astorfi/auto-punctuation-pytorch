Call of Duty: Ghosts executive producer Mark Rubin has a lot on his plate. In just two months, he's heading up the launch of one of the (if not the) biggest titles on two next-gen game consoles, not to mention the four other platforms it's landing on. He's got his team at Infinity Ward to manage, as well as the teams at several other studios that are assisting in the development process. And on top of all that, the two big next-gen versions of Call of Duty: Ghosts are headed to hardware that "literally just started showing up" at his company's offices. Rubin explained as much to Engadget in an interview this past week at Gamescom 2013.


"Trying to design for something that you theoretically know about but don't physically have is an amazing challenge," he said. Beyond the stress and manpower required to produce so many versions of a single game, it's expensive. "It's required us to bring in a lot more resources than we had planned on in the beginning," Rubin added. And that's money that Infinity Ward's parent company, Activision, won't make up until the next year's Call of Duty game, when the "transition" period between console generations crests and enough gamers move to new game systems.


Head past the break for the full extent of what that means for Ghosts and the Call of Duty franchise moving forward, and why Rubin's "hopeful" for the rarely spoken about Wii U version.
