 With Mobile World Congress about a month away, there wasn't a peep about new smartphones at today's LG press conference. The company was all about TV -- well, TV and smart appliances, we guess. But we couldn't help but be enamored with the giant TV sets, the company showed off once the curtains were drawn back at the end of the press conference. The most eye-catching of all, clearly was the 84-inch 4K display which downright dwarfed the LG rep standing to its side. Sitting just off to the right was the newly announced 65-inch model, which, like the 55-inch OLED that spent the show on-stage, looked like a relatively modest proposal sitting next to such a behemoth. Of course, these are 4K TV sets that we're talking about here, so we use the word "modest" as loosely as humanly possible.

 The set maintains the impressive life-like quality of its elder sibling (showing off massively detailed cityscapes) of course, but compared to incredibly sleek and shiny OLED sets that we saw early, the 4K seem a bit on the thicker side. Though, as with the OLED, LG's clearly focused on making the bezel as imperceptible as possible here. The 4K models are propped up by a shiny metal stand emerging from their center.
