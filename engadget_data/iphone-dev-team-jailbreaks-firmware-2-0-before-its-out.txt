Apple, here's our suggestion -- just let people do what they want with your devices, since they're clearly going to do it anyway. That way, instead of making enemies, you're making lifelong buddies. Reasonable, right? Steve, give us a call, we're more than happy to riff on some ideas for playing nice with the end-user.Update: Dev chat room chatter claims that the 2.0 is now fully unlocked as well.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
