 Crackberry claims to have gotten hold of an official Rogers BB 10 training manual that may or may not add to your anticipation of January 30th. The leak is a Powerpoint slideshow that apparently contains screenshots from an online course for sales people -- so there's been at least one twist in its journey before it reached us, and that's reason in itself to be a bit cautious. Nevertheless, the document repeats familiar claims from RIM about its new flagship smartphone having "best in class" HTML5 browser compatibility and performance. It also highlights the promise of 70,000 QNX apps in the re-named BlackBerry World, although we don't know how many of those are totally new, ported or perhaps cross-compatible with older QNX devices. Finally, a few more specs are detailed in the hope of enticing tech-minded shoppers, with reference to a Snapdragon S4 processor, a 1,800mAh battery and a 356 pixel density that tallies with what we've already seen of the 4.2-inch 720p screen.
