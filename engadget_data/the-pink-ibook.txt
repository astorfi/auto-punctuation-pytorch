We'll spare you the Legally Blonde jokes, but check out this pink iBook that a guy in Minneapolis made for
a friend of his. People are apparently harrassing him to do one for them, but if you really, really want
one there's a company called Colorware that
colorizes iBooks as well as iPods and Powerbooks.
