Japanese magazine CoroCoro, you did not just reveal that Pikachu - and potentially other pokemon - will be able to wear various ensembles in the upcoming Pokemon Omega Ruby / Alpha Sapphire.

Sure, we're not sure how this will factor into the eventual gameplay, but it's still a pokemon wearing a bonnet - isn't that enough?

Nintendo, you must stop this. For the sake of productivity across the global work force, we beg of you: don't let us dress our pokemon in adorable outfits.

OH NO LOOK AT THAT ONE, HE'S WEARING A LITTLE LUCHADOR COSTUME OH GOD
