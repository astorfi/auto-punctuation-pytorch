According to a post from Howard Forums, it shows the big V planning on releasing Mobile TV on January 30th in correspondence with a flurry of hints given by Qualcomm regarding their release of MediaFLO. Our guess is that in the coming weeks before and during CES you'll see announcements regarding handset availability and channel lineups. [Thanks, TheStone41]
