According to McAdams Wright Ragen analyst Tim Bueneman, "there are already several new, improved versions of the Kindle in the works," and while an MP3 version (saywha?) isn't in the cards, one with an "improved interface" is. Furthermore, Amazon could be aiming at least one of the new Kindle(s) at college students, though no details were given on what exactly that meant. Wait, do university attendees even read anymore?[Via CNET]
