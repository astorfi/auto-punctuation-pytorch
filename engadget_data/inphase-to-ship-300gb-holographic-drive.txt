 When wefirst heard that InPhase Technologies was prepping a 300GB holographicdrive, we found it a little hard to believe. After all, we're still meeting people who get weepy at the possibilityof 100GB Blu Ray discs. But the company has apparently come through, and has announced that its Tapestry drives will beavailable this year, using media developed in partnership with Hitachi Maxell. According to the company, the 130 mmdiscs will have a transfer rate of 20 megabytes per second, making them usable for media applications. Now if only wedidn't have to wait another three years for InPhase's promised terabyte discs.
