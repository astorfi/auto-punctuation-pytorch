Billed as "the world's first 4-bay Intel Atom-based NAS," the TS-439 Pro Turbo NAS sports an Intel 1.6GHz CPU, 1GB memory, support for RAID 0/1/5/6/5+spare configurations, up to 6TB capacity (that's before you start adding external drives) and a whole host of server functions, including all the FTPing, DDNS, MySQL and XDove mail servin' your little heart desires. And if that weren't enough, the Surveillance Station feature supports video monitoring and recording from up to four IP-based cameras. No price listed, but we do have plenty of glamor shots for you in the gallery below.
