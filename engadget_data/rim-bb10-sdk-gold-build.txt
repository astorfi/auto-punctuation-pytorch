 RIM's reached yet another milestone in the slow-going march to its big January 30th BB 10 reveal: its SDK toolkit has gone 'gold'. Now, developers that've been courted by the Waterloo-based company at one of many BB Jam conferences around the globe can start building apps for the next-gen BlackBerry platform using final versions of APIs. As we learned back in May, devs interested in BB 10 will have the option to code natively for the unreleased OS using the Cascades framework, create HTML5-based "rich web applications" with WebWorks, or use the included toolset for Adobe AIR apps or Android ports. And just in case you were questioning industry support, RIM's also included stats in its associated PR (furnished by Five Points Research) that paint a positive picture, claiming 58-percent of those surveyed would "recommend BlackBerry 10 as a development platform." While it's nice to have those numbers as backup for its bravado, the company still has a ways to go turning the tide of consumer perception and elbowing past that other third place platform. Windows Phone 8, we're looking at you.

   Interest from Global, Diversified Developer Community Continues to Grow as BlackBerry 10 Launch Approaches

   Waterloo, ON – Research In Motion (RIM) (NASDAQ: RIMM; TSX: RIM) today released the "gold" build of the BlackBerry® 10 developer toolkit. The "gold" build includes all of the final tools, components, and APIs that will enable developers to create integrated, social and beautiful applications for BlackBerry 10, and have the confidence that their apps will delight customers at launch.

   Native C/C++ and Qt developers can use BlackBerry® Cascades™ to build visually stunning applications that offer deeper integration with core feature elements, such as BlackBerry Hub, than any other mobile platform today. HTML5 developers can use BlackBerry® WebWorks™ to create compelling and rich web applications for BlackBerry 10 devices that deliver native-like performance and take advantage of core integration as well. BlackBerry 10 tools are also available for building with Adobe® AIR® and porting Android® applications to the platform.

   Developer Interest Growing

   With the BlackBerry 10 launch event less than two months away, developer interest and excitement for the BlackBerry 10 platform continues to grow. Top application developers have already committed to BlackBerry 10 in key categories including games, multimedia, business and productivity, published media and social networking. For example, at the recent BlackBerry Jam Asia conference in Bangkok, RIM showcased over 70 new top application partners and demoed several on the BlackBerry 10 platform including apps from Fox Sports, MTV India, Picstory, Viki Video, and Hot Remit.

   Over the past few months, developer outlook toward RIM has improved broadly and significantly. According to a recent Pivot Point Research survey commissioned by RIM*, 58% of developers surveyed would recommend BlackBerry 10 as a development platform, a 123% increase from May to October, 2012. The survey also found a steady increase in satisfaction with the BlackBerry 10 platform among developers, growing by 56% over the same period.

   "We have been actively engaged with developers from around the world for many months and as we near the final weeks toward the launch of BlackBerry 10, the growing dedication and commitment we see from our developer community is truly outstanding," said Alec Saunders, Vice President, Developer Relations and Ecosystems at Research In Motion.
