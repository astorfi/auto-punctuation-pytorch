This all follows just a few days after Sammy had to pull the Vibrant's Froyo update on word that it seemed be killing the internal microSD storage, so hopefully, this build will be just a little more drama-free. Oh, and Samsung had originally said that Telus Fascinate owners would be waiting until next year to upgrade their units, so it's pretty neat that they were able to rein that in a bit and get it pushed at the tail end of '10. So have fun, Canadians -- you've beaten your friends with T-Mobile Vibrants and Verizon Fascinates to the punch on this one, and we encourage you to lord it over them at every opportunity.
