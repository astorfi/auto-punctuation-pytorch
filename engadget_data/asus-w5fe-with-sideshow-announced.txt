It also features Core 2 Duo processors, Intel 802.11a/b/g, up to 1.5GB RAM and 160GB of drive space, an integrated 1.3 megapixel camera, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, ExpressCard port, VGA and TV-out, and so on. But we know the SideShow novelty is what's most important: that will give you a 2.8-inch QVGA display with 1GB of independent flash memory for installing widgets and even media.
