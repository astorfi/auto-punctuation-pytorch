HP's UK division has developed a technology that allows screens to be
printed on sheets of plastic; images can be displayed on thin, flexible displays, which may be used for digital paper,
electronic billboards, and digital photographs. We've all heard about this biz before ("It's real this time!"), but
apparently this current prototype can display 125 colors, and even hold the image when the display is shut off (we
haven't seen that from HP in two years). Inkless publications are obviously still a ways off, but these are all good
signs.
