 With the Apple iPhone set for release in the U.S. next month (with AT&T), which non-U.S. mobile carriers will be the first to get some Apple mobile lovin'? According to the churning rumor mill, T-Mobile has secured a pretty solid seat in the running to be the first European carrier for the iPhone, but Vodafone is in hot pursuit as well. T-Mobile may have the leg up, according to Gartner research, since the iPhone's iTunes would possibly clash with Vodafone's Live! portal. The bigger question is whether Apple wants to limit itself to one initial carrier in Europe, since that market and the U.S. wireless market are completely different beasts. We're sure to see something before this autumn's European iPhone release.[Via Tech Digest]
