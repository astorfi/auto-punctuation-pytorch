If you're a Nokia Lumia 820 or 920 owner, you now have a chance to try the  Amber update a little early. WindowsMania.pl has posted unofficial ROMs (820, 920) that upgrade international versions of the Windows Phones to the Amber release ahead of Microsoft's rollout. Both ROMs are relatively easy to install from a PC using NokiaViews.com's instructions, although they're risky: they require wiping the phone's data, and there's no guarantees of future official upgrades. Even so, the new code may be worthwhile for Lumia fans who'd rather not wait a few weeks for a minor OS refresh.
