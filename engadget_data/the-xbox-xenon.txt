Xbox-scene.com has what is purportedly a screenshot from the Xbox 2 Developers Kit (which software publishers use to
create games) listing the name of the console as the "Xenon", a suspected codename which has been floating around since
last year. Probably not what they'll end up naming it, but there's lots of speculation that Microsoft would rather call
it the Xbox Next or the Xbox Xenon or whatever rather than the Xbox 2 since they're worried that calling it that willl
somehow make it seem like it's less powerful than the PlayStation 3.
