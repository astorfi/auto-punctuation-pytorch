Well, last year's DARPA Grand Challenge might have been a
comedy of errors, but not only has this year's robotic
Cannonball Run produced a winner, it was actually neck and neck towards the end there, with three driverless vehicles
closing in on the finish line at almost the same time. In the end, though, it was Stanford Racing Team's Stanley, a
tricked-out Volkswagen Touareg R5, that was the fastest to cover all 131.6 miles of Mojave desert and earn its creators
a sweet $2 million in prize money.


UPDATE: Our bad â€” At the time of this posting it didn't look like CMU's Red Team was going to beat
Stanford's time, looks like they just did! We'll keep an eye out for official results.
