 As promised, the Redbox Instant beta is under way, offering interested customers and employees an early peek at its blend of kiosk rentals and streaming video. With unlimited subscription video and four Blu-ray rentals per month available for just $9 we expect there to be significant interest, if you haven't already signed up for early access on the website we suggest you do so promptly. The service's apps are already available on iTunes and Google Play, although you'll need one of the access codes being doled out to activate them. Hit the source link to get on the list, until then go over the official details and wonder just what might be waiting.
