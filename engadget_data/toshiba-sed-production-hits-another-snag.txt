 Well, it looks like there's more than just "technical issues" holding up production of Toshiba's long-awaited SED TVs and keeping them away from this year's CES, with Japan Today reporting that a US lawsuit may now delay the construction of a plant to produce the high-end TV sets. The suit comes from US-based Nano-Proprietary, which had an agreement with Canon (Toshiba's partner in the SED biz), but apparently is not so keen on Canon sharing its patents with its new best buddy Toshiba. Exactly how much, if any, this latest development will delay Toshiba's planned late 2007 launch of its SED sets remains to be seen, though it sure wouldn't be the first time the launch date got pushed back.
