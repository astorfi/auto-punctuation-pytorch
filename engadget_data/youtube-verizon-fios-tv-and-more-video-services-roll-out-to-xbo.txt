Microsoft announced today that the first big wave of video services for the console are available in the Apps Marketplace, including Verizon FiOS TV for US users and Rogers on Demand for those in Canada. Those are joined by a number of other video and entertainment services including iHeartRadio and MSNBC.com (both US only), TMZ (US and Canada), and MSN Video (in Canada and some other countries, but not the US). Those outside of North America also have a few options of their own, including SBS On Demand for Australian users, Blinkbox in the UK, RTVE for Spain, and MUZU TV for a number of European countries. As for the remaining services, including the likes of Comcast and HBO Go, Microsoft is still only saying that they'll roll out later in December and in early 2012.
