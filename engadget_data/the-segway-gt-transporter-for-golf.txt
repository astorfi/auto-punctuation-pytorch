There have been rumors for awhile in the Segway circles about a golf-specific Segway and it looks like it might be
happening. The Segway GT comes equipped to carry a golf bag, ice chest, scorecard, GPS equipment, and is colored red.
We're kinda disappointed, we'd like to see more Segways replacing cars and being used as robotic platforms, but hey,
you gotta go where the green is (literally).
