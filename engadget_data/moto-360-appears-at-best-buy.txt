You don't have to wait until Motorola's September 4th event to get more details regarding the Moto 360 smartwatch, it seems -- Best Buy appears to have the scoop over two weeks early. The big-box retailer has posted a product listing for the timepiece that appears to reveal many (though not all) of the specifications. Reportedly, the device's signature not-quite-circular display is a 1.5-inch, 320 x 290 LCD. You'll also find a heart rate sensor and a pedometer, so the 360 may be a good fit if you're an amateur athlete.



Best Buy isn't saying just when the gadget will ship, although it's listing the same $249 price that we saw a couple of months ago in a contest. That's a good deal for what's arguably much nicer-looking wristwear than either the G Watch or Gear Live. However, it's probably wise to take the pricing (and possibly the specs) with a grain of salt. Motorola warned us back in June that pricing wasn't set in stone, and the mention of 802.11n WiFi is odd when existing Android Wear devices only use Bluetooth to communicate with your phone. As such, it won't be alarming if there are at least a few surprises left when the Moto 360 makes its official debut next month.
