All the cool kids car makers have their own laptop line, so Lamborghini is teaming up with Intel to intro a
portable that we hope can improve on the
Ferrari and
Hummer attempts. Not that those weren't
wonderful examples of portable design, but it looks like Lamborghini is going to be doing more than just
slapping their logo on, since they're already buddy buddy with Intel due to their usage of Intel parts inside their
cars. Neither company is in the laptop distribution business so Lamborghini will be selling these lapsters in their
online store next year. CNET Asia is expecting a good bit of next-gen intel chipsets in it which should be fun, and
while the picture to the right is just a doctored pic of a Acer notebook, we'd just like to remind the guys at
Lamborghini product design that this isn't a car mmkay? Like, for instance, we're not really concerned about crumple
zones and roll-over ratings here, it's a freaking computer guys.
