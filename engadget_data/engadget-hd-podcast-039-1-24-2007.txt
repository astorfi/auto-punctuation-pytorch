             On this special edition of the Engadget HD podcast (yeah we know they're all special at this point) we interview Kevin Collins from Microsoft who is the head HD DVD cheerleader. We ask him a few questions about where HD DVD is today and where they are going. The podcast is available now and the transcript will follow once our secretary we have time to type it up.
