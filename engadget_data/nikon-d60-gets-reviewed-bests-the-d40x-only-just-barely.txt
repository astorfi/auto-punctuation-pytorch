The major features Nikon was touting were a new image processor and vibration, and both of those seemed to make very little difference in the camera's performance, according to the folks at PhotographyBLOG. Other small features were nice additions, but most of them are too obscure to make much of a difference to most consumers. The reviewers did find the new 18-55mm VR lens option to be highly desirable, since it's nearly the same price as the standard option, and in the end gave the D60 a "highly recommended" rating.
