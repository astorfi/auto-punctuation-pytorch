Fortunately, the Motorola Admiral -- the device that we presume will become the fearless leader of the Direct Connect fleet -- is one nautical mile closer to the sea of finished products, now that we've been handed some pics of the skipper itself in the wild. It's exactly as we've expected, as it looks rather close to the version we saw in the now-pulled "official" video. According to the image snapper, the Admiral is "awkward to hold due to the bottom being so thin and the phone being very top heavy." It's also known as the XT603, and unsurprisingly runs on Moto's proprietary UI (formerly called MotoBlur). We didn't hear of any change in the specs, so for now we're still expecting to see the military-certified handset come with a 1.2GHz single-core Qualcomm MSM8655 CPU, Android 2.3, 3.1-inch VGA display, a 5MP rear camera with 720p HD video capture and a 1,860mAh battery. One more pic of the sides below. Sound off, loose cannons -- is this Admiral going to command your next two-year contract?
