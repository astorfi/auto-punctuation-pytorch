Given how close it is to the model it'll presumably be replacing, we can't help but feel like the Pre 2 should've actually been the phone we call the Pre Plus today -- and it should've launched six (or more) months ago -- but in the event webOS 2.0 doesn't come to older devices, we suppose that alone will be the impetus some current owners need to upgrade. 'Course, the 1GHz processor should be nice, too. Hit up the source link for a few more shots of it slinking around the wild; meanwhile, we await Palm's move on an official announce.
