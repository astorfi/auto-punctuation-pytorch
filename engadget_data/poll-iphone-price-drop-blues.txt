Then again, we know it's a little bit of a contradiction: c'mon, chances are if you bought an iPhone really early on you probably didn't care too much about the price anyway. Or maybe you did -- now's your chance to sound off.P.S. -Apple offers a 10 day price guarantee -- you knew that right? If you snagged an iPhone in the past ten days (we've also heard two weeks), get some of that money back!
