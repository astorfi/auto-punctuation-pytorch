       It has been a while since we have done one of these, but it is about time to start it back up again. Apple has been regularly adding high-def content to their Movie Trailers site. These trailers are encoded in H.264 and can be displayed in 480p, 720p, or 1080p. The higher resolutions requires some good 'ol CPU horsepower but if you have it, use it. These trailers are simply stunning in HD. If you only have a few minutes to spare, the HDBeat team would recommend you watch the trailer for ether Babel or Children of Men. Both look like they are going to be great films and the trailers look amazing in high-def. If you have a few more minutes to kill, check out The Prestige staring Christopher Bale of Batman Begins fame and then American Hardcore's view of music in the eighties. Both are great. We are sorry to report though the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles trailer is -- well, its a waste of bandwidth.
