Rumors are circulating that Nokia's first extra-large smartphone, possibly called the Lumia 1520, is near launch. If it's real, you might be looking at it -- Windows Phone Central has obtained a photo that purportedly shows the device for the first time. The snapshot presents a behemoth that makes even the Lumia 1020 look dainty. Unfortunately, there's little to corroborate claims that a quad-core processor, a 20-megapixel camera and Windows Phone 8 GDR3 lurk inside. We've also seen a previous fake that looks like this, although the new phone's bezel both matches that from a July part rumor and carries the prototype stamp common to Nokia test units. When there's talk of Nokia unveiling the 1520 in late September alongside a Windows tablet, we may learn the truth behind the photo within a few weeks.
