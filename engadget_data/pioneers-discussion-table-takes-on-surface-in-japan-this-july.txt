The company's Surface competitor, the WWS-DT101 Discussion Table, we spotted back in December is finally coming to market this July... in Japan anyway. Up top is a 52-inch, 1920 Ã— 1080, multitouch glass slab powered by a Core i7 processor and 6GB of RAM. On the software side you're looking at Windows 7 and a proprietary interface called SCHEDA that has the ability to wirelessly pull content from laptops, tablets, smartphones and cameras. It also has a built-in scanner for quickly turning dead tree documents into manipulatable "cards," and teleconferencing capabilities. There's no set price, but we expect it fall in the same range as Surface -- somewhere between unaffordable and unreasonable.
