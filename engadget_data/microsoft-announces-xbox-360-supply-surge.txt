 Since late last year when the first volley of Xbox 360s sold out near instantaneously we've been hearing thenoise of Microsoft's wheels in motion to crank out more consoles. Well, today apparently they've "turned a majorcorner" as Peter Moore announced -- four to six weekslater -- that as of this week they're doubling to tripling their output to retailers. In other words, if you'vebeen having a hard time getting your hands on a device (and are now especially disinclined to wait around until fall / winter for aPlayStation 3), this could be the week you have to call mom and ask for that loan after all.
