They'll be selling select Inspiron and XPS desktop with whatever flavor of XP you choose up until June 26th, at precisely 6:59AM EST. Naturally after June 26 you'll be able to buy a Vista Biz or Ultimate machine and downgrade to XP Pro, but we'll hope it doesn't have to come to that. We heard that one guy even got a printer to work with Vista. Things are looking up, folks![Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
