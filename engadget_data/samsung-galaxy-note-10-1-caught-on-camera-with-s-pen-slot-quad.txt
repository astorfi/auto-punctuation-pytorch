While the company went on the record to shoot down that pesky rumor, it remained suspiciously mum where the Galaxy Note 10.1 was concerned. Now, thanks to a brief video demo over on German site All About Samsung, it appears the formerly dual-core slate refresh we had a chance to preview back in March could, indeed, be set for a processor swap. Though it's still far from official, the new Note 10.1 shown above looks to be sharing not only some of the Galaxy S III's specs -- quad-core Exynos processor with Mali 400 MP GPU and a TouchWizzed Android 4.0.4-- but also that formerly problematic Pebble Blue finish. And much to our delight, it also appears as if the company's revised the tablet's design slightly, adding in a convenient slot on the lower left hand side for S-Pen stowage. Not convinced by mere words alone? The head past the break for video evidence of this purported hardware upgrade.
