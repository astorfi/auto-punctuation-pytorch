  This week was a little slow for news, so we decided to try out a live chat room in USTREAM alongside our podcast, just to keep the degree of difficulty up. Between weaving in and out of conversations, we had a lot of talk about DVRs -- DirecTV is working on adding features, Moxi is lowering the barrier to entry, and TiVo is letting the competition catch up. The old red vs. blu topic came up for the first time in a long time, but Warner's Red2Blu trade-in program is more "assimilation/reconstruction" than "war." The next fight that comes to an end could very well be plasma vs. LCD, but from the reviews of Panasonic's 2009 plasma TVs that are coming in, it looks like plasma will go down swinging. Finally, the NFL managed to sneak onto the podcast with HD draft coverage. Thanks to all who joined us in the chat room; we'll spill the beans on getting you involved with the podcast as soon as we have a plan!
