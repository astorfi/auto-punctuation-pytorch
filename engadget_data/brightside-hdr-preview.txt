matter how much you spent on your HDTV, or what amazing Apple Cinema
display you are reading this post on, Brightside Technology thinks you
haven't seen anything yet. As we reported earlier,
they are taking LCD's and displays in general to the next step, by
producing greater contrast ratios (200k:1), which will increase the
quality of the picture we get from all currently available displays.HDR
lighting is quickly becoming all the rage in games, it was used to
create the realistic screenshot you see here, and also in Half Life 2:
The Lost Coast, and Project Gotham 3.
No matter what system or graphics card however, even the best CRT
screens are not capable of displaying light throughout the full range
your eyes can see, but an HDR display will. Even the 1,000,000:1 display ratio LCD that was recently announced can at it's maximum only get 1/8th as bright as their HDR display.They
say by combining their technology with all the money invested in LCD
production already, we will have affordable HDR displays within a
couple years. Click the link and see what Bit-tech has to say about
their peek at the future.[Thanks Joe for the link]
