 Hewlett-Packard didn't have the best 2012, but that's not stopping the US company from getting on the Chromebook bandwagon. The HP Chromebook Pavilion was spotted by Slashgear on HP's own web store, despite the additional information section noting a February 17 "ad embargo" on the information. The little 14-inch Chromebook runs Google's eponymous OS with an Intel Celeron 847 CPU clocked at 1.1GHz, an Intel HD GPU, 2GB of DDR3 SDRAM (expandable up to 4GB), and 16GB of SSD storage space, put to use on the 14-inch HD BrightView LED-backlit display (1366 x 768 resolution). A trio of old-school USB 2.0 slots an HDMI out, and an ethernet jack make up the lion's share of ports, while an SD card slot adds expandable storage options. The 2.55Ah lithium-ion battery included will last up to (approximately) four hours and 15 minutes, though we'd like to put that to the test ourselves before trusting the specs sheet. Of course, it looks like it won't be too long before we hear more and get our hands on the device, given that Feb. 17th date.
