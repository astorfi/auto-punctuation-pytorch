The world record-holding Mitsubishi displays at the center of Cowboys Stadium will this weekend be treated to the first public demo of a new real time 3D conversion technology from HDlogix. Touted as a glasses-free autostereoscopic method, it will be demonstrated before Sunday's game against the Chargers, and used during the game on highlights and live video to give the good people of Dallas an extra dimension to their already supersized visual experience. The list of promises from HDlogix is mighty impressive, including the ability to convert to and from all the 3D standards floating around at the moment (more on that in the source PDF below), but we advise waiting until Sunday when said good people can judge for themselves. Full PR after the break.

Update: We've received a quick note from the company to say that the actual feed on the Cowboys' megatron will be based on old school glasses-needy anaglyphs, since the humongous structure isn't capable of doing the more sophisticated stuff.
