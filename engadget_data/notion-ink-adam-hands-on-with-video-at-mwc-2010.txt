Like we heard a week or so ago, there will indeed be two versions of the Adam -- one which will be 12.9 mm thick and boast the Pixel Qi 3Qi e-paper screen, and another, thinner, non-Pixel Qi screen. The thinner, lighter version will measure in at 11.6 mm thick. As far as we know, the only difference in the two Tegra-powered Adams will be the display, and we also hear they are shooting for a third quarter of 2010 launch. The prototype on hand at MWC was not working, so one of the Adam's developers was kind enough to shoot a demo video of a working unit for us (and its Flash support) -- which is after the break.
