 Skullcandy hasn't made any official headphone-related announcements at CES -- but that doesn't mean there isn't news to share. We've just been tipped about a bass-pumping followup to its now-defunct Skullcrusher headphones, set to release as the Crusher. The circumaural cans are said to be designed and engineered in-house, though they do look similar to Logitech UE's over-ears. As we understand it, the "crushing sensation" is handled by a vibrating unit inside of each earcup that's independent from its actual 40mm speaker drivers. Impressively, we're told that the lowend will still pump out if the battery dies unlike similar offerings, such as Sony's Pulse gaming headset. An on-earcup control lets you dial in your preferred level of wub, and the earcups can collapse and rotate for storage. Naturally, a detachable 3.5mm cable with an inline remote / mic is also included. Expect these to hit shelves during March clad in your choice of black, white or red for a cool 100 bones. That's all we've got for now, so keep it locked to our coverage of the show while we try to spot 'em ourselves.
