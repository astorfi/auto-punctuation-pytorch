The ASUS-built Nexus 7 is now receiving the update -- a 12.6MB download that boosts the version number to 4.1.1. Our in-house unit isn't pulling down the new edition just yet (nor is our Galaxy Nexus), so it seems to be one of Google's typical phased releases. At any rate, Android Central is reporting that the code "improves performance and responsiveness system wide," while also adding Google Wallet to your app library. Seeing anything else? Let us know in comments below!
