Yeah, it's for real, Engadget reader/shopper Jereme Tupa swung by the store on a recent visit to Kuala Lumpur and captured some nice footage of a very nervous-looking clerk denying that he'd ever heard of Engadget the website. Whatever, dude, we're not going to sue you or anything, but don't front that you didn't swipe both our name and our logo. Just fess up (and maybe throw in a nice little gift certificate to your shop) and we'll let it slide.WATCH - StorefrontWATCH - Denial
