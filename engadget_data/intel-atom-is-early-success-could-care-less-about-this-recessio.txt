 Things are looking rosy in Intel's land of Atom, the little chip that could. Early reports from the chip maker indicate that Atom sales are brisk. After declaring a 25% rise in quarterly profit, Intel noted that the MID, netbook, and embedded-friendly Atom isn't cannibalizing sales of its traditional processors. In fact, it notes that Atom chips are creating a completely new money machine. Intel calls Atom a "perfect recession product" as it plays well into people's desire to pick up a second PC or a low-cost small computer for kids. Meanwhile, the embedded market hasn't even been reported yet. Once those numbers come in, it will probably be time to call Atom a success.
