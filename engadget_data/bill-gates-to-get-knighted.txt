Bill Gates is about to score something money can't buy (and no, it isn't your respect or a back rub from Linus
Torvalds): an honorary knighthood. Queen Elizabeth is going to make him a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order
of the British Empire in recognition of his "outstanding contribution to enterprise." You won't have to call him "Sir
William" or anything like that (unless that's your thing, that is)â€”only citizens of Britain and the British
Commonwealth get that privilege.
