An optional, integrated web-cam is now available in thevenerable DV1000, which appears to havea new DV1000t designation. HP also includes an update to their QuickPlay (v2.0) technology so you can view or listen tomedia or check your pics without a full system boot. Pricing on the budget line starts at $749, but those nice HP peepsare offering a $50 rebate.

Storage maxes out at 120GB, whichcould be tight if you go with the WMCE option. The typical standards of built-in optical drive, HP QuickPlay, 6-in-1card reader and 6-cell batter round out the capable, but lower-end laptop.Not to be left out fromthe CES announcements, the DV8000 also has some new tricks: the Windows Media Center Edition operating system is anavailable option, as is HP's Ultra BrightView display technology, which adds a second lamp over the standard 17-inchBrightView LCD. Gotta have more horsepower for WMCE on the DV8000? HP's got your back with an available option for aspeedy-fast AMD Turion 64 processor. Is it just us or didn't we hear about that late last year? Either way, the new-ishDV8000 line starts
