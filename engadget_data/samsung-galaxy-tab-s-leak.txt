Samsung has already launched a cavalcade of new Android tablets this year, but it looks like the company isn't quite done yet. SamMobile claims to have the first photos of the Galaxy Tab S 10.5, a recently rumored Android design that would mark Samsung's return to slates with OLED displays. As the name suggests, it would have a 10.5-inch, 2,560 x 1,600 AMOLED panel that promises higher contrast and bolder colors than an LCD; there's reportedly an 8.4-inch equivalent in the works, too.



          
 
 
 However, the hardware surrounding that display may be as much of an attention-getter. Where the Tab Pro range aped the Galaxy Note 3, the Tab S looks like a Galaxy S5 writ large -- you'd get the same dimpled plastic back and, apparently, the same fingerprint sensor. Connectors on the back also hint at a possible smart screen cover. About the only disappointment may be the performance, since there's talk of the Tab S carrying the same 1.9GHz Exynos 5 Octa processor that we saw in the Tab Pro early this year. Assuming the leak is accurate, the biggest mystery may be when this (mostly) upgraded device hits store shelves.
