It's thin, it's solid, but it's still hard drive based, which for our flash-loving selves will always be kind of a bummer. But if you're the type that carries around 80 (or 160 friggin gigs) of media and you like to use iPods, this is the new king of the hill. (Photographed is the 80GB model, not the thicker 160GB iPod.) Unfortunately, tasks like Cover Flow ran about as (un)smoothly as on the nano, so if you're expecting a fully iPhone-like experience, don't get your hopes up.P.S. -The new shuffles were difficult to find, but we also threw a couple shots of those in the gallery for good measure.
