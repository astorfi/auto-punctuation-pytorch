The latter said in an official post earlier today that an over-the-air update would arrive to fix such an issue, and like that, our Google TV box prompted us to download a 163MB file denoted update 39953. We've heard from a number of tipsters, too, who claim to have received the patch. Will this fix all the stuttering? We're hearing mostly yeas in that regard, so don't be shy, give the set-top another go -- and let us know if you see anything else that's new or improved.

[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
