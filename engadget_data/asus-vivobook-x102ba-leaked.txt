Families are all about growing -- an honest case of "the more, the merrier," if you will. Now, according to our friends over at SweClockers, ASUS is getting ready to make its own Vivo family a little larger by introducing the VivoBook X102BA. This leaked Windows 8 PC reportedly packs some pretty run-of-the-mill specs, including a 1.0GHz, dual-core AMD A4-1200 CPU (with Radeon HD 8180 for graphics), 2GB of RAM and a 320GB hard drive. What's also of interest here is that ASUS is said to be bundling it with Microsoft Office Home & Student 2013, which would certainly be a useful tool to interested parties. Per the report, the ASUS VivoBook X102BA will launch sometime in September for around 330 euros, or about 440 bucks if you're this side of the pond.
