The product page actually calls it the 'Vostro Success 360' to hammer home its productivity focus, as if the inclusion of Windows 7 Professional Edition wasn't enough. Other specs are pretty much as expected: a choice of touchscreen or non-touchscreen variants of the 23-inch Full HD WLED display, Intel i3 or i5 processors with the H61 chipset and up to a terabyte of 7200RPM storage. There's also a 1GB NVIDIA GeForce GT 525M for those out-of-hours LAN parties. The 4,999 Yuan price tag for the base model translates to a respectable $780, but we've no clue as to when this office beauty will arrive outside the Chung Kuo.
