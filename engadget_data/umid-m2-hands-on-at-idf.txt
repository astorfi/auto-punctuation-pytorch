The major fix is that there's now a regular USB port on the side, instead of the M1's goofy dongle, but we're also glad to see a 3.5mm headphone jack and a (tiny) trackpad with two mouse buttons flanking the screen. Yeah, it's still a quirky little MID, but hey, maybe that does it for you. We're not here to judge what you do with the gallery below.
