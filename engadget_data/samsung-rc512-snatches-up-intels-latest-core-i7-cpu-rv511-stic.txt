First up is the RC512 (pictured above), and the 15-inch machine is all about power -- it packs Intel's newest Core i7-2630M processor, 6GB of DDR3 memory, discrete NVIDIA GeForce 430 graphics, a Blu-ray drive, and a 750GB hard drive. For $1,150 it sounds mighty nice and even better it should be available in the coming weeks. Looking for something for half the price? The $600 15.6-inch RV511 (picture after the break) may do the trick -- well, if a Core i3-380M CPU, 4GB of RAM, and a 500GB hard drive works for you. That's all we've got for now on the duo, but if they're anything like the QX410 we recently reviewed, Samsung's going to be finding itself near the top of our favorite laptop manufacturer list.
