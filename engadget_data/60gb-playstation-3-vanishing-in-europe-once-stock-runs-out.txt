If you'll recall, Sony already pulled the plug on the 60 gigger here in the US, and now it seems that it will face a similar fate across the pond. According to Nick Sharples, director of corporate communications for Sony in Europe, "anyone who wants to buy a 60GB PS3 for Christmas is not going to have a problem," so those desperately needing an extra bit of HDD space (and / or backwards compatibility for PS2 titles) should be alright through the end of the year.[Via IGN, thanks Alan]
