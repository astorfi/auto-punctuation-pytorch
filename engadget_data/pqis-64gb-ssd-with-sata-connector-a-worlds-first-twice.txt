But these drives are also the world's first to sport SATA. That's right, thick juicy SATA which should make it possible to do a one-for-one swap with your existing laptop's spinner. So check it DV editors, before the end of the month you too will have access to ultra-fast flash for your video. No word on pricing yet, but 64GB of NAND on a SATA interface will likely buck the trend of falling SSD prices. Temporarily anyway.
