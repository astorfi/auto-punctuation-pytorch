Picture the scene: You're doing your laundry, separating silken "intimates" from your jeans, but you don't have enough time to wash both before you go out. You fall to the floor and beat the ground with your fists, cursing your inability to plan ahead. But then you remember that you bought LG's Twin Wash, a front-loading washing machine that has a dainty secondary washing machine tucked into the pedestal. Now you can throw those jeans into the main tub and still have room for your delicates!





According to LG, rather than being a single product, the secondary washer can be purchased separately and integrated with any of the company's most recent front-loading machines. In terms of the specs that matter, the slim inverter direct-drive motor comes with a 10-year warranty as well as the company's smart diagnosis feature. No, we don't know what it means either, but it sounds pretty hardcore, right? There's no word on pricing or availability, but rest assured, we'll be soiling our delicates and testing this out as and when we can.
