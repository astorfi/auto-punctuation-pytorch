Lenovo already treated us to a slew of new ThinkPad machines, and now it's time for the Idea line to get its due. Up first, we've got the IdeaCentre A300, which is hailed as the industry's thinnest all-in-one desktop. Measuring just 18.5mm deep, the 21.5-inch machine sports a 1080p LED panel, Core 2 Duo CPU, WiFi and a bundled Bluetooth keyboard / mouse. The IdeaPad S10-3t (shown above) is the industry's first multitouch capacitive netbook tablet, with Lenovo trumpeting the device's ability to easily recognize fingertip input and plow through chores with an Atom N470 CPU and a 320GB hard drive. Moving right along, the 14-inch Y460 and 15.6-inch Y560 offer up respectable multimedia performance on a budget, while the 20-inch Lenovo C310 goes down as the company's first multitouch all-in-one desktop. The Core i7-equipped IdeaCentre K320 caters to the gamers, and the G460 / G560 lappies are slated to suit those "mainstream" users who just need something basic to handle... well, the basics. Pricing, availability and detailed specifications await you just beyond the break.
