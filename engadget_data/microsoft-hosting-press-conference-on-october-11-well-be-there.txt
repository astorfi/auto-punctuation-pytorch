Microsoft has just gotten in touch to ask us very kindly to "save the date" October 11 for a 2PM London press conference (9AM ET for Americans) that will last all the way until 5.30PM. Unless Steve Ballmer's planning on reading the Iliad all that time, that sounds like there'll be hands-on opportunities with WP7 devices to us. Of course, there's nary a mention of any phones in the brief invite, but given the multiple sources nailing that exact date as Microsoft's European launch, we'd be shocked to see anything else. Either way, we're bringing our trusty liveblogging equipment and will keep you informed whatever happens.
