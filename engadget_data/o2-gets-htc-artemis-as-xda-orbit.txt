The "Xda Orbit" brings all of that GPS, trackball, and WiFi goodness in a slightly more conservative package -- it's by no means ugly, just not as nifty as the original Artemis we're used to seeing strut its stuff. Look for the Xda Orbit to drop complete with a 512MB microSD card loaded with maps of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland for â‚¬249.99 (about $315) on contract in the next few weeks.[Via the::unwired]
