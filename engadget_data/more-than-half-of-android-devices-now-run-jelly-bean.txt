It may have taken almost a year and a half, but Google can at last say that the absolute majority of active Android devices are using some form of Jelly Bean. The company's OS dashboard shows that 52.1 percent of owners are running at least Android 4.1; most of those (37.3 percent of the total) rely on the oldest version, but Android 4.2's use has already doubled since August. Jelly Bean's reign may be short-lived, however. The milestone comes just as Android 4.4 KitKat is reaching the public -- given Google's focus on supporting as many devices as possible with the new OS, it may not be long before Jelly Bean is once again in the minority.
