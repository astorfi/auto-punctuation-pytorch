Want to be able to "print" a flat-panel
display using an inkjet printer? Well, you can't try it at home, but several companies are already doing it, using
special printers that print light-emitting polymers onto sheets of glass or plastic. The resulting polymer OLED (PLED)
displays can be produced at a lower cost than conventional LCDs. While most PLED production is currently limited to
small quantities and specialty products (though 40-inch PLED displays have been demoed), Ian Chao of U.K.-based
PLED-producer Cambridge Display Technologies, sees PLED TVs hitting the market within two years. Which should be just
in time for us to buy another set.
