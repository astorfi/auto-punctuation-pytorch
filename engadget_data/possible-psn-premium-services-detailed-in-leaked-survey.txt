Not only is it easy to fake (although this one sounds fairly legit and has popped up elsewhere), but the questions posed could be purely theoretical. That caveat aside, there's a bunch of very interesting stuff in this list of features we just got from someone who claims to have done a survey for Sony about its plans to charge for "premium" PlayStation Network content. The actual subscription costs flung around ranged from $20 to $60 a year, or alternatively $6 to $9 a month, and while some features might sound familiar to Xbox Live members, there's plenty of innovative stuff here that we wouldn't mind seeing pop up on either platform, including:

Customer Service Priority Access
Exclusive Experiences with Sony Brands
Extended Console Warranty 3 Years
Access to Beta Games
Early Access to All Store Content
Member Demo Sharing of Full Game
Cross-game Voice Chat Access
Full Title Trial - 1st Hour Is Free
Token Wagering
User-to-user Challenges
Free Access to PSOne Classics, PSP Minis, and PS3/PSP Themes
Discounts on Store Content
Member Only In-game Content
Trophy Alerts
Cloud Storage Space for Games
Online Music Service
Online Music Video Service
Automatic Downloads and Updates
Loyalty Program Rewards
Facebook Connectivity
Catch-up TV
Netflix Access Without Disc

What a mouthful! There are definitions of all these after the break, and while the survey seems to imply that not all of these would be available in whatever paid service Sony launches, we could imagine quite a few PS3 users (ourselves, for instance) shelling out cash for some of the perks listed -- as long as they can swallow their Xbox Live Gold-deriding pride.
