A new Evernote for Mac update is available in the App Store today, and it includes a variety of features for both the free and premium versions. In addition to a nifty highlighting tool, Evernote is improving Skitch integration to simplify annotating and sharing notes. Clicking the Skitch icon in the editor launches the app, allowing users to annotate their notes in Skitch before saving them to Evernote. Premium subscribers can edit full notes in Skitch as PDFs, while free users will have to settle for annotating images only. Lastly, attached documents can now be previewed within notes, though document search is limited to premium account holders. To download the update, head on over to the source link below.
