 We've been hearing rumblings of inventor extraordinaire Dean Kamen's latest project: building a next-gen robotic prosthesis for soldiers wounded in the war. Details are still light, but apparently initial prototypes have been fabbed, and at TED Dean showed off an early video of the arm in action, performing such precise actions as picking up a pen and scratching a nose. Apparently it weighs six pounds, but we're sorely lacking information on this thing right now -- like whether or not you'll be able to install gyro-wheels and balance yourself -- so watch out for what some are hoping will be the new Cadillac of limb prosthetics in the coming months.
