Not content with Sony's official teardown of the PlayStation 4, iFixit has started work on its own thorough analysis of the console's internals. The dissection isn't complete yet, but early evidence shows that Sony is using standard measures to deter modders and tinkerers, including security screws and lengthy passages in the user guide about how "analysis" of the PS4's components is "not authorized." (With the replaceable hard drive being an awkward exception.) Now, this happens to be exactly the sort of language that gets up iFixit's nose, and it could well hurt the PS4's score for repairability and recyclability. The site also reports a potential issue with the HDMI port, spotted earlier by Kotaku, in which a small metal obstruction in front of the port on some units could potentially stop video output if you're not careful when you first plug in your cable (although the HDMI pins can apparently be bent back into position). In any case, we'll update this post as soon as the experts have splayed everything out and come to a verdict.


Update: Though you might expect a low repairability score from a gaming console -- especially in a smallish case like Sony's Playstation 4 -- iFixit gave it eight out of 10. All things considered, that's an excellent mark, which the teardown site chalked up to the absence of adhesives and a non-proprietary, user-replaceable hard drive. Security screws and tamper seals put a slight damper on things, but the biggest markdown came from a sharp mid-plane which resulted in a cut finger. Naturally, the site included a pic of said wound, adding that "we wear our repair scars with pride."
