Every once in a while, though, one'll break through -- take the Xperia X10, for example, which has now been announced for release on NTT DoCoMo simply as the "Smartphone Xperia," making it the first major carrier anywhere to announce a branded deal on the set. It looks to be a pretty faithful carry-over of the same custom Android skin Sony Ericsson is launching elsewhere and features 7.2Mbps down / 2.0Mbps up, WiFi, an 8.1 megapixel cam, and availability in "Sensuous Black" and "Luster White." It'll be hitting in April -- right about the same time we suspect it'll be launching elsewhere.
