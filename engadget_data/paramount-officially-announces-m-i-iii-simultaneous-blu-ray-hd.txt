 We may be able to forgive Paramount for the relatively small number of high-def discs they plan to release this year as they have announced what appears to be only the second tri-format day-and-date release on Blu-ray, HD DVD & DVD, after The Lake House. Mission: Impossible III will come on HD DVD with all the special features we told you about on the same day as the standard-def DVD release, but it will also come out on Blu-ray complete with high-def extras, DD+ soundtracks and all...except for the HD DVD-exclusive picture-in-picture enhanced commentary from star Tom Cruise and director J.J. Abrams. The MSRP is set at $19.99 for the standard DVD, $24.99 for the collectors edition, and $29.99 for both HD DVD and Blu-ray. Blu-ray fans finally have a blockbuster to look forward to this winter, unfortunately they're still coming up short on the extras, we have to wonder if the home release of Superman Returns will suffer the same cuts.
