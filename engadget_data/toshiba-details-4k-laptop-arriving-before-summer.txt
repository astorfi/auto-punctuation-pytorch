Toshiba has just dished most of the important details about its intriguing 4K Satellite P50t that we saw at CES 2014, along with some other new models. Unfortunately, it's left some info hanging -- namely the all-important prices. For the most part, the Satellite 50t model sounds pretty fine, considering the sleek 2.2kg (4.8 pound) weight. There's that exotic 282 pixel per inch 3,840 x 2,160, 15.6-inch touchscreen, driven by 2GB AMD Radeon R9 M265 graphics, for starters (1080p is optional). It's also packing an Intel Core-i7 CPU, 16GB DDR3L RAM, 4 USB 3.0 ports, an SD/SDHC slot, Bluetooth 4.0, 802.11ac WiFi and Windows 8.1. Oddly, the otherwise well-spec'd device only features a 1TB mechanical disk option, when it's clearly screaming for SSD speed -- hopefully Toshiba will rectify that prior to release. Availability is listed as sometime in Q2, but again, there's no clue about pricing. Meanwhile, Toshiba's also detailed a few other models after the break.



          
 
 
 Slipping down the scale are Toshiba's S50 (15.6-inch, 4.5 pounds) and S70 (17-inch, 5.9 pounds) laptops. Those eschew 4K for 720p, 900p or 1080p displays with optional touch, and use either Intel HD or AMD's Radeon R9 discreet graphics. Except for fewer USB 3.0 ports (two instead of four), the CPU and other features are the same as the P50t. The Satellite C50/C70 and L50/L70 models round out the new range. Each is available in 15.6-inch and 17-inch models, but the L50/L70 maxes out at 1,920 x 1,080, while the 15.6-inch C50 packs a 1,366 x 768 screen and the 17-inch C70 can do 1,600 x 900 (touch is optional for most models). As for the rest of the specs, there's a dizzying array of options. Depending on the size and model, you can get Intel Core-i7 or AMD chips, 8-16GB RAM max, up to a 1TB hybrid SSD and Blue-ray drives. There are too many configurations to detail here, but if you're still intrigued, check the galleries or sources below.
