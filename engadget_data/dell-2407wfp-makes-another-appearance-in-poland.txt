(We first caught the peripatetic peripheral on Dell's Japan site, and the specs -- but no pricing or ordering info -- later showed up in the US.) According to the site, the 24-inch, 1920 x1200 display will go for 4,634 zloties, or about $1,535, including VAT. That's roughly in line with  Japan's ¥157,500 (or about $1,400), though what we really want to see is a US price, already. And one that's lower than $1,400, of course.[Thanks, Krzysiek]
