We know you wouldn't, o ye faithful Engadget Mobile Devotee, and you'd also know that we have so much to talk about this week that we slide past the two-hour mark in this, the first Engadget Mobile Podcast of the crazy post-I/O era. If you would believe us, then well! have we got some good stories for you. Gather 'round the glowing orb and plug in.
