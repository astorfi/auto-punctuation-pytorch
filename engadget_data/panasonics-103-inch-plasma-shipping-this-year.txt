Well, startpinchin' those pennies son, cause Panny is putting them on sale in time for the holidays. This 7.5 x 4.2-foot (8.5-footdiagonal) plasma goes 16:9 and throws up a 1920 x 1080 resolution, 3000:1 contrast ratio and features Panasonic's 1080pHD high-speed pixel drive we've already seen in their 65-incher. Theperfect, er, accessory for their DMP-BD10 Blu-rayplayer, no doubt. Sorry, no pricing announced -- but if you gotta ask, you can't afford it. [Via NewLaunches]
