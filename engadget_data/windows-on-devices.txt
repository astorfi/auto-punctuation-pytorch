A Windows on Devices site has apparated into existence, mentioning robots, talking bears, the Internet of Things and Intel's Galileo acting as developmental hardware. It looks like Microsoft's planning a charm offensive on the maker community, with the site linking out to a Big-styled -- presumably Microsoft-powered -- floor keyboard as well as Maker Faire. The first SDK will appear soon, (by the end of Spring 2014) with additional releases through out the year. Microsoft says it'll have a life-sized piano to show-off its Windows on Devices conceit and naturally, it reckons its cloud services will serve as the perfect online accompaniment.
