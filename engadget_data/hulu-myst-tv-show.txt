It's a good day for point-and-click fans. After the news that you can now play Grim Fandango Remastered on your morning commute, it seems like the '90s classic Myst is getting its own TV series. According to Deadline, a drama series that explores the origin of the game's eponymous island is coming to streaming service Hulu. For those that don't know, Myst was a huge hit in its day; its innovative storytelling methods and stunning graphics made it the best-selling PC game of the decade.



The show is being reportedly being developed by Legendary Television, with Evan Daugherty (writer of Snow White and the Huntsman, Divergent and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) handling the script and Matt Tolmach (who's responsible for the most-recent Spider-Man movies and the upcoming Sinister Six) producing. Those names -- or more specifically the projects they've worked on -- might not fill you with confidence, but if there's a love for the source material, this might turn out okay.
