Love Uber, but hate surge pricing? We get you, and so does Uber. During the LAUNCH conference in San Francisco Monday, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick says he wants to take the sting out of surge pricing -- by letting you know when it's over. If you get hit with a case of sticker shock, the company is working on a new feature that will notify you via push notification when prices are back down to normal. Kalanick says that sometimes surge pricing can last just a few minutes. All told, that means if you're willing to wait an extra 15 to head to the club, you could potentially save enough cash to buy a round of drinks once you get there.
