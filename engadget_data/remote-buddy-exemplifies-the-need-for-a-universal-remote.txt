This borderline-comical storage unit has enough room for four of your favorite clickers and one ice cold beverage, but oddly enough, there's no basket for holding your day-old tater tots or marginally stale Fritos. Still, it does boast a built-in panel that will automatically buzz a lost remote in case you misplace it, which totally makes up for any other oversights in design. Of course, we'd recommend putting the $59.98 that this costs towards a decent universal remote, but at least this piece is less embarrassing than the infamous Remote Wrangler.[Thanks, Juergen]
