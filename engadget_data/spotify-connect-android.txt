A couple of months ago, Spotify Connect was announced for iOS -- a feature that allows you to wirelessly control (via your home WiFi network or mobile data) music playing on Connect-compatible speakers with your phone. Good news for Spotify users with Premium accounts and Android devices today, as their version of the app has now been endowed with all of Connect's powers. Of course, the number of devices currently compatible with the feature is fairly slim, as Pioneer and Bang and Olufsen are Spotify's only official partners. But, 'tis the season and there are some quality, if pricey, Connect-enabled speakers and receivers to be had -- remember, kids, Santa only brings you what you ask for.
