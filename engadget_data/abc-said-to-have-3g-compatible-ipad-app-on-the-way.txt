Barring some unforeseen issues, that seems to be all but assured, and it will presumably function much like the Netflix app by knocking things down to a lower bitrate when you leave your WiFi comfort zone. Still no official word from ABC on this, but we'd suggest keeping a close eye on the app store if you've been craving some Dancing with the Stars on the go.
