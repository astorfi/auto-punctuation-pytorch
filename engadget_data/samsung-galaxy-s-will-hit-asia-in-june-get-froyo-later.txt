Unsubsidized, this 4-inch beastie will cost you S$1,098 (or around $775), which might be a little on the steep side, but then this is one of only a pair of Super AMOLED handsets on the market and Samsung makes the other one. And in case you want an alternative closer to home, Amazon's German portal is now listing the Galaxy S for pre-order at â‚¬649, which works out to about the same price. The best news from today, however, is probably Samsung's official confirmation that the phone will be getting an Android 2.2 upgrade at some point in its future. No specifics are given as yet, but we'll take our Froyo whenever and wherever we can get it.
