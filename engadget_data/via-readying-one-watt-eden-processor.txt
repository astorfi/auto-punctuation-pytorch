 Apparently, VIA is hoping to stretch the battery life of devices that sport its forthcoming ULV processor, as the chip manages to hum along at 500MHz yet only consumes one-watt of power. According to DigiTimes, the company announced the CPU during a press conference held yesterday, and also noted that it will "adopt the same VIA V4 bus and 21- x 21-millimeter nanoBGA2 packaging as other Eden models." Reportedly, several industrial PC makers "including Advantech have already adopted the new Eden ULV processor" and hopes to have products shipping to market later this month, and if this thing actually does sip power as its creator suggests, we've all ideas Advantech won't be the last firm placing an order.[Via Wired]
