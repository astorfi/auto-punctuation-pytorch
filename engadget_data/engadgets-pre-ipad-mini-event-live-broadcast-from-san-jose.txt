 
 Apple has a "little more" to show us and we've got a little more to show you, by which we mean our handsome faces. Chances are you couldn't make it out to San Jose yourselves and scoring an invite to Apple press events is a pretty tough proposition for the general public. So join us here and live vicariously through our coverage of what is shaping up to be a slightly more understated event from Apple than usual. You can enjoy all the liveblog action here but, before that, Tim Stevens and Darren Murph will be having a live chat from outside the venue. Click on through to get your stream on.
