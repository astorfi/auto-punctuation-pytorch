Look, until Firefox/Mozilla goes mobile (it'll happen, we swear), we're not gonna pretend to be perennially
satisfied with Pocket IE, Blazer, or whatever crap got embedded into your non-smartphone. Which is why we were down
with Opera Mobile (which previously came on the Windows Mobile and Symbian Series 60 platforms), and now their latest,
Opera Mini. Yes, finally you can escape your phone's embedded biz if you can run J2ME apps. Mini doesn't pull pages
directly, but is kind of like a browser-front end, so you can be assured that Opera's speed and screen-crunching powers
will work their magic without you having to download a 4MB JAVA app every time you want to get on the Internet. Happy
browsing!
