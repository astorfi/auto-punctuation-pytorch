The company has also announced that while its investigation into the incident is "ongoing," it has already addressed the preliminary finding that the explosion was "likely due to an explosion of aluminum dust in a ventilation duct." To that end, it says it has put in place "improvements in workshop ventilation," as well as a "a total revamping of the policies and practices related to the disposal of that dust."
