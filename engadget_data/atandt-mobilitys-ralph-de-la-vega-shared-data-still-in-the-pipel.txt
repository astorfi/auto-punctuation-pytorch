At the time, the AT&T Mobility CEO was coy about a specific launch window for the service, saying only that users could expect the feature sometime soon. We're already well into the new year now and it appears de la Vega still hasn't changed his timing tune. In a post-keynote interview, he revealed the carrier's continued commitment to providing the feature, while also acknowledging the inherent difficulties in bringing it to market. When it does eventually go live, subs can look forward to spreading those MBs across devices (phone and tablets, anyone?), as well as fisticuffing with data-hoggy family members.
