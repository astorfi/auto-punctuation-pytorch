 As the evolution of flash memory (and CompactFlash in particular) continues on, it looks like the CompactFlash Association is gearing up to create a CF card with a SATA interface. Reportedly, the CFA has assembled a working group to "develop a specification for a CompactFlash card with a Serial ATA interface," as it looks to broaden the market appeal of CompactFlash and exceed the current 133MB/second interface data rate. Regrettably, we've no idea when these newfangled devices are slated to go commercial, but we'd recommend that you start saving right about now anyway.[Thanks, Mark]
