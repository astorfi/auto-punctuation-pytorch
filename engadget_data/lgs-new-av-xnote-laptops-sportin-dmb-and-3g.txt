There's also some hefty 256MB ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 going on, along with 2GB max RAM, 160GB max SATA HDD, 5-in-1 card reader and 5.1 Dolby surround sound. The laptops run WMCE 2005, and are sporting DVB-T or DMB and EV-DO to top it all off. No word on price, but these should be available this month in Korea and Europe.[Via I4U]
