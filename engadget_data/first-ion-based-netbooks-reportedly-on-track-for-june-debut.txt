 Nothing is completely official just yet, but Pocket-lint is reporting that its inside source at NVIDIA has "confirmed" that the initial batch of Ion-based netbooks will be announced at the big Computex trade show at the beginning of June, and that the first few netbooks could start shipping "as early as July." Of course, there's no word on any specific companies involved just yet, with the source only going so far as to say that the announcements will come from some "key players." Acer would seem to be about as close to a sure thing as there is, however, considering that it just recently launched the first Ion-based nettop, the AspireRevo, and that it's never passed up an opportunity to roll out yet another new nettbook in the past.
