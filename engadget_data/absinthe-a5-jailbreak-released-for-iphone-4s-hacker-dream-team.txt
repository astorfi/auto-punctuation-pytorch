  Been waiting with bated breath to liberate that dual-core A5 within your shiny, white (we presume) Jony Ive-designed device? Well, you can exhale now, as a "Dream Team" of iOS hackers have just released Absinthe A5: an untethered solution for the iPhone 4S and iPad 2. For the uninitiated, this particular hack will not only free your handset or tablet from Apple's controlling grasp, it'll also retain the jailbreak upon reboot. But don't just thank this hacker collective for the successful effort, you can direct some of that applause to yourselves, as over ten million users submitted crash reports which led to the discovery of the exploit. But enough of the backstory -- head on over to the source to get your download started.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
