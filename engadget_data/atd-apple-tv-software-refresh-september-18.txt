Though it was all about the iPhones during Apple's big event yesterday, Apple TV is about to receive an overhaul soon as well, according to AllThingsD. It'll arrive on September 18th, the same day as iOS 7, according to sources familiar with Apple's plans. There's no mention of what changes are in store, although the same source believes that Apple TVs will be able to play other users' content via AirPlay. You'd think such change would have been mentioned by the company last night, but as with all rumors, we'll believe it when we see it.
