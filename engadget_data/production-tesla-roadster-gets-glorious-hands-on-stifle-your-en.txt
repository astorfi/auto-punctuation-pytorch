This Very Orange (seriously) Tesla Roadster is one of the very first to be produced with the revamped drivetrain, and according to the lucky (lucky!) souls over at AutoblogGreen who were able to give it a go, the "new, higher torque motor immediately made its presence felt." All that aside, we know you're here for the photos, so head on down to the read link when you've got ten or so free minutes to shuffle through. Let's just say you'll have a new appreciation for one Drew Phillips (photographer) when you're done treating your retinas.
