NYC announced last year that its residents, including businesses and government entities, would be able to get a custom domain to match the place they call home -- something London has done as well. With the first two phases of the rollout now complete, which gave first dibs to city officials and trademark owners, it's finally time for the general availability of top-level domains for New York City. In order to qualify, you'll need to show proof that you live within one of the five boroughs (Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, The Bronx and Queens). To make things easier, NYC teamed up with over 50 registrars, among which are GoDaddy, Network Solutions, Domain.com and Name.com, with prices per domain ranging anywhere from $25 to $50. They're on a first come, first served basis, however, so hurry if you're interested.



I spoke to Jeff Neuman, vice president of registry services at Neustar, who is involved with the initiative, and he told me that this is a way for New York City to give its residents a digital space only for them. "It's an incredibly strong brand. We couldn't be more excited about this launch," Newman added. For those who live here in The Big Apple, the city is celebrating the launch by hosting a shindig at the Flatiron Plaza today, starting at 1PM ET, where there will be food, swag and an on-site registration process.

Bonus: GoDaddy doesn't want New Jersey to know.
