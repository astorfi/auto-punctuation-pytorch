Well, if you believe the Image Science Foundation, resolution is actually the fourth most important specification right behind; contrast ratio, color saturation, and color accuracy. Of course, color is hard to measure and not nearly as exciting, but it should be no surprise that Pioneer believes their 42-inch 720p HDTV looks better than many 1080p LCDs and honestly, we agree. The key to the Kuro line is contrast; and "Once you go Kuro, you never, uh, returro." Also, don't ever let specs tell your eyes how good a TV looks.[Thanks, Ben]
