Of course, the adventurous among us have been able to pull this off with a pretty simple Series3 hack for ages, but official support means a whole lot more users are going to be taking advantage of that extra room for hiding away Gossip Girl episodes and all their other CW faves. The rolling update hasn't hit everyone's boxes yet, but keep your fingers crossed -- the update should also address some of those 9.1 bugs, and allows for progressive playback of Amazon Unbox downloads as they download.
