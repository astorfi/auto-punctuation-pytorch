We don't know if these work as well as the Lokomat
robot, but they sure are a lot more wearable. Maybe not in a couture vs. RTW way, but you know what we mean. Called
the "hybrid assisted limb" (or HAL — who says scientists don't have a sense of humour?), these work by detecting faint
eletrical signals through the skin when the wearer tries to move their leg, then engaging motors to assist the
movement.  You'll have to provide your own Six Million Dollar Man sound effects, though.
