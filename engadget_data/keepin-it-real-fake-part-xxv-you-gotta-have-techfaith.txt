We weren't able to get any specs or a name, but we did learn that this fakester will differ from (or improve on, depending on your perspective) the original by running the Pocket PC version of Windows Mobile 5.0 rather than Smartphone. Not sure when this thing will ship, but if TechFaith hurries up they might even beat the Q to market.
