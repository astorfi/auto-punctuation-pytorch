Instagram has also confirmed that its team will be making the move to Facebook's offices, but it assures folks that the "Instagram app and its features will stay the same one you know and love." For its part, Facebook reiterated its statement that it is "committed to building and growing Instagram independently," and that "Instagram will continue to serve its community, and we will help Instagram continue to grow by using Facebook's strong engineering team and infrastructure." It also offers a small hint of things to come by noting that "we also can't wait to work with the talented Instagram team to improve the mobile experience." In other news, Instagram also took the opportunity to announce that it's now crossed the five billion photo mark -- no word on a breakdown by filters, though.
