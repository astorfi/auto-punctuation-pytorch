His latest design comes in the form of a sleek, tiny deco-styled wooden box, crafted from a disused cigar humidor and loaded with a VIA NX15000 Nano-ITX motherboard, 1GB of RAM, and a hidden optical drive around the side. The end result comes off looking like some time-warp artifact straight out of Bioshock -- and leaves us wishing Mr. Stephenson would get into mass production of these babies.
