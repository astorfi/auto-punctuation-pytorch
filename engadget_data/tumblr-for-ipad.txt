 More than a month after launching its native iOS app and a day after releasing a tablet-friendly layout on Android, blog network Tumblr has updated its app to support Apple's tablets. It's also added markdown support and a new Explore tab, but the big bonus for iPad owners is sharing Community GIFs and other memes without having to slog through that silly 2x zoom of an iPhone menu. The free app is in iTunes now, check for the latest update or just hit the link below to try it out yourself.
