  By now you know we really, really want you to join us at Expand this March. And if you've been waiting for Just One More Reason to attend the event, how about a free 6-month subscription to Make Magazine?

 Our friends at Make share our enthusiasm about independent inventors, tinkerers, and makers of all stripes driving innovation in the technology world, and we're excited to welcome them as an official Expand media partner. They'll also be joining us at the show, so look out for more fun announcements around their participation in the coming weeks. We're also thrilled to be able to offer half a year's worth of Make goodness to all of our full weekend Expand attendees if purchased in advance.

 When buying your ticket there will be a form where you can input your home address. If you've already bought a full pass ticket from us, don't worry -- we've got you covered too. Look out for an email coming from Eventbrite (sent to the address you used to purchase your ticket) with instructions on how to provide us your mailing address and start receiving your free subscription.

 See you at Expand!
