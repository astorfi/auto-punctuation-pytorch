If it ain't broken don't fix it - and Pioneer's newest plasma proves that statement. 1080p might be the '07 buzzword, but the Pioneer PDP-5080HD shows that you simply don't need the extra pixels in order to produce a superb picture. The 720p 50-inch plamsa happens to be one of the best-looking sets CNET has reviewed - evar (8.7/10). Sure, green wasn't reproducing 100% accurately and they would have liked to see a better picture control menu, but the marvelously deep black level outweighed those small issues like a fat kid on a teeter-totter. The $3500 sticker doesn't make this set the cheapest meal on the menu, but we can't think of a better way to fill your high definition appetite - or you could eat for free and win the 42-inch version in our latest giveaway.
