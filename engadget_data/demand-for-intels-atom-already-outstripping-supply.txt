Intel told the WSJ that it's planning on producing "millions" of Atom chips this year, but that it's "seeing better-than-expected demand" as production begins and that it's "we are working quickly to address it." Still, it looks like manufacturers are expecting a shortage to last for a while -- ASUS predicted that supply would be constrained until the third quarter during its quarterly conference call, for example -- and various Chinese trade publications have reported the same. That's definitely not encouraging news, and with AMD's Puma and VIA's Isaiah nipping at Atom's heels, Intel might want to kick things into a higher gear.
