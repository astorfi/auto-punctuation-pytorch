According to Akihabara News, the store front model (read: not available on-line) can be configured with a 64GB SSD, a first if true but not a surprise. Configurable with a 1.2GHz Core 2 Duo U7600 proc, up to 2GB of memory and 11-hour battery. All this in a 19.5~25.5-mm sled. On sale in Japan starting today for about Â¥279,800 or $2,284 well equipped but without the SSD.[Via Akihabara News]
