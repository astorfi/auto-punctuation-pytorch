What's more, according to InfoWorld, the laptop will apparently be sold through Sprint and other companies along with WiMAX service "in a manner similar to the way mobile phones are sold along with service packages," although any further details on that are unsurprisingly a bit light at the moment. There's also unfortunately no further word on the specs to the laptop itself, although those details are promised to be coming when Acer officially launches the laptop, which "could" come by the end of the year.
