  Samsung and Google still haven't officially revealed which US carriers will be getting the Galaxy Nexus next month -- even though Verizon has been leaked, is shown in the official trailer (included after the break, look at 0:22), and there was a quickly-retracted Facebook confirmation earlier today. Now, the official signup page for release info on Samsung's site allows users to show their carrier preference between AT&T, Cellular South, Metro PCS, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and Verizon. It's hardly a confirmation this latest Android phone will ever be available on all of them, but even if you're not on Big Red, we won't kill your Ice Cream Sandwich dreams yet.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
