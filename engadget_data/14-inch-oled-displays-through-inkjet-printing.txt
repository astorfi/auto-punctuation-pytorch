So Cambridge Display announced back in August that they've developed a technology to
"print" an OLED display using fairly traditional inkjet
technology, well now they've successfully printed up some 14-inchers with the low-cost manufacturing process, at a 1280
x 768 WXGA+ resolution no less, so it seems as if the age of laptop
OLED is almost upon us. Of course, we've
been having OLED laptop displays hyped to us for quite a while now, along with their wonderful promise of lower energy
consumption, thinner form factor, and of course, lower cost, so there's no telling when these things will actually
surface.
