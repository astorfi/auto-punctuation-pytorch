 
Grab your Light Swords, it's time to kill some Jedi to save the Empire from the Ewok menace! We know you already own seven Wiis, each one espousing a different sort of childhood memorabilia or cute-overload, but can't you use the force to make room in your heart for one more? This Star Wars-themed Wii just hit the eBays, with a $500 starting price that includes the work of art you see before you, a red LED Wiimote and nunchuck, and a copy of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. You can't usually put a pricetag on this sort of midi-chlorian concentration.
