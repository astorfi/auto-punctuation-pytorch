 Wanting to get first dibs on the Lumia 521 for T-Mobile? If so, it looks that you may need to tune into HSN on April 27th, because -- strange as it sounds -- the television network is offering the earliest access that we know of. Here, you'll be able to score T-Mobile's variant of the Lumia 520 for $149.95 off-contract, which includes a bonus car charger and screen protector. Following its arrival at HSN, the Lumia 521 will then hit Microsoft retail stores and Walmart on May 11th, with the same off-contract pricing. As you may recall, a previous leak from TmoNews suggested the smartphone would hit T-Mobile stores yesterday, but this date has come and gone without official availability (or even an announcement) from the carrier. Fret not, though, because we've done a bit of digging, and our sources tell us that the Lumia 521 is currently set to hit general availability on May 22nd, which by all measures should include all T-Mobile stores. Naturally, you now have some options to weigh, even if one of them might cost an ounce of your pride.
