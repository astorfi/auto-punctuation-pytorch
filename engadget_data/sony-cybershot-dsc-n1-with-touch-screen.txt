Sony's rolling out this juicy lil' 8 megapixel Cybershot, the DSC-N1, whose primary claim to fame is its
incorporation of a 3-inch touch screen interface. Instead of keying around to control it you just, you know, feel it.
Uh huh. Its unspecified amount of internal memory can store "up to 500" images, with a Memory Stick slot for external
storage. It's also doing 3X optical and 6X digital zooms. Not sure exactly when this will be out (or price, for that
matter), but it looks to be available before the end of the year in Asian and European markets, at least.
