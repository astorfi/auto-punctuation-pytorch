As with most WiFi cameras, the TZ50 can upload your pictures from any WiFi hotspot but is then locked into specific image sharing sites; in this case, Panny's own Lumix Club. There is hope for a more open model, however, when the TZ50 goes global. After all, the Panasonic / T-Mobile WiFi demo we saw at CES tied images to Google's Picasa. Ok, it's not Flickr but it's a start. Available May 16th in Japan for Â¥49,800 or about $500. [Via Impress]
