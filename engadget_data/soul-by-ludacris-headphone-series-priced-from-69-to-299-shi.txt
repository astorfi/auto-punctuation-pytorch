 You know what they say -- if you can't Beat 'em, undercut 'em. Signeo's Soul by Ludacris headphone series -- which made its debut a couple of months ago at CES -- has just been priced, and sure enough, each pair is cheaper than what Dr. Dre and co. are charging for the Beats assortment. The top-end SL300 is set to sell for $299, while the similarly styled SL150 goes for $199. The more conventional SL100 will list for $149, and if it's earbuds you're craving, the SL99 will sport an MSRP of $99 while the low-end SL49 offers itself for just $69. Specifics on each one are hosted up after the break, and Americans can expect to see the whole crew this May. As for everyone else? There's no time table yet, but we've been assured by the company that international distribution is being worked on as we speak. Word.
