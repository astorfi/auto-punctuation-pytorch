 We just got our hands on a couple of new cases that HTC's making specifically for its One X flagship. The colorful accessories -- which the company showcased at its Frequencies media event in Seattle -- are made of a flexible PTFE-like (polytetrafluoroethylene) material and are designed to both protect and enhance the appearance of the device. Different designs will be available, but we only got to see the one. Sadly, we have no info on pricing or availability at this time. Take a look at our gallery below.
