Sony has moved to calm fears over expensive digital PlayStation 4 games ahead of the console's European launch. After it was revealed that EA had set digital prices for Battlefield 4 and FIFA 14 as high as £63 ($103), Sony spoke to Eurogamer and told them it has activated its European PlayStation Network early, allowing it to perform tests and enable regional price adjustments ahead of its rollout on Friday. Both titles cost around £55 ($90) on the Xbox One, so today's changes will likely bring price parity between the two next-gen consoles. While Sony warns gamers that "nothing on the PSN is final" until its official launch, you'll still be able to pre-order any of its digital PS4 games (if you simply can't wait) and have the difference refunded if it drops in price.
