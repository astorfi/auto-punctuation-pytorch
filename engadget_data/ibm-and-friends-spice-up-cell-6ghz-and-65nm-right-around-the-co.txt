 The party over at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco hasn't begun yet, we've still got a month to go, but thanks to the conference agenda, we've got a pretty good idea of what will be announced, and it's sounding pretty hot. Of most notable consumer relevance is the new CELL chip that IBM, Sony and Toshiba will be trotting out, sporting 6GHz speeds and a 65nm manufacturing process, compared to the 3.2GHz and 90nm specs of its predecessor. The chip will also feature a dual power supply design, that should speed up memory performance. No word yet if this will be making its way into some sort of beefed up PS3, but we're sure Sony and Toshiba will find something to do with all that horsepower. IBM will also be announcing its 5GHz Power6 server proc, while Intel goes all experimental on everyone with its 80 core test chips. Good times indeed.[Via I4U]
