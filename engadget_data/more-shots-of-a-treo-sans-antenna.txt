Seriously, between this and the 700p, it seems like Palm either doesn't collect NDAs, doesn't care when they're violated, or is guilty of perpetrating some of the most well-publicized viral campaigns in history. Anyhoo, here ya go. What's notable here is that we can see the SD slot has moved to the handset's right side. Follow the break for more shots, though if you're not convinced by now that the device is stone-cold real, we're not sure what will.[Thanks, Andrew]
