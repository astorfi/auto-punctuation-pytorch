Although the original deal allowed for either company to walk away risk free on March 1 if government regulators didn't approve, the two companies have looked each other deeply in the eye and re-affirmed their love for each other -- for another two months.

Seriously, if we thought we could put a merger on deathwatch, we might actually do that here. Ah well, here's to young love -- too bad most of those stories end up with everyone dead, eh?
