Specs for this 10.1-inch, 3G-capable portable are exactly what we heard via leaked documents, but for those just joining us: 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270, 1GB RAM, 80GB HDD, two USB 2.0 ports, 802.11b/g, SD slot, and Windows XP Home with Service Pack 3. As for the pricing, it's not quite as bad as previously suggested -- $200 after $50 mail-in rebate and a two-year commitment. Frankly, we'd prefer paying a little more upfront on Verizon's MiFi 2200 EV-DO router and a netbook / laptop of our choosing, with the same Mobile Broadband data plans, but hey, we can't disagree with having more options.
