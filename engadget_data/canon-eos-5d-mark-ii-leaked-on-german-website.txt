As you can see by the photo above, the site appears to have accidentally listed the camera with specs and an accompanying photo, though there is some question as to the authenticity of the image. Did we say some? We meant it looks kind of fake to us -- but what do we know? It's not like we've been trained by a highly elite wing of the Secret Service to spot Photoshopped images. Great, now we have to kill you.[Via SlashGear]
