After a long wait, the
   Zen MicroPhoto is now
   available in the US. If you've been following along at home, you're familiar with the specs on this one: 8GB of
   storage, so-so 160 x 160 OLED display (trust us; we played with it and were not impressed), WMA PlaysForSure
   support, and the same form factor and color palette as the original Zen Micro (though Creative's online store is
   currently only taking orders for the gray model). At $250, it's going to be a tempting alternative to the
   iPod nano, especially given
   the fact that the Zen has double the storage for the price and works with subscription music services (don't
   worry, though; Apple will still sell ten times more nanos than Creative will MicroPhotos).
