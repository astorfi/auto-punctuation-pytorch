This one is a 10-inch, 9.5mm-thick slab, housing both a dual-core, 1.6GHz Intel processor and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean -- another Clover Trail+ powered tablet from the Taiwanese company. Perhaps just as notable is the inclusion of a 1,920 x 1,200 backlit 10-inch screen -- one that's capable of 1080p video playback and one that performed just as admirably as recent ASUS tablets. We're promised 10 hours of use from the 25Wh battery, with all the requisite Bluetooth (3.0), WiFi (802.11 a/b/g/n) and GPS connectivity. There are also dual speakers but we're waiting to confirm if this means stereo sound. It'll arrive in two configurations: 16GB and 32GB, in either dark blue and white. The whole package weighs in at just 580g and we just got to handle it for ourselves -- check out our impressions and hands-on video right after the break. We'll be updating the post with pricing and availability when we hear more. 





The MeMo Pad FHD 10's build feels suitably solid, with the same slick Android experience (at least from our early test) you'd find from Android tablets with non-Intel mobile chipsets. We couldn't test the dual speaker setup -- the unfortunate chaos of a very popular press event -- but we'd expect the audio performance to be equal to ASUS' other recent tablets. The screen kept our web browsing and Android swipes looking crisp and clear. Colors were good, as were viewing angles. Rounding out the specs is 2GB of RAM, a rear-facing 5-megapixel camera and a front-facing 1.2-megapixel companion shooter. The rear-facer, while autofocus capable, doesn't have an accompanying flash. The sides are gently curved towards the pack, making this feel a little bit like the Nexus 7, albeit a fair bit bigger. Now the biggest question is how much this 10-inch MeMo Pad will cost.
