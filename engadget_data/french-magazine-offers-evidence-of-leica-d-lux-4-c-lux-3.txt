What's more, if you look closely above, you'll also see a mention of a hereto unheard of C-LUX 3 model, which is supposedly Leica's take on Panasonic's compact FX37 camera, and an update to the its own C-LUX 2 model. Of course, none of this is quite official just yet, but it seems like we should be hearing more from Leica soon if it is, in fact, legit.
