So if you're thinking about the next big thing, remember this, Tosh just announced their 100GB, 1.8-inch hard disk drive due for mass production starting January. The new drives use perpendicular storage technology like their other drives and feature a 4,200rpm spin, 15ms seek, 100MBps max transfer rate and improved error correction code. Plenty of room for toting HD video eh, Steve?[Via Impress]
