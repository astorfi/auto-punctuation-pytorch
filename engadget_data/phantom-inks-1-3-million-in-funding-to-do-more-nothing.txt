Just a day after Phantom Entertainment's, um, head honcho, stepped aside and gave the reigns of the vaporware wagon to Greg Koler, the outfit has now announced that it will be using the newfound fundage to "manufacture product lines this year with Alienware and IONE Technologies." We know, it's hard to stifle the chuckling, but apparently Phantom really believes that this time will be different, as it's busting out radical plans to "initiate marketing, sales, and distribution of the Phantom Lapboard." We'd feel sorry for the lenders, but they should have known better.
