This touchscreen slate for Verizon lacking a front-side camera was last seen in the Pocketnow leak but is now snuggled up with a Harrods bear in a Chinese user forum. How cozy. Better yet, we've now got a view of the Droid-Incrediblish backside showing a dual-LED flash. Again, no detail to confirm but we'll bet it's announced with Android at a Mobile World Congress press event in February.
