Take TiVo's endless time warp patent lawsuit against EchoStar, which started in 2006 and involves just a single patent: the court of appeals just today affirmed the $200 million contempt judgment against EchoStar from September. Of course, EchoStar is going to appeal to the full appeals court -- it always appeals -- and if that doesn't work we'd wager that this case will eventually be appealed to the Supreme Court for a second time. Don't worry, everyone keep can keep recording Idol -- this shouldn't affect TiVo or DISH Network customers at all. Statements from both TiVo and EchoStar after the break.
