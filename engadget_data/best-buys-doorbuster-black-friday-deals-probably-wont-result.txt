 
We apologize for the cloying headline, but just wanted to point out to Best Buy that the whole point of insane deals and "doorbuster" savings is, well, those things. We're sure there are a couple things in this new Black Friday catalog to make a seven hour wait in below freezing temperatures -- to be followed by frantic hand-to-hand combat with other recession-hit shoppers who may or may not be Arnold Schwarzenegger -- totally worth it, but we'd really love to meet the person for which a $12 Guns N' Roses CD qualifies as such a purchase. If you're looking for a $380 laptop, a lame $300 Xbox 360 bundle or a decent deal on a crappy LCD TV, knock yourself out.
