While we were playing with HTC's latest toys, the company let us fiddle with an engineering sample of the BoomBass. The weighty little cube is a Bluetooth 3.0+EDR speaker that pairs to your smartphone over NFC and offers a slide-out base to prop up your device for impromptu dance parties. The 1,200 mAh internal battery that promises nine hours of playback is charged with a microUSB cable, but unfortunately can't be used to give your phone an extra bit of juice. We know that the little cube will arrive partway through October, but there's no word on -- yet -- pricing, so you can keep yourself amused while we wait for a figure by flicking through the gallery of hands-on images we've got for you.
