As of now we have no information contrary to that, but we do have news specifying when the European nobility will get theirs: March 5. That means UK gamers have less than two months to determine whether they are eligible for an upgrade from the slender DSi, and if you're not sure how to check, just measure the depth and breadth your pockets. If you have room in there for the new version, with its stereo 4.2-inch screens, you'd better make with that pre-order: Nintendo Japan sold more than 100,000 of the things in just two days.
