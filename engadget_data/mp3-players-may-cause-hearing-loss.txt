Technology giveth, technology taketh
away. Cellphones cause brain cancer, wearing a
tattoo t-shirt will certainly end in a much deserved
poser pummeling, and now…listening to your MP3 player causes hearing loss. A study by Harvard Medical School found that
the in-ear-style headphones increased sound levels "by up to 9 decibels" over can-style headphones — that's the sound
of normal breathing at the low-end but significant at high levels on the exponential decibel scale! Ok, so that
increase alone won't shatter your drum but the study also finds these headphones inefficient at blocking out background
noise providing incentive to crank it up baby, yeeeah! Harvard creds not good enough for ya? A study completed last
month in Australia shows a quarter of all people surveyed listened to their "iPods at volumes that could cause long
term hearing damage." Well, none of this should be a surprise — just think of how many times those Haight Street Gap
workers blast their Juice Newton to avoid the incessant slur of "doses" and "sticky green buds."
