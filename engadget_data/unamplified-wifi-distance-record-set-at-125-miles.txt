Saturday. Defcon. 11:00am. The (WiFi) shot heard 'round, um, 125 mile stretch of land. That's right, Team PAD fired
unamplified WiFi from Vegas to St. George, Utahâ€”that's 125 full miles up in there. Congratulations, boys; now go live
it up in Sin City while you've still got a chance, ok? Shooting WiFi signals two hours down the highway doesn't really
qualify you to be in a commercial for the whole "What happens here, stays here" thing.
