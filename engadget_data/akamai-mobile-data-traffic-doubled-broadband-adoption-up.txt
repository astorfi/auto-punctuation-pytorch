According to the firm's figures, mobile data traffic doubled between the third quarters of 2011 and 2012, growing 16 percent since Q2 2012. In terms of browser marketshare over cellular networks, Android Webkit accounted for 37.6 percent of requests, while Mobile Safari netted 35.7 percent. Opera Mini hovered a tad below 20 percent, with RIM's and Microsoft's offerings duking it out below the 10 percent mark. However, when it comes to mobile devices across all networks (read: not just using cellular data), the gap between iOS and Android devices is far wider. In that scenario, Mobile Safari took the crown with 60.1 percent of browser requests, leaving Android Webkit with only 23.1 percent.

 On the cyber attack front, Akamai reports that such traffic originating from China increased by 16 percent in Q3, making the country the source of roughly a third of attacks during the quarter. The number two spot was claimed by the United States with 13 percent, and Russia slid in at third place with 4.7 percent. While average broadband speeds didn't see much in the way of landslide shifts, they were up globally by 11 percent year-over-year. Worldwide adoption of broadband 10Mbps or greater grew a sizable 22 percent between the third quarters of 2011 and 2012.
