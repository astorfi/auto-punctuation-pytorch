Where just last year companies like Apple and Nintendo were renowned for their ability to keep completely silent about impending hardware, these days the thrill of exposure and some media pressure go a long, long way. Now, if Computer and Video Games' sources are to be believed, Nintendo's had another leak: an October release date for its autostereoscopic 3DS handheld in the UK. That's well within the original "before March 2011" timeframe, and apparently a surprise for game publishers currently planning software for Holiday 2010. Besides, since Europe typically gets Nintendo systems after the US and Japan, some lucky dogs might get the system even earlier -- we'll let you know when we see it ourselves at E3 this June.
