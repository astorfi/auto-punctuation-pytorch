 NEC revealed its financial woes to the world yesterday and now Fujitsu is doing the same. The Japanese computer giant originally expected to make ¥60 billion ($790 million) in the fiscal year ending March 31st, but its latest estimate suggests ¥35 billion ($460 million) may be closer to the mark. Whereas NEC admitted there'd been a fall in demand for its products, Fujitsu has so far put the blame squarely on the recent flooding in Thailand, which hit PC sales by disrupting supplies of HDDs.
