 While Nokia and Qualcomm continue various spats and other legal nonsense to the nth degree, the future of 3G may be at risk. Well, not really -- but Nokia says it could very well slow things down, and mobile WiMAX and other technology that Qualcomm can't claim exclusive license to may be a possible answer.

One thing seems clear here -- these two companies don't seem eager to settle on anything these days.[Via mocoNews.net]
