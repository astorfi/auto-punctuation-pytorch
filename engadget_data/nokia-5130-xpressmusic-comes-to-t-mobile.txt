 T-Mobile subscribers looking to get in on the whole musicphone craze at a bare minimum of expense need look no further than the just-announced Nokia 5130 XpressMusic, a colorful candybar previously announced for other parts of the world that features a 2 megapixel cam, 2-inch QVGA display, integrated FM radio, and -- most importantly -- a 3.5mm headphone jack. Considering that there's no 3G, we're not necessarily sure why you'd pick this over the stylish 5310 -- especially considering that it's now free on contract -- but if you're digging the new model in either its Black / Red or White / Aqua color schemes, you're welcome to grab it now for $29.99 on a two-year deal after discount and rebate.
