 The Sony Ericsson rumor mill has been churning things out at a wild rate in the last days and weeks, leading some (that some includes us) to speculate that a product launch (or two!) may be just around the corner. The latest fodder for our eyes to feast upon -- from left to right in the picture -- is the candybar codenamed "Nicole" and the slider called "Shinobu." The Shinobu is rumored to pack such niceties as HSDPA, 2.4 inch QVGA screen, 2 megapixel cam, and what appears to be a forward-facing camera into a svelte half-inch thick package. Nicole is touted to be the first handset under the Sony Ericsson / Sagem partnership and brings a 2 inch QCIF screen, 2 megapixel camera, and 3G (no word on flavor) also packed in a half-inch thin handset. Both pics smack of fan renders, so we will just have to cross our fingers and hope that Sony Ericsson spills the beans on these two in the near term.[Via Just Another Mobile Phone Blog, thanks Michael]
