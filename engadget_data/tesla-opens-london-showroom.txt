Tesla now has an official retail footprint in the UK. The EV maker has just opened its first British showroom in London's Westfield shopping center, giving locals a chance to buy the Model S (including next year's £55,000 right-hand drive variant) in person. The store is just the beginning of Tesla's inroads into the country, though. As part of an opening gala Q&A, Elon Musk said that his company was already mapping the UK for Supercharger stations. He also expects that the Model X SUV will reach the UK in late 2015 or 2016, and hopes that Tesla's long-planned lower-cost EV will come in roughly three years for about £30,000. That's an ambitious plan when Tesla barely has a presence outside of North America, but Musk has a knack for completing large-scale projects.
