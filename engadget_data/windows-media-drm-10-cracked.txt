Uh oh, Microsoft. Okay, we can't vouch for the validity of this right now, but word has it that a particular
Japanese site has discovered a method to break Microsoft's Windows Media
DRM 10 on WMV files (which is Windows Media Video, if
you haven't been paying attention).  No word on whether the two apps that aim to do it (DrmDbg and DRM2WMV) can be
retooled for decrypting DRM'd audio files (WMA), and it looks like you need to have a license for the content you want
to crack in the first place—though obviously once the DRM is stripped away, you should be generally able to do whatever
you want with the file (share it online, transfer it to a personal video player, etc.).
