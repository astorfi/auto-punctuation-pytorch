There have been hints that ASUS' new PadFone Infinity could represent a little more than a speed boost; if newly leaked details obtained by ePrice are authentic, we may have proof. Photos included with the leak show an exterior design that's virtually identical to that of the current PadFone, save for the option of a white model. As previously rumored, the new smartphone would fit into the existing Infinity's tablet base. ASUS could make up for this conservative design with a speedy release, however. The ePrice sources claim that the new PadFone Infinity should launch in Taiwan during the third week of September, which would leave just a short wait for ASUS' fourth-generation hybrid.


Update: We've also noticed that there could be a microSD slot, next to the SIM tray. If so, that would answer the complaints of more than a few existing PadFone Infinity owners.
