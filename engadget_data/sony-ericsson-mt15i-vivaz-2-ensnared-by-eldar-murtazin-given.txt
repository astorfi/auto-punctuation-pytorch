The typically curmudgeonly gent was pleasantly surprised by SE's latest (and entirely unofficial) handset, claiming that the company "has developed and is about to launch truly cutting edge devices and ... has almost nothing to fear in the hardware department as well." He has praise for the above-average front-facing cam, the endurance offered by the 1500mAh battery, and the 854 x 480 res on the Reality Display -- though he does warn that Sony's Bravia Engine is only used when consuming multimedia and therefore has limited impact on improving output quality.

Internally, you're looking at 512MB of RAM and a 1GHz Qualcomm MSM7630 with Adreno 205 graphics, all of which resulted in perfectly smooth, lag-free operation. In spite of its many pluses, Eldar describes the MT15i as a phone targeting the mid-range, which invites all sorts of delicious pricing speculation, though we're not entirely sure we agree with his postulation that this handset will be called the Vivaz 2. The Xperia branding up front and the replacement of Symbian with Android would collectively suggest it'll bear an altogether new name when it's unveiled -- which we'll go ahead and presume is going to happen at MWC next month.
