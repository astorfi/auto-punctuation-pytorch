 By rights, Brammo's street-fighting Empulse should have gotten here quicker, but at least we now have a firm launch date. Sporting an all-new six-speed gearbox in place of the one-speed original, Brammo's spec sheet shows a 121-mile city range (or 56 miles on the highway), 100+ MPH maximum hustle and a re-juicing time of 3.5 hours in fast-charge mode. We're not sure if the price has budged from the original $14,000 estimate, but if you want to see what that ballpark sum might get you, the video after the break is all yours.
