According to NewGadgets.de, HP's planning to update its 12.1-inch tm2 convertible tablet with Core i3 and i5 processors in June. Considering we've heard that Intel will be releasing its Core i5 ULV processors around then, this certainly makes sense --- after all, we'd expect HP to swap out the current Core 2 Duo ULV processors for something more powerful, yet power efficient. Time will tell if the new chips make it into the multitouch laptop, but it's good to know that HP's still working on at least some sort of Windows 7 tablet.
