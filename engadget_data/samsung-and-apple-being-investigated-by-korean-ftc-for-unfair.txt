We already knew that iRiver, Cowon, and other South Korean MP3 player makers
were crazy pissed at Samsung for giving Apple such a
sweet deal on NAND flash memory modules for the iPod
nano, but now it looks like the South Korean Fair Trade Commission might be investigating whether or not the two
companies engaged in "unfair trading practices". We're not overly familiar with the ins and outs of Korean trade law
(we slept through that class sophomore year of high school) and whether or not Samsung and/or Apple did anything
illegal, but we don't doubt that iRiver and the rest of 'em put a ton of pressure on the government to look into
this.
