Hey hey, it's a party in the USA, or at least, it will be for UK-to-US travelers who are signed up to Three. The network has just announced that those intrepid pond-hoppers will be entitled to roam with their UK allowances of data, text and calls absolutely free. It's not just the US that's joining the party either, as it'll also apply to those journeying to Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Macau. We assume, just like the other Feel At Home countries, that calls to non-UK numbers will still incur fees, and tethering's still a no-go option, but that hasn't stopped us splurging on some long-haul flights for this afternoon.
