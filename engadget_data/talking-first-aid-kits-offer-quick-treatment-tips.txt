The Talking First Aid Kit from Intelligent First Aid is either a
really good idea, or the punchline of a really bad joke — we suspect that it's a little bit of both. Instead of having
to read instructions, a verbal guide allows you to focus on the task at hand — whether it's applying a bandage or
treating a mosquito bite. But we can't imagine what kind of audio they'd put on that chip to help the uninitiated deal
effectively with anything as serious as a spinal injury or shock. So maybe you should just do yourself a favor and take
a couple of Red Cross classes instead of assuming voice prompts will save the day.
