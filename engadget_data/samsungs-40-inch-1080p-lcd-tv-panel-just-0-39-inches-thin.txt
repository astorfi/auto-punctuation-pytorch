 
With Sharp, Hitachi, and LG.Philips all announcing ultra-thin LCDs we were beginning to wonder, where's Samsung with their world's first / biggest / thinnest boasting? No more. Meet the 10-mm (0.39-inch) thin, 40-inch LED-backlit, Full HD LCD TV panel which covers 92% of the NTSC color gamut while consuming less than 90 watts of power. That profile easily bests the crazy thin measurements we've already seen. At the moment, however, no price or production run details are available. That could change on Wednesday when the panel goes on display at FPD International in Japan.
