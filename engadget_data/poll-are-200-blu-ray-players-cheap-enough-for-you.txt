For starters, two aged BD decks broke the $200 mark this week, and even a few new players are getting MSRPs far lower than what we're accustomed to seeing. We've big hopes for player prices on Black Friday, and even bigger dreams for the run-up to the end of 2008, but given the current market scenario, is $200 low enough for you to finally buy in? How does that compare to your buy-in price for DVD / VHS? Do players still need to drop even lower before the population at large starts sinking their cash into the Blu?
