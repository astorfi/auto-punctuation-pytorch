TechCrunch just revealed that not only has Facebook created a fully-fledged iPad app, they've even released it -- albeit in secret. The code lies buried in yesterday's update to the iPhone app and it's entirely executable on jailbroken tablets. What's the software like? Well, TechCrunch reckons the left-sided navigation system and use of overlay menus is "great," as is the ability to chat with buddies while simultaneously doing other Facebook tasks in landscape mode. There's also a ton of screen grabs at the source link which tell much of the story. However, it surely won't be long before we can make our own minds up.
