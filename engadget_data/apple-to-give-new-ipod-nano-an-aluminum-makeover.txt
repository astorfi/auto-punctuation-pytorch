This time, though, they're taking it in reverse, and are supposedly outfitting their miniature player in aluminum to combat those scratches and durability problems that the nano was so given to. The aluminum is supposed to even come in various colors just like the mini did (pictured above), but the player is said to retain the same form factor as the nano, along with bumping the storage capacity to 8GB. These rumors are based on AppleInsider "sources," so we really have no way to verify their accuracy, but it seems pretty reasonable that Apple will do something about their players to combat those scratches and the accompanying lawsuits.
