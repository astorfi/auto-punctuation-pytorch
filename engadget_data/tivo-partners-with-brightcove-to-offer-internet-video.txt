TiVo owners with Series 2 boxes will have access to "an as-yet-undisclosed set of Web-based programs" from the Cambridge, MA startup when the new service goes live this June, and although the initial round of programming will be free, the two companies plan on allowing content providers to charge for their material in the future. This move would seem to strengthen TiVo's position in the marketplace -- which may already see a boost in the near future if the rumored deal with Cox Communications materializes -- as their core business of providing hardware and guide services is quickly being being usurped by cheaper, and some might say better, alternatives.[Thanks, Dave Z]
