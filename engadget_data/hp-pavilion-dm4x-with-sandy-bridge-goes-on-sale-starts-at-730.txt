 Those Sandy Bridge refreshes just keep on coming. Today, it's HP's turn, whose 14-inch Pavilion dm4 (which we reviewed last year) now comes standard with a 2.3GHz Intel Core i5-2410M CPU. Curiously, it's now the dm4x -- a suffix you don't usually see on HP notebooks. For that $730 starting price, you'll also get Radeon HD 6470M graphics with 1GB of memory, 6GB of RAM, a 640GB 5,400RPM hard drive, and a six-cell battery. If money's no object, you can trick yours out with a 2.7GHz Core i7-2620M processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 750GB 7,200RPM HDD. Oh, and for $25 you can opt for a "dark umber" color instead of "steel grey" (pictured). Not too shabby, but we just hope HP also fixed that wonky touchpad.
