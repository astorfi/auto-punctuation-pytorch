That welcome connectivity addition comes in the form of what Toshiba describes as the "first ever" combined WiFi /WiMAX module, formerly codenamed "Echo Peak," which is about the only stand-out feature among the laptop's high-end but otherwise unremarkable specs, including 4GB of RAM, a 320GB hard drive, and a 13.3-inch screen with Toshiba's trademark TruBrite technology. No word on a price just yet, but it'll apparently be available "soon."
