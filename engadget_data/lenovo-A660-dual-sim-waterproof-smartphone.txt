 
 Lenovo is burning up the Chinese smartphone market, and it's just announced a new midrange 4-inch ICS model, the A660, with two twists: dual-SIM slots and a waterproof case. The IP67 certification and Gorilla Glass also make it dustproof, but apart from that, the device carries pedestrian specs: Android 4.0, 1GHz dual-core processor, 800 x 480 screen and 5-megapixel rear camera. As with other recent models in China aiming down the middle of the road, the A660 boasts several colors, and supports WCDMA + GSM networks with dual-SIM / dual-standby capability. There's no word yet on how much or when, but don't start shopping for lime green or burnt orange furniture to match just yet -- few of Lenovo's smartphones have crossed the Great Wall.
