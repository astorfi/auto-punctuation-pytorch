 As if we weren'talready worried enough about our cellphone causing Blackberry thumb, certain indecisiveness,and, of course, brain cancer, the WSJ is nowreporting that according to some leading opticians, portables, especially with small screens and smaller fonts, couldbe causing irreversible eye strain and damage to our vision. Apparently the action of focusing for long periods of timeon small spacial areas held relatively closely to the body -- especially displays with poor contrast ratios, and badglare -- tends to overwork the eye's ciliary muscles, and might be causing deteriorated vision in the same young groupof patients now visiting doctors for other technologically related ailments, like portable audio related hearing loss -- a group far too youngto be coming in for their annual eyes, ears, and artificial hip-bone checkup.
