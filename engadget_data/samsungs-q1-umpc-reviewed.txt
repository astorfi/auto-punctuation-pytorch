And to our surprise an English site called Personal Computer World not only got and reviewed a Q1,but gave it some very high marks, citing its quiet fan, sleek form factor, and bright, clear display as high points forthe device. In fact, they only knocked on it for having a "standard" battery life (huh? 2.5 hours is nowstandard?), smallish drive, and, of course, sucky Celeron-powered under-performance. Will all those 4/5-star ratingsthey laid down be enough to get users to plunk down Â£799 (about $1450 US) for one of their own? We don't know,but we didn't exactly find it encouraging that Samsung told PCW only "hundreds" had been pre-ordered.[Via UMPC Buzz]
