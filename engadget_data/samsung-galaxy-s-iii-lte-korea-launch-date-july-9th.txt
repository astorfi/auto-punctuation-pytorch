 While in the US, our LTE-equipped Galaxy S IIIs are packing dual-core Snapdragon S4 processors, the (so far) Korean-only Galaxy S III LTE that combines the quad-core Exynos processor of the international model with high speed data finally has a release date -- July 9th. Samsung's post indicates three carriers (SK Telecom, KT and LG U+) are lined up for the launch and confirms that the battery will remain at 2,100 mAh along with 2GB of RAM and DMB TV tuning. Having everything will likely come at a price of battery life since the quad-core CPUs are not as well integrated with LTE so far, but those willing to compromise for more cores (despite the dual-core Krait's not-at-all shabby performance) will likely look on with envy.
