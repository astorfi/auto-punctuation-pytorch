While it's still not providing an exact date just yet, the company's newly-updated FAQ now says that the device will be available directly from TomTom sometime this October. What's more, the company also says that the kit (which also works with the iPod touch) will be initially sold without the TomTom iPhone app, contrary to what was previously rumored, although it's not clear if a bundle with the app will also be available at a later date.[Via NaviGadget]
