  We're closing in on one year since we first heard about Astro's A40 gaming headset, and for those of you who've held off in anticipation of these changing your life, here's a few more details you'll surely want to know. Astro founder Brett Lovelady sat down with Core77 in order to talk about the company and the headset in detail, and he gives us a first hand look at what the A40s are all about. We'll warn you, he does ramble on for a solid four minutes, but it's good stuff if that's what you're into. Check the vid just after the break.
