Your Android phone can now warn you when traffic is likely to crawl to a standstill on the drive home. Google has updated the platform's search app to send Google Now notifications if road work, accidents and other incidents might create major delays. The alert system won't be as slick as having  your very own traffic drone, but it should help you find an alternate route before you're caught up in gridlock.
