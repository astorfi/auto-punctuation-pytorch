Up in all 69 markets where the IPTV service has a foothold, the final ten markets launched today were: Bakersfield, Dayton, Green Bay, Jacksonville, Little Rock, Miami, South Bend, Tulsa, West Palm Beach and Wichita. Honestly, we're not sure what AT&T (or us for that matter) will do now that it's over, the leading candidates are a "Remember the Rollout" reunion tour in early '09, or the somewhat less likely possibility that confused AT&T techs start adding the functionality to random areas without U-Verse service.
