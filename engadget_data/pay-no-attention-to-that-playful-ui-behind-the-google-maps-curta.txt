You ain't seen nothing yet -- The Astonishing Tribe (the brains behind the look of Android) aims to give you billowing, rippling cloth-like curtains of clever interactive content with their concept Velvet UI. Pull out a widget or Google Maps query, and a sheet of your desired result waves with the virtual wind, before stretching out flat for you to more comfortably interact with. Running on MeeGo (and apparently possible on Android) it's built with the company's proprietary UI framework, so don't expect it to hit tablets anytime soon unless someone throws them some bucks. Also see: TAT's other impressive concepts. Video after the break.
