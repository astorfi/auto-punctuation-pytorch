The tasty thought of Palm OS inside a Q shell was debunked pretty quickly thanks to a glance at the supposed Q2's spec sheet, and sure enough, Sprint has now updated the site with a hastily Photoshopped Windows Mobile screen replacing the Palm one. Oh, and it's now the Q9c, which we kinda expected, since we know the Q9c has a date on Sprint any day now. The detail view for the phone still shows it as the Q2, but we're pretty sure it's just another error in this comedy-filled Flash app Sprint has thrown together to send the mobile blogging world into a tizzy for a few days.[Thanks, mattemer]
