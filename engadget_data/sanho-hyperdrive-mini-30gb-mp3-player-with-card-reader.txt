Sanho's HyperDrives are low-priced, AA-powered hard drives with memory card readers,
designed for photogs who want to back up images on the road and on the cheap. With its new HyperDrive Mini, the company
has added MP3/WMA-player capabilities, along with its standard hard drive (30GB) and built-in support for 8 different
kinds of memory cards. Specs and pricing haven't been announced yet, so we don't know how "mini" or affordable this
really is, but given that it lacks most of the features of current audio players (and like the original HyperDrives
lacks a color display to preview pics), it had better be both small and cheap.
