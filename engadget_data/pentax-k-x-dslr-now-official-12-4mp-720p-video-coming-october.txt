All the earlier specs have panned out, so we're looking at a 12.4 megapixel CMOS censor, a 200 to 6400 ISO sensitivity expandable to 100 to 12,800, 4.7 frames per second continuous shooting, and 720p HD video at 24 frames per second. Sized up to the K-7, its wider ISO range is the only improvement, otherwise on par in features or lacking, as is in the case of AF / AE, video, and continuous shooting speed. It's due out in October available in black, white, red, or navy blue, with an attractive base price of $650 that nets you a 18-55mm lens.
