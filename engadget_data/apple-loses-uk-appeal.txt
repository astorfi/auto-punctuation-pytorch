 Remember when a UK judge said that Samsung couldn't have copied the iPad with its Galaxy Tab because it wasn't "as cool" as the iPad? Well, Apple has just lost the High Court appeal to have that decision overturned, meaning that despite the backhanded compliment, it will still have to run adverts in the press stating that the Korean giant had not copied its tablet designs.
