 So, we learned two things today. Firstly, Will.i.am is able to attract quite a media scrum, and secondly, national press photographers have sharp elbows. Nevertheless, we braved the London debut of the Black Eyed Peas star's i.am+ iPhone accessories and fortunately came away with more than just Elephunk-sized bruises. We got some brief playtime with the gadgets, plus an interview with the CEO of Will.i.am's tech venture -- none other than Chandra Rathakrishnan of Fusion Garage fame (or notoriety). If you're wondering if we asked him why anyone would spend upwards of £199 ($315) on a wide-angle lens attachment when a really decent alternative can be had for a fraction of that cost, then hopefully the video and early impressions after the break will satisfy your curiosity.




 
 It's worth pointing out that these accessories do slightly more than just give your iPhone a wide-angle view of the world -- and in fact there are quite a few different models that all do different things. They're as follows:

  The foto.sosho C.4 is the basic model at £199, which includes a flash module, three interchangeable lenses (macro, fish-eye and clear glass) and a grip to make it easier to wield your iPhone 4 or 4S like a point-and-shoot. Aside from these functions, the device is largely about aesthetics -- and the white and gold C.4 we played with certainly makes a statement, if that's what you're into.  The foto.sosho V.4 is for those who prefer vintage styling. It costs £299 ($415) and adds a slide-out backlit QWERTY keyboard that pairs with your phone over Bluetooth. Like the C.4, it's only compatible with the iPhone 4 and 4S. Also like the C.4, it'll go on sale December 6th exclusively at Selfridges in London.  The foto.sosho V.5 and "luxury" L.5 (also with QWERTY) persist with the excessive punctuation, but otherwise take a very different approach to "social-digital photography," as explained below. They won't be available until early next year, with pricing yet to be announced, and they'll only play nice with the iPhone 5. The all-black V.5 we held was a non-working prototype, but Rathakrishnan tells us it'll do something no other accessory currently does, by circumventing Apple's camera components and using its own 14-megapixel sensor and 5x zoom lens to provide superior image quality. We have no idea how it'll do that, or whether it will deliver on its promises better than the ill-fated JooJoo and Grid10 ever did, so we'll just have to wait and see.
