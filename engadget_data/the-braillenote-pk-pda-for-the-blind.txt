There's a new PDA for the blind from Pulse Data International. The BrailleNote PK doesn't have an LCD screen
(obviously), but they're claiming it's the world's smallest PDA with a Braille display (which has a matrix of dots that
can be raised or lowered depending on what information needs to be displayed), and it does feature a built-in speech
synthesizer, built-in Bluetooth, 16MB of RAM, an Ethernet port, a CompactFlash expansion card slot, and run on Windows
CE.
