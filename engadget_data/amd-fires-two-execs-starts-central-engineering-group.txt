 AMD's managed to distract us a bit from its troubles lately with some interesting chip announcements and bold predictions, but reality keeps setting in -- the company announced another executive shuffling today as the company keeps losing money and ground to Intel. Out this time are former EVP of Computing Solutions Mario Rivas and "Chief Talent Officer" Michel Cadieux, as well as 1600 workers being laid off worldwide. Former server chief Randy Allen will replace Rivas and Allen Sockwell is getting Cadieux's old job, but the more interesting move is the creation of a new division called Central Engineering, which will oversee all of the company's roadmaps from here on out. Hopefully that means we'll see fewer incomprehensible roadmap updates and more shipping chips -- that's the only way things are going to improve in Sunnyvale.[Via The Register]
