If you'll recall, Google opened up a Chrome OS Pilot Program Tuesday, and for those who registered early (and got awfully lucky), they're being treated to a Cr-48 on their doorsteps. One gracious tipster has already sent over a trio of unboxing shots (while another provided the video after the break), and we'll be sure to give the low-down (you know -- video, impressions, etc.) once our own arrives. Anytime now, FedEx...

[Thanks, Dan and Michael]
