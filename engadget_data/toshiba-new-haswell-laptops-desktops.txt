If you're going to unveil a completely refreshed PC lineup, you may as well do it the week Intel launches some new processors (and, you know, the week a big computer show is going on). Toshiba just announced a slew of new models, including an all-in-one, a redesigned gaming notebook and mainstream laptops in various sizes. It'd be silly to overwhelm you with details right here, since everything from the designs to the GPUs have changed, but if you follow us past the break we've got a neat summary of everything Toshiba introduced today, complete with pricing, specs and a few hands-on photos too.



 Qosmio X75. With a gunmetal-gray chassis and glowing red accents, the Qosmio X75 doesn't look that different from Toshiba's previous gaming notebooks. Curiously, Toshiba nixed the 3D display this time around -- it's just a garden-variety 17.3-inch, 1080p panel. Under the hood, it runs a Haswell Core i7 processor and a 3GB NVIDIA GeForce 770M GPU, with support for up to 32GB of RAM, thanks to four open memory bays. Storage-wise, you've got some options: you can load up to 1.25TB of HDD space, though an SSD is also an option. Toshiba's also upgraded the machine with an HDMI 1.4 port for outputting 4K content -- not that you have any yet. Lastly, you'll find full copies of Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements, just like on the new Kirabook. Look for it June 10th starting at $1,550.
