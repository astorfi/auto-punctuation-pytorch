A forum member over at the China's TGFC has managed to sneak some shots of the Xbox 360 Elite in production, and it sure is looking... black and silver. We're not sure how "Wangsososos" got the shots, and we sure hope his machine-translated statement doesn't mean what we fear it might: "As mobile phones, cameras can not be brought into plants. The key to reaching the buttocks no plans, joy!" But we digress. For some up close and personal pics of that 120GB drive, peep the gallery.[Via Xbox 360 Fanboy]
