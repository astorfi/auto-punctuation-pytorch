 
Android phones and their eternal struggle to get the latest version update, it's a book that needs to be written. It was only last night that we were hearing that the Froyo upgrade for Spanish Galaxy S users would be pushed back till late October, yet today our emotions are swung back the other way by news of T-Mobile UK promising the exact same update by the end of this month. If our solar calendars are accurate, that means there'll be no more than a 10-day wait left for T-Mo customers using this 4-incher. We'll bug the other UK networks as well to see whether their 2.2 updates are in the mail or still lost somewhere in the frozen isle.

Update: Here's O2's current position:
"We're working with Samsung to bring the latest version of Android, 2.2 FroYo, to our Samsung Galaxy S customers as soon as possible. This will take a period of several weeks and we will update our customers once the new software is available."
