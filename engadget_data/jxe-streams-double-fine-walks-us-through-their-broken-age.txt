More than a year has passed since the first half of Double Fine's Broken Age came out, leaving fans of classic adventure video games as flummoxed and desperate for resolution as the game's young heroes. Later this month Tim Schafer's point and click fantasy will finally continue when Broken Age: Episode 2 hits PC, PlayStation 4 and PS Vita. We here at Engadget feel that there's no time like the present to revisit the first chapter. Composer Peter McConnell and artist Nathan Stapley will be joining us to give some insight into the game's strange world of technological prisons and human sacrifice-loving beast gods.



Tune into JXE Streams at 3PM ET in this post, on Engadget.com/gaming and on Twitch.tv/Joystiq for two hours of Broken Age. Come 4PM ET, those fine artisans from Double Fine will join us via Skype to talk about their work on the game.

Enjoy our streams? Follow us on Twitch.tv/Joystiq to know when we go live and bookmark Engadget.com/gaming to get a look at our upcoming schedule.
