CEO Avner Ronen announced on the official blog that while updates for the downloadable version "will most likely lag behind the versions of Boxee for devices" the company hopes to keep them more up to speed going forward. Still think you could do a better job of updating the software yourself? Done, since Boxee also plans to make an open source version available. There's no date attached to that effort and given past experience with delayed Boxee releases we wouldn't clear our college football watching schedule just yet, but for everyone who would rather roll their own media device there is still a future in the Boxee platform.
