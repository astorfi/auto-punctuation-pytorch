It hasn't been a particularly quiet quarter for Apple, at least in the announcement department. But, as far actually shipping new products, Q3 of 2013 has been relatively uneventful. Perhaps that's why the company's revenues are down to $35.3 billion, from $43.6 billion in Q2. Still, while its revenues are down significantly from the last two quarters, things are pretty stable year-over-year. In fact, it's enjoyed a small increase over the $35 billion it raked in during Q3 of 2012. Still, while revenues are up, profits are down. $6.9 billion in net income is hardly anything to snub your nose at, but it does represent a notable drop from the $8.8 billion Apple pocketed in the same quarter last year. That's at least partially attributable to a year-over-year drop in both iPad and Mac sales, though the 31.2 million iPhones sold is a record for the June quarter -- up 20 percent from last year. The decline in iPad sales is particularly notable. After selling 17 million iOS tablets in Q3 of 2012 and 19.5 million just last quarter, Apple only managed to sell 14.6 million slates in the three month period ending June 30th. Mac sales were down less dramatically, from 4 million to 3.8 million, year-over-year, though those numbers are roughly flat sequentially.


The iPod line continued its rather swift decline in Q3, with sales dropping 19 percent sequentially and 32 percent year-over-year. The impressive uptick in iPhone sales does help balance out the drop, but it appears the writing is on the wall for the product family that helped kick start the digital music revolution. All the blame for Apple's declining profits can not be blamed on the iPod, however. Sales are down pretty much across the board, both sequentially and year-over-year, with the exception of the iPhone. All the while, Cupertino's expenses keep increasing.


You'll find updates and more numbers after the break from Apple's earnings call.



5:04 PM CFO Peter Oppenheimer is bragging about the iPhone's international growth, particularly singling out Japan, where sales are up 60 percent, year-over-year.

5:08 PM Peter says that the year-over-year drop in iPad sales is at least partially attributable to Q3 2012 being the first full quarter that the third-generation iPad was available. With no comparable update made available in 2013, sales predictably dropped off.

5:10 PM While Mac sales were down seven percent year-over-year, Peter says that the line still exceeded expectations. Since IDC suggests that the PC market contracted by about 11 percent, the Apple CFO says this indicates that Mac has actually gained market share.

5:15 PM Peter cited a study showing that the iPad still holds a commanding lead over its Android and Windows 8 competitors in the enterprise market, representing 88 percent of the commercial market.

5:16 PM Apple plans to open nine new stores in the next quarter, bringing its grand total of new openings to 27 for the year.

5:17 PM Peter says Apple now has a war chest of $146.6 billion on hand.

5:20 PM Not that it should come as a surprise, but Peter confirmed that Apple has some new products in the works for 2013. Of course, he wouldn't get any more specific than that. Such a tease.

5:23 PM In response to a question about smartphones approaching saturation, Tim Cook says that there is plenty of room for growth in markets outside the US and, contrary to some perceptions, he believes there is still plenty of room for growth even at the premium end of the spectrum

5:27 PM Despite sales shrinking overall, Tim Cook is optimistic about the iPad's future. Especially since sales grew by double digits in China, Japan, Canada and a handful of other nations.

5:35 PM Tim Cook was pressed about a rumored trade in program, but he wouldn't give up the goods. That said, he seemed pretty fond of the concept from both a business and environmental standpoint.
