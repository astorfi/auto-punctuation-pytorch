While the S6 has donned the leather outfit for some time now, Asus is releasing it in a "limited run" of hot pink, which is sure to take top priority on your lovely lady's wish list. Also boasting camel / black colors, the S6 is powered by an Intel Core Duo L2300 / L2400 processor, sports an 11.1-inch WXGA display, 802.11a/b/g, Bluetooth, S-Video out, five USB 2.0 inputs, and an ExpressCard slot to boot. The mightier W6 loses the pink shade, but gains options for Intel's T5500 / T5600 / T7200 Core 2 Duo processors, and a 13.3-inch WXGA screen. While there's no word on pricing or availability, we expect these tastefully decorated machines to demand a stiff premium when they hit stores.  [Via Laptoping]
