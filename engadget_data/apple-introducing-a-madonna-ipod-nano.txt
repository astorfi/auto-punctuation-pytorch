We still don't know for sure whether or not Apple is going to intro a
video iPod next week (hey,
if we did know for sure we'd tell ya), but word is going around on several of the Madonna fan sites that, in the spirit
of the U2-themed iPod, Apple is planning to announce a
special pink-colored version of the iPod nano for the
Material Girl. Makes sense, since she helped launch the
ROKR E1 iTunes phone last month and has
generally been kissing up to His Steveness in interviews. If true, probably best to start preparing yourselves now for
several days of awful Madonna puns courtesy of the mainstream press.
