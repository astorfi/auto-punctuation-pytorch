We'll have to wait until CES for a real peek at Digital Storm's forthcoming Steam Machine, but thankfully the show's only a few weeks away. In the meantime, the company's got a few details to offer up, calling the box "one of the most advanced small form factor systems" ever, thanks to options like an NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN graphics card, liquid cooling, airflow thermal management and up to a 700W power supply. The system will offer up both SteamOS and Windows, with a starting price of $1,469. Digital Storm says it opted not to compete with the price of current-gen consoles. Fair enough. In the meantime, here's a dark teaser page for you to stare at for the next couple of weeks.
