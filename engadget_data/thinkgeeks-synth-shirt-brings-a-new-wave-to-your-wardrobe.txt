Then you might want to consider ThinkGeeks' new synthesizer shirt, which packs five different sampled instruments, full polyphonic sound, and a handsome "wearable" amp. Head on past the break to get an idea of what the shirt's capable of, and look for it to start shipping on November 29th for $29.99 to $32.98 depending on the size.
