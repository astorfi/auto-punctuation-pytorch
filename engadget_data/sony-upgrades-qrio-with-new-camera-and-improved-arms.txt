The little bot can now enjoy all sorts of box related activities, such as carry, stacking, and recognizing dropped or fallen boxes, thanks to better articulated arms and a new "third eye" that keeps track of stuff. QRIO can also now keep track of colors, faces and other objects, bringing him closer to Asimo in that regard, who could already recognize and track faces. Based on this round of humanoid updates, it looks like while Asimo is gearing up for the workforce, QRIO is gearing up for preschool, but that ain't necessarily a bad thing.    [Image via Cnet]
