Lenovo was quick to stop preloading Superfish and clean up its immediate PC security problem, but what about preventing problems going forward? Well, you can relax a little -- the company is thinking about the long term. In an open letter, technical chief Peter Hortensius reveals that Lenovo is investigating a "wide range of options" to avoid software that poses a threat to your data. Among its choices are preloading a "cleaner" software bundle (definitely our pick) and consulting with both security experts and regular users to determine what programs it should use. The computer builder doesn't have a firm plan of action yet, but it's promising one by week's end -- while you probably won't see truly bloat-free Lenovo PCs, your next IdeaPad or Yoga should have a bit less cruft.
