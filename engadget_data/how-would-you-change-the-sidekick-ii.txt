(and not so favorite) devices. This week, let's take a look at the
Danger Sidekick II:




Add other chat networks: Yahoo, Jabber, etc.




IRC client




Search function in the Notes feature, and more ways to organize notes (by priority, keyword, etc.)




Have anyone other than T-Mobile carry this, or have T-Mobile miraculously build out a network with better
  coverage. Please.




Add WiFi to compensate for point 4.




Yer up: go!
