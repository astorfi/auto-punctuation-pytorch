Now the English speaking world can subject themselves to creepy Japanese robotic
partners. Starting today, Tomy is taking pre-orders for its 8.5-inch tall bear-shaped robot named Chatty
Kevorkian Tom. Depending on the software you choose, the robot either makes a fun toy for children or
a Euthanasia Pal "conversation learning device" for adults. The robot and software sell for ¥25k
($221) and ¥3k ($27) respectively.
