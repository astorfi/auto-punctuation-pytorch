8.9-inch 1024 x 600 LED-backlit display
1.6GHz Atom N270
512MB DDR2 SDRAM (expandable)
1.3 megapixel camera, SDHC and multi-format media readers
802.11b/g, Ethernet, three USB 2.0, VGA, and 3.5mm audio out
One free mini PCI slot for WWAN
80GB hard drive (with XP) or 8GB solid state (with Linux)
2.5 or 5 hours on 3 or 6-cell batteries in XP model, 3 or 7 hours on Linux
1kg (2.2 pounds)

It should be available overseas this month in blue or white (with black, red, and pink models coming soon), and supposedly US release later this year. At the outset you'll be ponying up £199 (~$400 US) for the Linux model, and £299 (~$600 US) for XP.[Thanks, Garry, via El Reg]
