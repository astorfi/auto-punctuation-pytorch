Three plucky young nerds in Bulgaria have formed a company to build a fully functional android. A man-sized,
fully-functional andriod, not some piddly little 3 foot high midget. Not only does the robot look Terminator-esque, but
it's been designed to mimic the muscle system of a human (with bone-crushing strength, of course) and will be
programmed with a semi-autonomous AI so that the android can learn new tasks, all of which is just a little too much
like the Terminator for our comfort. Of course, this all looks and sounds really scary, but if a 1000 robot-obsessed
Japanese scientists haven't been able to build any normal-looking androids this big that don't fall over and don't
require a gigantic power backpack of batteries, it's tough to believe that three crafty Bulgarians will do it. So if
they are successful, we'll get very, shall we say, nervous. And if they start working on a satellite network to control
the androids, then we all go over there and level the factory before anything bad happens. Agreed?
