Yep, they're just nice wool or knit gloves with metal dots in the fingers that work with capacitive touchscreens -- no crazy patented Apple "anti-sticky" layer or ridiculous overdesign involved. Of course, just because they're marketed towards iPhone users doesn't mean they won't work with the Storm or G1 as well -- honestly, we're sort of surprised these little nubs haven't popped up on gloves everywhere. Couple more pics and a quick video after the break.
