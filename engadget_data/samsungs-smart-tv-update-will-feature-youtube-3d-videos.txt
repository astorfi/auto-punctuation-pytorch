So far one of the major issues for 3DTV owners has been a lack of content, but since it launched support for 3D videos two years ago, YouTube has accumulated quite a library of both professionally developed and user generated videos for viewing. HDTVs from LG added access to the site's 3D content earlier this year, and the update is expected to appear across the Samsung lineup across the second half of 2011. We spoke with one of the engineer's responsible for the initial rollout of YouTube's 3D support, Pete Bradshaw, and he mentioned the project's genesis as one of Google's famous "20 percent" projects that was worked on on the side, but has now drawn the support of a multiperson team to support, and a rapidly expanding number of viewers and content creators uploading videos to the service. The intent is to make viewing 3D just as easy as watching anything else, once users film in 3D with their phone or camera, they can upload it to YouTube and watch on TV (or mobile device) without worrying about the formatting and technology involved. We're still a few steps away from the magic bullet that removes the current hurdles for wider 3D acceptance in the market, but if you're one of the (not so early at this point) adopters with the hardware to handle it, you'll probably appreciate anything that makes more content available easily. Check after the break for the press release and a few sample videos to check out.
