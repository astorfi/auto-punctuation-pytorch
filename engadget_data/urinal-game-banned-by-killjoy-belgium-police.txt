You know, the one you drive with your pee, and which warns you against drunk driving if you're not controlling your car too well? Well the Belgium police didn't seem to find it too amusing, and have banned the "Place to Pee" version of the game installed at GamePower Expo in Gent, Belgium as an indecency offence. We're guessing they're just tired of missing out on all those exciting men's room tourneys.[Thanks, Joel S]
