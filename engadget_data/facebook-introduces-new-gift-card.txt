 If you're still desperate to get that Facebook acquaintance something for their birthday or some kind of anniversary, the Social Network has instituted a new way to take your money give. You'll be able to pick up gift credit for the likes of Jamba Juice, Olive Garden, Sephora and Target, plucking what you'd like from the "gift cards and digital" category inside the existing Gifts tab, and stating an amount and the name of the lucky gift-getter. The friend will be immediately notified and a lovingly Facebook-branded card will be sent to their residence. The credit can be used immediately, reused and even hold multiple balances for the differing providers -- ideal for the times you need fragrances, electronics and ... olives. Balances can be monitored direct from your Facebook page or app, even updating and sending notifications when credit is being used. Facebook says the cards will roll-out gradually across the US, though wasn't specific on any launch regions. Expect to hear more in the next few days.
