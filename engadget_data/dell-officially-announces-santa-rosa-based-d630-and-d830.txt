In case you missed it, the Latitude D830 and D630 offer two variations on the same theme, with the former boasting a 14.1-inch display and the latter a 15.4-inch one, and each packing integrated 802.11n WiFi, as well as your choice of an Intel Turbo Memory cache card or a hyrbrid hard drive to help speed things up a bit. Dell's also showing a bit of love to AMD (who must be feeling a little left out today), officially announcing its 15.4-inch D531 Latitude, available with your choice of Turion 64 or Sempron processors, but lacking the SSD and hybrid storage options of the Intel-based Latitudes. From the looks of it, all three are available now, with the D630 and D830 starting at $1,189 and $1,249, respectively, and the D531 coming in at $839 for the base configuration.
