 We've seen a few budget tablets debut at CES this year -- the Vivitar Camelio and Polaroid's M7 among them -- and the latest 7-incher to cross our path is Coby's MID7065. This $150 (not $130, as we incorrectly say in the video) slate runs Android 4.0 and is the first in Coby's lineup to feature access to Google Play.

 This device is fully Google-certified in the sense that all of Mountain View's standard programs, such as Gmail and Maps, are on board. There aren't any surprises when it comes to other specs: the MID7065 runs a dual-core Cortex A9 processor clocked at 1.GHz with 1GB RAM, and there's 8GB of internal storage (expandable up to 32GB via the microSD card slot). Other connections include mini-HDMI and a micro-USB port. There's a front-facing 0.3-megapixel camera to the left of the display, and the capacitive panel itself sports a standard resolution of 1,024 x 600.

 We spent a few minutes poking around the Play store and flipping through home screens, and we didn't notice any lag. The accelerometer was speedy at recognizing changes in display orientation as well. The MID7065's design isn't the thinnest we've seen, but the plastic body feels sturdy, and the rounded edges are comfortable in the hand. Look for the tablet to drop in the next month or two -- and check out our hands-on gallery in the meantime.
