Remember when Samsung's big-screened Galaxy Note line was considered niche? Those days are long gone. JK Shin now says that the company has sold more than 38 million Note smartphones since the original launched in late 2011. That's 28 million more than Samsung reported a year ago; for context, Nokia has sold a total of 27.3 million Lumia smartphones as of its latest earnings report. Not surprisingly, Shin sees a bright future ahead for the Galaxy Note 3. He expects Samsung to sell over 10 million units of the third-generation handset, and history suggests that the tech giant could easily reach that goal despite an abundance of competition.
