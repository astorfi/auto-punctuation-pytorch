Sony Ericsson's head Bert Nordberg has shared with Swedish publication Sydsvenskan the rather salacious news that his company was asked to build the so-called Google phone before HTC... and it turned down the opportunity. Fearing brand dilution or something equally crazy, Nordberg states that Sony Ericsson is committed to building only its own-branded hardware and will not be a subcontractor to anyone. Haughty words from a company whose own Android device is still a good couple of months away from hipsters' pockets, but we're sure Bert knows best. After all, it's not like HTC got a ton of positive press and brand awareness out of its partnership with Google, and it's exceptionally clear that SE doesn't need a dime of additional revenue. Oh, wait.
