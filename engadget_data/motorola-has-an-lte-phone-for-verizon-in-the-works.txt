That alone isn't new, but what is new is the mention of Moto in the same breath: "Motorola will be right there." He wouldn't go into specifics about models, specs, release dates, or prices, but we wouldn't be surprised if the offering looked a little like the Tegra 2-powered device codenamed Olympus (pictured) -- allegedly for AT&T -- that we've seen floating around recently. For what it's worth, we're also aware of models from HTC and LG in the pipe, so by all accounts, Big Red is planning on coming out with guns blazing when it rolls out 4G handsets next year.
