Apple Store UK had just such a snafu today, advertising Mac Pros complete with "quad-core or 8-core processing power." Apple has since revised the page, and we're sure we won't hear a peep from the company about the release until it's good and truly ready, but there's pretty much no denying that 8-core Intel action is due any day now for big spendin' power users.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
