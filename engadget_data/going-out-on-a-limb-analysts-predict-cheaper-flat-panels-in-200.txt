 With a price decrease of 14.7% over the year 2007, it's no surprise that a lot of flat panels moved from store shelves to living rooms (especially during the holiday season). As anyone who's either shopped for a display or purchased one knows, they also tend to get increasingly cheaper with time. No surprise, then, that Pacific Media Associates is calling for further drops in LCD and PDP prices over 2008. The company is predicting a 15.6% price decrease and 41% increase in volume sales in 2008. Prices are falling and increases in volume are slowing -- competition in the flat panel market just keeps getting hotter.
