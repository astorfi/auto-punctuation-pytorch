 Talk of HTC's rumored, giant DLX has veered between the plausible and not-so-plausible. We might just toss the newest tip into that former category. Football4PDA, who's developing a reputation for uncanny accuracy in leaks, has posted what's claimed to be the core specifications of HTC's first phablet. The DLX would mirror earlier expectations of a 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro and a 5-inch, 1080p display, but push past the OneX+ in more ways than just physical heft: the extra space might just help it afford 1.5GB of RAM, a 12-megapixel rear camera, a 2-megapixel front shooter and a larger-still (but non-removable) 2,500mAh battery. We're not as much of a fan of the threadbare 16GB of storage that's supposedly in the cards, though, even with a new Android 4.1.2 build in store. Provided that there's more to the story than just 136 characters, the real point of contention is the ship date -- having mostly cleared the decks between its September event and its One X+ introduction, HTC hasn't left much time for the possibly Verizon-bound flagship to show its face.
