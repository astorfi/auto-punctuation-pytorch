Debuting today at Macworld are the MultiSync LCD2690W2-BK-SV (26-inch) and LCD3090W-BK-SV (30-inch) displays, both of which come bundled with the SpectraView color calibration sensor and software. Of note, NEC's also taking this opportunity to launch the aforesaid kit as a standalone product (SVII-PRO-KIT; $329) for those who could use it, and it's fully compatible with both Windows and OS X-based systems. Oddly enough, NEC doesn't even stop to mention the native resolution on either IPS panel, though it spends a copious amount of time detailing exactly how awesome fully automated color calibration is. And it better be, given the $1,449 / $2,449 price points.
