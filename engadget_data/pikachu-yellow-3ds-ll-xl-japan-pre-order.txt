The brightly colored clamshell features a white interior and the electric rodent's visage on its lid with his tail trailing onto the underside. Priced at Â¥18,900 (roughly $238), the portable will only be available at Pokemon Center stores throughout the Land of the Rising Sun on September 15th for those who pre-order between August 25 and its release. Gamers in North America may not be able to snap up the uniquely hued system, but this weekend's launch of the 3DS XL in red and blue could provide a small measure of consolation.
