Other than that GPU which includes support for up to WQXGA (2,560 x 1,600) resolutions -- perfect for the 11.8-inch P10 mentioned in court filings -- and much more, the white paper uncovered by Android Authority also mentions support for features like Wi-Fi Display, high bandwidth LPDDR3 RAM running at up to 800MHz with a bandwidth of 12.8GBps, USB 3.0 and SATA III. It also claims the horsepower to decode 1080p video at 60fps in pretty much any codec, stereoscopic 3D plus handle graphics APIs like OpenGL ES 3.0 and OpenCL 1.1. All of this is comes courtesy of a dual-core 1.7GHz ARM Cortex-A15 CPU built on the company's 32nm High-K Metal Gate process and Panel Self Refresh technology that avoids changing pixels unnecessarily to reduce power consumption. There's plenty of other buzzwords and benchmarks floating around in the PDF, you can check them out in the PDF linked below or just sit back and see what tablets and phones arrive with one of these -- or the competition from Qualcomm's S4 and NVIDIA's Tegra -- inside starting later this year.
