 We already knew Nintendo was anticipating Wii shortages this holiday season, but it's just the beginning of November and UK retailers are already reporting dwindling supplies. While we're certain the problem is at least in part due ot what Nintendo cheerfully calls "unprecedented demand," it's a little ridiculous for there still to be supply issues a year after the Wii's launch. Come on Ninty, get crackin' -- that Vii is starting to look pretty tempting.
