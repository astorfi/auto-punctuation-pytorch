The rumors pretty much revolve around which carriers in which regions will get the phone, with a hint of speculation about a 3G update in HSDPA and UMTS rife Europe. Will Apple give us what we all want, or are we looking at the same ol' locked EDGE phone, this time with three or more different equivalents of AT&T? Or will Apple throw a fast one on us all and announce one more thing?
