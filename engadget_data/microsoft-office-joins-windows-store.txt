What makes its arrival noteworthy, however, is the fact that the productivity suite marks the first of the traditional desktop applications available in the digital storefront. Integration leaves much to be desired, however, as you can't actually make the purchase within the Windows Store. Instead, users are kicked over to Microsoft's website, where they're prompted to choose between different editions of Office, which range in price between $119 and $499. In other words, the latest "inclusion" is little more than a shortcut rather than a cohesive shopping experience. Still, if you like the idea of a full-fledged desktop productivity suite and LibreOffice simply won't cut the mustard, it's yet one more opportunity to plunk down some cash.
