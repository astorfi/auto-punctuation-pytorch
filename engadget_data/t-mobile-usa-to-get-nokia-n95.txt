To be fair, they manage to accidentally swap the N90's and N95's pictures in their sidebar, so they may have absolutely no idea what they're talking about, but for a country (and a carrier) starved for S60 devices, this is a rumor we'd very much like to cling to. As always, we'll remain cautiously optimistic until we're given sufficient reason to the contrary.[Thanks, Ray D.]
