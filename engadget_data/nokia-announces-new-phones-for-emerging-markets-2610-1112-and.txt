The Nokia 2610 is their dual-band GSM business-minded phone which features arubberized finish to combat dusty offices. It sports a 65k color display, MP3 player, speakerphone, and voice recorderamongst its middling feature set. The 1112 (pictured) is pretty much the 1110starter-phone albeit with a, um, swank black-on-white display. Rounding out the lot is the Nokia 2310 which claimsoxymoronically to be a low-end, fashion phone. It features a built-in FM radio, a host of messaging options, MP3player, and all important range of interchangeable covers so important to 12 year old girls and Engadget interns. Allthree models are expected to begin shipping sometime Q2 of â€™06.[Via Chip Chick]
