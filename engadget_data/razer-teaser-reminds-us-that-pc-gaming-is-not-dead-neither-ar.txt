Aside from telling us that "there's something terribly wrong with gaming today," we aren't given much to go regarding its impending announcement. Apparently, something "big" is coming on the 26th of August, and whatever it is (Switchblade, perhaps?), it'll remind the world that PC gaming is, in fact, not dead. Hit the source link to sign up for more, or head on past the break for a look at the ominous teaser vid.
