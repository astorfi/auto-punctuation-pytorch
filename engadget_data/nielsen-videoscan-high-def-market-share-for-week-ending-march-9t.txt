In fact, it's kinda nice to see HD DVD go out with a bang, as we suspect this will be the final week HD DVD is able to hold on to a respectable share of the market. We chalk up this week's results to Disney, because we believe that if 101 Dalmatians was released on Blu-ray this week, we'd be looking at completely different results. The reason we think that is because on DVD, the classic dog movie outsold Beowulf by over 4:1 -- that's not to say it would've sold that much better on Blu, since Beowulf probably appeals more to the HDM crowd. Blu-ray's top title didn't do too bad this week though ,but it barely bested the three week old American Gangster. As much fun as it is to see how well hot excluvies continue to sell on HD DVD, the fun is over as the only remaining new release left is Atonement in a few weeks. But even if there were any left, we doubt they'd stand up to Blu's lineup that will be reflected in next week's numbers. What's more up in the air is the status of this weekly post, but we're sure we'll think of something -- no we won't compare Blu-ray to DVD.
