Based on the box art displayed, one can assume that they plan on releasing current seasons of high-def shows on the new formats first, then working their way back through the older shows. Whether or not these will be day-and-date releases like The Sopranos remains to be seen, but we'll be keeping an eye out for Lost and 24 boxed sets.
