Which, if you're wondering, is Â£499.99 (or about $783 in US dollars, when crudely converted) and Monday, November 8th, respectively. That's just over two weeks away, which means if it is true, you won't have long to wait... and if it's not true, you'll know soon enough, anyway.

Update: PC World's spotted the same date and price for the Venue Pro on Amazon UK. You lucky Brits.
