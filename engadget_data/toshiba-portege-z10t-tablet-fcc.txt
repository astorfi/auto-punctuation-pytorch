 A Toshiba Portege Z10t tablet has stopped by the FCC -- and yes, you read that correctly. The Portege name is most readily associated with Toshiba's line of Ultrabooks, but this FCC filing hints at something different -- and takes us back a few years to Toshiba's Portege M750 and M780 convertibles. Can we expect a resurgence of these two-in-one devices? The test documents reveal that Bluetooth and 802.11n WiFi are on board, and the image seems to indicate that a rear-facing camera is located on the back, but that's about it as far as details go. Still curious? Head to the source link to give the filing a full perusing.
