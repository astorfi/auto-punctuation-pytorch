 
Are you ready for this? No, we mean are you ready for this? We sure hope so, 'cause Audiovox is about to drop eight new products on you here in the desert. Kicking things off is the Acoustic Research brand with two new iPod / iPhone-friendly sound systems: the ARS1i (36-watts) and ARS2i (50-watts). Both of these guys arrive with twin 2.5-inch carbon fiber woofers, two dome tweeters, AM / FM radio functionality, a bundled remote, backlit LCD, soft touch front keys and an auxiliary input jack. The latter also touts a built-in rechargeable battery and portable handle, and while it will list for $199.99 this Spring, the lesser-specced sibling will sell for $50 less.

Moving on, there's the RC60i and RC66i iPod clock radios from RCA, with the latter running on standard alkaline batteries and designed for the on-the-go crowd. That one will sell for a penny under $100, while the AC-powered RC60i will be offered at $79.99 when they hit this Spring. Staying on the RCA beat, there's the new line of Small Wonder pocket camcorders. The EZ4000 is a rugged, waterproof version that can capture 1080p clips onto a microSD card for $169.99 (available this Spring), while the palm-sized EZ5000 ($169.99) and EZ5100 ($199.99) look entirely more like a conventional camcorder and offer up 720p / 1080p video recording, 8 megapixel still shots, a 2.4-inch flip-out LCD and a rechargeable battery. The smaller EZ1000, EZ2000 and EZ3000 models round things out on the low end, with full specifications of these in the press release after the break.

The outfit is also introducing the DPF8100 ($129.99) and DPF8300 ($129.99) digiframes, both of which are a part of the newly created Décor series; if those are just too classy for you, there's also a 7-inch DPF7407 ($129.99), which fits squarely in the cutely named Celebration series. Closing things out are the $39.99 RCA Voice Control Remote (which gladly listens to commands that you bark at it), a gaggle of new AR outdoor wireless speakers, a few new Jensen in-car head units and Zentral Home Command smartphone remotes. Feel free to dig in for more information on those just past the break.

It's designed with a removable wood frame that can be easily replaced with nearly any 8x10 inch standard photo frame. The Company conducted testing and found that the majority (roughly 85%) of standard 8x10 ready-made frames are compatible. The "Virtual Matting" concept allows consumers to either digitally customize the photo mat using pre-selected options right in the frame, or the ability to use any personal photo to create custom matting. The Décor Series should also make a great gift item, since worrying about matching a specific décor is no longer part of the equation. The eight-inch, Décor Series, DPF8100 digital photo frame, utilizes a LCD display and comes with a unique adapter plate, built from strong molded plastic material that allows consumers to easily install virtually any 8x10 picture or metal sectional frame. The adapter contains an innovative auto catch-lock mechanism that will lock the two pieces together without the use of any tools and includes the necessary hardware. The DPF features high-resolution (Digital 800x600), a 4x3 aspect ratio, automatic video & slideshow creation via Muvee Reveal software, and includes a built-in clock and calendar, USB and a remote control. Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP): $129.99.The other model in the Décor line is the DPF8300, an eight-inch digital picture frame with Virtual Matting capabilities that will provide consumers with infinite color, texture and image options. The DPF features high-resolution (Digital 800x600), 4x3 aspect ratio, and includes a built-in clock and calendar, USB and a remote control. MSRP: $129.99.The Celebration Series is just what the name implies. These digital picture frames are not frames at all, but portable photo albums that bring pictures to life. Featuring leather covers, these frames look more like elegant books than photo frames. They have been designed to celebrate special moments like a wedding or birth, graduation or retirement. There's even a model that includes an embossed cover noting the occasion. The book-clasp doubles as a stand and the built-in rechargeable battery supports more than one hour of playing time. "These two product lines bring true flexibility to digital photo frames. The Décor series allows consumers to change the frames and customize with Virtual Matting as tastes change without having to buy new electronics. The Celebration Series lets consumers remember the important dates in life by turning a DPF into a portable photo album. These new lines will illustrate how Audiovox, through innovative product development, give dealers another profit opportunity in the DPF market," said Tom Malone, president, Audiovox Electronics Corporation.The seven-inch, Celebration Series, DPF7407 photo frame utilizes a TFT LCD display and comes in black or white with an embossed cover. The DPF features high-resolution (Digital 480x234), a 16x9 aspect ratio, automatic video & slideshow creation via Muvee Reveal, and includes a built-in clock and calendar, USB and a remote control. MSRP: $129.99."And these lines are not just a pretty face. The models have full compatibility for your entire media card needs (SD/MMC/MS/MS pro), internal memory of 128MB and will support JPEG, MJPEG to playback videos, photos, or music. Even without the unique frame concepts they are quality offerings for consumers," said Malone.Other models in the Celebration Series include the DPF7404 4.3-inch digital picture frame design dedicated to special occasions.
