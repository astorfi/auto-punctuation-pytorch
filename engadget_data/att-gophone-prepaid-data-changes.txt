AT&T's GoPhone plans are undergoing a major shakedown, and you'll get a preliminary taste on June 20th once existing data packages are given the axe. Smartphone users who want internet access on GoPhone's $25 or $50 plans currently have the option to purchase a 50MB data add-on per month for $5, a 200MB add-on for $15 or a 1GB add-on for $25. Only the $5 option will remain once the changes hit -- and we all know having to budget 50MB of data in a month is a sad, sad proposition. Subscribers to the $50 plan have it even worse as they won't be able to purchase any data add-on at all. Fortunately, the $65 plan that comes with 1GB of data remains untouched.


Things might not be as bad as they seem. When we reached out to AT&T, a spokesperson said:



Beginning June 20, we're making some changes to our AT&T GoPhone prepaid plans to simplify our offers and better align with what customers are choosing and telling us they want. We've begun letting customers know about the changes in advance, and we'll have more information on new, additional plan options soon.



The mention of "new, additional plans" coming soon gives us hope that the company is introducing new options to make the service more smartphone-friendly once again.
