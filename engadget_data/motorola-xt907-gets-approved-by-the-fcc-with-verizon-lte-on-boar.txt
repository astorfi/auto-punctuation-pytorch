The XT907, a rumored midrange handset, just got pushed through the federal approval process today with Big Red's LTE bands, NFC and the standard CDMA / EVDO radios to boot. We'll keep digging to see what else we can find about the device, but at least the FCC has blessed us with yet another fun mystery to solve.
