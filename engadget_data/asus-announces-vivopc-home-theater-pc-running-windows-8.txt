During a chock-a-block event at Computex 2013, ASUS just announced the VivoPC, a compact Windows 8-based home theater PC that can also double as your primary desktop. It'll let you stream HD video via a newfangled 802.11ac WiFi connection, and has a similar spun metal design to the freshly announced VivoMouse. The mini-PC will also feature ASUS's SonicMaster audio, but that's all we know so far in terms of specs -- of course, as soon as we find out such minor details as, say, processor, RAM and storage, we'll update you right here.
