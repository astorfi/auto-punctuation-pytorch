Netflix already pulled whodunnit The Killing from the scrap pile once, working out a deal with AMC to produce a third season for airing and subsequent streaming, and now it's done it again. The Killing will see a fourth and final six-episode season (when is still up in the air), produced by Fox, which Netflix will stream exclusively in the areas where it provides service. This, along with continued hints of more Arrested Development in the works will probably get fans of other canceled/about-to-be canceled series excited, although we'll have to wait and see how many refurb projects Netflix is ready to put next to its original content.
