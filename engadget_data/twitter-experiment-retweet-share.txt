Twitter can't help itself. If it's not new pictures, tweet views and video previews, then it could be an epoch-defining change to what the social network called one of its core features: retweets. So, it's possibly not a big deal, but in Twitter's latest experiment, it's been changed to 'share' -- terminology closer aligned to its rival, Facebook. For the moment, only a handful of users appear to see the substitute share button and it's appearing in both the Android and iOS apps. At the same time, and probably unrelated, a new design to profile pages inside mobile apps has also appeared, with a not-so-faint Facebook vibe. Take a look after the break, and if you're one of the chosen few, let us know your thoughts on either experiment in the comments.
