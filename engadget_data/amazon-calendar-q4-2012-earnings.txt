 It's still the same old story, really. Amazon pulls in revenues equal to a small nation's GDP and makes a small profit for itself in the process. In this case, particularly small. Jeff Bezos' little company that could has posted fourth-quarter turnover of $21.27 billion, a 22 percent increase, but a net profit of $97 million that's down 45 percent from a year earlier. The discrepancy is attributed to a shift in reading habits that Bezos claims the company was expecting. Kindle downloads have been growing quickly, but old-fashioned paper book sales grew just 5 percent in December -- the lowest in company history, Bezos says. That's not surprising when you look at Amazon's bestseller charts, as the Kindle Fire HD and three other Kindle devices led the ranks. Most of the concern centers on the future. Amazon expects its operating income to dip from $405 million to anywhere between a $285 million loss and a $65 million profit, which doesn't exactly set a high bar for post-holiday performance.

  Financial Guidance
  The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of January 29, 2013. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce and the various factors detailed below.

  -- Net sales are expected to be between $15.0 billion and $16.6 billion, or to grow between 14% and 26% compared with first quarter 2012.
  -- Operating income (loss) is expected to be between $(285) million and $65 million, compared to $192 million in the prior year period.

  A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir . This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
  These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
