That interestingly titled GejBox that we peeked last month has seemingly been redubbed DivX Connected, received a slight facelift, and best of all, has been caught in the wild. According to DivX, "Connected is a digital home platform and interoperability standard for networked media devices, PCs and, online services," and it can supposedly access Stage6, Google Video, and ShoutCast internet radio when not playing back media on any of your networked machines. The boxes are apparently being doled out on a very limited basis and are still marked as beta hardware, but judging by the photos, it features an Ethernet port, built-in WiFi, a USB connector, and a remote to keep you firmly situated on the sofa. You know the drill, check out a few more pics after the jump.[Thanks, Dave T.]
