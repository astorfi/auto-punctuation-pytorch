It's been only a day since 4.3 hit the scene and already we've seen hints of future iPhone / iPad models, a Find My Friends feature, and now more hints of a camera for the next iPad. Which, of course, is far from the first time we've heard iPad and camera in the same utterance (cases, mockups, paperwork, even more code). Today's revelation comes in the form of shutter screens and camera / video icons care of 9 to 5 Mac, but here's the catch: to believe these imagery to be the real thing is to also accept that the iPad 2 might have the same 1024 x 768 display, given that's what these pictures are optimized for. You didn't really believe the iPad 2 would have a 9.7-inch, 2530 x 1897 resolution retina display... did you? Well, it's only speculative, anyway.
