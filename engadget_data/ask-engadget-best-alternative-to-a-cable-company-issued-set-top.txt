This week's Ask Engadget question is coming to   us from Ozair, who is no longer down with forking out monthly for a subpar DVR experience. If you're looking to  send in an inquiry of your own, drop us a line at ask [at]  engadget [dawt] com.

"With the unveiling of (pricey) Google TV, what are the other, cheaper alternatives to setting up HDTV via a cable box rather than renting out Optimum / Cablevision's outdated and laggy set-top box? TiVo? Any other standalone DVRs? Something I'm not considering?"
For those of you who've purchased a standalone DVR + CableCARD setup (or possibly even an HTPC + CableCARD setup), how are you enjoying it? Let this fellow know your optimal arrangement down in comments below -- make it quick, it's not like he can afford to miss this year's burning of the Yule Log in HD.
