According to Notebook Review, the cat's outof the bag and Dell's launching (or is about to launch) their second gaming-centric laptop, but this one's alittle easier on theshoulder and presumably also the pocketbook. The XPS M1210 rocks a 12.1-inch widescreen display, Core Duoprocessor, NVIDIA 7300 or ATI X1300 graphics, dual later DVD burner, Bluetooth 2.0, 802.11a/b/g, 5-in-1 media reader,ExpressCard54 slot, up to 4GB RAM, and an optional webcam. Should be out some time in May, but we'll know for sure whenwe get the official word from the gang at Dell.[Thanks, Ben]
