Last time he did this he burned the then unannounced Nokia N8 to the ground. He's coy with any details but the "I do not like this device" machine translation is pretty telling as is that AT&T logo. One more pic of the backside 8 megapixel shooter after the break as we brace for things to come.

Update: We've been told by a source that only two of the four "speakers" at the corners emit sound. At least that was the case for the unit tested by our contact.
