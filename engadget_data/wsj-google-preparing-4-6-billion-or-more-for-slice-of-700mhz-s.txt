 $4.6 Billion. That's the number Google is preparing for rights to the 700MHz wireless spectrum according to the Wall Street Journal. Even more, if that's what's required to get a chunk of that sweet-spot frequency for consumer electronics. Citing "people familiar with the matter," Google is planning to make the offer alone, without any partners, relying on their own cash and possibly some borrowed money. To illustrate how serious Google is taking the matter, the WSJ reports that Google is already running an advanced wireless network under a test license from the FCC at its Mountain View campus. Why? In order to gain the knowledge necessary to run a national carrier. You know, just in case they win the auction and decide that that is the business model they wish to pursue. The FCC deadline for declaring intent to bid is December 3rd. A date Verizon, AT&T and others are watching very, very closely.
