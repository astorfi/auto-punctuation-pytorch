 Looks like GM's got more than plug-in hybrid vehicles up its sleeve for 2007, announcing this fully-loaded key fob set to debut in April of next year. In addition to the mundane task of unlocking your doors, it'll display your car's tire pressure, odometer reading, and the amount of fuel in the tank, as well as let you change the radio station settings before you step outside (we're still trying to wrap our heads around that one), not to mention start the car if you get the remote start package along with it. GM also claims that the fob's two-way community will give it four to six times the range of competing units. Of course you'll have to pay a premium to get all that excitement at your fingertips: $150, and it won't be available on all GM models (at least to start with), just full-size SUVs, pickups, and crossover-utility vehicles.
