Turns out they forgot to do much drawing, and their resulting O ROKR product looks (and feels)just as weak this time around, though thankfully they're adding A2DP for piping stereo tunes from your spankin' new ROKR E2. Oakleyalso claims they're totally upping the ante as well with High Definition Optics or some such marketing speak, butunless they're bringing us a few sets of 720 or 1080 pixels when these launch in the first half of the year, we'regoing to withhold the term HD from some mere UV blocking shades.[Thanks, Buzz]Read
