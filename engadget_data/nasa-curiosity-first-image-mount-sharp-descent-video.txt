The shot above is the first high(ish) resolution photo shown to the public from its cameras, depicting a shadow of its top, a peculiar Martian landscape and the three-mile Mount Sharp. Just beyond the break, you'll find video footage of the intense descent onto Mars' surface. It's a low-res stop-motion affair displaying 297 frames as it found its way from space to a foreign land. Trust us -- it's worth the 1:03 time investment.
