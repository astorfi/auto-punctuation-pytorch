 Sony's withdrawn Everybody's Tennis from the PlayStation Store after discovering it could be used to hack the PS Vita. The game was pulled without warning (probably to the consternation of tennis fans) as the company attempts to keep absolute control on its new platform. It's the second title to get the treatment after hacker Wololo discovered an exploit in Motorstorm Arctic Edge that allowed the Vita Half-Byte-loader to be launched on the device. It looks like the game of cat-and-mouse between massive corporation and a single individual will continue for a while, with Wololo claiming they've got access to around 10 more undiscovered exploits. Popcorn, anyone?
