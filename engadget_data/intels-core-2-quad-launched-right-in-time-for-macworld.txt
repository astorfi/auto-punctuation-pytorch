 Intel just spat out their first Core 2 Quad branded processors right on schedule and just hours before Macworld... hmm. As the name implies, Intel packs in 4 cores per processor. Three new quad-core processors were released today, one for desktops and two for entry-level servers. The 2.4GHz Core 2 Quad Q6600 for desktops replaces the E6700 Core 2 Duo at the top-end of their consumer-bound procs and will demand $851 when purchased in bulk. Servers get their bump with the 2.13GHz and 2.4GHz Core 2 Quad Xeon 3200 series based on the "Kentsfield" core. The X3220 (2.4GHz) is priced at $851while the X3210 (2.13GHz) hits in quantity for $690.
