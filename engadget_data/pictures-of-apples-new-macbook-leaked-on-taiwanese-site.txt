 We can't say for sure these are the real deal, but if recent leaks of iPhone 3G production models are any indication, we might just be looking at Apple's new MacBook. It's a bit hard to make out what's happening in these photos, but to our eyes we're seeing the back of a metal laptop lid, as well as the as-yet-unused inner panel of the display. The text clearly reads MacBook, which falls right in line with rumors that the next iteration of the smaller laptops would be aluminum just like their big brothers. Right now it's anyone's guess if these pics are legit or not -- but you can be sure we'll be keeping a close watch on this one as these pictures emanate from the same site carrying the last supposed leak. Two more shots after the break.
