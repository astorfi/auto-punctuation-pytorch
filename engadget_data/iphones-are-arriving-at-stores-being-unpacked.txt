Even though El Jobso banned cameras from the backrooms of iPhone outlets, an overzealous employee as just posted some pics in the MacRumors forum of an iPhone in just such a spot. Too bad Sunshine McBrilliant included his obvious wrist tattoo in a couple of these pics -- maybe he can list "blurry cameraphone photography" on his resume when he starts looking for a new job tomorrow.
