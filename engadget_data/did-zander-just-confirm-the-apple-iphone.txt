Seems people are more interested these days about what Motorola CEO
Ed Zander has to
say about Apple than, well, what he has to say about his
own music playin' whipping boy.
Now sound-bite Ed
appears to confirm the much speculated Apple iPhone saying, "We know that they are going to build a smart
phoneâ€”it's only a matter of time." The quote came after an MIT presentation where Zander, get this, showed off a prototype device
that can "receive and play music videos." Any chance those are coming from
an
iTunes Movie Store, Ed?
