Their version of the V3i did feature iTunes (with 100 song cap) which managed to pump-out"pretty good" audio over the included headphones although "a lot of people will wish for morevolume." Otherwise, the list of included applications, while functionally fine, were found to be "a bitpaltry" compared to "most other phones these days." Overall though, they lay down a "highlyrecommended" rating calling it a "great device" for both practical and aesthetic reasons.
