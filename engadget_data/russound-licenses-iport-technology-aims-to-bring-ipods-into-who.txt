 As if the iPod wasn't ubiquitous enough, Russound has just licensed Dana Innovations' patented iPort concept and integrating technologies in an attempt to tie in Apple's darling with whole home AV systems. Apparently the company views said PMP as a "music server rather than a simple portable player," and now that the agreement is in place, we should see a slew of new kit designed with tight iPod integration in mind. Unfortunately, details beyond that are scant, but Charlie Porritt, Russound's vice president of sales, did note that the forthcoming products would be aimed at consumers "who treat their iPods as a primary source of entertainment in the home."
