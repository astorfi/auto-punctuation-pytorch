 You might take the Play Store and other Google apps for granted when shopping around for Android tablets, but for Coby it's a Big Deal (with a capital "B"). So much so that after releasing its first Google-certified slate back in January, it's coming out with three more, in 8-, 9- and 10-inch flavors. (A Coby rep told us the idea is to catch as many customers as possible.) Despite the different screen sizes, they all boast the same specs as the 7-inch model we showed you at CES, including a dual-core Amlogic 8226-MX CPU, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of built-in storage, a microSD reader supporting 32GB cards and a 0.3-megapixel webcam up front. They also have modest 2MP cameras 'round back, which the 7-incher doesn't have.

 Design-wise, the 8-inch MID 8065 and 9-inch 9760 have the same plastic construction as the 7-inch one, albeit with higher-res screens. The 10-inch MID 1065, though, has a more premium-feeling metal casing, along with an IPS panel (the pixel count tops out at 1,280 x 800, so don't get too excited). Indeed, the viewing angles are better than what we saw on the 7-incher, but you're still going to suffer delays even when you flip the tablet to change screen orientations. So far, we know the 8- and 10-inch models are coming to the US for $180 and $230. As for the 9-inch version, there's no room for it in the states, apparently, but a Coby rep from Germany told us it'll go on sale there later this month for around â‚¬219. As your lead reviews editor, I can tell you the Magic 8 Ball is turning up an "outlook not good" on a possible review, but we've added some hands-on photos below if you've just got to get a closer look.
