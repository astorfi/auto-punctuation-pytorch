Now, there aren't a lot of details to go round here, but Nikon Rumors is reporting that Chasseur d'Image -- a print magazine in France with a history of publishing rumors that turn into reality -- has published a report that Nikon will soon announce the VP650. What is this VP650, you ask? Well, it's a hybrid compact digital camera with an LED projector (which may or may not be manufactured by Taiwanese company Foxlink) that can project 8 x 12 images in "good quality" in the dark. Chasseur d'Image reports that the VP650 will ship in September. Like we said -- not a whole lot of detail, but we'll keep our eyes peeled to see if this thing ever appears. We'll say this though -- such a product would probably make the tiny projector a lot more attractive.
