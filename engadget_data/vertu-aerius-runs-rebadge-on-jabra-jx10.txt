You wouldn't think the answer would be a 1yr+ old Jabra JX10 rebadge, but there it is. Guess the headset being designed by Jacob Jensen (say: Yakub Yensin) meant it was good enough to slap their label on (and bend the ear hook around a bit). We don't know how much more they think they can get away with charging for this thing, but that so sexy V seems to lure 'em in (oh, and apparently you get a nice leather pouch to go with it, too).
