The second-gen Galaxy S launched at MWC this year with Samsung's own Exynos dual-core solution at its heart, but it seems that yields of that chip haven't been good enough to sate the expected high demand for the handset. So, in steps NVIDIA with its soon-to-be-ubiquitous Tegra 2 -- which runs at the same 1GHz as Exynos and offers comparable performance -- to fill in the supply gap. The decision as to which part you'll get in your next Samsung smartphone will depend on which territory you're in, with Americans and Brits likely to get first bite at the Exynos cherry.
