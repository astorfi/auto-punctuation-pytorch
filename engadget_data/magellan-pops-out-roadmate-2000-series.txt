 Magellan is taking things to the low-end with their new RoadMate 2000 series, but the new portable GPS units aren't without frills. The base-model RoadMate 2000 brings the SiRF Star III action for a mere $400. At 7.9 ounces and 1.1-inches thick, the device sports a 3.5-inch display and includes SmartDetour re-routing, along with battery power for use when traveling on foot. Another hundie will get you the RoadMate 2200T, which can handle extra info via SD memory, along with real-time traffic, points of interest, text-to-speech directions, MP3 playback and photo viewing. The unit purports to have an eight hour batter life, and can wear an optional "Sports Guard" jacket for impact and water resistance. At $550 the RoadMate 2500T features the "CrossoverGPS" capabilities available to the 2200T via SD card expansion, allowing for all sorts of off-road and backpacking exploration fun. The unit also comes with the Sports Guard sleeve for extra rough-and-tumble action. The three GPS units should be available in North America this September, October and December respectively.[Via gps tracklog]
