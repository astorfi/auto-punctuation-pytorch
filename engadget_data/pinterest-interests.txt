It hasn't been easy to browse Pinterest for pin-worthy things without the help of your friends -- not unless you've been willing to search entire categories, anyway. That hunt should be much easier now that the social network has rolled out its Interests tool on the web. The section recommends relevant items based on what you've pinned in the past. Look for tourist hotspots in a distant city, for example, and Interests will suggest places you might have missed. Pinterest's new advisor isn't yet available worldwide or on mobile devices, but it should reach every member in the near future.
