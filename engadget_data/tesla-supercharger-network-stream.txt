 What is Tesla Motors' Elon Musk hiding up his sleeve? "Alien spaceships landed at highway rest stops," we're told, but all will be unveiled tonight at Tesla's Supercharger Network debut stream. All we know about Tesla's Supercharger Network thus far is it'll offer charging and battery swaps for the company's electric cars -- presumably "at highway rest stops" -- but tonight promises far more information. Will the stations be solar-powered, as some speculate? Will they introduce us to actual aliens in actual spaceships? Tune in to the company's stream to find out!

 Update: It's alive! We've embedded the video steam for your convenience. You'll find all the action right after the break.
