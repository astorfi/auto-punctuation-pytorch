Both LCDs boast a WSXGA+ (1,680 x 1,050) resolution, 300 cd/m2 brightness, a 1,000:1 contrast ratio, 5-millisecond response time and VGA / USB 2.0 connectors. The USB functionality is being coined EzLink by ASUS, but it's no different than the DisplayLink you've grown to know and love. As per ASUS' apparent internal guidelines, it has completely failed in dishing out pricing information for the freshly available duo, but hey, at least we know they're out there!
