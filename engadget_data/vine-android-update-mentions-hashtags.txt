Vine proved you can do a lot with six seconds of video, and thanks to its latest Android update you can do even more. Version 1.3.4 brings a couple of usability fixes to help the world see your valiant attempts at short-form comedy, including @ mentions in posts and comments and autocompletion for hashtags. The changelog notes "other bugs fixes and improvements" too, but the takeaway here is that the Google version is just about on par with the iOS one. Now, could you please hurry along and make one of those rad stop-motion clips for us? Thanks.



Vine for Android now includes mentions - tag people in your posts and comments. Plus, hashtag auto-complete & more https://t.co/xEtAOyzRFO
