This person recently had a working model in their possession for a few minutes and managed to glean quite a bit of detail that would seemingly confirm Apple's plan to announce an 11-inch MacBook Air at the "Back to the Mac" event later today. Here's what we've been told to expect:

Smaller 11.6-inch display.
2.13GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (with a 2.33GHz option possible).
2GB of memory in the base configuration.
No optical drive, naturally.
Mini DisplayPort, USB, and SD card reader along the left-hand side and USB and power on the right (that's 2x USB).
The trackpad has been updated to match that of the new MacBook Pros.
Although smaller due to the 11.6-inch display, it's still about the same thickness as the current MacBook Air.
A black power key now sits immediately to the right of a smaller eject key on the MBA's keyboard -- the round aluminum power button is gone. A design decision that might support the MBA's rumored instant-on capabilities though our source didn't see this functionality exhibited (possibly because it was running OS X 10.6.4).

Unfortunately, our source couldn't identify the graphics or the storage related to the rumored "SSD Card." So where does that leave us? Well, it looks like a smaller (and presumably, cheaper) MacBook Air originally rumored by AppleInsider is in the bag for a Steve Jobs announcement later today as is a refresh to the 13.3-inch model we broke last week (pictured nekkid above). So check back in a few hours and watch the reveal live, won't you?

Update: Reader Lucas F. submitted a mockup of the new power and eject keys which you can see after the break.
