According to BGR, this one shrinks things down even further while still staying "sturdy as a rock" and, somewhat interestingly, includes two SIM card slots. Apart from that, you can expect the CDMA / quad-band GSM handset to pack a 3-megapixel camera and built-in Bluetooth, but any other details seem to be a bit hard to come by at the moment. That unfortunately also includes any word on pricing or availability, though BGR says not to expect a launch at CTIA next week.
