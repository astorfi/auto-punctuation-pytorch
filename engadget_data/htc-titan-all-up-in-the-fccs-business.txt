 The existence of HTC's follow up to the venerable Apache comes as a surprise to no one; after all, we've seeing it time and time again. Still, there's some sort of wave of reassurance that washes over us when we see a promised new handset get two thumbs-up from our boys and girls at the Fed. Still no word on exactly when we'll see the device materialize -- which is expected on Sprint and Verizon alike as the PPC6800 and XV6800, respectively -- but this filing should at least clear the path for both carriers to hold to their roadmaps; with EV-DO Rev. A, Bluetooth 2.0, and beefed-up internal storage all in the cards, those roadmaps really can't come quickly enough.
