Seiko, whichoriginally put a price of about $2,000 on the watch, has now decided to offer it up on eBay as part of a charityauction for British charity Help a London Child. The auction is expected to start on March 19th and run through March25th. Seiko is only making 500 of these, so if you want one, get ready to start bidding.
