With all the excitement around the latest news in the world of digital downloads, we though we'd take a cue from our good friends at gdgt.com and hold a roundtable on the subject. Rather than choose other professionals on the subject for the panel, we reached out to fans of digital downloads to get real world impressions of what is actually out there. We get deep into the why people want downloads, why the market has yet to reach the masses, and finally, we all make our predictions of when we think Blu-ray Discs will be like VHS is today. So if you have strong feelings about the future of discs, you're going to really love this.
