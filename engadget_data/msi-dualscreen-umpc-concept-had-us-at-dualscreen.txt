Only the lower of the two screens is touchable, and it while would naturally be a tad small for regular typing, we could almost see a decent thumboarding scenario arising. But really, we're just taken in with the look of this thing. It's incredibly thin, pure premium, and the little clock display on the is just icing on an already sexy cake. There's no word on what's under the hood here -- we'd have to guess some Atom variant, since this will run Windows -- and we're naturally in the dark about the rest of the vitals like price and release date.
