When Microsoft said it had a new Xbox One user experience in store at E3, it wasn't joking around. The company has unveiled its redesigned console interface, and it has very little in common with the tile-based UI you use today. The focuses here are on speed and community -- there's a quick menu for some of your most common tasks, and a prominent activity feed shows what your friends are up to. Oh, and Microsoft's Cortana voice assistant will play a big role on the Xbox, too. You can tell the system to handle certain duties (such as starting a party) at any point, even while you're playing. Microsoft hasn't said just when the new experience arrives beyond "soon," but the tech giant has historically rolled out these bigger Xbox updates late in the year.


Update: Check after the break for a quick video walkthrough of the new UI.
