An almost empty webpage has appeared on Motorola's US portal, apparently confirming the existence of a handset going by the name of the Droid Ultra. Now, while there are specs listed, all the numbers match those of the RAZR M, so we're pretty sure it's a cloned template and not a true indication of hardware. Alongside a space where the device would normally be pictured sits a box headed "think thin," which pegs the Droid Ultra as having a DuPont Kevlar body and a selection of "glossy colors." There's nothing more to add right now, but it seems the Moto X isn't the only handset Google's smartphone division has been working on.
