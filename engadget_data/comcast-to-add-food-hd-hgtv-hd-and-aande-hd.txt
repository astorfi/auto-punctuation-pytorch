       We received some tips from readers in the Boston area that Comcast has added Food HD, HGTV HD and A&E HD to the HD lineup. This is usually a good indicator that all Comcast customers will be enjoying these channels soon, but there is no official word. This is turning out to be the year for new HD channels, so we hope that these will be available to everyone, along with all the rest of the new channels announced for this year, that at least DirecTV will be carrying after their new birds are operational.[Thanks Bob!]**Update** According to Multi-channel news it is now official. They will add the new channels to every Comcast area that has the available bandwidth.
