 Note the plural use of "phone" in that headline quote. It comes from HP's Senior VP Eric Cador who said, "you will see us coming early next year with new phones," when speaking at an industry conference today in Barcelona. Of course, he's referring to smartphones running webOS and not some WinMo followup to the iPAQ Glisten for crissake. Sure, it's not much, but when you're as desperate as we are for the next Palm device then every scrap of information counts.
