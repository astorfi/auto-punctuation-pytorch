The invite doesn't offer up too many clues as to what will be revealed at this particular time, but we have a feeling the company may offer its competition to whatever products Nokia will unveil tomorrow (hint: not Android). Regardless of what it may be, we'll be there to give you the full scoop. We'll post more details as they flow in.
