Looks like Dell is the latest manufacturer to fall victim to
sizzling batteries: the company is
recalling about 35,000 laptop batteries (a relatively small number) that were sold either separately or with certain
models of Latitude, Inspiron, and Precision machines between October 5th, 2004 and October 13th of this year. No
injuries have been reported yet, but Dell claims that three people suffered singed tables, desks, and "minor damage to
personal effects." To find out if you own one of the offending batteries, contact Dell with the suspect's ID number,
and Dell will whisk you a new one post haste (although no word on whether you have to
hit the post office in order to pick it up).
