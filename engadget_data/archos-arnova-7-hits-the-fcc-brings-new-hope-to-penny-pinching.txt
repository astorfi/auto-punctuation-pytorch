The Arnova 7 slate has just graced the FCC, accompanied by the requisite confidentiality requests, which means we won't get any real-deal shots of the thing, nor a full list of specs, but we did get a rather nice sketch of the WiFi tablet via the good old label-placement diagram. If that outline's got you all worked up, the Arnova 7's already received some pricing and spec details overseas, rocking a â‚¬99 price tag, 800x480-pixel display, and Android 2.2. Now we'll just have to wait and see how that translates when the Arnova 7 makes its way across the pond.
