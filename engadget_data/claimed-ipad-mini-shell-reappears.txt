Its view of a WiFi model gives us both a much clearer look as well as some hints that Apple wants more than a basic slab at the iPad's potential new entry level: there's a conspicuous cutout for what's likely a rear-facing camera, along with space in the top frame for a front camera. We've already seen the mini dock connector that fits in that hole at the bottom edge, of course. Nothing's definite unless there's either a smoking gun leak or an official event, but we may have just a month to wait to know whether or not the Kindle Fire HD 7-inch has some fresh competition.
