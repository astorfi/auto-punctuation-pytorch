There's not a whole lot of details to report at the moment, but the device (assigned the iH85 designation in SDI's naming scheme) is apparently water-resistant and, from the pics, appears to provide some protection for your precious iPod, as well what may or may not be a wireless remote so you won't have to pull over and disassemble the whole unit every time you want to skip a track or crank the volume. Needless to say, there's also no word on pricing or availability, though that and some more specs should be revealed at the big show in Vegas.
