If successful, the game will launch for PC sometime in the spring of 2015 via "Steam and DRM-free digital distribution methods." Mac/Linux versions will be produced if the $1.35 million stretch goal is reached. Likewise, Xbox 360, Wii U and PlayStation 3 versions will be developed if the campaign manages to raise $2.5 million.

The game's development team includes Mega Man series alumnus Nayoa Tomita and Manami Matsumae, who served as level designer and composer (respectively) on the original Mega Man, in addition to artist Shinsuke Komaki, whose resume includes character/mecha design work on Mega Man Legends. Mega Man 9/Mega Man 10 developer Inti Creates is also involved, with CEO Takuya Aizu listed as being responsible for "executing on the designs his company and Comcept create together for Mighty No. 9."

The game is a side-scrolling shooter, which concerns a robot named Beck â€“ the ninth in a series of robots called the "Mighty Numbers." The other eight Mighty Numbers have gone rogue due to a virus, and it's up to Beck (and his female robot companion Call) to stop them. Each defeated Mighty Number grants Beck a new power, but Beck also has the ability to transform his limbs into various tools (giant magnets, tank treads, etc) to dispose of enemies and traverse the environment. You know, call us crazy but this sounds kinda familiar.
