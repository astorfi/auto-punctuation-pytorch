 
There are some days when we just can't believe we get paid to work for Engadget -- and a day when a Pioneer Elite BDP-95FD Blu-ray player and VSX-94TXH Audio/Video Receiver show up at our labs, is most definitely one of those days. Pioneer really knows how to make some nice looking hardware and as you hold them, there's no doubt you have a premium product in your hands. Our initial impressions of both components have us very impressed and while we slave away putting this high-end hardware through the paces, you'll have to wait for our full review. So enjoy the pics and if you think of any questions about this new hardware, drop 'em in the comments and we'll do our best to report back.
