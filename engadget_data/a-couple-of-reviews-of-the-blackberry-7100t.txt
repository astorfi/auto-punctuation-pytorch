So far only a couple of reviews of that new BlackBerry 7100t have trickled out, but both PC Magazine and hoary old
Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal mainly have nice things to say about RIM's new smartphone (or whatever you
want to call it). Of course they focus mainly on the unusual newfangled keyboard they've grafted onto this thing, which
squeezes two letters onto each key and uses software to guess which one you want, with Mossberg saying it's not quite
as easy to use as the one on the Treo (why are we not surprised he'd say that?) and PC Mag finding that they were
typing with ease after the first 15 minutes.
