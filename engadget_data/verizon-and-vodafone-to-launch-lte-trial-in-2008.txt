Suppliers will include Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia-Siemens, and Nortel with devices anticipated from the usuals (LG, Samsung, Motorola, Nokia, and Sony Ericsson) in addition to non-traditional consumer electronics companies looking to get a foothold on the nascent wireless broadband service. Presumably the latter is a nod in the direction of Verizon's suspect, Open Development initiative announced earlier this week. No word on dates or locations but we'll certainly let you know how this trial network, with a theoretical 100Mbps download and 50Mbps upload capability, unfolds.
