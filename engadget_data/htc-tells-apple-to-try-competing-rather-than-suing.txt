 Apple has proven, time and time again, that it is not shy about dragging its competitors before the ITC over patent disputes. And, while its fellow smartphone makers have never held back from defending themselves, HTC's general counsel Grace Lei had some particularly pointed words for Jobs and co. regarding Cupertino's latest volley of suits. In a statement Lei said that, "HTC is disappointed at Apple's constant attempts at litigations instead of competing fairly in the market." This is the second time Apple has attempted to block the import of devices from the Taiwanese manufacturer, and the purveyors of all things i are also currently on the offensive against Samsung, GetJar, and Amazon in patent and trademark disputes. At this rate the company is probably spending almost as much on legal fees as it is on the engineers and designers tasked with whipping up its next generation of mobile products.
