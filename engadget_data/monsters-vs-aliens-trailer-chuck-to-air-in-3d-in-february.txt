NBC has been feverishly pushing a 3D airing of a Monsters vs. Aliens trailer on Super Bowl Sunday, and a 3D episode of Chuck will follow later in February. We were even blasted with a shot of Jerome Bettis rockin' some super ugly 3D glasses, of which you'll be able to procure yourself for free in the coming weeks at select Pepsi and Sobe kiosks. Obviously, since the ads were shown to all watching tonight's tilt, no special television will be needed to enjoy the eye-popping content; now, let's just wait and see if any 3D clips are snuck into the actual Super Bowl.[Via TVByTheNumbers]
