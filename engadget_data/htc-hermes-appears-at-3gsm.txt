 
Well,well, well. Hello there, HTC Hermes,so lovely to finally see you in person (kind of), up close. We don't have any idea how long this'll take to get tomarket (if we're talking about America, then it'll probably be a year or more, if ever), but apparently PocketPC Italiacan confirm that it rocks UMTS / HSDPA, has a 300MHz Samsung processor, 128MB flash and 64MB memory, 2.8-inch display,802.11b/g, Bluetooth 2.0, MicroSD, 2.1 megapixel camera, and a secondary videoconferencing camera. Expect it to enterthe market as the QTEK 9600 in late summertime, and don't be surprised if T-Mobile Germanyannounces it some time around then, too.[Thanks, Mark]
