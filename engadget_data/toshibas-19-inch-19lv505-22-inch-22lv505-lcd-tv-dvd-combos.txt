       Sure, the sets we're about to mention would be a fair bit more interesting if they rocked an integrated high-definition disc player, but nevertheless, Toshiba did take the time to crank out a pair of new LCD TV / DVD combos at CES. Kicking things off is the 19-inch 19LV505 (19LV506 in glossy white), which offers up a chassis depth of 2.64-inches, HDMI / PC inputs and support for WMA, MP3, JPEG and DivX files. Stepping it up is the 22-inch 22LV505, which boasts a 1,680 x 1,050 resolution, 1,000:1 contrast ratio, a five-millisecond response time, a depth of 2.95-inches and support for the same files already mentioned. Grab one for the kids at $479.99 / $599.99.
