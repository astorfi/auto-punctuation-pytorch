Sony was never one to just sit back and watch the other manufacturers throw down the tiny tiny cams; so they're at
it again with their new Cyber-shot DSC-T9, a 6 megapixel shooter that goes for the whole "I'm sized just like your
credit card," shtick that's all the rage these days. It's not as thin as that
DSC-T7 craziness, but we're digging
the look all the same. Lest you believe we're all about the physicality of this device, which we are, they're packing a
3x zoom and optical image stabilization (into this 0.80-inch thick camera), along with 58MB of built-in memory and a
30FPS VGA movie mode. Along with the camera, which should be available November 18th for around $400 (at least in
Japan), Sony is being nice enough to offer a underwater housing for another hundred, so you can tote your fashion cam
wherever that fashionable life of yours might take you.
