 Lookslike Apple wants to make sure to own a piece of every sector of the iPod accessory market. In addition to the $349 iPod Hi-Fi, the company alsoannounced its own $99 leather iPod case. Sure, it's a pretty basic sleeve, and only fits the iPod with video or nano,but if you want an official Apple case with an Apple logo and "iPod" stamped on the front, this is the placeto go (though we hear there are some pretty convincing knockoffs available on Canal Street for about $15).
