 Sprint may have missed out on an exclusive Treo 700P offering, but at least they plan on being first to market. Sure, the 700P is missing WiFi support and a few other notable exclusions, but if EV-DO and the promise of watching Sprint TV on that 320 x 320 screen is your PalmOS siren song then get ready -- Sprint will be kicking these out the door at the end of the month for $399.99 green after available discounts and promotions. Meaning, you'll likely have to sign up for a two-year commitment which is pretty much what we expected anyway and exactly what the WinMo 700W went for when it was launched. [Via PalmAddicts]
