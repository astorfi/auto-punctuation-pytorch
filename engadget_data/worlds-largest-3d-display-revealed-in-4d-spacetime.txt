 Ooo, ahhh, you feeling that 3D display on your 2D panel? You should, it's the world's largest 3D LCD panel from VMJ measuring in at 65-inches. The stereoscopic panel developed with support from VisuMotion features a 1920 x 1080 resolution, 6-ms refresh, 120-degree viewing angle, and DVI and RGB inputs. Best of all, no goofy 3D glasses of any type are required thanks to the incorporation of Sharp's Parallax Barrier viewing technology. Priced at Â¥3.15 million (about $30k) when it starts advertising CosaNostra Pizza around Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong.[Via Akihabara News and Impress]
