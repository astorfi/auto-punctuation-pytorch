According to AllThingsD, the blue birdie has snapped up a three-man outfit called Vine, a video-sharing startup intended specifically for bite-sized clips. You'd be forgiven for not knowing it -- the service hasn't actually launched yet -- and there's no word on whether it'll operate independently or be assimilated by the social network. There are bound to be more details revealed soon, and it might not be too long before you're sharing less in 140 characters and more in five-second clips.
