All of these fall under the Compaq moniker, and include model numbers 2510p, 6910p, 8510p, 8510w, 8710p, and 8710w. Specs-wise, this bundle pretty much runs the gamut, from the ultraportable 2500p with its 12.1-inch WXGA display and 2.8 pound carrying weight, to the desktop-replacing 8710w and 8710p, which each pack 17-inch displays, NVIDIA graphics, and Blu-ray drives as a option. All but the 2510p also pack Core 2 Duo processors ranging from the T7100 to the T7700, and boast integrated fingerprint scanners along with usual built-in WiFi and Bluetooth. As with HP's other Santa Rosa laptops, however, there's no word on pricing or availability, although that should be coming soon enough.
