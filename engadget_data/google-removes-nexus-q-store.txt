 Google had already yanked the "In Stock" status from its Nexus Q as we awaited a re-envisioning of its purpose, but today's Nexus launch is making it ever clearer that we may never hear from the bizarre orb again. Launched in July with an almost unbelievably small set of features, it took but a few weeks for Google to postpone the proper launch while sending free units to those who pre-ordered. Now, its placement on the Nexus landing page has been removed entirely, with the Nexus 4, Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 roaming the page alone. The Q's placement in the Play Store remains, but an ominous "This device is not for sale at this time" message accompanies it. Google had not returned a request for comment at the time of this article's publication, but we'll update should we hear back.

 Update: Google returned a comment, but it's certainly not much to go on: "We don't have anything to share at this time."
