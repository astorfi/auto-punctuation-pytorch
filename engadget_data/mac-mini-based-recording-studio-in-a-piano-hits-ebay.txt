At the core is the aforementioned Mac mini (a 1.42GHz model) complimented by a 17-inch LCD, a Lexicon Omega audio interface, built-in Klipsch Promedia Ultra 2.0 speakers, and an MXL 2006 Cardioid Microphone, plus a number of other peripherals. Alas, it seems the original piano keys didn't quite cut it -- they've been replaced with a Studiologic TMK-88 MIDI keyboard, but maybe that'll be remedied in the next version; the person behind this bit of retro goodness is selling the whole shebang on eBay to help fund a new-and-improved rig. Things don't look to have gotten off to the best of starts, however, with the starting bid still untouched at a hefty $4,000.
