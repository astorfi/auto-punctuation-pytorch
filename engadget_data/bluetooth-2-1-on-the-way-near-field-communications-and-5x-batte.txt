Most definitely, the coolest new feature is delivered via an optional part of the spec dubbed "near-field communications." Using a prototype Nokia cellphone and Parrot picture frame, Foley was able to snap a photo on the handset and then pair and transfer it to the frame by simply holding the phone a few inches away from the display. Other notable enhancements are 5x reduction in battery drain (hoozah!) for Bluetooth mice and keyboards as well as enhanced security. The spec is "just being finalized now" with first product expected to hit around the 2007 holiday season. Fingers crossed eh, as these things tend to drag out a bit longer than expected. In the mean time, check the full video demonstration after the break.
