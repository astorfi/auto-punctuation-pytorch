 Word on the street is that Windows Phone 8 will get its official launch on October 29th. When asked for confirmation, Microsoft issued a pretty standard "no comment," which is at least a small step better than an outright denial. With Windows 8 slated to land on October 26th, we wouldn't be surprised to see its portable counterpart hit the market just a few days later, as ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley is suggesting. October is already expected to be a rather hectic month for Microsoft, with launch of countless Windows 8 tablets scheduled. Putting WP8 out alongside its first batch of handsets (hello ATIV S!) would only make sense, really. We can think of a reason or two that Microsoft might want to utterly dominate a few news cycles.
