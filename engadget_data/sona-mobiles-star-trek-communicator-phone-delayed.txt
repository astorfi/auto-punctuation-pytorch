We regret to inform our Klingon speaking, phaser toting, beam-me-upping audience that
Sona Mobile's Star Trek Communicator phone has been
delayed â€” though it's apparently not due to any lack of demand. No, production difficulties are delaying the device
until 2006, so unless you can be up-taken by the Nexus or hit some other form of temporal disturbance, you're still
going to have to wait until the future to get your Communicator.
