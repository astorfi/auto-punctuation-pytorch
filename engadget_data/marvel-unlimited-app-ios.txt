 Fans who follow the goings on in the Marvel universe just got a better way to do so... assuming they own an iOS device. With the debut of the Marvel Unlimited app, iPhone and iPad owners can now access Marvel's full 13,000 issue back catalog for a mere $60 per annum, or $10 a month. Subscribers can also keep up to six titles directly on their device for offline reading. This isn't the first time the publisher has courted digital denizens, as Marvel's subscription-based comics service has long been available on the web and it's been making digital copies of titles available for years. However, this is the first native app for iOS granting offline access to Marvel's full collection, and that, friends, is a reason to celebrate.
