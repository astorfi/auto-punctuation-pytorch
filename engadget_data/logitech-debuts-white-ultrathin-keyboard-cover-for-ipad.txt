Like the black model, the accessory operates via Bluetooth and features a battery that's said to provide up to six months worth of go time -- a statistic that's based on two hours of usage per day. You can expect to coat your very own white keyboard with a layer of grime in short order: it's currently available for pre-order on Logitech's website for $100 and is said to hit Apple retail stores later this month. For the curious, you'll find a teaser video after the break.
