The goal here was to "install a computer in thekitchen, hidden, and with few to no visible cables." A standard UK double-socket faceplate was hacked with themini's power button, status lights, and ports all fed via extension magic from the mini mounted under the kitchen unit.Most useful tool: blunt table knife, a.k.a. lever or impromptu screwdriver. Ahhh modders we justs loves 'em. [Via eHomeUpgrade]
