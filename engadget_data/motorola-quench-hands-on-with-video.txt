We had a quick tour today of Motorola's new Quench -- or CLIQ XT as it'll be called on T-Mobile USA when it launches next month -- and for an eighth outing in the Android world, it's pretty slick. Sure it lacks keyboard, but the touchscreen is pretty responsive and now includes Swype input on the virtual keyboard -- and we've found with a bit of practice and patience, Swype can be really fast. The soft touch plastic rear of the set can be removed to slip on over covers and shows off the 5 megapixel camera with auto focus and dual LED flash. Follow on for a quick video tour of the Blur-powered beast and some pics.
