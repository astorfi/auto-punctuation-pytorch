The trickle of Google Glass details (they're shipping, the API is available and an Android companion app is live) has suddenly turned into a flood tonight, as 9to5Google points out a support page listing the device's technical specs. While we knew some bits about its capabilities (some of which were explained in a patent application), the official list reveals its display will be equivalent to a 25-inch HD screen viewed from eight feet away, while its camera does 5MP stills and 720p video. It packs 16GB of storage onboard, 12GB of which are available to the wearer. Audio is transferred via a bone conduction transducer, while its wireless capabilities include Bluetooth and WiFi 802.11 b/g. There's a micro-USB charger included with it and the battery is expected to last a "full day of typical use" although video and Google Hangouts will drain it more quickly. Also published is an FAQ for things like "Is it ok to go scuba diving with Glass?" (A: No, jackhammering is also probably out, while laws concerning mobile devices and driving may rule out use behind the wheel as well), covering things any Explorers should know before their headset arrives.
