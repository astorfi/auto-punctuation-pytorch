 Last time we heard from BioCert, it was regarding that there Guardian biometric fingerprint door lock. Now it looks like they're back in the game with the ClipBio Pro 1GB biometric flash drive. Yeah, it's more of the same when it comes to integrated-biometric personal data storage, but their fingerprint reading piece will only set you back $130, which ain't too bad for a gig of room (sans whatever space is required for that bundled iQBioDrive security software).[Via Mobility Site]
