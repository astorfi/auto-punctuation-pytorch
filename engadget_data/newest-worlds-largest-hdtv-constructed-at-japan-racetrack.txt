  We knew this was coming but now we've finally got a picture of the high definition 8,066 sq ft  monster installed at Tokyo Racecourse. Now this Mitsubishi Diamond Vision display has far more square footage than the HD LED displays installed by Daktronics at Miami and Texas, or their own last screen at Turner Field in Atlanta, but we're not sure if it really deserves the largest title. Its measurements come in at 218 feet wide by only 37 feet high compared to Dolphin Stadium (137x50 ft) and University of Texas (134x55 ft). Thanks to Mitsubishi's technology they can display up to three races at once on the single screen, but until they start making movies in 5.89 aspect ratio it will be hard to really put this masterpiece to work. Still, if you've got $28 million or so lying around this wouldn't be the worst way to spend it, two NFL games plus 720p Madden should make a happy fall for anyone.[Via Pink Tentacle]
