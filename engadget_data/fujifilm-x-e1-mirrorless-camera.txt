 Didn't jump at the chance to own a Fujifilm X-Pro1? Considering the camera's relatively massive footprint and $1,700 body-only price tag, we can hardly blame you. Fortunately, things are looking up for the company's high-end X-series of mirrorless cameras --- a new model just stepped into town. The X-E1 features the same 16.3-megapixel APS-C X-Trans CMOS sensor as the much pricier X-Pro1, but in a body that's 30 percent smaller. Better yet, this latest flavor, which will ship in two-tone black and silver or solid black "classic designs," will carry a body-only retail price of $1,000. A cool grand will buy you an interchangeable lens camera with a sensor that, according to Fujifilm, is "capable of delivering resolution that is superior to other APS-C sensors, and equal to even some full frame sensors found in popular DSLR cameras." (Sayonara, Canon EOS-1D X.)

 Like its larger sibling, the X-E1 ditches the low-pass filter typically found in DSLRs in favor of a color filter array, which serves to minimize moire while yielding more accurate colors. A 2.36-million-dot OLED EVF is included for eye-level framing, or you can use the 2.8-inch 460k-dot LCD. The camera boasts a sensitivity range of ISO 100-25,600, packs a pop-up flash, it can capture 1080/24p video and includes a microphone input so you can add external audio sources. The camera is compatible with M lenses using an optional M Mount Adapter, or you can take advantage of Fujifilm's current selection of three X-mount primes. There will also be two new lenses launching alongside the X-E1 in November, including an XF 18-55mm f/2.8-4 and a 14mm f/2.8 prime, priced at $900 and $700, respectively -- you can save $500 by snagging that first lens in a kit with the camera for $1,400. Head past the break for the full PR.

   X-E1 Features 16 Megapixel APS-C X-Trans CMOS sensorTM, FUJIFILM Original X-Mount and a 2.36 Million Dot Organic LED (OLED) Viewfinder to Deliver Astonishing Image Quality and Operability

   Valhalla, N.Y., September 6, 2012 – FUJIFILM North America Corporation is proud to introduce its second compact system camera of this year - the FUJIFILM X-E1 - a premium interchangeable lens camera system that truly exemplifies the high quality and extraordinary image resolution that the X-Series is known for among professional photographers.

   The FUJIFILM X-E1 follows in the tradition of the award-winning FUJIFILM X-Pro1 and utilizes the same proprietary 16.3 Megapixel APS-C X-Trans CMOS sensorTM and the same X-Mount for use with FUJINON XF lenses, all in a body that is 30% smaller than the FUJIFILM X-Pro1.

   With its compact, travel-friendly size, the X-E1 promises to be an exciting addition to the FUJIFILM X-Series. It will be available in two classic designs: a two-tone black and silver, and a solid black. Both versions of the X-E1 will also ship as kits with the XF18mm-55mm (27-84mm) F2.8-4 lens in November 2012.   "It's an exciting day for Fujifilm as we launch our second premium interchangeable lens digital camera this year, the FUJIFILM X-E1, and two extraordinary new XF lenses" said Go Miyazaki, president and chief operating officer, FUJIFILM North America Corporation. "The X-Series has thrilled photographers around the world with its exceptional image quality and stunning design, and the new X-E1 promises to continue that tradition with a slightly smaller body and all of the attention to detail that is the hallmark of FUJIFILM X-Series digital cameras."

   Exceptional color rendition and image resolution  Fujifilm's advanced X-Trans CMOS sensor is capable of delivering resolution that is superior to other APS-C sensors, and equal to even some full frame sensors found in popular DSLR cameras.

   The FUJIFILM X-E1's unique color filter array can effectively minimize moiré and false color without the need for an optical low pass filter. This makes it possible for the camera to maximize its extremely high resolution, and to capture each photograph with accuracy and clarity across the whole image.

   FUJIFILM original "X-Mount" maximizes lens performance  Specifically designed to take advantage of the camera's mirrorless design, the X-Mount has a short flange back distance of just 17.7mm made possible by designing the mount ring as thin as 2.5mm. This means the rear lens elements are as close as possible to the sensor, reducing the back focus distance of each lens to the minimum possible, thus achieving high resolution from edge to edge. And when fitted with a FUJIFILM M Mount Adapter, the X-E1 can use a wide variety of M lenses to broaden the scope of your photography.

   2.36 million dot "Organic LED (OLED) electronic viewfinder"  The FUJIFILM X-E1 camera comes equipped with a high definition, high luminance OLED electronic viewfinder with a resolution of 2.36 million dots that is one of the highest resolutions available on an EVF-equipped digital camera today(1). The natural, bright viewfinder offers a horizontal field of view of 25-degrees, allowing users to scan the entire scene quickly and easily.

   Premium quality design and portability  Made in Japan, the X-E1 exudes precision, elegance and premium quality that can be seen from each of its components. The top and front covers are made from die-cast magnesium for a solid, yet functional design. At roughly the same size as the FUJIFILM X100, the X-E1 is refreshingly compact and lightweight (12.35oz(2)). Featuring a rubber grip for additional stability, and with the X-Mount positioned centrally on the camera, the X-E1 is perfectly-balanced.

   Expanding the FUJINON XF lens lineup: New XF14mm (21mm) F2.8 single focal length lens and XF18mm-55mm (27-84mm) F2.8-4 lens  The FUJIFILM X-E1 pairs perfectly with the XF18mm-55mm (27-84mm) F2.8-4 lens to deliver super-fast focusing speeds that will capture even the fastest action. The highly responsive linear motor in the XF18-55mm lens combines with the high-speed signal readout of the X-Trans CMOS sensor and the EXR Processor Pro, to achieve a huge leap in AF speed and precision performance. Contrast Detection in the X-E1 brings your subject into sharp focus in as little as 0.1 seconds.

   A true masterpiece of optical technology, the high quality all-glass lens structure consists of 14 elements in 10 groups, including 3 aspherical lenses and 1 extra low dispersion element, as well as a seven-blade rounded diaphragm. This zoom lens covers a broad range of frequently-used focal lengths from 18mm in wide angle to 55mm mid telephoto(3) to capture everything from landscapes to street photography.

   At F2.8-4 wide open, this fast lens is perfect for low-light photography or scenes beckoning a beautiful bokeh effect. Advanced optical and mechanical designs are optimized to keep the lens compact, while maintaining a physical aperture ring so that users can make fluid adjustments. The lens also features OIS to provide image stabilization equivalent to 4 stops, controlling the effect of camera shake and allowing users to seize perfect photo opportunities.

   The new FUJINON XF14mm (21mm) F2.8 single focal length lens offers a stunning, ultra wide angle that delivers exceptional resolution from edge to edge. The new lens consists of 10 elements in 7 groups, including 2 aspheric and 3 extra low dispersion elements, and a seven-blade rounded diaphragm.

   With its distance and depth of field scales on the barrel, the FUJINON XF14mm (21mm) F2.8 lens is ideally suited for a range of shooting techniques. And with its bright, F2.8 aperture, the lens performs beautifully in low-light shooting.

   Diverse shooting modes  The X-E1 offers Fujifilm's creative "Film Simulation Modes" to simulate the distinctive color palates of conventional photo film. Film Simulation Modes include "Velvia," "ASTIA," and "PROVIA," as well as two additional settings based on professional color negative films, PRO Neg.Std and PRO Neg.Hi.

   In addition, advanced digital processing in the X-E1 enables multiple exposures, giving photographers the ability to take two shots while visually checking the finished image, either in the viewfinder or LCD screen.

   Full HD Movie recording  The X-E1 supports shooting Full HD movies (1920x1080) at 24fps. In addition, you can now use Monochrome or Film Simulation modes when video recording and even take advantage of the X-E1's large sensor and bright XF lenses to capture movies with beautiful bokeh effect. Connect a stereo microphone (3rd party sold separately) to the external microphone input and record audio with enhanced clarity.
