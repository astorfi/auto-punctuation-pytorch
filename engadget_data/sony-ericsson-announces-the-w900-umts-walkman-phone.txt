Sony Ericsson just announced the W900 â€” their first 3G (UMTS) tri-band Walkman phone we've been dropping ya
deets
about since September. It features a 2.2-inch QVGA 262k
TFT display, FM radio, 2
megapixel auto-focus camera with flash, records and plays video at 30fps, and
supports MP3, AAC or
AAC+, MIDI, WAV and XMF audio playback. As expected from a music-first Walkman device, it features dedicated music controls right up front
with keypad accessible via a "swivel" of the base, a 3.5mm jack, and a decent 470MB of available internal memory which is expandable via a
Memory Stick Pro Duo slot. Music is loaded via drag-and-drop, Disc2Phone PC software, or using an "over-the-air" provider
of choice. The press release says the W900 is "supplied with" the HPM-80 remote control but it's not clear if this will
be included in the cost of the phone. We also wonder if the included Bluetooth also supports A2DP for stereo rawkin'
over Bluetooth headphones. We'll know soon enough as the W900 will being shipping in Europe, Middle East, APAC, Africa (W900i), and China (W900c) in time for Christmas.
Sorry, not for the US, yet. More pics after the break.
