As you can see for yourself in the promo video after the break, not only has LG carried on the oft-imitated manila envelope motif, but it tops things off with a just slightly off "la la la" refrain for good measure. All of which might have earned LG a few points for boldness if this were a parody ad released a few years ago but, sadly, this is 2010, and this ad is all too real.
