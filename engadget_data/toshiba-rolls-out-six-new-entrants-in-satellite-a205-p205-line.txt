Up first is the trio of models in the P205 lineup, which represents "the company's latest 17-inch (1,440 x 900-pixel resolution) laptop line with a starting price of less than $1,000." The S637, S6267, and S6287 models all sport sub-2GHz Intel processors, up to 2GB of RAM, dual-layer SuperMulti drives, Vista Home Premium, 120GB to 200GB of hard drive space, WiFi, and Harmon Kardon speakers as well. The 15.4-inch A205 series includes the S4577, S4617, and S4639, and these models sport a 1,280 x 800 resolution, optional webcam, 802.11n, sub-1.7GHz Intel Core 2 Duo chips, up to 2GB of RAM, dual-layer DVD burner, integrated speakers, biometric scanner, NVIDIA's GeForce Go 7300 graphics, and Windows Vista runnin' the show.
