Spotted out in the wild with an accompanying spec list, the Honor (or U8860) purportedly packs a 1.4GHz processor, 4-inch FWVGA LCD display, 5 megapixel rear-facing camera capable of 720p video, a thickness of 9.9mm and an unspecified version of Android 2.3. Judging by the phones Europe- and Asia-only UMTS 900MHz / 2100MHz bands, it's highly likely we won't have the honor of seeing the company's rumored flagship device grace North American shores. We'll keep an eye out and let you know if we catch this one slipping through the FCC's arms.
