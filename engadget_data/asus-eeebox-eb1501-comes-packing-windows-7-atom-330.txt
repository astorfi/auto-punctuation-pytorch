As before, this one packs the increasingly common one-two punch of NVIDIA's Ion chipset and Intel's Atom 333 dual-core processor, but makes its mark by being the first EeeBox (and one of the first nettops) to come pre-loaded with Windows 7, which also means it's not shipping until the end of the month. Otherwise, you'll get the usual 2GB of RAM (expandable to 4GB) and 250GB hard drive, a built-in DVD burner, and an HDMI port to make it feel right at home in your home theater. No official pricing over here just yet, but it looks like this one will start at â‚¬399 (or about $580) when it hits Europe.
