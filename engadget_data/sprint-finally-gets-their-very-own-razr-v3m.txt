It's probably the least exciting member of their upcoming MOTO phone lineup, but the MOTORAZR is also probably one of the cheapest, at a mere $50 after $150 instant savings and a $90 mail-in rebate. Why an EV-DO phone with fancy features like Blutetooth and a 1.3 megapixel camera should have a $290 regular price is beyond us, but we're sure glad Sprint decided to sweeten the deal with arbitrary rebates and the like.
