The i1 is definitely an interesting device, though whether its rugged mil-spec feature set -- we were playing shuffleboard with them last night, seriously -- will appeal to its intended market is still kinda up in the air. Don't get us wrong, it's not like the set is missing a pile of features, but it's essentially a giant glass display and we worry it'd eventually suffer a shattering end. Check out the video tour below and chime in, if you use iDEN let us know what you're feeling about this.
