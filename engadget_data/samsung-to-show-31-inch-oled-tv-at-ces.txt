 It's not like we haven't been let down at CES before, so we're doing our best to contain our excitement on this one. Reportedly, Samsung is gearing up to showcase a 31-inch OLED TV at CES next month, which would trump Sony's 11-incher and even Toshiba's now-delayed 30-incher by some margin. A company spokesperson even stated that it was "considering exhibiting a 40-inch OLED TV," but decided against it presumably due to the exorbitantly high price tag that would've been shown along with it. In case a single 31-inch version isn't enough to meet your sky high expectations, the outfit is also hoping to have a 14-inch iteration set up for viewing, but as always, we'll believe it when we see it.[Via Telecoms Korea]
