We received some further information on the latter of those two this morning, most notable being the inclusion of haptic feedback that should make its 4.8-inch, 800 x 480 1024 x 600 screen feel a little more tactile. We also got confirmation that the device will be running Windows XP hidden behind a custom UI overlay that, we presume, will be similar to the one we saw running at CES on the S7. Still no price, but the company is aiming for a March release domestically. Our fingers are tingling with anticipation.
