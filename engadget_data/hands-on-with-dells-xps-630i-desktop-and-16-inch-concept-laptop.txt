Unfortunately the notebook was locked behind a glass case, precluding any real face time with the prototype widescreen system, but luckily we were able to get right up in the grille of the 630i to check out all the angles. Of course, you'd rather peep some pictures then hear us drone on about our impressions, so check out the gallery below for the full package.
