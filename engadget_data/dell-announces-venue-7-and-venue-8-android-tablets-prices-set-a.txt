When Dell said it was going to revive the Venue brand, we assumed it was referring to Windows tablets. And indeed it was -- it just announced the Venue 8 Pro and Venue 11 Pro running Windows 8.1. But what we didn't know was that Dell was also planning on getting back into the Android market, and that these devices, too, would fall under the Venue brand. Here at a press event in New York City, the company announced the Venue 7 and Venue 8, both of which run Android 4.2.2 (upgradeable to KitKat) and will be offered in both WiFi-only and 4G configurations.


As you'd expect, they're exactly what they sound like: the Venue 7 (pictured) has a 7-inch screen, and the Venue 8 is -- yep -- an 8-incher. Neither is particularly high-end: each has a 1,280 x 800 IPS screen and a 2GHz dual-core Intel Z2580 processor. The Venue 7 only has 16GB of internal storage, we're told, though the Venue 8 will be offered with either 16 or 32 gigs. Either way, you have a microSD slot at your disposal if you need more space. Pricing is set at $150 for the Venue 7, while the Venue 8 will cost $180. Both will be available October 18th.
