 
Sure, Intel's big push for its IDF 2010 keynote this morning was the new Sandy Bridge architecture, but within the confines of one awkwardly-presented tech demonstration, we got a glimpse at "Project X." Which, as it turns out, is a pretty interesting Atom-powered development tablet with WiDi technology. From a video conference window projected against the wall, our man Shashi was pushing his slate's screen wireless to the HD set in the background as he showed off some Starcraft II recap footage. We're still on the lookout for the device somewhere on the show floor; if and when we find it, you'll be first to know. One more shot after the break.
