The smartphone will be priced around $199 when it ships next month in India and China. It will eventually make its way to other Asia-Pacific countries and South America, but there's no news yet on any stateside availability. We did expect this Microsoft-powered device to turn up with version 7.8 of its mobile OS, but instead, there's Windows Phone 7.5 and the promise to an eventual upgrade. We've got more impressions after the break. 




 In keeping with the trend of Nokia's other Lumia hardware, the 510 will arrive in five colors -- red, yellow, cyan, white and black. We got our hands on the black version and the plastic body certainly felt well built with nary a squeak. The screen may be a fingerprint magnet but the rear has a nice matt finish. A tad lighter and thinner than the Lumia 610, the new device has a slightly larger footprint, due to the bigger 4-inch display which dominates the device. Beneath that 480 x 800 touchscreen, you'll find the three Windows Phone backlit capacitive keys, while the bottom edge houses the micro-USB port. The headphone socket is on the top edge, while the sleep / wake button and volume controls are all found along the right side

 The 800MHz processor may sound disappointing, but we didn't face any significant slowdown during our brief time with the device. Apart from some minor lag in launching apps, menu transitions and navigation felt smooth. On the software front, Nokia has armed it with several signature items, including Nokia Music, Drive, and Maps, but alongside this older Windows Phone build, we're a bit disappointed by the lack of a front camera and the miserly 2.2GB of non-expandable storage. At this cost however, Nokia's free voice-based navigation alone could make it worth the spend.
