 We most certainly dig where this uber-green three-wheeled vehicle category is going, as just one week after seeing the Silence PT2, we've now learned that Venture Vehicles will be tossing the two-wheeled axle in the rear and calling its rendition the VentureOne. Based around Carver Engineering's tilting technology, this trike is officially classified as a motorcycle, but sports a fully enclosed body, roll-cage construction, airbags and bumpers similar to a standard car. The vehicle will hold three folks, and the company has plans for two plug-in hybrid variations that utilize a flex-fuel approach to barely sip gasoline from the four gallon tank, all while touting 100 miles per gallon and the ability to hit speeds upwards of 100 miles per hour; eventually, Venture is also hoping to release an all-electric breed that can scoot 200 miles before needing a recharge. Although production isn't slated to begin until "late 2008," that should give you enough time to save up a good chunk of the $18,000 (E50 hybrid) to $23,000 (all-electric model) that'll be required to snap one up -- and to acquire a motorcycle license, too.[Via Gizmag]
