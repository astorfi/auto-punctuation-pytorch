This week, however, Apple's kicking those digital white blood cells into high gear, updating that quarantine list daily with a new background process. The company's primarily got its crosshairs on the recent MacDefender scare, of course, but on the off-chance malware starts coming out of the woodwork, it sounds like you won't have to wait for a formal security update to be forewarned of the dangers. If privacy's your primary concern, however, you can also opt-out -- take a gander at our source links to see how it's done.
