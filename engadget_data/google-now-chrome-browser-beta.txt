 Google Now seems another step closer to arriving to the Chrome browser on Windows and Chrome platforms, thanks to yet another code spot by Chromium savant Fran√ßois Beaufort. He previously noticed hints that such a feature might arrive, and this time he espied it in a full-fledged Chrome beta release -- sadly, sans the server address necessary to run it. Despite that omission, it looks ready to eerily track your life anew on non-Android devices, so if you're in the mood to look at (but not touch) the new add-in, grab it at the more coverage link after the break.
