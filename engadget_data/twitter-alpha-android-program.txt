Now the social site is taking public testing a bit further with a new Alpha experiment program. According to TechCrunch, the Android team announced the move in a Google Groups post accessible only to current testers, opening up the program exclusively to existing members for the time being. Space is limited, unfortunately, so if you haven't tested unreleased features for Twitter in the past, you might be out of luck. If you've received an invite from the team, however, don't dally on clicking that link -- Alpha testers will be accepted on a first come, first served basis, and if you're eager to try out half-baked app features long before the general public, this is definitely your best shot.
