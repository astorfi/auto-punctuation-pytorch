But we're even more bummed to learn that Mario has traded his trademark peace sign for a more traditional American greeting: a gang sign. Luckily, YouTuber GovernorWatts was there with a video camera to catch the action, comprised of Nintendo toys from all the way back in 1889 through the 1970s and beyond.
