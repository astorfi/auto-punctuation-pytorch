The device is the latest entry in Samsung's popular Android-based Galaxy Tab line, and the thing is pretty darn slick. The 7.7-inch screen is in keeping with the company's push toward devices that straddle the line between the tablet and smartphone spaces (see also: the Note), and it is indeed a terrific form factor. This isn't going to replace your laptop or iPad (or Galaxy Tab 10.1) for lengthy multimedia marathons, but it's a great size for watching quick videos and basic computer like checking your email. It's also exceedingly portable at 0.74 pounds.

Like so many other devices launched by Samsung this year, the screen is the thing, and indeed, that 7.7-inch 1280 x 800 Super AMOLED Plus display is quite sharp and extremely bright -- in fact, we had to turn the thing down while doing the below hands-on video. Also new with the device is the addition of Android 3.2 -- we didn't notice all that much different on that front, however, seeing as how the tablet is still skinned with the familiar TouchWiz UX UI. There weren't really any noticeable changes from the newly updated version for the 10.1.

Check out our hands-on video after the break.
