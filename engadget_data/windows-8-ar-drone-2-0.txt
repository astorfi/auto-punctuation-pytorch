Drones. If they're going to become the true public nuisance that we're lead to believe they will, then we're gonna need more ways to get 'em airborne, right? If you're UAV of choice is Parrot's AR.Drone 2.0, and you're also a Windows 8 user, then you need to be all over AR.FreeFlight -- an official app for the aforementioned drone. Dig out your Surface tablet, and you can pilot your quadcopter, and record video/take pictures just as owners of Android and iOS devices have been enjoying already. Think a phone makes more sense for this? Don't worry, Parrot's reportedly got an app for the smaller devices in the works too (and developers can sneak a look here).
