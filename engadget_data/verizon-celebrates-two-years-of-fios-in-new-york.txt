As of today, FiOS TV has been available in at least some portions of New York for two whole years, and including the new areas that VZW reached out to last month, over 145 communities can now tap into its fiber-based TV service. Now, watch as the vast majority of the nation forces a grin and congratulates you on having something that we don't.
