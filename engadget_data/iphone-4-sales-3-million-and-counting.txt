For the record, that's about twice the number Apple sold in the first weekend -- 1.7 million -- so the pace has clearly slowed down a bit, though that would appear to be due almost exclusively to supply constraints.

As for how many of those sold phones are staying out in the field, Jobs has revealed return rates, too: 1.7 percent, which works out to about 51,000 phones, compared to 6 percent for the 3GS. Seems like most of these returners would've been better off eBaying for a profit, eh?
