Utilizing their D-ILA implementation of LCoS like we've seen in their highly-praised big panels, this baby pumps a theater-like 27-decibels and features an okay 2,500:1 contrast ratio, 2048 x 1536 resolution, and one measly DVI-D HDCP port -- sorry, no HDMI here folks. And that rather lackluster 600 lumen rating makes the DLA-HD10KS suitable only for the darkest of home theater setups. Dropping July 1st for ¥1,440,000 (or about $12,500) with replacement 200W lamps set to pull an additional ¥26,250 (or about $228) per pop. For that price, you might want to hang with 1080p DLP just a bit longer, eh?[Via Impress]
