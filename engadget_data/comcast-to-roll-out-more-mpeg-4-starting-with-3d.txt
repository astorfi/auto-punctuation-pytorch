The local Comcast office picks which to send out your way for now (which caused lots of issues on launch day since most didn't realize their MPEG-2 only box wasn't compatible) but that changes in August when all 3D signals will be sent via MPEG-4 and those with older boxes will just have to upgrade to enjoy their new 3DTV -- so much for the benefits of frame compatible 3D. MPEG-4 is a win win for consumers and the cable provider, as it takes less bandwidth on the providers network and uses less space on those pitiful 160GB cable DVRs.
