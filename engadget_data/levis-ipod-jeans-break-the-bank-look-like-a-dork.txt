At least the RedWire moniker is explained by a snazzy red ribbon that tethers your iPod to its assigned sidepocket, but the dork factor is quite evident in the retractable headphone doo-hickey and the overly obvious control pad. Or is that the whole point? We never claimed to be fashionable ourselves, only to be practiced in lambastating the fashion of others.
