Starting June 9, Microsoft will offer Kinect-less Xbox One hardware bundles at $399 in North America and Â£349 in the UK. Microsoft cites customer feedback as the driving force behind the Xbox One's new hardware options.

The Kinect was bundled with every Xbox One sold since the console's launch last year. A standalone Xbox One Kinect sensor will be released at retail this fall.
