That tiny USB Type-C port you've seen on the latest MacBook and Chromebook Pixel? Don't be surprised if you see it on your smartphone soon. In a video accompanying the new Chromebook, Google's Adam Rodriguez says that his company is "very committed" to the new USB spec and that you'll see it on both Android phones and more Chromebooks in the "near future." It's a vague promise, to be sure, but it'll matter a lot in the long run. Type-C delivers brisk USB 3-level speeds (and eventually, 3.1) without requiring a gigantic connector, and the reversible design means you won't have to inspect your phone to make sure you plug the cable in the right way.
