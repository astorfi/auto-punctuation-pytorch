As such, Siren -- the number 4 DAP maker in Japan -- looks to become the low-to-mid tier device maker in iriver's lustalicious DAP/PMP portfolio while introducing iriver to the digital photo frame business. Interestingly enough, Siren was started by two former bleeding edge Rio Audio employees, one of which was a former Creative employee. Now, they find themselves working for iriver, a division of S.Korea's ReignCom, a company started by a bunch of Samsung executives. Welcome to the incestuous family we call consumer electronics.
