 It certainly hasn't been the easiest phone to get a hold for for those interested, but those in Canada now at least know when they'll have another chance to grab a Nexus 4. Google's today sent out emails informing prospective customers that the phone will again be available in the Canadian Play store starting at 3PM Eastern (noon Pacific time), although it's of course making no guarantees about quantities. It also hasn't specified if both the 8GB and 16GB models will be available, but there's now less than an hour 'til we find out.

 [Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
