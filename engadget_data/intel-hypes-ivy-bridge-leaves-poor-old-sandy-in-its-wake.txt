AnandTech is reporting a claimed 60 percent boost in 3DMark Vantage scores from the next-gen integrated graphics compared to Sandy Bridge, which could well put an end to Intel's frame-rate humiliation at the hands of AMD's A-series APUs. The bragging also extended to Quick Sync, which is "privately" said to deliver video encoding at twice the current speed. However, these claims only relate to the top tier of the Ivy Bridge range and they skirt around the key battlegrounds of raw CPU power and pricing -- which is precisely where we suspect AMD's FX series will bring the ruckus.
