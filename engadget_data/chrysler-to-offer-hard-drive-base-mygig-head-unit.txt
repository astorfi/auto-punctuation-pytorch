Slated to hit Sebring models first -- with the Jeep Wrangler and Dodge Nitro to follow suit -- the MyGIG head unit rocks a 6.5-inch touchscreen display, voice-activated controls, 20GB hard drive, "3D-like" navigational maps, real-time traffic updates, and a USB 2.0 port supporting JPEG / MP3 transfers, while also controlling the (optional) U-Connect Bluetooth handsfree system. Opting to support all DAPs (rather than taking the iPod-only approach that many automakers have), it sports an aux input just in case ripping CDs directly on the HDD doesn't interest you. Another impressive feature is the unit's reported ability to play back DVDs via the built-in optical drive (while in park, obviously), or you can hookup the forthcoming Wii or PlayStation 3 to the dual video inputs fpr keeping you and your co-riders entertained should you hit a traffic jam (or LA stoplight). If you aren't much on custom installations, or just needed a good excuse to get in a new set of wheels, the MyGIG head unit will be a $1,700 option when it drops this fall.[Via Gizmag]
