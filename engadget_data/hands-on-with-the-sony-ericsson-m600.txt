 SonyEricsson had a press event here in New York this morning where we were lucky enough to get our hands on the M600, theirnew flagship GSM/UMTS smartphone which sports a 2.6-inch, QVGA (320 x 240 pixel) display, 80MB of internal memory,Bluetooth, a Memory Stick Micro card slot, and one of those QWERTY keypads where they've put two letters on each key.We only got to play with it for a few fleeting moments, so we didn't get to test out the keyboard or anything, but theM600 definitely felt very nice and solid.
