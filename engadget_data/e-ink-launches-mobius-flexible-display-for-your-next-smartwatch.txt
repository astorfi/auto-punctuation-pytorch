Although smartwatch makers have had access to e-paper for a while, there have been few such displays tailor-made for our wrists. E Ink is more than willing to fill that void with a new, watch-oriented version of its Mobius screen. The flexible, 1.73-inch panel won't floor anyone with its 320 x 240 grayscale picture, but it can be cut into timepiece-friendly shapes that take more abuse than a typical e-reader. More importantly for us end users, E Ink already has at least one hardware partner lined up: Sonostar is using the tiny Mobius for a smartwatch this summer, and the odds are that the company won't be alone.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--E InkÂ® Holdings, "E Ink" (8069.TW), a digital signage and display visionary, announces the addition of a 1.73" flexible display to its Mobius product line of flexible electronic paper display (EPD) technology.
