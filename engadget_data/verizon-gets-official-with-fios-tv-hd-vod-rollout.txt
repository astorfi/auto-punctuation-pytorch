As for subscribers in New York and Oregon, you'll be joining the party "in the coming weeks." Finally, the carrier noted that it plans on offering up over 1,000 high-definition video-on-demand titles before the year's close -- now, if only it could locate a steady supply of AQUOS LCDs for new signups, we'd really be in business.
