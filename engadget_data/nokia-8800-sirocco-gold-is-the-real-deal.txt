The 8800 Sirocco Gold is, as one might expect, merely a gold-hued version of its 8800 Sirocco, combining almost-Vertu style and craftsmanship, almost-Vertu pricing, and a shiny yellow case for those times when neither silver nor black sufficiently express its owner's "my phone's more expensive than yours" attitude. Look for it to hit "select markets" (which we think excludes the US on account of the lack of GSM 850) bundled with a matching headset and desk stand for â‚¬1000 (about $1,355).
