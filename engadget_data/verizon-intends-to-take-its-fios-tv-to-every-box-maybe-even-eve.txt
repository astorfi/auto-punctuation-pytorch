And unlike other providers, Verizon isn't taking the media server approach because it doesn't scale. The demo at the at CES's bloggers lounge included all four screens with a Samsung Blu-ray player's app delivering both traditional live TV, DVR'd content and video-on-demand -- in this case the DVR content was being streamed from a FiOS DVR, but the device could have internal storage. Because this content is to be delivered via IP instead of QAM, there's the chance that this programming could be delivered everywhere and to any screen (rights issues aside of course). That's the good news, the (potentially) bad news is that all this great content will only be delivered via Verizon's software, so if you're a TiVo or Media Center guy, no programming for you. We still stick by the idea that true inovation will only come when cable customers can chose both their hardware and their software, but we you can bet we'll bite our tongue and enjoy some HD when we are not standing on our soap box.
