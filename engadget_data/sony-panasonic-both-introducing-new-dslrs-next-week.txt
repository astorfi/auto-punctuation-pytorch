 The big Photokina show may be fast approaching but, as is often the case, some camera makers aren't waiting for the doors to open to debut their latest wares, and both Sony and Panasonic look to be carrying on the tradition by introducing new DSLRs next week in advance of the event. Of course, details on either of 'em are pretty light at the moment but, as Macworld notes, Sony had said previously that it was planning on adding a full-frame, 24.6 megapixel camera to is Alpha line, and that would seem to be a likely fit here. For its part, Panasonic will apparently be introducing the follow-up to its Lumix DMC-L10, although its staying tight-lipped on any details beyond that. Look for Sony to get things started at a special event in Tokyo next Wednesday, with Panasonic following-up two days later at a press conference of its own. Both, as you might have guessed, will also have plenty more to say about the cameras at Photokina.
