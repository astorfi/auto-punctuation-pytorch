Not surprisingly, they say the service pack is "mostly invisible," although that's not to say it's insignificant, with the update supposedly making Vista both "faster and more secure" (certainly no small feat) On the downside, the beta still appears to be very much a beta, with problems reportedly cropping up during the install on certain systems, although PC Mag expects those to be ironed out by the final release. Still no word as to when we might be able to expect that though.
