BitTorrent promised that its Sync Beta service would get an iOS client, and the company is making good on its word with plans to launch the app this week. As with the Android release, iOS users will get to sync files of any size, send content to other mobile devices and back up photos. And if you're not carrying an Apple device, BitTorrent still has a small treat in store: it's rolling out a localization update that supports 10 major Asian and European languages. Whatever your platform of choice, you'll find more details at the source link.


Update: And it's live. The download resides at second source link!
