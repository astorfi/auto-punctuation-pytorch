 It's been barely 10 days since we discussed 8 and 16GB SD cards, but today, Samsung announced today that it has developed the world's first 40-nanometer memory device, allowing for 32 and 64GB CompactFlash cards. According to the company's press release, the new design uses a Charge Trap Flash architecture, which "reduces inter-cell noise levels." Oh, and remember when we asked if anyone had figured out the Moore's Law for flash memory? Turns out Samsung has: "Introduction of a 40nm manufacturing process for 32Gb NAND flash marks the seventh generation of NAND flash that follows the New Memory Growth Theory of double-density growth every 12 months, which was first presented by Dr. Chang Gyu Hwang, president and CEO of Samsung Electronics' Semiconductor Business in a keynote address at ISSCC 2002." By those calculations, we should have laptops with flash memory within a year.
