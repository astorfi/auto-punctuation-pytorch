That's unlikely to mean tomorrow at this point, but if you play your cards right, you could be sliding through emails a la Swype before the weekend is out.

Update: Best Buy has confirmed that the Thrive will be available on July 10th, both in-store and online.

Update 2: Looks like it's live on Amazon, too!
