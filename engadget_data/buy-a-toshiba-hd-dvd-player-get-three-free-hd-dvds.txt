The promotion doesn't apply until November 1st, so walk, don't run to your local retailer and keep the receipt. Mail it in with the above form and in a speedy 8 to 10 weeks you will be the proud owner of at least three HD DVDs. One each from column A, B and C, customers will get one disc from each of the three major studios so far supporting HD DVD. Free is exactly the right price to us; but while three discs compares well to the one free movie that comes the Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on and PlayStation 3, having to wait two months pretty much kills the warm fuzzies. This offer does not apply to the Toshiba-built RCA HDV5000, but it does include the HD-A2W we haven't seen before; Toshiba tells us its not an entirely new model but a limited club edition like the HD-D1. List of titles is after the break.Read - The Perfect Offer: 3 free HD DVDs (Warning: PDF link)
