Acer's captured 38.3 percent of the market share, selling 2.15 million netbooks, while ASUS sold about 1.7 million, or 30.3 percent. Possibly adding insult to injury, we hear that an XP-loaded Aspire One can be yours for $299 today at Best Buy. We doubt ASUS will be taking its toys and going home any time soon, but we might've heard a few sniffles coming from its corner during recess.[Via Laptop]Read - Best BuyRead - Strong netbook shipments buoy notebook PC market in Q3 '08
