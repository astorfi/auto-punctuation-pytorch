Dell hasannounced that the luxe gaming rig is already sold out, after less than a month on themarket. Of course, the Renegade was always listed as a "Limited Edition" box, and Dell was a little coy aboutwhat that actually meant. We figure they probably made about 10, and Michael Dell picked up at least three of those forhis own collection, and gave two more to Nelson Gonzalez and Alex Aguila. The other five? Our guess is that they burstinto flames from that "factory overclocked" processor (or the paint job), and are now being refurbished forsale via Dell's outlet site for a mere $8,999.[Thanks, Michael]
