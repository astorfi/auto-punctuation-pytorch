It's been a looong time in coming — and a
lot of people didn't think they could make their Q4 2005 deadline — but Cingular went to press with the official
announcement for their HSDPA 3G network. That's right, ladies and gents, 16 —
not 18 — US markets (Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago,
Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Portland, SLC, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Tacoma, and DC) will
get BroadbandConnect service with speeds between 400-700Kbps. Yeah, we know it's a little weak for HSDPA, which has a
top capacity of up to 10Mbps, but they probably don't want to go too crazy on their brand new network right off the
bat. No word on phone devices or data plans for them, but as usual the laptop users get first dibs on service: $59.99
for unlimited data (with a two year contract, of course).
