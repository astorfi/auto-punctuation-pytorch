Since Worlds of Wonder seems in no rush to update Teddy Ruxpin for the digital age (you
can't really blame them, since they went backrupt years ago), you'll probably have to settle for this toy bear from
FIONSON that comes with a 256MB MP3 player hidden inside. Not that there's anything untoward about it,
but doesn't anyone else think that a little kid would be just the tiniest bit creeped out by the cable that's
coming right out of the top of the bear's head?
