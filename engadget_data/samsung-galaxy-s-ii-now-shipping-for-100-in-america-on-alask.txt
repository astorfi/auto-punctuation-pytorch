While we were all led to think that Sprint's Epic 4G Touch would be the first subsidized Galaxy S II to officially land in the US of A, it looks as if Alaska's GCI has beat 'em all to the punch -- and in more areas than one. A tipster residing in The Last Frontier just picked one up today, and best of all, it's running a solid Benjamin less than it will on those other operators. Oh, and it's compatible with the company's "4G" (read: HSPA+) network. Unadulterated wilderness? Yep. Northern Lights? Definitely. Early / cheap access to the year's hottest Android smartphone? Evidently. So, who's up for a little northern exposure?
