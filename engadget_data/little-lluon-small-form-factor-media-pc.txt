If you're looking for a small form factor
media PC and don't want to wait for the rumored Intel-based
Mac mini media center, you can always take a look at the Little
Lluon, from Korea's TG Trust. The 4.6-pound PC
includes 512MB of RAM, an AMD Turion ML-32, SD/Memory Stick reader, a TV Tuner and, of course, Windows XP MCE. Of
course, you shouldn't expect to find this outside of Korea, so you may have to settle for something a little bulkier â€¦
or wait to see what Apple has under the covers.
