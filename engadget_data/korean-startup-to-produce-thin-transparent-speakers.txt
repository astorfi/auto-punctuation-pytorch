We thought the NXT SoundVu — which overlays a
transparent speaker on a laptop display — was a clear winner, but now we can see through the hype and acknowledge
another developer's more flexible option. South Korean startup Plasma and Ion Beam Corp. is working to commercialize a
speaker made of thin, plastic film, which was first developed back in 2001. Developer Koh Seok-keun claims the speakers
offer fidelity on par with conventional speakers at frequencies of 300 Hz or higher, and that they can be rolled, cut
and bent for use in everything from computer displays to banners and flags. Koh expects commercial applications to
begin appearing as soon as this July or August. We can't wait to see what Christo does with this.
