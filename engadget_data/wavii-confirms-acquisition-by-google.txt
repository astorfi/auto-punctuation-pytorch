 There was an odd level of uncertainty surrounding Google's reported buyout of Wavii: where Google usually mentions acquisitions in short order, mum's been the word for much of the past week. Thankfully, we won't be left hanging over the weekend -- Wavii has stepped forward to confirm the deal is happening. Neither side has discussed the terms involved, but Wavii chief Adrian Aoun made it clear the acquisition is for the technology first and foremost. Wavii's info summarization service will be shutting down, while the company's expertise in natural language processing should find its way into future Google projects. It's sad to see another independent service absorbed by a much larger company, but we're at least likely to see the fruits of Wavii's labor through some very public channels.
