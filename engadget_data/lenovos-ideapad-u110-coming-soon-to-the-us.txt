According to JR.com, the laptop will be available in both black and red versions (model numbers U110B and U110R, respectively), with each setting you back a hefty $1,999. That'll buy you a 1.6GHz Core 2 Duo L7500 processor, a generous 3GB of RAM, a 120GB hard drive, and an 11.1-inch WXGA display. Unlike Lenovo's similarly slim X300, however, this one unsurprisingly doesn't come with a built-in optical drive of any sort, but we're guessing the 2.3-pound weight and 0.7-inch thickness will be enough for most to forgive that shortcoming.[Via Laptoping]
