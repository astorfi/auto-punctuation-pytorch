The E-D Audio FX headset features a rumbling subwoofer that the folks at E-D swear will make your gaming experience
more intense and immersive. It also promises enhanced "situational awareness" due to the sense of three-dimensional
space the headphones give you when mixing both sound and vibration. "Literally feel your enemies [sic] footsteps
approaching and intensifying," they say. Sounds like stereo with a busted woofer to us. However, the attached USB
microphone and friendly $49 price tag could make it worth a try for those whose significant others are sick and tired
of listening to World of Warcraft /trains. PC compatible, no Xbox version just yet.
