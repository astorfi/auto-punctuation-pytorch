 
 Toshiba's getting the most attention today for announcing two new laptops (including one with a bonkers 21:9 aspect ratio), but it's also getting some extra mileage out of its first Ultrabook, the Portege Z835. The company just announced it's refreshing the system with a Core i5 Ivy Bridge processor, and that it shall henceforth be known as the Portege Z935. Other than that, the chassis and other key specs are expected to remain the same. Look for it on shelves starting June 24th, and don't be surprised by a bump in price: it now starts at $900, up from $800 when it had Sandy Bridge.
