Coming from Tecnologia Aeroespacial Mexicana and Jetpack International, the jet packs will each give you about 30 seconds of flight time, with Jetpack International's model boasting a slight advantage in speed, topping out at 70 mph. Somewhat reassuringly, each also comes complete with the necessary flight training, although we wouldn't expect any less given the $250,000 and $155,000 price tags. Those who take the plunge may be suffering from some buyer's remorse before too long, however, as  Jetpack International is reportedly working on a new model that'll give you a full 19 minutes of flight time.
