According to MarketWatch, it successfully shot down objections including those of LionsGate and suggested it could both crossmarket its satellite service i the remaining stores, while offering Blockbuster's VOD and digital products to its satellite TV customers. We may have to wait until July 21 to know for sure which stores will stay open, but for now Dish says it's assumed about 400 leases and will have "near or below 1,000" stores when it's all said and done.
