There's not much to say about the DLP that we didn't cover during our 3D roundup, it's just bigger, with other changes and details still TBA -- we're waiting for 'em to cross the 100-inch mark -- while the OLED seemed suited to its potential purpose of lighting up stadiums and other similar areas, with rather impressive viewing angles although the seams in the panels were quite apparent up close.
