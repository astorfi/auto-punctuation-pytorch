 We already knew that the Android SDK was causing developers some frustration. So we're not really surprised to hear Quang Nguyen, Android Developer Advocate, say that based on feedback, "we've made significant updates to the SDK that we'll be releasing in several weeks." As a result of the UI and API enhancements, the deadline for application submissions to the $10 million Android Developer Challenge has been extended to April 14th. First round winners will now be announced on May 5th with the grand prize announcement coming on July 21st. No handset delays have been announced (yet) -- those are still expected to hit in the second half of 2008.[Via MocoNews]
