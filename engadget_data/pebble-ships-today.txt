Pebble has just informed backers that the very first orders will begin shipping today, though the iOS app is still pending approval from Apple. In the meantime, Android users will have access to a compatible app in Google Play beginning tomorrow -- just in time to start using those freshly unboxed smartwatches. iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users will be able to display notifications and control music in the meantime, though advanced features like watchface and OS updates won't be possible until the app is ready for download.


Now, a bit more bad news: the Pebble team reportedly jumped the gun on shipment notifications, so even though you may have received word that your watch is on the way, it may not be in the first batch of 500. If you've also received a tracking number, however, your device is likely to be in the mail. We're holding out hope that our Pebbles fall within that latter group -- stay tuned for a review just as soon as we've had time to put the device through its paces. In the meantime, hit up the source link for some more pics from factory.


Update: That was quick -- the iOS app is ready to go.
