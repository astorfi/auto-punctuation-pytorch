Word has it that Orange's little European exclusive on LG's touch-screen G910 watchphone with HSDPA data will result in a £1,000 / €1,144 price per. That directly translates to about $1,500 but, as these things generally go, it will likely be priced closer to $1,000 (without tax) whenever it lands Stateside. With contract, however, you'll be handing over £500 and then £40 per month for what we suspect will be the next two years. Such is the life of the early adopter.
