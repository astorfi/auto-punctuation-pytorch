Apparently, DreamWorks Animation thinks it can convince viewers to pay a premium for a three-dimensional product, as its Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg announced that all of the studio's future films -- starting with next year's Monsters vs. Aliens -- will be "made in 3D." Reportedly, adding 3D to each film will require an extra $15 million per production, but after the stunning success of Disney's Hannah Montana / Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour, it reckons the investment is a smart one. As it stands, only 1,200 or so theaters worldwide are capable of 3D exhibition, but Katzenberg is hoping that some 3,000 to 5,000 would be equipped once Monsters emerged.[Via WidescreenReview, image courtesy of WorstPreviews]
