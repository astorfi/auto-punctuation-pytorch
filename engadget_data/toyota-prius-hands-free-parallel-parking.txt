'Cause they'lljust never get enough experience parking in those spacious suburban streets to avoid being a menace over here. Justcheck out thevid if you doubt the usefulness of said tech. Now, if only Toyota would bring the technology here like they just didin Europe or in Japan oh, 3 freakin' years ago. Really Toyota, we won't sue when we back over our AIBO -- promise.
