The AA battery-sized cams, which are worn on a headset and sit just above the left ear, cost Â£1,800 ($3,410) each and record up to 12 hours of video on a waist-worn media player that resembles, for lack of a better parallel, an Archos player. We hope that these officers are trained in the ways of YouTube though -- police-sanctioned recording of hooligan debauchery immortalized on the internet surely would make for a great deterrent, no? Actually, no, scratch that, we've all seen "Cops."[Via The Raw Feed]Read - Press AssociationRead - BBCRead - eGov monitor
