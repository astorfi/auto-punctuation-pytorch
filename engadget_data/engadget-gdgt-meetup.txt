Hey New York City, it's been a while. We're hosting another meetup in the Big Apple later this month, and now we've got help from our pals at gdgt -- in fact, we've combined to form the Voltron-like Engadget+gdgt Live. We've got some big plans this time out, featuring tables from some of the biggest names in tech and lounges from Sony and Samsung Mobile. One smaller company will also get a chance to show off its wares, in the form of our Startup Contest, which will put it on the floor alongside some of tech's top brands. And if all those tables aren't enough to keep you busy, we'll have programming featuring Engadget and gdgt editors discussing the state of the industry, along with some on-stage product demos. And, as always, there'll be lots of sweet giveaways. Not too shabby for a free event.


The action starts at 6PM on Monday, June 24th at 82Mercer in Manhattan (the entrance, somewhat confusingly, is at 76 Mercer St. -- but we have faith that you'll figure it out). Snag yourself a ticket to the event by clicking here. Oh, and if you're a sponsor who's interested in getting on board -- or a member of the press who wants some early access to the event -- drop us a line at events [at] gdgt.com. We'll see you in a couple of weeks!
