 It looks like that newfangled silver motif we spotted a few days back on Dell's 2007WFP was indeed a sign of things to come, as both the 17-inch SE177FP and 19-inch SE197FP have been officially updated to sport a snazzy new silver casing. Thankfully sparing us the bizarre-looking silver / black mishmash design on the rear, these two still sport the same black backside with a new silver bezel and stand arm. Both units tout a 1,280 x 1,024 resolution, 8-millisecond response time, 300 cd/m2 brightness, VGA inputs, and VESA compatibility; the 17-incher also boasts a 500:1 contrast ratio while the larger of the two claims a 700:1 ratio, and both are available as we speak. As for prices, the SE197FP will demand $219, while the more diminutive sibling rings up at just $179.Read - Dell's 19-inch SE197FP LCDRead - Dell's 17-inch SE177FP LCD[Thanks, Ethan]
