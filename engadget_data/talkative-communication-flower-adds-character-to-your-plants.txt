While it's certainly not a voice-activated R2-D2, nor a channel-flipping R100, the Communication Flower pulls double duty by sprucing up your living room and adding a bit of chatter to break up the depressing silence. Although you can't wirelessly cater to its every need, this device sports a colorful motif and packs an integrated speaker to randomly belt out "200 words and phrases" whenever you speak to or touch the connected bouquet. Although we aren't sure how quickly the novelty factor would wear off (or how repetitive it's bound to become), the Communication Flower can be picked up next month for Â¥4,179 ($36).[Via Akihabara News]
