Microsoft is desperate for the Xbox One to make an impact this holiday season. In addition to a slew of exclusive games, including Halo 5: Guardians, Rise of the Tomb Raider and Forza Motorsport 6, the company is continuing to undercut Sony's PlayStation 4. To mark Black Friday -- specifically November 26th to 30th -- Microsoft is slashing $50 from 12 Xbox One holiday bundles. The cheapest of which will be going for $299 with either a copy of The Lego Movie Videogame or Gears of War: Ultimate Edition. Needless to say, there's never been a better time to jump on board with Microsoft's latest console. Combined with the greatly redesigned dashboard, a customisable "Elite" controller and backwards compatibility, there's little else the company can do at this point to promote sales.
