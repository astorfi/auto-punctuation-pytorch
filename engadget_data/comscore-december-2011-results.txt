  The latest report is in from ComScore, and as you might expect, the news is sunshine and roses for the crews at Google and Apple. Both companies platforms charted some worthwhile month-over-month gains, as Android is estimated to account for 47.3 percent of smartphones in the US, while iOS runs a strong second with 26.9 percent. Meanwhile, former BlackBerry fans continue to scatter, as the platform now accounts for 16 percent of smartphone users. Similarly, Windows Phone (and whatever's left of Windows Mobile) have taken it on the chin, and have fallen to just 4.7 percent market share. Without ever gaining much traction in the US, Symbian now makes up 1.4 percent of the smartphone pie. You'll find a quick look at the manufacturing side of the equation, along with the full ComScore press release, after the break.
      

 

 Samsung continues to hold its spot as the top mobile manufacturer, but its 25.3 percent market share also accounts for its dumb phone segment. The same is true for LG and Motorola, both which saw their user base decline to 20 percent and 13.3 percent, respectively. Apple and RIM -- both of which make only smartphones -- both show gains over the previous month. Apple's increase was rather significant, which grew from 11.2 to 12.4 percent. Meanwhile, RIM's uptick was modest, which saw a change from 6.5 to 6.7 percent.Based on ComScore figures, there are now 97.9 million smartphone users in the US, which is quite a leap over the previous month's estimate of 91.4 million. Perhaps we'll have a bit of a milestone to report next month?
