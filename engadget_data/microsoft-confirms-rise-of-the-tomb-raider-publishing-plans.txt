Rise of the Tomb Raider was outed as an Xbox exclusive earlier this year, with Xbox 360 and Xbox One versions slated to launch in late 2015. The game serves as sequel to 2013's series reboot Tomb Raider, which was published across consoles and PC platforms by Square Enix.

Rise of the Tomb Raider's platform exclusivity raised the ire of series fans when it was revealed earlier this year. Microsoft's Phil Spencer previously noted that the company's partnership with Square Enix "has a duration," potentially clearing the way for a multiplatform Rise of the Tomb Raider release once the deal expires.
