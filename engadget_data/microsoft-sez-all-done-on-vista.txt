Today Microsoft announced that Vista has been released to begin manufacturing copies of the OS, putting it right on track for its November 30th release to big businesses customers, and the January 30th release to consumers. Of course, the job of an OS developer is never finished, and we're sure Microsoft is already gearing up to patch day one vulnerabilities, but we suppose the developers can have a few hours in between to crack open a cold one, plop down for a bit of Gears of War, and celebrate this monumental achievement -- at around 50 million lines of code, they sure seem to have earned it.
