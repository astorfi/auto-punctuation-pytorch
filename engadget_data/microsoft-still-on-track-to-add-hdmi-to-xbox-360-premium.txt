 Remember way back when we broke the big news on the Xbox 360 Elite -- and one of the bits we mentioned was that after a while Microsoft was going to burn through its Premium SKU stock and eventually add HDMI to the mid-range model? Or that again, recently, another source of ours confirmed the same? Well it seems Ars heard the same thing from one of its sources, and has it that Microsoft will have an HDMI enabled Premium system (with cooler 65nm chips and quieter drives) coming later this month or early September. We don't know about that bit, but we'll certainly be waiting and watching this one.
