As further homage to our overlords presenting at the International Robot Expo (IREX) in Japan this week, we bring
you the new and improved HAL bionic suit. At first site,
we thought we were looking at one badazz crime-fighting cyborg
prepping to blast that
human wall target (with fuzzy bear backpack — come on, you see it right… please say you see it?).
Instead, that dude's all human all the time and only the HAL suit is robotic, if you can
believe it. This is the new HAL-5, or more specifically the Hybrid Assistive Limb. It's developed as a walking aid for
those who could use a bit of extra power, such as the disabled or apparently
farmers who must add bags of sodium to their basement water softeners.
