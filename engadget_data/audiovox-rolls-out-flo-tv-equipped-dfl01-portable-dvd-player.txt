It was actually announced way back at CES in January, but is now available to order for $199, which will get you a 7-inch widescreen display, three months of free FLO TV service (it'll run you $14.99 a month after that) and, of course, a built-in DVD player. Somewhat curiously, it seems that HSN is the only retailer actually shipping the device right now, but it's said to be "coming soon" to Best Buy as well.
