Some things to remember about the police crime analysis system that predicted with, eh, some accuracy the
time and place of a robbery in Yonkers, New York, which resulted in an arrest of two suspects. First is that the
computer predicted the crime would happen on South Broadway, a very major thoroughfare in Yonkers. Second, the computer
predicted the crime would occur in a window of four hours. So yeah, we'd probably agree that chances are between
sundown and midnight someone's gonna get robbed on a big street in New Yorkâ€”ah, the miracle of modern computing.
