It has announced the availability of its TransferJet wireless LSI, enabling high-speed file transfers between devices sans cables. Ahead of the January 2012 date we'd heard, the company has begun shipping out $5 units in sample quantities. With the ability to transfer files at 560Mbps, the TC3540 chip has hopes of making close-proximity, high-speed sharing between your laptop, smartphone and tablet much easier. We're anxious to see if the tech can live up to our lofty expectations, as we've seen previous TransferJet devices flounder. If you're itching for all the particulars, hit the full PR just beyond the break.

(TAEC)*, a committed leader that collaborates with technology companies to create breakthrough designs, today announced the availability of its wireless LSI compliant with the TransferJet™ standard for high-speed wireless data transfer. The TransferJet LSI (part number TC35420) enables fast, close proximity exchange of large multimedia files between consumer electronics devices. Toshiba, a member of the TransferJet Consortium, will host technology demonstrations featuring tablets, laptops and smartphones running the company's TransferJet LSI at CES, January 10 – 13, 2012, in the TransferJet Consortium booth (#15112). 		The Toshiba TransferJet LSI is a single-chip solution that uses an RF-CMOS manufacturing process to support both RF and digital functionality in one chip. Having a complete TransferJet solution in one chip reduces power consumption and design footprint; key areas of concern for customers designing battery-powered, small form factor consumer electronics devices. Furthermore, the Toshiba TransferJet LSI has a receiving sensitivity of -78dBm, which far exceeds the TransferJet specification and contributed to the device's range and stability. 		"The proliferation of mobile broadband and consumer electronics devices with lots of storage has enabled consumers to take their movies, music and photos anywhere. But moving that content between devices can be a tedious process involving cables or confusing Bluetooth or Wi-Fi configurations," said Andrew Burt, vice president, Analog and Imaging Business Unit, System LSI Group, Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. "TransferJet removes these complications, letting consumers simply place devices next to each other to securely transfer large multimedia files in seconds. Our TransferJet LSI will let OEMs add this functionality to their devices with minimal effect on their device's size or power consumption." 		The Toshiba TransferJet LSI is now available, priced at $5 per unit in sample quantities.
