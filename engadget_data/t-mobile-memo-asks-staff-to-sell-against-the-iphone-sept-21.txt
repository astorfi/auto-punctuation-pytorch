The note tells carrier staff they'll get training material to learn "selling against the iPhone" from September 21st onwards. Why does that date sound familiar? Although we don't know if T-Mobile has an inside track on Apple's plans or is just making assumptions based on rumors, that's not the language we would associate with a carrier that has a new agreement to sell the iPhone -- not unless it's using a loose definition of the word "against," at least. As a consolation, T-Mobile is reportedly supplying updated micro-SIM kits on August 29th to emphasize its improving support for unlocked iPhones on refarmed 3G spectrum. Nothing's official until Apple struts on stage, of course; you may nonetheless want to research alternatives if getting a cheaper contract phone on Magenta trumps having Cupertino's latest and greatest.
