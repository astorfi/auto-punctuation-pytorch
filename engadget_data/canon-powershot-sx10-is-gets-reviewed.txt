Among other things, they were apparently especially impressed with the SX10's "bigger and better" lens, which they say is a marked improvement over the one on the S5, and they were happy to find that both the tilt-and-swivel LCD and dedicated record button for video stuck around for this incarnation. On the downside, you'll have to do without HD video recording or RAW still shots and, while the overall ease of use is improved compared to the S5, those moving up from a point-and-shoot will still face a bit of a learning curve. There's also the small matter of the camera's price which, at $400, places it somewhat uncomfortably between some higher-end point-and-shoots and some entry-level DSLRs. Hit up the link below for some more details and, of course, plenty of sample shots.
