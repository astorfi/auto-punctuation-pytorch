Are we holding out for a little more than some guys in clean suits gazing thoughtfully at the thing for minutes on end? Yes we are. You know as well as anybody how much we love our civilian space program, and how giddy with excitement we tend to get whenever they announce some new technology, so we're wishing everyone involved much success with this latest endeavor. And we're really hoping that things pick up a little on the USTREAM. As for the rover itself, it's called Curiosity, and it should launch a year or so from now, putting it on the red planet sometime in August 2012. Get a good look after the break.
