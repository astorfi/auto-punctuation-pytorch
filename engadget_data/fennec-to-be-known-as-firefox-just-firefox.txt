As it closes in on a final release, everyone (and seriously, we mean everyone) is wondering what the darn piece of software will actually go by. WMExperts has learned that the browser will simply be titled Firefox -- not Mobile Firefox, not Firefox for Mobiles, just Firefox. We needn't tell you just how confusing this is going to get, but whatever, so long as this gets pushed out on the double, we'll call it anything it wants.[Via phoneArena]
