The page mentions little beyond an Axx name and that there will be a "whole new generation" of the technology uncovered on May 30th. There's a contest to win whatever the device might be if you're astute enough to predict the future name, but this may be a softball question given the not-so-subtle hints. Between terrible puns about the "axx-traterestrial" coming and winners getting to "axx-perience" the technology first, we have a feeling that any name that doesn't put "Axx" front and center is out of the running.
