 In the latest edition of the love-hate Nokia-Qualcomm legal nastiness that's taking up way too much time these days, those mobile phone giants in Finland have asked a Texas court to make Qualcomm stop infringing on six of its MediaFLO implementations. Nokia has some gall to countersue Qualcomm over some specific tailoring of the MediaFLO and BREW standards seing as both are Qualcomm technologies. Those Finns are accusing Qualcomm here of "effectively copying Nokia's innovations." And, Nokia says that its patents are at the core of MediaFLO (broadcast quality) and BREW (application download enabling). Why don't these two just get in the ring and rumble? Enough with silly suits/countersuits already.
