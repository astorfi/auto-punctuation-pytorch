This pretty much falls into the "because you can" category as far as hacks go, but stillâ€¦ you can apparently save
your Xbox game saves to your
PSP, simply by marrying the twain with the PSO USB
keyboard adapter (or any USB adapter for the Xbox, really) available at Xbox.com. It will completely reformat your
Memory Stick Duo, but after you've had your way with whatever nefarious deeds you have planned for your Xbox saves you
can just reformat it PSP-style.
