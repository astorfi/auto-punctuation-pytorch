 The Palm rumor du jour calls for Palm to deliver its first, Linux-based smartphone in an October release. According to the DigiTimes source, the new OS will be based on Wind River System's flavor of Linux already in use (and buggy) in Palm's forthcoming Foleo folly. That's right, Wind River, not ALP. Really, we don't care whose OS it is, just as long as we never have to see Garnet rolled out on a new device ever, ever again. Of course, it makes sense for Palm to standardize on a low-risk, OEM-grade Linux platform so we'll play along with the rumor for now. Oh, and make it ultra-thin with WiMax, please... pretty please, with sugar? We'll even move to Baltimore if you do. Well...
