While this doesn't appear to be official from Ma Bell, or entirely exhaustive, we've gotten a spreadsheet that goes in-depth to out the carrier's upcoming smartphones. A host of Android devices are on the list -- all with Gingerbread -- along with two handsets that strut Windows Phone 7.5 and another duo with BlackBerry 7. Of particular note, we see the Samsung SGH-i777 (otherwise known as the Attain), along with the SGH-i927 for you QWERTY slider lovers. Both Sammy's sport Category 14 HSDPA, or (up to) 21Mbps downloads. Curiously, the Impulse -- Ma Bell's rumored LTE phone -- is nowhere to be found. The Motorola MB865, with a full gigabyte of RAM and 8 megapixel camera, aligns very well with the rumored Atrix refresh. You've seen the two phones from RIM before, and while Samsung's Mango handset spent a brief moment in the wild, little is known about HTC's counterpart. Hopefully we won't need to wait for the actual change of seasons to learn more.
