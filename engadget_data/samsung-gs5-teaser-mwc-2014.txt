We're not mathematicians, but we're fairly sure that you can't multiply Life to the power of five. That hasn't stopped Samsung, however, from claiming as much on its latest MWC invite. The company's "back-to-basics" Galaxy S5 is expected to dominate the show, and this is the first official hint of what we can expect. The grid of nine icons are grouped by color, with Speed, Curiosity and Privacy in team blue and Outdoor, Style and Fitness in healthy green -- and yes, all are multiplied to the power of five. It'd be hasty to leap to any conclusions just yet, but perhaps we'll see Samsung beefing up device security in the wake of PRISM and, hopefully, a renewed focus on fitness.
