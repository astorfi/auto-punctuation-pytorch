Check out Amazon, where you can now plunk down 380 of your hard earned dollars to get first in line -- or close to it, anyway. The S10-3 was said to be headed for retail sometime this month when it was announced, so a pre-order at this point isn't particularly surprising, but a price that's $30 higher than MSRP is. A little. We wouldn't be particularly inclined to click the little shopping cart next to a listing without a picture or a proper model name, but more power to you impulse orderers.
