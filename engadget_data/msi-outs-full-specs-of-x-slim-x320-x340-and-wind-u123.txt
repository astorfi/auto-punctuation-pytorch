Over at CTIA in Vegas, the company is revealing all the dirty details about what makes these May-bound rigs tick, and we're pleased as punch to see a few unexpected inclusions. As for the 10.2-inch U123, you'll find a 1.66GHz Atom N280 CPU, integrated WWAN and even a built-in TV tuner. As for the X-Slim X340 (starting around $1,000), it's amongst the first to feature Intel's newfangled CULV platform, which sucks down one-sixth the power of a regular mobile CPU. The X320 (starting at $700) gets gifted with a less exciting 1.6GHz Atom Z530, but the optional 3G / WiMAX module definitely makes it altogether enticing for those scouting a continually connected ultraportable. Head on past the break for the full hardware breakdown.
