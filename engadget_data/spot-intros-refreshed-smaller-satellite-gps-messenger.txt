The newly revamped SPOT is some 30 percent smaller than the previous model, and it also boasts an enhanced antenna for picking up signal whilst deep in the brush, a GPS acquisition light, "Message Sending" indicator light, illuminated buttons and a dedicated pre-programmable Custom Message button. There's also a protective cover over the all-important S.O.S. button to prevent inadvertent message transmissions (wouldn't want that, now would we?), and in a move to give fashionistas a choice, this one will be available in both silver and orange. It's expected to be available in select retailers this fall, but you'll have to wait until then to get a handle on pricing.
