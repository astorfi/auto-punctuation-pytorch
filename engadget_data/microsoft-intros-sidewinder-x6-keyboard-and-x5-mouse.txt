The SideWinder X6 is hailed as the "first gaming keyboard created by Microsoft from the ground up, and the only gaming keyboard on the market with a switchable key pad." When not in gaming mode, the key pad transforms into a full-programmable macro pad. You'll also find two-color adjustable backlighting, mode switching and a $79.95 price tag. As for the X5 mouse, this critter packs nine buttons (five of which are customizable), a 2,000DPI laser tracking engine, six DPI settings (adjustable on the fly) and a $59.95 sticker. Full release is just after the break.
