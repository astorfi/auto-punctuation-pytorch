 Pretty bold move, Hirai, to admit that you're less than three months out from the global launch of what could be one of the most expensive propositions Sony has ever undertaken -- and you haven't even started manufacturing. According to Kaz, who recently spoke with GameSpot, Sony "haven't started manufacturing yet. Some of [their] ops guys were actually just in China, and also in Japan just reviewing the [production] lines and everything else." Oh, great, you've got two million units to whip up and you're still in the review process. That's over 660,000 units a month if they start, um, tomorrow. Look, we're not saying it can't be done, but unless the hefty price tag of the Blu-ray behemoth outstrips consumer interest, it seems like we could be in for some serious shortages come the holiday buying season.[Via GamesIndustry.biz]
