We have been diggin' this phone since we first laid eyes on it, but now that we have finally had a chance to use it a bit, we can't help but feel fairly underwhelmed. The build quality looks top-shelf, but feels like inexpensive plastic, and while the idea behind the touch interface is grand, typing an address in a browser was nasty. That being said, the lovely PR type from O2 told us that it was most definitely her fav handset and that she was hoping to take one home, so what do we know? We won't bore you with the specs again, but we will share the pics!
