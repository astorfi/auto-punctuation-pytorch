 
We're ready to make a boldprediction for 2006: the market is aboutto be deluged with laptops with 19-inchdisplays. Actually, we're not being that daring here. After all, we saw some even bigger laptops at CES, and nowthat such luminaries as the UK's AJP Computers are rolling their own 19-inchers, it seems only a matter of time beforethe OEM plants in Taiwan and China begin cranking these out by the thousands. AJP's box does sound pretty good, though,with 2GB RAM, a 100GB hard drive, AMD Turion 64 MT-40 and a TV tuner (because, after all, if you've got a 19-inchdisplay, you're gonna want to watch TV on it, right?). Of course, all that real estate is going to cost you; this onegoes for over $4,000 in the UK. Come on, OEMs. Get busy, so we can get these prices down and turn up the heat on ourscoliosis.
