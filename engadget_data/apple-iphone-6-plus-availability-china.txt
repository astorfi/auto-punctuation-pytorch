Apple has finally revealed the date that its new iPhones will be available to eager users in mainland China: Friday, October 17th. The devices had been delayed pending regulatory approval, but Apple was granted a license earlier today by the Chinese government -- despite some security concerns. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will go on pre-order starting October 10th, with units available a week later at Apple Stores and all three major carriers. Both phones will support TD-LTE and FDD-LTE, meaning 4G speeds will be available to users at China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom. So far, the lack of availability has meant extortionate prices for smuggled models, though there's been an alarming lack of demand in the gray market. But at least Chinese Apple fans will avoid the parade of early iOS 8 bugs.
