Both phones are powered by A9 processors, although it's not yet clear if the quad-core chip is same as the Samsung engine in the PlayStation Vita. The 4-inch screen will be 960 x 640 and overall thickness will stay within the 10mm (0.4-inch) threshold. No doubt we'll have the full low-down from Engadget Chinese as soon as it launches.
