	Don't you hate it when all of your iPads collectively run out of juice? Well, praise Griffin for announcing its first business centric iOS "accessory" in the shape of the Multidock. It has its own power connection for simultaneous charging of ten iPads, but it can be chain-linked to two other docks for syncing of up to 30 tablets with a single Mac. With each server-esque tower measuring up at 18.6 inches (47.2 cm) tall and priced even higher at $700, this one's for IT pros and Scrabble aficionados only.
