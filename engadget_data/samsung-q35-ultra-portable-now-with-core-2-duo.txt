And from the looks of things, that's the only change you're gonna see; same 12.1-inch widescreen display, 80GB SATA disk, up to 1GB memory, and integrated Intel graphics swaddled in a sleek, 4-pound ultra-porable. Still, while the new proc won't be any more efficient with the juice than the Q35's former Core Duo, that promised 20% boost in performance ain't chicken feed. Most of all, kudos to you Sammy for not calling this the World's Smallest Core 2 Duo laptop held by a shoeless waif. Nice to see a bit of restraint on this one. Also announced is the less interesting 15.4-inch, R55 with that same 1.8GHz T5600 Core 2 Duo CPU, disk, and RAM but with GeForce Go 7600 graphics for that extra bit of oomph. Stay tuned for the deluge of Core 2 Duo lappies to come dear readers.
