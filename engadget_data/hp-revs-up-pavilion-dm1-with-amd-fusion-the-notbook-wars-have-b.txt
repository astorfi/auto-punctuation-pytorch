The case has been substantially hotted-up from last year's dm1, and inside you're looking at a dual-core 1.6GHz Vision E-350 APU, which includes Radeon HD 6310M graphics that power an LED-backlit 1366 x 768 BrightView display. 3GB of memory comes standard with a max of 8GB, and there's a 320GB drive and an SD card reader as well as 3 USB ports, HDMI and VGA out, and an Ethernet port. Best of all, it weighs in at 3.52 pounds with a six-cell 55WHr battery that's promised to run for "up to 9 hours and 30 minutes." That's a lofty claim, and one we look forward to testing in the days ahead -- along with just how much real-world performance that E-350 APU really provides for the dm1's $449 MSRP. We'll let you know -- for now, check out some hands-on shots below.
