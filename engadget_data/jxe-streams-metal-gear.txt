Can love bloom on the battlefield? Metal Gear elicits more questions like these -- from both players and its characters -- than it ever answers. In the wake of Konami's recent public relations meltdown and Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain's impending release at the end of summer, Hideo Kojima's bizarre war drama is looming large our world. Next week, Engadget will bring you some early impressions of The Phantom Pain. Today at 3:30PM ET/12:30PM PT, though, we're going to the very beginning to stream the original Metal Gear.



Tune in right here to this post and Engadget.com/gaming to watch a solid 90 minutes of the MSX version of Metal Gear. That's the OG Metal Gear, not the NES port from the late '80s. If you want to chat with us about the game, watch over at Twitch.tv/Joystiq. Click that follow button while you're at it.

[We're streaming a PS3 retail version of The Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection through an Elgato HD at 720p via OBS.]
