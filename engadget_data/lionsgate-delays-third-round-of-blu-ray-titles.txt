 Lionsgate wouldn't be representing Blu-ray properly if it didn't delay at least some of their up-coming titles. Look at the whole history of the format, with all the delays of players, pushed back movies, bumped release dates and now Lionsgate is getting in on the action by delaying their titles that was suppose to hit October 17 but instead have been pushed back till 'early 2007.' Hopefully this means the studio is ditching the MPEG-2 codec and instead retrofitting these discs with VC-1 encoding. We don't know for sure why but let's just say we are more then a little disappointed that we can't peep Sylvester Stallone in First Blood as soon as we thought we could.
