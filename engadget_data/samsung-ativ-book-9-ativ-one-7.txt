We hope you like super skinny laptops, because you're going to be seeing a hell of a lot more of them in 2015. Samsung just took the veil off its new ATIV Book 9 Ultrabook, which comes in at just 0.45 inch thick and 2.09 pounds. That's insanely compact for a 12.2-inch machine and indeed, it's the thinnest and lightest notebook Samsung has released yet. (Given Sammy's history with razor-thin laptops, that's saying a lot.) Like so many other slim machines that have come out lately, the Book 9 uses one of Intel's new Core M processors, which were designed specifically to allow for skinnier designs.





Even more than its svelte profile, though, the real star of the show might actually be the display. Not only is the 2,560 x 1,600 resolution high for a machine this size, but Samsung also included an "outdoor mode" that takes the brightness from an already-impressive 350 nits all the way up to 700. The only concession seems to be that it's a non-touch panel -- kind of a necessity, though, if you wanna build a machine this thin.
