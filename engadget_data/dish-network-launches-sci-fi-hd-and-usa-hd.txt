Seriously, how could you not with all the new local markets recently, then CNN HD a few days ago and now the two channels many have really been waiting for -- Battlestar Galactica in HD anyone? Now to those who subscribe to DISH's AT100 and Essentials HD (or higher) package, SCI FI HD is available on channel 122 HD and USA HD is available on 105 HD.[Thanks, Scott!]
