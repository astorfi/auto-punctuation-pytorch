Face it: if you're like us your laptop
is more important than your car (especially since living in the city you don't even own a car). In an effort to cash
in make users feel more safe carrying their investments, Absolute Software licensed the name LoJack to make a
LoJack-like system for your portable. Apparently the software installs a silent agent into the machine's BIOS which
sends a IP address or phone number upon Internet connection to help identify its physical location in case it should
"go missing". (We're not really sure how it pulls the phone digits, though.) A bit different from
SkyHook, but hey, LoJack even offers a $1,000 recovery
guarantee for your machine so you feel that much more safe cruising around at night with your precious gear. Just don't
forget to freaking back up and use decent passwords though, ok? Identity theft totally sucks, and you really don't want
to have to get this guy on the case.
