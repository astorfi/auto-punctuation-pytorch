Remember that China Labor Watch report we recently covered? After digging further into the document, 9to5Mac's Computerworld's unearthed more possible evidence about that often leaked, low-cost plastic-clad iPhone. The introduction states:



Its assembled products include iPhone 4, iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, and low-priced plastic iPhones.



Then, on page 27:


Today's work is to paste protective film on the iPhone's plastic back cover to prevent it from being scratched on assembly lines. This iPhone model with a plastic cover will soon be released on the market by Apple. [...] The new cell phone has not yet been put into mass production, so quantity is not as important.



Of course, there's no definitive proof that Apple will be launching a more affordable iPhone made of polycarbonate -- after all the company might just be testing prototypes that are not destined to market. Still, the information in this report sure gives all these recent iPhone rumors a lot more merit.


Update: It looks like it was Computerworld that originally discovered this information, and we've changed the source link to reflect this.
