Somehow, he's managed to squeeze a Zern GPU block, a Koolance GPU-180-H06 block, a Tank-o-Matic mini reservoir, a 12v thermaltake pump and DD fill port into the 360's already crowded interior. The mods don't stop on the inside, as the box itself is customized with blue LEDs, plexiglass windows, some slick blue paint and, best of all, no huge water pipes that look like they came from a pool filter.
