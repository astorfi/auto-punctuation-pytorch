The company is also working on super-high-end prime lenses for their cameras that supposedly outperform every other test lens the company has in its possession -- Jannard says "it isn't close." As usual, RED doesn't say when any of this is coming out, but it's definitely enough to make a camera geek's hair stand on end -- check it all out in the gallery.[Thanks, Jun-Dai]
