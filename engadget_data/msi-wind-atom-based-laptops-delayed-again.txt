We expected the machines to start shipping already, but a big pink "Estimated Ship Date: Friday, June 27" at MSI's online fulfillment site has shattered our dreams all the way to, at the earliest, the end of June with our hands on the machines in early July at best. We'll keep our eyes on what appear to be an endless stream of tacked-on delays. MSI, you tease us so!Update: So it looks like the delayed machine will ship with a 3-cell (instead of 6-cell) battery due to shortages. To be fair, the price is a somewhat reduced $479.[Via thegadgetsite]
