Apparently making sure that its got the low and mid-range customers covered as well, Evesham is busting out a bevy of new displays at much lower price points. The Alqemi lineups boasts 32-, 37-, and 42-inch panels, with all five sporting WXGA resolutions, 8-millisecond response time, 500 cd/m2 brightness, 1000:1 contrast ratio (save for the bottom-end's curiously high 1200:1 spec), and integrated stereo speakers. Evesham further segregates the models by offering a low-end 32-inch version (peep a pic after the jump) with the bare necessities (HDMI, component / S-Video / composite, VGA, and an analog tuner) for £499 ($970), while offering mid-range units with DVB-T / analog hybrid tuners (with Digital Tick support), and a 42-inch flagship (Alqemi SX; pictured after the break) that boasts PIP and Virtual Dolby surround sound. Evesham's budget lineup tops at £1,399 ($2,718), with the mid-range units ranging from £599 ($1,164) to £899 ($1,747), and can be picked up now on the other side of the pond.Read - Evesham 32-inch Alqemi LCD TVRead - Evesham 32-inch Alqemi SX LCD TVRead - Evesham 37-inch Alqemi S LCD TVRead - Evesham 37-inch Alqemi SX LCD TVRead - Evesham 42-inch Alqemi SX LCD TV
