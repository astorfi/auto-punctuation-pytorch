Then you won't find a much better one these days than the Samsung Epic 4G, which is launching on the carrier tomorrow for $249.99 on a two-year contract (in case you needed a reminder). According to Sprint, most stores will be opening at 8 a.m. sharp, which still leaves you plenty of time to read (or re-read) our review of the phone.
