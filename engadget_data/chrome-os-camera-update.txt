You have a Chromebook, yes? Well, if you're webcam-inclined, Google has some potentially big news for you. The Chromium team has completely overhauled the Camera app's UI, and according to Mountain View's "Happiness Evangelist" Fran√ßois Beaufort, new functionality is in the hopper. Soon, the application will offer video recording, direct uploading to YouTube and Google+ as well as syncing captured pictures across all of your Chrome devices. (Handy!) If you want a look at the operating system's new camera interface sooner rather than later, you can head over to the Chrome web store and grab the update right now.
