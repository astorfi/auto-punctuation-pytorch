MS just dropped the device's price to $349, representing a $150 decrease for the 32GB model. Staples was the first reported retailer with slashed pricing -- the tablet went on sale there yesterday -- and Microsoft's UK and Australian online stores have followed up with pricing of Â£279 and AU$389, respectively. The new MSRP appears to be live on at least three continents, and you can take advantage at our source links just below.
