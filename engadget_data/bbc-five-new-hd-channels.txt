Earlier this year, the BBC said it would further commit to high-quality programming with the launch of five new HD channels by early 2014. Today, it announced it will deliver on that promise, launching BBC Three HD, BBC Four HD, BBC News HD, CBeebies HD and CBBC HD to take its high-definition channel tally up to seven and ensure all but two of its domestic TV channels are delivering 1080-line broadcasts. There'll be no need for any additional subscriptions, meaning you'll be able to access Danish political drama Borgen and other content using your existing Freeview, Freesat, Youview, Sky or Virgin Media box, as well as on-demand via iPlayer. The BBC says all five channels will begin rolling out via their new dedicated channel numbers from December 10th -- you can find out what they are by hitting the source below.
