 
The mylo is back, and this time it's gotten serious. The once humble, even kind of laughable device has been upgraded with specs respectable enough to make former naysayers sit up and take notice. Check it out:

800 x 480 3.5-inch (resistive) touchscreen display!
1GB internal storage, mini-USB
1.3 megapixel camera, 802.11b/g, colored info-LEDs
WMA / PlaysForSure DRM, MP3, AAC, ATRAC, and MPEG-4 codec support
Flash Lite 3 (capable of playing back YouTube videos, for example)
Netfront-based browser, AIM / Gtalk / Yahoo IM support
Skype support, podcast and RSS aggregator (!), and an expandable widget panel with access to Google, YouTube, Facebook and other web 2.0 sites
Attachable face plates ($20) and cradle ($30) options
Free Wayport WiFi access at your local participating McDonald's until December 31, 2010
5.1 x 2.5 x 0.8-inch footprint

Unfortunately you still can't add your own apps to the device, making it far less compelling then, say, the similar but far better equipped Nokia N810 -- which goes for $180 more. It's shipping this month for $300, "BS" key included for no additional charge.
