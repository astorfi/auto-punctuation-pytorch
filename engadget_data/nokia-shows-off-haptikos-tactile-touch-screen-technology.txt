According to Red Ferret, Nokia's system is also a good deal more advanced than some similar ones already on the market, with it actually allowing for a 0.1 mm movement in the screen itself. That, combined with a pair of sensor pads under the screen, supposedly allows it to "mimic exactly the sensation of pressing a real key," complete with a "clunky click and tactile snap." What's more, it seems that the technology isn't all that far off, with Nokia's upcoming S60 handset apparently first in line to get it.
