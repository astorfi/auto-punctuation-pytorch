It's good to see they haven't left these issues to simply whither on the dying vine of HD DVD, but unless an alternate ending to the format war is tucked into those network features we don't see this making things all better anytime soon. Expect a prompt the next time you watch an HD DVD while online, and remember the good times we had.
