Nestled inside Nintendo President Satoru Iwata's statement on those brutally slashed sales forecasts, he touched on what the company is doing to (hopefully) reverse the current downward trend. Research and development is apparently getting some heavy support, with the Nintendo No.1 saying that the company is strengthening both the existing "development structure" as well as "new research and development activities." Will that entail Nintendo's next console, heavy-duty improvements to the existing Wii U or just a new fitness dongle? We don't know and Nintendo isn't giving us much for our imagination to run on just yet, but it sounds like the company's planning for a brighter fiscal future. Now, let the flights of wild fancy begin.
