The user's guide starts by confirming the usual suspects: a 1GHz dual-core processor, 4G LTE, a 4.3" screen and a rear-facing camera capable of capturing 1080p video. The good stuff comes in on page thirteen: the Motorola XT375 supports LTE, CDMA, GSM, and UTMS, a world phone with support for over 200 countries, but unlike its WiMax cousin, the Photon, UMTS support is limited to 2100MHz only. The familial similarities are still there, however, as it seems that the Bionic uses the same connector layout (micro-USB / micro-HDMI) as the Photon, but shifted further down the edge of the phone. This means, unlike the Atrix, the Photon and Bionic just might be able to share WebTop docks and accessories. Need more than just bread and butter? An inductive charging back tagged along on the handset's federal funday, and while there's no indication that it ships with its own charging mat, we'd hazard a guess that it's compatible with existing VZW inductive chargers.
