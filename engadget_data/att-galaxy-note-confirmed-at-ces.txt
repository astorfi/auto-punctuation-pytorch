The company's Galaxy Note is indeed headed to AT&T, confirmed by several posters in the public area of the Las Vegas Convention Center. The banner appears to be a Photoshop job rather than an actual device photo, since there's no 4G LTE indicator to be found. The AT&T branding is prevalent, however, leaving little doubt that the device will in fact be making its way to Ma Bell. More details will surely come to light during tomorrow's Samsung press conference, and we'll be back with a hands-on shortly after.
