 
 Whether you have streaming-savvy children, or are just a big kid yourself, Hulu has added a new section to its bulging catalogue specifically for you. Hulu Kids puts all the ad-free shows available to Plus subscribers in one place, and splits them into categories for filtering, say, only dinosaur-related programs. The section has its own website, or can now be accessed through the obvious option in the Browse menu. PS3 owners will be happy to know the Hulu Plus app has been updated, too, bringing back the Blu-ray remote functionality that was, for some wacky reason, removed in the last update. And, what better way is there to relax after a humiliating public defeat than dropping the controller, and taking in a calming dose of SpongeBob?
