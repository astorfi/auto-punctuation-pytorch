According to a report from The Wall Street Journal today, however, the FTC is looking at both Android and Google's search practices, and specifically whether it gives preferential placement to its own products and services at the expense of its competitors. The WSJ also says the FTC is looking into allegations that Google unfairly takes information like reviews of local businesses from its competitors, and then uses it on its own sites while also pushing those competitors down in its search results. For its part, Google denies that it engages in any such practices, and says that it is "happy to answer any questions" the FTC has about its business.
