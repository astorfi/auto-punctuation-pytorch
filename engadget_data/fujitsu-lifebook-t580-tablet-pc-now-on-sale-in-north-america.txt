The netvertible, if we can even call it that, is about double the price of the usual convertible netbook, and for good reason -- the system eschews Atom for Core i3 / i5 processor options and also has an capacitive display with an N-trig digitizer, which can support both pen and finger input. The $1,149 "Express Buy" model packs a Core i3-380UM processor, 2GB of RAM, 160GB of storage, and a 5,800mAh six-cell battery, while going on up to the Core i5-560UM CPU adds an extra $250. The T580 sure does seem to fill a pretty niche market these days, which is why we're guessing Fujitsu dropped the early "slate-beating" descriptor, but there's got to be some out there that still want the power of a mainstream system in a shrunken Tablet PC form factor, right?
