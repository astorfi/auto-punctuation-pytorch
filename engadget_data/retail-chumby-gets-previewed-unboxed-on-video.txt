 
Just about two short months after learning the official specifications and pricing details of the forthcoming Chumby, it looks like one of those lucky "insiders" were able to get their paws around a retail production unit and show us what this thing's all about. Aside from blessing us with an unboxing video, initial impressions of the device explained that overall performance was "very snappy, the screen was crystal clear, and sound performance was excellent." Additionally, it was noted that the Chumby just seems like a gizmo that will enable all sorts of fun, so while we the general public wait our turns, be sure and take a peek at the preview vid residing after the break.
