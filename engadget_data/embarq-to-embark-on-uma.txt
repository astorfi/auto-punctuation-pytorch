 When Sprint-Nextel became Sprint-Nextel, Sprint's landline service had to go somewhere, so it became Embarq. But now that Embarq's already hit the streets with its 20,000 strong workforce, it's time to introduce some products. We don't know the full rap sheet on their new Smart Connect service, but it sounds like the Plus version of system will allow wireless call roaming onto WiFi networks -- what sounds a lot like UMA, or BT's Fusion service. According to RCR they are also expected to offer user-customizable service packages, but really we just want to be able to move our Sprint-Nextel (or Embarq MVNO) calls off our daytime minutes, and onto our Embarq landlines, thanks.
