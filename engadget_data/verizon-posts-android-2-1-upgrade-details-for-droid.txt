That's right: Verizon's just posted details on the Droid's upgrade to Google's latest and greatest cut, and you've got the expected host of goodies including the new 3D Gallery app, voice-to-text, news and weather widgets, pinch-to-zoom support, "improved" pattern lock, and -- get this -- live wallpapers, something we'd originally thought Motorola might leave out. It appears to lack the Nexus One's 3D app launcher (which we'd expected), but it's still pure gold for owners. Let us know when you've gotten it, eh?

Update: Leaked documentation indicates we'll see this start to get rolled out in batches of 250,000 at a time starting on Thursday -- not too long of a wait (unless you're in the very last batch, that is).
