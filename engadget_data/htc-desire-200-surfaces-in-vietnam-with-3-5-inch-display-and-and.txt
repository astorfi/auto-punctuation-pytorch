As teased a few months back and joining the now-official Desire 600, the smartphone pulls together a 320 x 480 3.5-inch screen, 1GHz processor and Android 4.0. It sounds a whole lot like the UK-bound Vodafone Smart Mini, which has been priced at just Â£50 on pay-as-you-go. HTC does put in a little more effort, however, including its Sense UI, front-facing speakers like the HTC One and a 5-megapixel camera on the entry-level device. According to thegiodidong, the Desire 200 also houses 4GB of storage, expandable up to 32GB through microSD and the whole package will land in Asian markets soon. Watch it get handled after the break or visit the source for a closer look.


Update: According to the video, the loudspeaker resides on the back of the Desire 200. It looks like those front grills are largely for design reasons -- we just wanted BoomSound a little too much...
