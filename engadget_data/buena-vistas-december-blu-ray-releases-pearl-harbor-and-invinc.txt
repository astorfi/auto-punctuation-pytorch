 Disney's home distribution arm, Buena Vista has successfully launched two waves of Blu-ray titles already, and is dropping a couple more before year end. Pearl Harbor and Invincible are the lucky movies, the latter day-and-date with the DVD version. No word on any special features or "Blu-scape" extras, but they carry an MSRP of $34.98. No Pirates of the Caribbean or Cars just yet, seems like we'll have to wait until 2007, meanwhile we'll "enjoy" box office-failure Pearl Harbor.[Thanks, Dave]
