       Canon just slopped-out an "EOS 40D" DSLR page onto their Hong Kong site. No specs or pictures of the unannounced camera but it's fair to say that we're looking at a followup to their 8.3 megapixel 30D. No surprise what with Canon's market share slumping due to stiff competition from the Sony A100, Nikon D80 and some cannibalization by their own EOS 400D / Rebel XTi. No specs yet, but don't be surprised to find at least a 10.2 megapixel sensor, anti-dust technology, DIGIC III processing and sensor changes for better performance at high ISO. Clicking through you'll find a big red "X" in place of the EOS 40D text. Now the tough choice: click the "read" link below and refresh until the onset of RSI, or kick back and chill -- the wolf's on it and we'll be with you di-rectly... or at least once the specs do finally break.[Via Digital Photography Blog]
