 Sometimes a PC lineup just needs a little nip and tuck, you know? Toshiba certainly thinks so, as it's sweeping through its everyday all-in-one and laptop ranges with tweaks. The most conspicuous update we see is for the higher-end Satellite P series portables, which receive a Windows 8-friendly touchscreen on the 14-inch model and a 1080p display for the 17.3-inch behemoth. Toshiba also says it's sprucing up the LX815 and LX835 all-in-ones, as well as the Satellite C, L and S series laptops, although the company isn't specific on what's truly new -- we've reached out and will let you know what tune-ups are enroute. Regardless of the scope, all the new mainstream models should ship in February, with prices to come later.
