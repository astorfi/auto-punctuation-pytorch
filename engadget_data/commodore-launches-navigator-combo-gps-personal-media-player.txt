This isn't the first time we've seen the venerable Commodore name slapped on some spiffy
new piece of gear, but at least this one sticks a bit
closer to the old-school design sense we expect from our 80s relics (no word yet if it comes in tan). Inside the
device, codenamed "The Navigator Combo," you'll find a decidedly non-retro 30GB hard drive, 3.6-inch touch screen
display and an integrated GPS receiver. And when it's not giving you directions while you're cruisingÂ  in your '84
Camaro, it'll also play MP3s and WMAs, as well as MPEG-4 and DivX video, which can be transferred from your PC via USB
2.0 or loaded directly onto SD cards.
