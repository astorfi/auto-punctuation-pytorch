Smartparts looks to be trying to de-emphasize the digital aspects of its frame (pictured above), slotting an 8.4-inch LCD into a genuine wood frame with a walnut finish (hey, not everyone's into the quasi-futuristic look). It'll handle just about every type of memory card, of which you'll need at least one spare cause it doesn't appear pack any storage of it's own -- it does come with a handy remote though, and will set you back about $200 US. Siren's frame (peep it after the break) has a smaller 5-inch display available in your choice of black or brown frames, and packs a welcome-but-paltry 32MB of built-in memory, in addition to the requisite line up of memory card support. No remote on this one though, but look for it to be available in Japan later this month for Â¥17,800 (just over $150 US).Read - SmartpartsRead - Siren
