Of course, that profit is apparently still a fairly small one (and might just be breaking even), with Yoshida only saying that "this year is the first time that we are able to cover the cost of the PlayStation 3," and that "we aren't making huge money from hardware, but we aren't bleeding like we used to." That also unsurprisingly means that Sony still isn't planning a price cut anytime in the near future, with Yoshida instead saying that Sony will focus on more bundles like Move / Sports Champions package announced at E3.
