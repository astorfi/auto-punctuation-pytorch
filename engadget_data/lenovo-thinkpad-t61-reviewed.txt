They sure seem to have found a lot to like in this one, giving it their Editors' Choice award and calling it the "best business laptop for those who love widescreens." In particular, they found it to out perform all but HP's massive Pavilion HDX in their tests, aided by its top-end T7700 Core 2 Duo processor and NVIDIA Quadro NVS 140M graphics, which should even be enough for business-types to get in a bit of gaming. About the only fault they could find with it was the included 56-Wh battery, which could only eek out an hour and 57 minutes during their DVD rundown test (higher capacity batteries are available). The T61's battery also isn't compatible with those from earlier T60s, so anyone 's that's stocked up on those won't be able to carry 'em over to their new laptop.[Thanks, Jacob]
