       Velodyne sure has been keeping quiet of late, but now we know why -- it's been saving it all up for a CEDIA extravaganza. From the top, it'll be introducing the Optimum-8, 10 and 12 subs, which feature up to 1,200-watts (RMS) of amplification, interactive front panel displays and an automated, one button 7-band equalizer. Moving on, we've got the in-wall SC-600, Class D-powered DEQ-R (in 8-, 10-, 12- and 15-inch models) and the small(er) Impact line, which boasts a 6-inch forward firing driver and an 8-inch down-firing passive driver. Expect prices and availability to surface within a few days.
