For those who still enjoy rocking it 20th century style, it'll also pick up plain old AM and FM radio stations. The unit itself measures a countertop-friendly 14.5 x 9.75 x 4.75 inches and packs two sets of auxiliary inputs that'll let you jack in just about any audio device you like (like, say, a Stiletto, perhaps?), as well as S-Video and composite video outputs in case you want to do more than just listen to DVDs. List price is a hefty $599 US, but Polk knows you're good for it.[Via Talk Radio Nation]
