We've heard rumors about an HD DVD player from Onkyo for some time, and there was even a mention of it at CES this year. Our friends over at FormatWarCentral have discovered a few details that we find very interesting in an otherwise obscure Onkyo post on a UK site. Apparently, Onkyo expects to launch the DV-HD805 this autumn, and it will be based on the Toshiba HD-XA2 player -- with a few yet-to-be mentioned tweaks. We are excited to see another HD DVD player on the market, but we hope it's not just a re-badge of the HD-AX2. Before any format fanboys get too rabid, the Onkyo rep also mentioned that officially Onkyo supports both formats.
