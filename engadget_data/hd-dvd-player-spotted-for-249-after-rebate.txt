For those who aren't familiar with Costco, they like to change the model numbers, so this is the same as the HD-A2 to everyone else. While $50 off the MSRP isn't the best deal we have seen without a rebate, at this price anyone trying to decide between an upconverting DVD player and HD DVD, has a really easy decision to make..
