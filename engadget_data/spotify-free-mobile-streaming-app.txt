If you can't bring yourself to shell out $10 a month for the privilege of enjoying your Spotify playlist on the go, we have good news for you: the company is apparently developing a free version of its streaming service for mobile devices. This report comes from the Wall Street Journal, which cites "people familiar with the matter." The publication also shares that three major music companies have signed licensing deals for the new service. Further details, of course, are scant, but the free mobile streaming will almost certainly be ad-supported, echoing the format of Spotify's unpaid desktop version. We'll likely know more soon, as an event is scheduled for next week in New York.
