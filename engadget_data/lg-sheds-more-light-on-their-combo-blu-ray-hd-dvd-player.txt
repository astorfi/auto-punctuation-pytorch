 Nomention of "Ultra-Multi", but LGhas confirmed their plans to build a combination HD-DVD/Blu-ray player, and make it available this fall. What this willdo for the next generation DVD market however, is unclear. The analyst quoted in the article sounds thrilled, but howmany early adopters will get burned if the format battle drags on endlessly? Theres also the question of how much sucha player will cost, after including both technologies plus licensing fees. The more I think about it, themore pessimistic I get; a "holy grail" device that comes to market late, heavy on price and short on featuresis the usual outcome. Maybe we're just reading into the possibility of high profile technology bustsÂ  too much, anyonecare to provide a glass half full perspective?
