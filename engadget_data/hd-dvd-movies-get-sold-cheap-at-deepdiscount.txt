Merely hours after Amazon decided to whack 50-percent off of 150 different HD DVD titles, DeepDiscount has now stepped up to the plate and is offering up a smorgasbord of flicks for $11.06 and up. A whole chunk are pegged at $12.20, and amazingly, many of those bargain bin wonders are actually worth watching. For you big spenders out there, you'll find a whole 'nother gang crowding up the $15 to $18 range, but make sure you don't go overboard, okay?[Via Electronic House, thanks Nfinity]
