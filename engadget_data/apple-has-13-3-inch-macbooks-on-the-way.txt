We've been operating under the assumption that Apple will calltheir new consumer line of laptops MacBook, as opposed to thepro line of MacBook Pro. Maybe we just spend too much time thinking about Apple's naming schemes, and this probablydoesn't change anything. We should hopefully know for sure before long, though, since it is claimed that Apple willstart selling these new laptops in June. (Image by William W from our WWJD 3 contest.)
