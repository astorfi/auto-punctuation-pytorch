	Sony Ericsson's forthcoming flagship was already looking like a very handsome slice of smartphone, but it's even more dashing in these thankfully crystal-clear shots. This latest leak give us a nice close-up of the matte-finished monolith, showing off a dedicated camera button, HDMI port, built-in battery and the conspicuous absence of microSD storage. The LT26i is rumored to possess a 720 x 1280 resolution spread across a 4.3-inch touchscreen, with a dual-core processor behind it. Sony Ericsson also looks to have finally taken the plunge with front-facing shooters, with an as-yet unspecified camera embedded above the screen, while a stylish glassy button bar below seems to run right through the device. Take a peak at the still-codenamed Nozomi -- uncovered -- after the break, or check out a full 360-degree runaround at the source below.
