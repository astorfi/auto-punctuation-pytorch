 Netflix will reveal its financial results for the second quarter tomorrow (better known as the one before they raised prices) and already we've got a juicy rumor about the company signing up Dreamworks Animation flicks for streaming. Bloomberg reports that Netflix would replace HBO's agreement for these movies, while The Hollywood Reporter's sources indicate HBO actually offered to end its deal early after signing up movies from Summit Entertainment and because it anticipates more animated flicks from other studios. If the rumors are on target, with Dreamworks also reporting earnings this week we're likely to hear confirmation soon. Besides that, Hacking Netflix also has the low down on a couple of other Netflix tidbits, including that it's recently spun off DVD operations are moving to their own offices, and a rumor that Weeds creator Jenji Kohan is working on an original show for the service. The over/under on Engadget Netflix posts this week is set at 3.5.
