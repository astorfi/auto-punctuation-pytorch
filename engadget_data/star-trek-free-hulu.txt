 That's essentially the message Hulu's sending in making the entirety of the Star Trek series free for everyone, starting today through the end of March. That's not just Shatner-era Star Trek, but literally all of it: the Original Series, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise. Normally this bountiful selection of space operatics would only be available for Hulu Plus paid subscribers, but Hulu's going crazy in celebration of Shatner's 82nd birthday. With all those hours of medium-octane space drama ahead of you, you could just go crazy and marathon until the offer expires come April! We wouldn't suggest that, though.
