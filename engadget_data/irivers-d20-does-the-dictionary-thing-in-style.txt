So along with ebook reading, organizer functions and general dictionary fun, this device sportsMP3, WMA, OGG, line in and FM radio recording, and lets you browse your pics on a generous 4.3-inch 480x272 color LCD.Too bad it doesn't rock any video formats, but it's a nice step up for the usual electronic dictionary crowd.[Thanks, .midnight]Read
