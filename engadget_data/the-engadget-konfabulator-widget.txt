Shout outs to Akram Hussein who's cooked up a Dashboard Konfabulator widget for feeding on the
Engadget newsfeed in style. You can download the widget
here. Big thanks, yo!


Update: Listen up people — strike that, reverse it. It's a Konfabulator widget… but if anyone wants
to make us a Dashboard widget to complete the collection, we promise we'll never confuse the twain in our haste ever
again. Pinky swear.
