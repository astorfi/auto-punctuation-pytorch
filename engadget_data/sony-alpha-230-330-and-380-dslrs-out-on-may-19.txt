It looks like the cameras in question will be the raison d'être of a press event that the company has scheduled for the 19th of May, so you may just be getting your hands on the video-less wonders in short order -- y'know, if that's what you're into. With prices starting at €549.99 (around $738) and going up from there, these bad boys feature a revised UI, HDMI out, and Memory Stick Duo support. And if you think that's exciting, wait'll you get a load of the spec breakdown! Peep it after the break.[Via Photo Rumors]
