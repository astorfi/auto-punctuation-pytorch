 Now that we've got the dates and prices sorted, all you need to do is get yourself to the nearest AT&T store (or one of those source links below) today to pick up either of Nokia's Windows Phone 8 handsets (Lumia 920 for $100, or the Lumia 820 for $50) or HTC's Windows Phone 8X, priced along the same lines as Nokia's bigger smartphone. Not a fan of Ma Bell? Then you'll can wait it out with Verizon, which starts taking preorders for both the Lumia 822 and 8X from today.
