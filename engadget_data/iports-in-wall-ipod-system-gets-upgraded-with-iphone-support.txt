More specifically, each of the firm's five models features a re-designed faceplate that plays nice with Apple's older cellphone and all existing touch-wheel iPods. Aside from that, you're still looking at the same whole home approach to distributing iPhone / iPod content, and while we can't say for sure that the iPhone 3G will work outright, there's nothing that a little Dremel can't fix.
