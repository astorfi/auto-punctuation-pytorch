It's only been out for a couple of days, but the first few reviews of the
Audiovox SMT 5600 (known as the
SPV C500, the i-Mate Smartphone 3, the Qtek 8010, and the
Dopod 565 in other corners of the globe) have started trickling out. Besides being the smallest handset to run on
Microsoft's Smartphone operating system, the SMT 5600 is also the first with the new mobile version of Windows Media
Player 10, and PC Mag gives it high marks for its good battery life and tight integration with Outlook (not to mention
the built-in digital camera and Bluetooth). Available now from AT&T Wireless.
