 Looks like Universal heard our plea for a little sweetener in its November 14th HD DVD lineup, announcing that King Kong will feature the same U-control features seen in Fast and the Furious 3: Tokyo Drift and Miami Vice. Using HD DVD's HDi interactivity layer, viewers can watch behind the scenes footage and cast interviews while the movie plays in the background, and a "My Scenes" bookmarking feature to easily come back to favorite scenes later. Kong will also be a pack-in with the Xbox 360 HD DVD player, which will be the first place buyers can get a copy. We're still holding out hope for more -- like a TrueHD soundtrack maybe? -- but its obvious that Universal sees it will need more than just excellent 1080p picture quality to convince customers to choose HD DVD this holiday season.
