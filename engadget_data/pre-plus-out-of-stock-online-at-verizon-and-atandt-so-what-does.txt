 We can all agree that some fresh product is desperately overdue out of Sunnyvale, so the eternal optimists in us want to believe that the departure of the Pre Plus from Verizon's and AT&T's warehouses right now means that we can expect new goodies soon. Of course, it's entirely possible that the two carriers just happened to run out of phones at the same time and that fresh batches are on their way, so it's too early to say these phones are out for the count; then again, when you consider that Sprint somehow still sells the Centro, anything's possible. For what it's worth, both carriers' stores are still stocking the phones, so if you absolutely must have a Pre Plus right now, you're in luck -- you're just going to have to put on something besides your underwear and leave the house to get it. Sorry!
