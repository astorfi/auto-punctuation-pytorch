In a Chinese invitation we received earlier today, Foxconn Technology Group and Mozilla confirmed an upcoming press conference that will detail and make their Firefox OS partnership official. The event will take place in Taipei next Monday (just a few days before Computex truly kicks off), and it'll see Mozilla welcome the 19th partner to its Firefox OS alliance. There isn't much meat in the email, though we did spot a little hint in the rundown that says one or more of the "latest" Firefox OS products will be on show. Whatever they may be, we shall keep an eye out for them as soon as we land in Terry Gou's back garden next week.
