They're followed by RIM and Nokia, who are now in a tie for a distant fourth place at 8.3%, and Apple, which is said to have a five percent share. Of course, these stats are just part of a broader report, but the rest of the results are a bit less surprising -- Verizon and AT&T are virtually unchanged in their position as the number one and two carriers at 31.1% and 25.2%, respectively, and the total number of subscribers in the country now stands at 234 million, of which 63.7% send text messages, 30.1% use a web browser, and 28.6% use downloaded apps.
