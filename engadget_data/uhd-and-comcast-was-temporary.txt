       It appears that now that the Olympics are over so is Universal HD's carriageon Comcast. Comcast customers are reporting in that they no longer receive Universal HD and when one reader calledin the customer service rep indicated that the channel was just temporary for the Olympics.I hope you guys enjoyed Battlestar Galactica in HD while it lasted. Adversary D wants to know where he is supposed to goto enjoy Knight Rider in HD? He's welcome to come to my house and watch it via DIRECTV!Did anyoneelse suddenly lose Universal HD or do you still have it after receiving it for the Olympics?Thanksfor the tip Adversary D!
