 Once Japan's own CTO brought a lappie to American shores under the Everex moniker, we knew a similar desktop wasn't too far behind, and now it looks like the company has waited for Vista to make its "debut" before loosing them Stateside. The IMPACT series desktops are admittedly lacking in the style department, but they do offer average components for everyday computing if you're not concerned with fashion, and Everex even gives the polarized CPU camp a choice between Intel and AMD. The GE6315J houses a 1.86GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 1GB of RAM, dual-layer DVD burner, 8-channel onboard audio, four USB 2.0 ports, audio in / out, VGA out, Ethernet, Intel's 945G Express integrated graphics set, Vista Home Premium, 250GB hard drive, a ho hum collection of peripherals, and a 19-inch WXGA+ LCD to finish it off. The AMD-powered GM3515J packs an Athlon 64 3500+, NVIDIA's GeForce 6100 graphics set, up to 160GB hard drive, two USB 2.0 ports, and otherwise mimics its Intel-based counterpart. As expected, both of these units are slated to go on sale tomorrow alongside Windows Vista, and while no hard prices were available, you can tell by looking that these shouldn't demand too steep a premium.[Via Impress]
