Shots have emerged of these here fun looking little sliders, apparently coined the 5200 and 5300. Specs on the devices are largely hearsay at this point, but here's what we're being told: 1.3-megapixel cam with LED flash, 160 x 128 display (presumably guaranteeing Series 40), and dedicated music controls on the slightly higher-end 5300. Nothing to get terribly worked up about, but with Nokia seemingly throwing a majority of its energy at its S60-based Nseries devices, it's always refreshing to see our Finnish friends pour some love into the low end.[Via SlashGear]
