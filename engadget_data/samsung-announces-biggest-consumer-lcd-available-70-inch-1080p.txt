  Just when we found the perfect spot to put the Sharp 65-inch LC-65D90U LCD, Samsung has announced their 70-inch LCD will be available to consumers during the first half of 2007. Sporting a full 1080p resolution, 2000:1 contrast ratio, sub-8ms reponse time and 120hz refresh rate, Samsung thinks it will compete will with similar large plasma HDTVs. While LG still has the crown of the biggest LCD we've heard about, this will be the biggest one actually available. It will be shown publicly for the first time on the 23rd at the International Meeting on Information Displays (IMID) 2006 in Korea, which is exactly far off enough to get a plane ticket, fly across the Pacific and check it out before you order one.
