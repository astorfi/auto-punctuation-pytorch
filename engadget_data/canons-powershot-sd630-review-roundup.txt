The $400 3x zoom camera sports a whopping 3-inches of LCD, andwhile it's hard to hate on that much screen, it doesn't seem to leave much room for the controls, which end up being abit cramped. Luckily the photos are great, and if you're really hung up on the image stabilization you can alwaysspring for the SD630's older brother, the SD700 IS.Read - CNETRead - DigitalCamera TrackerRead - Digital PhotographyReviewRead - Digital TrendsRead - Lets Go Digital
