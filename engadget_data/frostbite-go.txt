It appears that while EA's making claims that its Frostbite 3 game engine (which powers next-gen's Battlefield 4) can't run on Nintendo's Wii U, the game publisher is also working on bringing "true Frostbite experiences to all major mobile platforms." The Frostbite website details the initiative as "Frostbite Go," and calls it "one of our most exciting current projects."


Without directly saying "Frostbite 3," the blurb details Frostbite Go as aimed at "empowering EA game developers" -- in so many words, it sounds like Frostbite Go isn't meant for indies as much as it's meant for EA studios used to working with Frostbite. Battlefield 4 will be the first game from EA to launch using the latest iteration of Frostbite, which isn't a huge surprise considering that BF4's developed by the same folks who develop the engine (EA DICE). It's expected to arrive this fall on both current and next-gen platforms.
