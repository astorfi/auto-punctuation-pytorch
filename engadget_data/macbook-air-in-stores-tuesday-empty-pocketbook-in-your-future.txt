Of course, old Jobsy has already said as much ("two weeks"), but the Boy Genius is making extra-dextra sure that everyone knows they really will be on the floor come next week. If you're lucky enough to be employed by Apple as a "Genius," then you'll be getting some Air training tomorrow. Hey, it's never too late to sign up and instantly be accepted for a job... oh, wait, it probably is.
