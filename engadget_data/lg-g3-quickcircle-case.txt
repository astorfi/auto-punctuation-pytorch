LG hasn't officially revealed the G3 yet, but its new QuickCircle case gives you a pretty good idea of what the device can do. The QuickCircle, which the South Korean company just announced, features a circular cutout in front so you can access the UI's lock screen, take pictures, listen to music and even make calls even if you don't open up the case. It has other things going for it other than its tiny window, as well, such as Qi wireless charging standard compatibility and a Smart Lighting feature that emits a soft glow within the cutout whenever you get a call or a message. Next month, LG's also releasing an SDK for the case, and if you're lucky, someone out there has a brilliant idea just waiting to be made.
