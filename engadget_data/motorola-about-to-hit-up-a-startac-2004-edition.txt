Man, those were for serious the good old daysâ€”so it's
nice Motorola wanted to play up the nostalgia factor and hit us with a 2004 edition of their classic StarTAC handset.
It will apparently feature a single 128x160 pixel 262k color display, up to 190 minutes talk and 185 hours standby
time, and maintains that classic chic physique at only 3.4 x 1.8 x 0.78-inches in size (in the smaller-batteried
version, presumably). No word yet on networks or availability, but as per usual, we'll keep you up to the minute.
