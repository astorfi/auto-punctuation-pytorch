Neither of these are going to be available for a while, but images and specs for a couple of new HTC phones have
popped up online.


 The HTC Hermes (pictured above) is a Pocket PC Phone that looks a lot like a successor to the
HTC Wizard. It's listed as
having quadband GSM/GPRS/EDGE/UMTS (and possibly HSDPA), a QWERTY keyboard, a QVGA, 320 x 240 pixel LCD touch screen,
802.11b/g WiFi, a 416MHz processor, a 2.1 megapixel digital camera (with flash), and a second video camera on front for
making video calls. Should be out sometime around May of next year.


 The HTC Star Trek (pictured at right) isn't much to look at, at least not yet, but this one's a clamshell that's
supposedly going to be about the same size as the
Motorola RAZR V3 (just
slightly thicker) and have quadband GSM/GPRS/EDGE, a QVGA, 320 x 240 LCD, Bluetooth, a two megapixel digital camera
(with flash), 64MB of RAM, up to 128MB of ROM, and a microSD memory card slot. Should drop March of 2006.
