 If you though TiVo and EchoStar were judged, settled, and ready to go their separateways, think again. The $74 million windfallTiVo just got from their patent infringement suit against EchoStar is about to get all RIM / NTP on us. EchoStarfiled a request late last year with the USPTO to reexamine TiVo's famous 1998 TiVo-secret-sauce patent (otherwise knownas patent #6233389 for a "multimedia time warping system") -- almost two years into the case, notbefore -- and apparently they're now pressuring the judge presiding to stay judgment until word comes back fromthe patent office. Being that TiVo won the trial by jury and the judge has yet to hand down the final verdict, EchoStarcan continue pressuring to stay the case until the patent has been reviewed, and accepted or rejected as novel /un-novel, then undoubtedly re-petitioned continuously by one party or the other until the system breaks down andsomeone -- like the judge -- gives up on the process. Will TiVo's judge be as harsh and unforgiving as James Spencer was with RIM in their battle with NTP? That's yet tobe seen, but in a release on the judgment, EchoStar called the jury's verdict "the first step in a very longprocess" and expressed their belief that "the decision will be reversed either through post-trial motions oron appeal." In other words this has the makings of yet another patent-suit fiasco, and frankly we'd like none ofit.[Thanks, Ryan]
