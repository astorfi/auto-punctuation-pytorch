Sure, we showed you pretty much everything you wanted to know about the company's second slate, but if you want more, they've got you covered. You can feast your eyes on demos of Garageband, FaceTime, iMovie, as well as other first party apps for the new iPad -- these 14 videos should keep you occupied for a while. If you want to properly prepare yourself for Friday, hit the source link to watch them all.
