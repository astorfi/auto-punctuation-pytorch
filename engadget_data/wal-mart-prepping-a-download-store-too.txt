       We've heard rumblings for a while -- and Wal-Mart's purported intense opposition to the iTunes Movie Store might've had something to do with it as well -- but now the rumors are coming hot and heavy in regards to a movie download store from the retail giant. First off, we have a new job listing from Wal-Mart in regards to a business manager for a digital video division who can sort out "pricing strategies to maximize market share." And then there's a report by CNN Money citing "sources" that say Wal-Mart is hoping to launch in the coming months, and is currently debating pricing structures. (If only they had a business manager who could sort out "pricing strategies to maximize market share.") Wal-Mart is also supposedly considering in-store kiosks, and a deal to allow for a free digital version of a movie with the purchase of a physical DVD, or at least for a few dollars more. Wal-Mart of course wouldn't confirm or deny these report, but dropped some big juicy hints such as: "Our customers want to watch movies and they want to be able to make the choice when and how they want to view them." Right now it looks like a natural move for Wal-Mart, and we sure wouldn't complain if they manage to drive prices down -- as seems to be their way -- but we'll let them and that business manager figure things out for now while we head over to iTunes for a bit of The Princess Diaries.[Via Techcrunch]Read - Wal-Mart sets stage for digital actionRead - Wal-Mart moves on digital movie downloads
