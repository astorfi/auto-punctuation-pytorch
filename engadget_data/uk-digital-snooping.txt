  The UK Government revealed on April Fools' Day that it's planning to offer law enforcement agencies unprecedented access to private communications. British Cellphone operators and ISPs will be required to harvest packet data -- containing the parties to all calls, emails and social media communication, as well as the time and duration of each message. The proposals will be officially unveiled on May 9th, as part of the Queen's Speech, despite a similar bill being opposed by the current administration whilst it was in opposition. It has already drawn bitter criticism from backbench members of the Government, civil liberties advocates and privacy experts, who believe the move is fundamentally flawed. It's currently timetabled to be added to the statute books by 2013, unless, you know, common sense gets in the way.
