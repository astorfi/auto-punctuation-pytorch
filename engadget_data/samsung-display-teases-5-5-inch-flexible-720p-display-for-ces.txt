Well, in addition to our previews, Samsung Display -- a recent spinoff from the Korean giant -- has let it be known that it'll demo a 5.5-inch flexible 720p display at this year's tech mecca. Keep this in mind, though: what we'll see is merely a component that could one day find its way into a smartphone, rather than a finished product that's meant for consumers. Samsung Display also wants to ground your expectations that while its screens bend without breaking, they're not designed to roll up. Nonetheless, we're looking forward to getting our grubby mitts all over 'em as we dream of what might be.
