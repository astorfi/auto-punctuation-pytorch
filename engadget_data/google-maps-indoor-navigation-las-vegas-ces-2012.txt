Turns out, Google (smartly) mapped out lots of Las Vegas before the annual Consumer Electronics Show, as many of our contemporaries have pointed out over at The Sands and Venetian. We also confirmed that indoor mapping worked here at CES Unveiled, and given the dearth of wireless connectivity inside most of Vegas' frequented locales, it's certainly a blessing that we'll be taking advantage of.
