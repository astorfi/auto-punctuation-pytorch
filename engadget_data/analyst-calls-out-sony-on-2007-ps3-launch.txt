Sony keeps on saying they're gonna push that there
PlayStation 3 out the door in
Spring of 2006, which we're all hoping for somewhere near as
much as we actually think it's maybe just wishful thinking. But in an Electronic Arts earnings call memo, a senior
Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst predicted Sony may delay the console until 2007, and instead ride that
$100 slim PS2 into the sunset until then. While we're
positive this would be a certain form of corporate seppuku for Sony, we wouldn't exactly put it past them to
hold out, especially considering the hard PR front they've crafting around this undeniably unwavering faith in the
final product we consumers will be so blessed as to own.
