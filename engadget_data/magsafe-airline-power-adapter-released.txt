       As Dan mentioned it looks like Apple finally gave in to all our whining and has released an adapter which allows you to power (not charge-the seats don't provide enough juice) your MacBook on those long haul flights-that is, if you're lucky enough to be seated somewhere with access to an EmPower plug. While sixty clams is considerably steep for what is essentially a piece of wire and an adapter plug, frequent flyers will finally be able to continue their always-on existence while cramped between the fussy baby and overly-friendly guy. On a bit of a more editorial note; is this the first specialized adapter Apple has released? I can't think of any other situations in which Apple has provided anything other than the normal desktop adapters, leaving third parties to fill in the market.
