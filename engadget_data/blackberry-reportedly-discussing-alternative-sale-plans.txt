BlackBerry may have a failsafe in the event that its deal with Fairfax Financial doesn't pan out. Reuters claims that the smartphone maker is now holding early, just-in-case sale discussions with multiple large technology firms that include Cisco, Google, Intel, LG, Samsung and SAP. It's not clear which companies are serious about bidding, but they're reportedly interested in BlackBerry's servers and patents; unsurprisingly, they're not so keen on the ailing smartphone business. None of the involved companies are corroborating the rumor, and there's no guarantees that BlackBerry will sell itself to any suitor besides Fairfax. If there's another big takeover announcement in the future, though, you'll know you had fair warning.
