Facebook likes and shares can give you a pretty good idea of how popular your posts are, and since sharing is essential for social media, they can be considered as two of the website's key features. Apparently, though, they're more like extra metrics making success much harder to measure for advertisers, as people accidentally click them (especially the Like button) all the time. So, the social network has decided to drop your likes and shares from their Cost per Click (CPC) measurements, making them less valuable than they are today.



When the company's new API rolls out in the coming weeks, advertisers will see adjusted CPCs that only count clicks leading you to an external website, to install an app or to watch a video on another domain. While the two buttons don't matter as much anymore, Facebook maintains that they're not completely useless either: "If an ad has lots of likes and shares, that's a signal of high-quality content being delivered to the right people." Besides, they're probably still as important to you and a good indicator of success for company, celebrity and pseudo-celebrity pages.
