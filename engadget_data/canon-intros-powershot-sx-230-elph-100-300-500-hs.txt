The quartet enjoys the 12.1 megapixel HS (High Sensitivity) sensor, an improved variant of the ones introduced a year back with the S90 and G11. In fact, the ELPH nomenclature has nixed "digital," "SD," and "IS" in favor of the more simplistic (but still elongated) "ELPH HS." So without further ado, the PowerShot ELPH 500 HS features a 3.2-inch touch panel screen, 4.4x optical zoom, ultra-wide angle 24mm lens with optical image stabilization, and color options including siiver, brown, and pink. The ultra-slim ELPH 300 HS has a 2.7-inch LCD, image stabilization, 4x zoom and a 24mm wide angle lens. On the lower end of the spectrum, the 100 HS comes in five colors, has a 4x optical zoom, a 3-inch LCD, and a 4x optical zoom -- otherwise, it shares many features of its bigger 300 HS brother. Meanwhile, the (non-ELPH) SX230 HS has a 14x zoom, GPS, and a 3-inch LCD. Price and release date? All are due in March (the 100 HS in the beginning of March, the rest by the end), with the 100 / 300 / 500 HS going for $199.99, $249.99, and $299.99, respectively, and the SX-230 for $349.99.
