The BBC and Twitter deepened their alliance today with the announcement of #BBCTrending, a new initiative to promote original video content through the Twitter Amplify program. A series of short videos produced by BBC Global News and hosted by Anne-Marie Tomchak is set to debut on the social network this fall, providing analysis of trending topics in the form of video clips embedded in promoted tweets. In Tomchak's words, the endeavor aims "to decipher why and how trends are happening on social media around the world." Over the past few months, Twitter has inked a number of deals with broadcasters like ESPN and A&E to promote their videos in tweets, though the BBC partnership is the first time original content has been made specifically with Amplify in mind. To get a glimpse of what #BBCTrending has in store, check out the video after the break.
