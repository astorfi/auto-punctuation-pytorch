This isn't just a misprint, we ran the config through Lenovo's site and sure enough, the entry level X200 price drops from $1,434 to $1,364 after selecting the biggie SSD. Hell, you'd likely pay that much for the SSD alone as the 64GB SSD lists for an $830 premium. Reader Sunil already has his order in so you'd better hurry up and do the same -- it won't be long before Lenovo wises up to the situation. Update: Well, it was fun while it lasted, the 128GB SSD option is now gone, completely gone at any price. Do let us know if Lenovo honors those orders.[Thanks, Tobias W. and Sunil]
