The tipster claimed to be a Microsoft insider, but used a .ovi email address. The video itself certainly looks polished, although it culls a couple of bits of footage from marketing clips that have been out for a while, including a futuristic segment from a Microsoft Office Labs promo. It's either a genuine leak revealing new handsets that look substantially different to the Sea Ray, or it's one of those silly Nokia-style manufactured leaks, or -- very possibly -- it's just a nicely edited bit of fakery from a fan. But, whoever made it, we think they have some style.
