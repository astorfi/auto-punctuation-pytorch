We knew the RIAA wasn't too happy about peeps
recording music off of their satellite radios, and now they're playing the mommy Congress card with the HD Radio
Content Protection Act of 2005. It would require device makers to implement "functionality" to automatically delete
your recordings after a certain amount of time, just like back in the good old days. Don't you remember? When they'd
come over to your house and erase your cassettes after a week or two, even though you'd recorded them from FM radio for
non-commercial use and were protected by the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992? Yeah, us neither. The law would also
restrict time shifting capabilities, in an effort to allow you to record what you're listening to, but to stop you from
pulling songs automatically from a schedule for later perusal. Lucky for us, the Consumer Electronics Association is
fighting back; saying that the RIAA is limiting innovation, which is a nice gesture seeing how, for the most part,
consumer electronics manufacturers usually seem to fall all over themselves trying to offer up new and more restrictive
DRM schemes.
