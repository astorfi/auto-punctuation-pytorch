Sure, nearly three years have passed since its inception, but there's nothing like a little (literally) impostor to conjure up memories of the not-too-distant past. Available now, the miniature Self-Destruction Button comes in black, white and green motifs, fits snugly in the palm of one's hand and even doubles as a keychain. This highly portable device ensures the instant vaporization of your person and most of your surroundings should you find yourself in some horrifically inescapable situation, or, something to that effect, anyway. Grab yours now for $26.94 -- Y3K is just around the bend![Via AkihabaraNews]
