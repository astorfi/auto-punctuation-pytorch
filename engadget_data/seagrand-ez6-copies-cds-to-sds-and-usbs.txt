Put a disc in the portable player, plugin a USB drive or SD card, and rip away. Of course, you won't have the usual conveniences of Gracenote integration andID3 tagging, but if you, say, pick up a CD in an airport kiosk and need to get it onto your digital audio player byflight time, this will get it done.
