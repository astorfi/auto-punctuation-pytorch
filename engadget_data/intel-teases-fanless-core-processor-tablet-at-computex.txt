Here on stage, at Computex, we saw one very slender (and as-yet unnamed) tablet that packs the aforementioned processors without the need for fans for cooling. Sure, we've seen fanless Windows 8 tablets with Clover Trail-based hardware, but never with the potency of Intel's Core processor series. Alas, slimline profile (and hybrid skills) aside, that's all we can say for the moment. We'll update if we manage to glean any more details from Intel.
