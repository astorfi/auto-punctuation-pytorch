 We can't ourselves confirm Impress's pseudo-confirmation, but according to PS3center's reading of an Impressreport, it sounds like like corporate executive managing director and senior vice president of Sony ComputerEntertainment Asia, Tetsuhiko Yasuda, said something about PlayStation 3 games being downloadable (nice) through Sony'ssupposed Hub service(nice!). Apparently this would be a concerted, controlled effort to combat game piracy in Asia, but hey, their newsystem (like every new system) is totally unbreakable and uncrackable, right, guys? Right? Anyway, we're taking thiswhole thing with a big grain of salt and keep you posted.[Via PS3center]
