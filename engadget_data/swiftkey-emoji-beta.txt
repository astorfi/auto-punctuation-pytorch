If you've been aching for more emoji on your Android device, the SwiftKey team has something right up your alley. The popular Android keyboard's latest beta brings more than 500 of the adorable symbols to your device of choice and can even autopredict emjois, just like it does for regular ol' words. What's more, the test-version also adds a dedicated number row in case you're one of the long-press averse. Of course, this is still a beta and your experience may vary once you side-load the APK. We tested the app on a Nexus 4 and found it was laggy to the point of being almost unusable, squashing our dreams of recreating Katy Perry's "Roar" video like a grape.
