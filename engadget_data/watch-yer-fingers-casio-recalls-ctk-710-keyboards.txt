The reported overheating cases have caused property and keyboard damage, but lucky for Casio and its customers, nobody's gotten hurt (yet). If you just so happen to be tickling these ivories, Casio urges you to quit jammin', unplug it, remove the batteries and ship it off for a free repair -- but if you're rocking so hard that you miss this message, we wish you and your digits the best of luck.
