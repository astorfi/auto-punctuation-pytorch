  Reimagining the Datacenter
   Traditionally, "balanced systems" such as rack servers, blade servers or micro servers have to be refreshed to maximize the performance of select subsystems such as CPU performance, memory, storage or the network. Today, with the help of Intel, hyperscale customers are leading a transformation of these "balanced" platforms toward rack scale architecture solutions that separate, and group server, storage and network systems, making them more modular and efficient. This transformation starts with sharing power and thermal components, and improving rack management to reduce operating costs, and will evolve to include high-bandwidth fabric interconnects such as Intel Silicon Photonics technology to enable complete disaggregation of racks to drive optimal flexibility for large scale data center deployments. Intel sees the evolution of rack design happening in three phases:

   · Physical Aggregation. All non-critical sheet metal removed and key components such as power supplies and fans taken out of individual servers and consolidated at the rack level. Savings are expected due to higher levels of efficiency and lower costs by reducing the number of fans and power supplies.

   · Fabric Integration and Storage Virtualization. Disaggregate and separate out the storage from compute systems with direct attached storage, and achieve higher utilization through storage virtualization. The compute and network fabric is the key technology that is enabling disaggregation of storage without impact to performance. Intel Silicon Photonics interconnects will enable higher speed connections between various computing resources within the rack, thus enabling the eventual disaggregation of server, memory, network and storage within the rack.

   · Future. Ultimately, the industry will move to subsystem disaggregation where processing, memory and I/O will be completely separated into modular subsystems, making it possible to easily upgrade these subsystems rather than doing a complete system upgrade.   Benefits of rack scale architecture include increased flexibility, higher density and higher utilization leading to a lower total cost of ownership. Based on the needs of cloud service providers and large hyper-scale data centers, Intel is developing a reference design that utilizes Intel technologies and allows a range of solutions for OEM providers to develop and deliver racks.

   Intel rack scale architecture will include a suite of innovative technologies such as: Intel's leading Xeon and Intel Atom SoCs for servers, storage, and networking; Intel Ethernet switch silicon for distributed input/output; and Intel's new photonic architecture, based on high-bandwidth, Intel® Silicon Photonics Technology. Silicon Photonics Technology will enable fewer cables, increased bandwidth, farther reach and extreme power efficiency compared to todays copper-based interconnects. Intel demonstrated a mechanical prototype of this new rack architecture earlier this year and will publish a complete reference architecture optimized for deployment as a full rack to make it easy for system builders and customers to adopt.

   One implementation of Intel's rack scale reference architecture is already taking place in China, as Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent and China Telecom are collaborating with Intel on Project Scorpio, an initiative that will deliver a physical aggregated rack consisting of the fan and power supplies in six zones within the rack, with the goal of demonstrating TCO savings  Intel Cloud Innovation Center in Beijing, China
