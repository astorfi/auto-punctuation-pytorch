We have no idea of what any of this means -- and we're not too sure Nokia really wants to suggest that its new flagship device is the cellphone manifestation of Twitchy McSanity here. You'll see what we mean -- video after the break.

P.S.- Are we the only ones who see this as a nightmarish dystopian remake of Pump Up The Volume? Is that just us? Okay.
