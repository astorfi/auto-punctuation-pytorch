It should shock no-one to hear that Frozen outsold every other piece of entertainment in the UK in 2014. Even so, the emphatic style with which it did so might surprise you. According to new figures from the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA), the Disney sing-along extravaganza racked up just over 4 million DVD and Blu-ray sales last year, beating the nearest competition, which included films, video games and music, by a huge margin. Its closest rivals were FIFA 15, which scored 2.6 million sales, and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, which shifted 1.8 million copies -- a stellar effort, considering they debuted at least six months after Frozen's release. The film's soundtrack even made the top 20, besting entertainment home-runs such as Destiny, Gravity and Watch Dogs. The numbers aren't perfect though; the ERA's data only includes physical film and video game sales, while its music figures account for digital sales too. Even so, were downloads fully embraced we doubt Elsa and friends would have been toppled from their icy throne.
