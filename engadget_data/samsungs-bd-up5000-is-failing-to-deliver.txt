Users of Samsung's latest dual format HD movie player are reporting a whole slew of problems including; inability to enjoy any multi-channel next-gen codecs, problems playing the latest titles like Resident Evil: Extinction, 3:10 to Yuma and Sunshine, and miscellaneous problems with 4:3 material and DVDs. If all the BD-UP5000 are having these problems, it's no wonder we haven't received our review unit from Samsung yet. Either way, you'd better believe we'll be watching this closely, because as it stands the BD-UP5000 is the worst device capable of playing Blu-ray discs released in recent history.**Update** Samsung has said that a firmware update to address the compatibility problems with current discs should be out in mid January. Also, Samsung plans to released a firmware update during Q2 2008 that will enable bitstream output of multi-channel Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD (both HR and MA).
