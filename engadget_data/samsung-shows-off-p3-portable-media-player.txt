As rumored way back in May, the device's touchscreen gets a haptic upgrade, but the size and resolution stay the same at 3-inches and 480 x 272. Otherwise, you can expect capacities ranging from 4GB to 32GB, built-in Bluetooth with A2DP support, an FM tuner, a mono speaker, support for all the usual audio and video formats and, of particular note, an all new interface complete with customizable widgets. No word on a price or launch date just yet, but Samsung will apparently have more to say about that when it gets even more official about the device at CES in January. Until then, you can hit up the links below for some more pics, including an ample supply of comparison shots.Read - Generation MP3Read - Le Journal du Geek
