The only problem? It's the same old Pearl, not the Pearl 2 everyone's salivating over. Whatever, though, we guess it'll be cool to flash this to your RIM fanboy and fangirl friends for the next few weeks while we wait for the next generation to come around. Get 'em now for the same $150 on contract as the originals.[Via Boy Genius Report]
