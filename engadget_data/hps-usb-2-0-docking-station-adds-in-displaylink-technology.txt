Now, it's hooking up with HP for the first time ever in order to introduce the USB 2.0 Docking Station with DisplayLink technology. The universal dock enables laptops to pass through audio, LAN and peripheral connectivity, and of course, it enables the laptop to expand its display onto a USB-enabled monitor without the need for graphics cards and the like. We can't tell you when or where it'll land, but you can have a gander at the read link for other hardware details.
