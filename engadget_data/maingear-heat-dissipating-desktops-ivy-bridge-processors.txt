Now it can reveal that -- alongside Intel's third-generation processors inside all of its desktops and laptops -- it's further updated two of its tower models. The F131 ($1,049), the middleweight option, now houses the same vertical heat-dissipating design found on Maingear's Shift model, alongside hot-swappable storage. It's followed by the Potenza ($899), the company's "mini-ITX gaming solution." It's 45 percent smaller than the F131 with the same heat dissipation design, but still capable of squeezing in NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 680 and support for a liquid cooling setup on the side. Phew. So pick your size, pick your processor and hit up the source for all the custom desktop options.

   Kenilworth, New Jersey – April 29, 2012 – MAINGEAR, a PC innovator and award-winning PC system builder offering custom desktops, notebooks, and workstations introduces 2 new desktops with vertical heat dissipation chassis design (VRTX Cooling Technology) and updates all desktops and notebooks with the new 3rd generation Intel Core processors.

 
   The MAINGEAR SHIFT was the first in the industry to offer a custom PC that rotates the internal components of the PC to leverage the natural tendency of hot air to rise. As it exhausts through the top vents, cool air is drawn in from the bottom of the chassis, keeping components cooler, limiting noise, and increasing overclocking and stability potential. This vertical heat dissipation design has won MAINGEAR a 2011 CES Design and Innovations award as well as numerous editors' choice awards. MAINGEAR is proud to offer two more desktops to create a family of desktops that offer vertical heat dissipation design with different chassis and performance selection grades.

   The well-known and award-winning MAINGEAR F131 has always offered a more traditional yet powerful mid-size tower solution for those looking for something smaller than the SHIFT with extreme performance at a lower price point. The new MAINGEAR F131 chassis will now offer a new micro ATX vertical heat dissipation design that is similar to the SHIFT, delivering on customer demand for VRTX Cooling Technology in a smaller footprint without compromise. The new F131 will support the latest technology, offer dual GPUs of any length, and includes a hot-swap, tool-less bay for quick data storage needs. In addition, options to select MANGEAR EPIC innovations such as the EPIC 120 CPU cooling as well as the EPIC T1000 will also improve the overall high performance PC experience. The F131 features a bold and clean 360 degree exterior design with a slot loading optical drive and the same refined aesthetics as its older brother, the SHIFT. With a 2.5mm thick, sand-blasted and anodized aluminum chassis and its 9.25"(W) x 19.17"(H) x 11.18"(D) smaller size, this system takes up 38% less space than the previous F131 design without compromising on performance. The starting at price for the new F131 is $1,049.

   The 3rd desktop to offer vertical heat dissipation solution is the new MAINGEAR Potenza, the world's first mini-ITX gaming solution designed for overclocking with a Digi+ VRM design found on larger, full-sized desktop motherboards. The Potenza offers a mini ITX custom desktop solution that is 45% smaller than the new F131, 76% smaller than the SHIFT, and offers an even smaller desktop solution with a smaller footprint design and no cables on four sides just like the new F131. The Potenza can accommodate graphic cards up to 10" including the latest NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680, support one 3.5" and two 2.5" drives, includes a 140mm Air Penetrator fan and also supports the EPIC 120 CPU liquid cooling that can be installed to satisfy needs of any enthusiasts or office. With the petite size of 7.4"(W) x 15.6"(H ) x 9.25"(D), the MAINGEAR Potenza's sleek design further increases the appeal of this unique computer form factor. The starting at price for the new MAINGEAR Potenza is $899.   If the plain black box isn't enough for you and more color is desired, exterior design can also be customized with different automotive quality paint options that are affordable or etched with name, artwork or logo. Combined with technology from MAINGEAR's EPIC Research Labs like the EPIC Audio Engine, EPIC T1000 phase change thermal material, and EPIC CPU liquid cooling, MAINGEAR's new custom desktop family rolls up to be one hell of a beast that runs silent, cool and powerful.

   Staying true to pushing performance, all of MAINGEAR's desktops: MAINGEAR SHIFT, F131, Potenza, VYBE and X-Cube along with the Alt and eX-L series notebooks offers the latest and fastest in custom computer technology including the new 3rd generation Intel® Core™ processor with the option to overclocked for more even more performance. Whether it's for serious multimedia or multitasking, PC enthusiasts can unlock a new level of PC experience with expert overclocks courtesy of MAINGEAR's decade of performance innovation.   "Intel's latest and most advanced 3rd generation Intel Core processors in MAINGEAR PCs are a terrific combination for serious PC enthusiasts to unleash their full potential. The overclocked 3rd Generation processor helps unlock a whole new PC experience." Said CJ Bruno, Intel VP, GM Americas. "MAINGEAR understands their customers want the best performance and we are excited that MAINGEAR is offering the new 3rd Gen Core processors for their new desktops."

   "We are very excited and offer the option for our customers to select a MAINGEAR desktop with heat dissipation solution in three different chassis size and performance levels." said Wallace Santos, CEO and Founder of MAINGEAR. "The new 3rdnd generation Intel® Core™ i7 3930K processor and Intel® Z77 Chipset, built in any of our desktops offer the ultimate gaming experience."
