The pink shuffle -- which may or may not be different than the hot pink model from the last-gen shuffles -- comes packaged with a $15 iTunes Gift Card, courtesy of Target, who is donating a portion of the proceeds to The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, totalling $25,000. Happily, the player maintains its $79 price tag, so barring an aversion to pink or cancer cures, you've really got no reason not to seek one of these out. They're only in retail stores, and there's no telling when supplies will run out.[Thanks, Kiwi616]
