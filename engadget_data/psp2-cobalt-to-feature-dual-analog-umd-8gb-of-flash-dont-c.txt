From the outset, we're kind of liking the look here, and there seems to be plenty of room for that dual analog setup everyone's been clamoring for. Plus the metal and ruggedized rubber build seems likable enough. Unfortunately, the inclusion of UMD, Memory Stick and 8GB of flash seems pretty far fetched -- either Sony loses the UMD and goes for all-downloadable games, or it sticks with its tried and true method of milking consumers on Memory Stick purchases, it's hard to imagine an all-in approach. Other dubious specs include a "200% Brighter Screen," and the more likely a/b/g WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0 and visual battery display. We're not banking on this one, and Sony's been pretty down on the topic in general, but hopefully these guys do actually pull something out before too terribly long.[Thanks, Dondy]
