The Satellite U405 (pictured), Satellite M305, Satellite M305D, Satellite A355, Satellite A305, Satellite L305 and Satellite L355 are all being refreshed today in order to cram in newer (read: zippier) Intel / AMD CPUs, face recognition software, USB Sleep-and-Charge ports, an eSATA combo port, built-in FM tuner and ATI Hybrid CrossFireX graphics in select models. Outside of a few expected increases in speed, capacity and capability, there's nothing here to really cheer about -- particularly if you were never hot with passion about the designs in the first place.
