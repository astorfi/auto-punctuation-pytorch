 Just in case you thought Disney's support of the Blu-ray format might be slipping, the company is taking its show on the road with an 18-city mall tour to promote the format. Disney's Magical Blu-ray tour, sponsored by fellow Blu-ray backers and experienced mall-tourers Panasonic, starts August 17th and aims to educate customers about the format with interactive demos of Blu-ray movies and hourly presentations on Blu-ray tech. While consumer confusion over high definition in general and the format war specifically is definitely a problem, we have a feeling that "education" will go a lot more smoothly once hardware prices drop a bit more. Check the link for dates the tour is coming near you, no word on if the HD DVD tour plans to crash any stops.
