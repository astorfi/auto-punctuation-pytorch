Luckily, the price is right: going for "as low as" $150, as expected. At 0.5-inches thick, and with a well-sized QVGA screen, the E62 isn't totally weak-sauce compared to its E61 high-end predecessor, but it does lack the fancy WiFi and UMTS of the E61. Plenty has already been said about the specs (EDGE, Symbian 9.1, the like), so we'll spare you this time around. You should be able to nab this one September 29th -- none too soon, to be sure.
