  Crawling the job posting boards over at Canonical turns up a pretty interesting position, one for a Business Development Manager (Ubuntu Phone OS). Now, we're not quite ready to jump to any conclusions here, but the wording of the listing is quite intriguing. The group is looking for a "business development lead to engage and develop strong relationships with industry partners in the run up to the launch of Ubuntu as a smartphone operating system," with the goal of "establish[ing] a commercial ecosystem around Ubuntu as a smartphone OS." Does this mean that Ubuntu is preparing to take on Android and iOS in the battle for smartphone supremacy (or, more likely, take on Windows Phone in a competition of also rans)? Honestly, we're not sure. The wording is quite vague, and it could simply be the company is referring to Ubuntu for Android. We've contacted Canonical for comment and we'll update if we get any clarification.[Thanks, Mo]
