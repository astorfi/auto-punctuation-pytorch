The HDD-less receiver was dubbed "breathtaking," ensuring that it'll look quite fine underneath your tele. As for setup, it was coined "a breeze," and the very informative on-screen guide was seen as a pleasure to use. As expected, high-definition quality was "sensational," though we can't help but shed a tear at the lowly amount of HD channels available at the moment. At any rate, those content with just a receiver (or simply unwilling to wait for a DVR version) should be plenty pleased with this one, but you can tag the read link below if you're interested in the full review.
