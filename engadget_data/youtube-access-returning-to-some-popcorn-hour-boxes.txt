It's limited to the hardware that are capable of running Flash, which Google notes as the key differentiation in their new TOS and will unfortunately keep out A-100/A-110s that could only handle an HTML version of the site. The YouTube app should show up right next to Revision3 and the others, go ahead and update those media streamer comparison charts we know you've been keeping handy.
