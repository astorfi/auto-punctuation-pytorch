Guess that explains the shuffle banner! So we also got
you hooked up on the new iPod Shuffle, too: their new flash based player, as we just found out, will come in 512MB and
1GB sizes (for $99 and $149, respectively), and can act as a USB 2.0 mass-storage device by taking off the cap on the
bottom. (Hasn't Apple learned anything about flash drives with caps?) It will have have no display as you can see
(we're on the fence about this), but it is interfaced with simpleÂ  play/pause, volume up/down, track foward/back
buttons, and a slider on the rear that engages the player and plays songs in order or shuffled. In that little 3.3 x
0.33 x 0.98-inch package you've also got a USB-rechargeable 12-hour battery. The whole thing weighs 0.78 ounces, and is
shipping now, yo. Not too shabby for a flash player!



 
 Thanks, guys. We?ll make sure not to do that.
