 
Got that song stuck in your head? You know, the song. Go ahead, hum a few bars, nobody's going to notice. "This was a triumph..." Bet it's in there now! Now, while you spend the next 6-8 weeks trying wrench that beautiful melody from you head, you can concentrate on the harm you've caused to innocent weighted companion cubes over the world, and think about making restitution. Take this homage built by Magnus Persson, for example: it allows the cube to fulfill a higher calling as a case for a VIA Epia EX1500G, and it looks pretty too -- it's almost like that little incident never happened!
