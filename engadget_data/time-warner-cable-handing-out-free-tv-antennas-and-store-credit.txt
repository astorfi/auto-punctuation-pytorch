Time Warner Cable may not be in a rush to end the CBS blackout, but it's not leaving subscribers out in the cold. The TV provider is now giving away a "limited quantity" of basic TV antennas in the Dallas, Green Bay, Los Angeles, Milwaukee and New York City regions. For those who don't snag a free antenna, the company is also offering $20 in credit toward buying a unit at certain Best Buy stores in those same cities. These sorts of stopgap measures aren't new, but they may provide some comfort to TWC viewers who aren't likely to watch CBS channels through cable anytime soon.
