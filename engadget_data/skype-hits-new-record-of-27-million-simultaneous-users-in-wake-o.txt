The latest evidence for this trend comes from Skype, who unveiled video calling on the iPhone a few days ago and yesterday managed to reach a new milestone in its history: 27 million users online at the same time. That comfortably overshadows the previous record, which wasn't even over 26 million, and while not all of those logged-in Skypers can be attributed to its FaceTime alternative, it's undeniable that the recent growth in Skype's customer base has been catalyzed by its introduction of video calling. And now that it's coming to Android phones and TVs of all creeds, that number should only continue to grow.
