Talk about cryptic teasers: Sony has just announced that Minecraft is coming to the PS4 at launch. And... that's about it. There's no other details. Still, those who want to build blocky worlds on next-gen consoles won't be limited to the Xbox One.


Update: Notch has chimed in after Sony's event with word that Minecraft will also reach the PS3 and PS Vita.
