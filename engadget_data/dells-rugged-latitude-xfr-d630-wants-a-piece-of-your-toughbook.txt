Built to meet MIL-STD 810F standards from the Department of Defense, this beast not only handles just about anything you throw at it, on it or inside it, but it also promises to provide "23-percent better system performance than the Panasonic CF-30." Furthermore, it boasts a 14.1-inch outdoor readable display (with optional touchscreen technology), a 2.0GHz T7250 or 2.2GHz T7500 CPU, up to 4GB of DDR2 RAM, a shock-mounted 80GB HDD (or a 32GB / 64GB SSD, if you prefer), integrated DVD burner, Intel's GMA X3100 graphics set, WiFi / Bluetooth and optional WWAN for good measure. You'll also find a 6-cell battery with ExpressCharge, a magnesium handle, a smorgasbord of ports and a starting weight of 8.9-pounds. Heck, Dell even gives you a choice of Black / Charcoal and Desert Tan color schemes, but you'll be handing over a minimum of $3,899 to pick up either.
