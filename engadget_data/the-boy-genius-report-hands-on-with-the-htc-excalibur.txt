Field report tidbits from Engadget's mobile insider, the Boy Genius.Ok fellow geeks, fanboys, nerds, phone fiends, and otherwise generally awesome Engadget readers. Excuse me if my typing is a little off I can't stop shaking. I just got a hands-on with the HTC Excalibur, and in all honesty, people are gonna have to watch out. This is the most responsive, fastest Windows Smartphone I have ever used. Everything was made to perfection. The device is metal and rubberized plastic which gives it a great feel in your hands, and the keys... oh my lord, the keys! They are firm but not hard, softly tactcile but not squishy. The touch bar is incredible: highly responsive and ingenious or, Boy Genius if you will. It also earns the right to be called a Q-killer because it basically kills the Q in size and usability. The EDGE performance is great -- no, it's not 3G, but the built-in Wifi helps make up for it. And the microSD and clear, great-sounding speaker don't hurt none, either. And now the moment you have all been waiting for, I give you KONG! Excalibur! Thanks be to E-Gadget.[Click on for pictures of the Excalibur next to the BlackBerry Pearl (8100), BlackBerry 8700, and a Nokia N73. -Ed.]

 Quite the nicely integrated power button.
