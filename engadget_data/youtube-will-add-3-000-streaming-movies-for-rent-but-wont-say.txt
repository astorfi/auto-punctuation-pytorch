More details are promised to come in another post later today, but right now the video page appears to have the same list of flicks we've seen before so the question of which studios will bite is still up in the air. The rest of the post also mentions the YouTube Next program to push new original content on the site with "much more to come" -- consider the week of Google I/O underway.

Update: Additional details have been posted on the YouTube Blog and are also after the break -- NBC Universal, Sony Pictures and Warner Bros. are the new studios YouTube is partnering with to add the 3,000 new and catalog releases, doubling the amount previously available. The pricing is $2.99/$3.99 for movies viewable via PC or Google TV (no other device support is mentioned) and the FAQ notes that YouTube supports resolutions up to 4K but "most" of the new additions are sadly in SD, a choice which is apparently up to its partners.

Update 2: The YouTube Movies page is updated now, as seen above. There's plenty of well known movies to be seen now replacing the catalog of older and indie movies that filled the page before. Rotten Tomatoes ratings integration is also front and center, while the Extras are on each movies individual page, but really just show a list of related videos on YouTube, while there doesn't appear to be a way to tell if a movies is one of the few in HD before you pay.
      

 

 		Show full PR text  Get more into movies on YouTube 		Here at YouTube, we can't get enough video. When it comes to movies, we're just as excited: YouTube hosts a great selection of movie trailers and showcases a variety of independent films in our Screening Room; last year we announced the ability to rent movies from Sundance Film Festival; and this year at Sundance we premiered Life in a Day, a documentary film about a single day on earth filmed by thousands of YouTube users, produced by Ridley Scott and directed by Kevin Macdonald. 		Today, we're announcing another step in our goal to bring more of the video you love to YouTube: the addition of thousands of full-length feature films from major Hollywood studios available to rent in the US at youtube.com/movies. In addition to the hundreds of free movies available on the site since 2009, you will be able to find and rent some of your favorite films. From memorable hits and cult classics like Caddyshack, Goodfellas, Scarface, and Taxi Driver to blockbuster new releases like Inception, The King's Speech, Little Fockers, The Green Hornet and Despicable Me. Movies are available to rent at industry standard pricing, and can be watched with your YouTube account on any computer. The new titles will begin appearing later today and over the coming weeks to www.youtube.com/movies, so keep checking back. 		But your movie experience won't begin and end with a single film. With 35 hours of video uploaded every minute to YouTube, there's a sea of content that can add to your movie experience. Many movie pages feature YouTube Movie Extras -- free behind-the-scenes videos, cast interviews, parodies, clips and remixes from YouTube's unique community of content creators. Movie pages also showcase reviews from Rotten Tomatoes, so you'll see feedback from critics before you decide what movie to get into. Over time we'll also be adding additional videos and features to YouTube Movie Extras so that you can get even more into movies on YouTube.
