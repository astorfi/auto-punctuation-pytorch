 Sharp's putting out a plethora of new devices at CES, and among them is an addition to its existing 3D DLP projectors called the XV-Z30000. It's a 1600-lumen 3D projector that throws a 1080p image on whichever wall you point it at, and keeps the quality up thanks to a 50,000:1 contrast ratio. Connectivity comes courtesy of dual HDMI inputs and its got home automation control compatibility from all the big players along with LAN control as well. The XV-Z30000 comes with two sets of 3D glasses, and will be available for $5,000 in March 2012.
