While the Auto Show's press preview events are winding down, it's time for the Automotive News World Congress to take over, and tonight it featured a sit-down with Elon Musk. During the interview, Musk answered questions about everything from, "Where is the Model X?" (coming this summer) to whether or not he's a good boss (The Wall Street Journal says no; Musk says "not all the time.") He said that he expects Tesla's production to reach millions of cars per year by 2025, which is part of the reason he's focusing on the Gigafactory -- more battery production will be needed first. ("If it doesn't drive down the cost of batteries, I should be fired," says Musk.) First, however, he expects the company will be profitable by about 2020. You can check out some of the quotes collected in tweets after the break, or read impressions posted by the Detroit Free Press, Autoblog or The Verge.
