What's new? It adds support for bicycle routing (something they've had on the desktop for a while now) and sharing of destinations via the usual array of mediums like email, Facebook, Twitter, and so on, but the most significant change might also be the smallest: the addition of a dedicated icon for Google Maps Navigation. The product is still in beta, but this seems like an early sign that it's starting to come of age -- and on a more practical level, this obviously makes it quite a bit easier to launch right into a route when you saddle up in the car. Anywho, Motorola, about that CLIQ update?
