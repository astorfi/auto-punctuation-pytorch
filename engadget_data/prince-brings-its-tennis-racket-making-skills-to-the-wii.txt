According to IGN, Prince has teamed up with Qualtech Global to produce the rackets, which will be available in your choice of three colors and will apparently be exclusive to Circuit City (at least for the time being), where they'll set you back $15 apiece. You'll have to make do with your imagination for a little while longer though, as the rackets won't be available until November 15th.[Via Crave]
