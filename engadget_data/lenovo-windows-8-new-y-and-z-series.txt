Today the company is introducing two new entries to its multimedia-focused IdeaPad Y Series. The 14-inch Y400 and 15-inch Y500 include an interchangeable HDD bay that users can swap out for dual graphics chips, extra storage space or an additional fan. Both models also sport dual-layer backlit keyboards, with a snazzy red tone peeking out from under the black chiclet-style keys.

 Processor options go up to a Core i7 Ivy Bridge chip, and discrete NVIDIA GeForce GT650M graphics are a configuration option. Like virtually every other product announced at IFA, these notebooks will run Windows 8, and though the 1,366 x 768 displays aren't touch-enabled, Lenovo says its touchpad is optimized for the Metro UI. Storage space maxes out at a 1TB hard drive and up to 16GB of SSD cached, and the machines offer up to 16GB of RAM. Pricing for the Y400 and Y500 starts at $649, and the laptops will go on sale in October. Meet us past the break for a look at the Z Series models.



 Finally, the company is welcoming two new IdeaPads to the Z Series. Lenovo positions these as "slim power" machines, and they're 25 percent thinner than standard laptops with a thickness of about 1 inch (26mm). The new Z Series will be available in two flavors: 14 inches for the Z400 and 15 inches for the Z500, and will come in four different colors. Specs are similar to what you'll see in other new IdeaPad models: up to Core i7 CPU, a 1,366 x 768 screen, optional NVIDIA GeForce GT645M graphics and up to 1TB of storage space. Both models are rated for up to three hours of battery life. The Z400 and Z500 will both go for $549. The Z400 will drop in November, while the Z500 will be available two months earlier, in September.
