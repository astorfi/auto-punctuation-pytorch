When will they learn?  XkPad has joined the legions
of game accessory manufacturers asking us to stand up and do something when we sit down to play videogames.  For
those of you who want to mix exercise with gaming, the device uses four pressure-sensitive sensors, two on the biceps
and two on the knees, along with a wireless radio belt.  Compatible with the PS2 and most fighting games, BodyPad
costs $80 and works with most fighting games.  Us?  We'll be the freaked out neighbors across the way
watching in bewilderment as you virtually gank your girlfriend.


[Thanks, Mike]
