Those getting the nod from Sony will be able to develops apps for use on the PS Vita, which is set to hit in February, along with the PS Suite -- that "hardware-neutral" framework that'll allow access from non-PlayStation branded products, including the Xperia Play, Tablet S and Tablet P, with the potential for third-party devices to come as well. The SDK uses the C# programming language, and doesn't require devs to have access to actual Sony hardware -- so don't expect a Vita to show up at your door anytime this year. Think you have what it takes to be a Sony dev? Hit up the source link to send 'em the word.
