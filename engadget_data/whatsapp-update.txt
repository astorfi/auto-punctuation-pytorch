We here at Engadget love app updates, especially when new features and functionality are involved. WhatsApp is doing this very thing with version 2.10.1, which was released today. The refresh offers a few pleasant additions, such as the ability to send multiple photos to someone at the same time, as well as the option to backup and restore your iCloud chat history. Lastly, it also includes URL schema support for third-party apps and is currently being offered for free. Head below to grab the link to an iTunes App Store near you.
