 
It's officially too late to send a gift basket now, but to celebrate our 2nd anniversary we'vebeen giving you the presents during seven days of giveaways. We did a Slingbox, RAZRwire, mPack P800, Squeezebox, MDA, and a SDA. Somepretty sweet prizes if you ask us (well, maybe not the RAZRwire), but today being our last day, well, we had to blowout the candles just right. So how would you like an Alienware Area-51 3550? We thought so. How do you win it? Bake usa cake! Yes, we're serious.

It's pretty simple. You bake us agadget-shaped or Engadget-themed cake, send us a picture (or pictures), and the winner (as judged by theeditors of Engadget) picks up an AlienwareArea-51 3550, courtesy of Intel and Alienware. Here are the specs:
