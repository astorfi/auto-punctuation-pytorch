Gone are the FCC documents' references to video calling, but when it comes to phones supporting HSDPA on the 850 and 1900 bands, we'll take pretty much whatever we can get right now. Pricing and availability will vary by region -- in fact, it appears Cingular only wants your cash right now if you go through a Premier account -- but with the CU500's better looks, similar specs (plus a color external display), and apparently lower price, we're not getting terribly worked up about it.
