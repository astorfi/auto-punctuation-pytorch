 XM and Sirius have already talked a bit about some of their post-merger pricing schemes, but it looks like that's not all they have in store, with Reuters now getting word of some additional changes coming once the deal is done. Specifically, the companies are now saying that they'll be offering a subscription package "priced 46 percent below current levels," along with an option for customers to buy packages of their favorite channels. While exact pricing is still unclear, the "a la carte" programming would apparently be available "within one year following the merger" -- whenever that actually happens.
