As expected, its customers will be unwrapping the 21Mbps HSPA+ version of the device, but sadly, the question remains as to how much it'll cost. While a leaked Verizon document evidently has this Android 4.0 flagship pegged at $300 on-contract, O2's left nary a mention about pricing. With a handful of carriers now firmly under this 4.65-incher's belt, it's time for others to defrost their Ice Cream Sandwich release plans.
