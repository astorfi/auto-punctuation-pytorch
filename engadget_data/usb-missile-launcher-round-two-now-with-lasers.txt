Fortunately our buddies at Engadget Chinese have found the Striker II, which comes with a Level 3 precision guidance system (whatever that means). It may have something to do with accompanying 3D software (pictured), although we don't quite get what that city in the background is all about, nor why the missiles are pointed toward the user -- so you may want to get that guidance system looked at before you aim it at your nearest enemy.[Via Engadget Chinese]
