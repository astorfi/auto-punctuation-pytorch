Working on The Engadget Show has afforded us the opportunity to travel all over, in search of the best tech stories we can sniff out. In our travels, we've encountered some amazing individuals who are using technology in exciting and unusual ways. They're the inspiration for our newest series, Peripheral Vision. The show is a weekly look at the people powered by technology: artists, scientists, musicians, broadcasters and others who have given us fresh perspective on the way we interact with our electronics.


We're kicking the series off with a bang, a magical ride around San Francisco in the Volkswagen Lightmobile with artist Eric Staller. You can check out that inaugural episode here. And for a view of what's to come, have a look at teaser trailer for the show below, featuring a sneak peak at a number of upcoming interviews. We're incredibly excited to bring this show to you. We hope you enjoy the ride.
