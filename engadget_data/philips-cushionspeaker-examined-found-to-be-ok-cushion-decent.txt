As our pals at Engadget Spanish found out first-hand at IFA, that combination actually delivers mostly as promised, but not without a few trade-offs. The good news is that speaker does seem to be of reasonable quality, and should be an improvement over most laptop speakers (the retractable USB cord is also a nice touch). On the downside, while the cushion is apparently suitably cushiony, the hard plastic surface isn't exactly the most conductive to keeping your laptop in place -- such are the perils of innovation. Hit up the link below for a closer look, and look for the CushionSpeaker to be available sometime soon (in Europe, at least) for â‚¬69, or just under $100.
