 In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line.
 
 The Aviator Travel Jib can give you the smooth camera moves to make your spectacle go from meh to marvel, while still being light enough to schlep around. At less than 3.75 pounds and 24-inches compacted, the device will tote anywhere but support up to six pounds, thanks to its sylphlike but rigid carbon fiber construction. It'll take your cinema cam or DSLR rig out to around six feet, and with its built-in fluid pan base, let you crane, track or truck to your heart's content. Pledge $400 and you'll get the jib, ballast, mounting hardware and a bubble level, while students can get the jib alone for $300. If that sounds like it could hit your mark, move fluidly past the break for the video.



 
  Previous Project Update: The Kick photo and video light with iPhone control was our last topliner, and after less than a day has already drummed up $11,076 towards its $115,000 target.
