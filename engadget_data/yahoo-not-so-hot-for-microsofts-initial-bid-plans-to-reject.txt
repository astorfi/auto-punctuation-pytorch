Apparently some of the number crunchers inside Yahoo! feel like the number is too low of a valuation, while others want to get tied up with Google to improve search revenues -- which some seem to think might have some antitrust implications. Pah, "antitrust implications." At least Microsoft remembers when men were men, and monopolies were monopolies.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
