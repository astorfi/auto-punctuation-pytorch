It turns out that Apple has apparently put the 60GB iPod on its "at risk" list. That's a designationApple provides to retailers to give them a heads up that a product may be in short supply in the near future. Appledoesn't provide any explanation for why a certain product is categorized this way. It could be that it's sold so wellthat supply can't keep up with demand. It could be that it's being replaced with a higher-capacity model. Or it justcould be -- and you know where this is going -- that it's being phased out to make room for the one true video iPod. That seems to be the consensuson the internets, and even some financial analysts are betting on that scenario. Shaw Wu, of American TechnologyResearch, told clients that he believes Apple is working on a wide-screen video iPod with Bluetooth, and that his"checks" confirm this. Of course, we don't know who Wu checked with. His sources could be right; or Applecould be coming out with a 40 or 80GB version of the current model; or just having a supply-chain hiccup; or, well, youget it. And if you'll excuse us, we're now going to swim ashore and wash this muck off.[Thanks to everyonewho sent this in]
