The X Series is ready for ordering in 16GB (NWZ-X1050B) and 32GB (NWZ-X1060B) flavors, with both expected to be dispatched between a fortnight and five weeks. As for pricing? Try £214 ($308) for the little guy and £283 ($407) for the big brother. All of a sudden, Cowon's OLED-equipped S9 isn't looking like such a bad alternative, eh?[Via OLED-Display]Read - 16GB WalkmanRead - 32GB Walkman
