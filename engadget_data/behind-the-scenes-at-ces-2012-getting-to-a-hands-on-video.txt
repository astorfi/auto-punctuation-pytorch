  Getting to and from an announcement, meeting, or keynote is one of the things we find ourselves doing countless times a day. To truly appreciate just how far we sometimes have to trek to get to the things we're covering at CES is hard to understand unless you've done it. Crowds that delay because they're ambling along, booths that are hard to find, and the time you burn getting to and fro is always at the back of our minds. We thought it a good idea to put together a little tour of how we find and then travel to a booth at CES. Enjoy the video after the break.
