 There have been doubts that Lenovo's ThinkPad Helix would ever arrive in the US, with even the past FCC appearance of a WiFi-only version offering no guarantees. An American launch now seems considerably more likely in the wake of a follow-up FCC approval. The dockable, 11.6-inch Windows 8 tablet has popped up carrying LTE both on an AT&T-specific 700MHz band and AT&T-friendly AWS (1,700MHz and 2,100MHz) bands -- with such explicit network support, we'll be surprised if it doesn't reach US shores. Little else is available in the filing that we don't already know, although it's clear that there's no real cellular access for Sprint, T-Mobile or Verizon. We'd just like to know if and when Lenovo is ready to make the ThinkPad Helix official for this side of the world and give the upcoming IdeaTab Lynx some company.
