 Looks like Fraunhofer's researchers aren'tthe only Germans able to get in on the transparent OLED thing. It appears some researchers at the Technical Universityof Braunschweig are claiming to have developed a technique for embedding OLED pixels on layers of transparent TFTs,creating see-through displays that could be manufactured cheaply with flexible plastics capable of withstanding extremetemperatures. Apparently the transparent displays, which were up to (and over) twice the brightness of today's displays,should be ready to rock in two years -- just in time for us to renovate the Department Of Precrime set we use act outMinority Report in during our lunch hour. Is it now?
