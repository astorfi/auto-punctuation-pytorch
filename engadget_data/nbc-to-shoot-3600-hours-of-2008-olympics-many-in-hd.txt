 If you thought 416 hours of Winter Olympic Games coverage was a bit much, the 3,600 hours (that's 150 days worth, folks) that NBC-Universal will be recording next year will seem like overkill in its finest form. Sure enough, it will supposedly be covering every facet of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing from August 8 - 24, 2008, and a variety of networks including NBC, USA, MSNBC, and CNBC will be carrying its programming. Notably, it will be displaying Olympics in HD on Universal-HD, NBC HD, and USA HD, and while the exact amount of HD coverage wasn't stated, even a fraction of the 3,600 hour total would be mighty impressive.
