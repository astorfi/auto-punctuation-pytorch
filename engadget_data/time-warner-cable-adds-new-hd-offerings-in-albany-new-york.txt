       Hot on the heels of reports claiming that Time Warner Cable (partly owned by Time Warner, parent company of AOL, which owns Engadget) added six new HD channels in Maine comes a note that eight new offerings have emerged in New York's capital city. Reportedly, residents of Albany can now kick back and enjoy programming on History Channel HD, CNN HD, HGTV HD, The Weather Channel HD, Food Network HD, Golf Channel HD, National Geographic HD and Outdoor HD. Of note, our tipster mentioned that he had to reboot his HD DVR in order to actually receive the newcomers, so give that a go if you're running into issues viewing the aforementioned channels.[Thanks, Daniel S.]
