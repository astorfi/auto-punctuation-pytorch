An updated page from the PS Vita's Japanese site has backed up rumors that PSOne Classics and other "archive games" won't be available when the quad-core console arrives in Asian stores next month. However, it's not all bad news for anyone hoping to relive those jaggy-edged gaming triumphs of the late 90's -- the official response adds that plans for older titles will be announced in due course.
