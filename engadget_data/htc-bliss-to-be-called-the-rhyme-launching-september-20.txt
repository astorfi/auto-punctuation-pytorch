The image you see above was leaked with a few new pieces of quality information: the Bliss will inevitably become the Rhyme once it hits stores -- which plays right into HTC's infatuation with Beats, though the tech probably won't be incorporated here -- and will likely be announced at the September 20th event (the date on the press image is often a solid indicator). HTCInside is also reporting that the Rhyme will be available in silver / white, pink / yellow and dark blue, so perhaps it isn't completely for the ladies, no?
