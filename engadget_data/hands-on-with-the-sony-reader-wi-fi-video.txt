The Sony Reader Wi-Fi does go a ways toward keeping up with the competition, offering up WiFi (as advertised), an infrared touchscreen, and the Pearl E-Ink display seen on past versions. The hardware is nice, though it doesn't feel quite as natural in the hand as the Nook or Kobo -- it did indeed feel light, as advertised, though it's hard to get a final judgement, seeing as how the demo product on the show room floor was all wired up. The software also zips along quite nicely, and pinch to zoom functionality is certainly a welcome addition in the e-reader market. Unlike many other Sony Readers, the thing also does well for itself pricewise, at $149. Hands-on video after the break.
