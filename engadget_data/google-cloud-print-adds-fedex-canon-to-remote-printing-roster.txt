In addition to wirelessly sending documents to nearby printers, Mountain View's now adding FedEx to the drop down destination list, granting users the ability to obtain retrieval codes for use at any of that shipping service's locations across the U.S. The remote printing feature has also gained an additional device partner, enlisting Canon into the ranks of participating companies, occupied by the likes of Epson, Kodak and HP. And as an extra bonus for the Android faithful, handsets and tablets sporting the search giant's Ice Cream Sandwich OS will now be able to receive and display transmitted docs as PDFs, although you'll need to install the beta version of the company's mobile browser to take advantage of this seamless integration. Open OS, meet the closed-off cloud.
