       New York is all set to start receiving their local breaking news in HD via the NBC Universal-owned WNBC station on September 13. Start? You would think that the number one market in the country would already of had their local news in HD, but nope, this is going to be the first one in the market. Wouldn't it make sense to produce an example station for other affiliates across the nation to follow? Ah, what do we know anyway? WNBC is going to produce 28 hours a week of news and local programming, including the movie review show Reel Talk and sports show Mike'd Up. So far, the station has only retrofitted the studio and helicopter with the pricey cams, but when more of 'em trickle in over the next few months, programming will follow. Alright New Yorkers, are you ready to see your city's highs and lows like only the local news can portray -- but now it's in high definition.[Thanks, Andy]
