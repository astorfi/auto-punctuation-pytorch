 It's been a slow news day for most of the tech industry, but it's been a helluva Monday for T-Mobile. First the carrier announced expansion plans for its fledgling LTE network, and said that the Galaxy Note II would be getting an over-the-air update allowing it to take advantage of T-Mo's new 4G speeds. Now, Big Magenta is planning a press event for March 26th in New York City, reports AllThingsD. As you can see, the invite promises the wireless operator will no longer be acting like one, which makes us think a splashy product launch isn't in the cards. Given the teaser, we have to wonder if T-Mo is finally ready to elaborate on its plan to offer Value plans only, under which customers pay for their phones outright in exchange for lower monthly fees (and no contracts, of course). If we were betting types, that's where we'd be putting our money, but it'll be another eight days before we know for sure.
