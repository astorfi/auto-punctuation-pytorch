If that didn't scare you away from accepting small payments from the company's tiny credit card swipers, rejoice, because they appear to be shipping again -- at least to some. Sally over at the Square support forums posted that she was sent the following message:

We started rolling out Square card readers and one is now coming your way from our fulfillment center in Saint Louis. It will arrive on your doorstep in the next few days.
A few others it seems have also received the same note. How about you? Is your little, different credit card reader on the way?

[Thanks, Sam]
