 Hope your calendar's clear for next May. Google has just announced the dates for I/O 2013, with the event kicking off on May 15th and concluding on May 17th. After setting up shop in San Francisco this June, the event will return to its traditional May time frame in 2013. The company isn't handing out any clues on what's to come, only noting that registration information will be coming in "early '13." Meanwhile, feel free to relive the keynotes from just a few months back. My, how the time flies when you're Nowing.
