The search giant just simplified the process for getting access -- instead of signing up and waiting for an email invitation, you can simply hit the source link below and click through to explore the new interface. The redesigned Maps includes a much more content-rich design, featuring neighborhood attractions and a more polished interface. See for yourself in the demo after the break.
