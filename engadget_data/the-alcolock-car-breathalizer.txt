 
Various parts of the UK are conducting trials of the
   Alcolock, a breathalizer-type system that attaches to a car's ignition and requires the driver to blow into a tube
   before starting the car. If the blood alcohol content is too high, the car won't start. It's being targeted at
   those previously convicted of drunk driving, possibly as a way to regain their licenses sooner. On a side note, we
   wouldn't mind an alternative ignition system based on this. Though just the breathing tube alone, minus the
   suspicion. Put your key in and blow the breath of life into your car. Think of the power.
