Ok, it's officially Christmas now, which means it's time to fess up: What'd you get? These days everyone we know is
afraid to buy us anything even remotely electronic (which is fine, they'd probably screw it up anyway), so we have no
choice but to live vicariously through you guys.


 P.S. - Merry Christmas!
