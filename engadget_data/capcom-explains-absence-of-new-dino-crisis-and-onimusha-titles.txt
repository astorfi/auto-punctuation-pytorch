They're probably not even at Capcom and likely at the appliance store, sitting in the back playing cards, waiting to deliver the actual oven. In short: we haven't seen 'em and we're not sure when we will again.

Capcom's VP of strategic planning and business development, Christian Svensson, provided IGN with some insight into Capcom's two franchises. You see, while earlier entries in those franchises were successful, later iterations weren't. According to the company, each provide their own set of challenges: Onimusha is a brand that resonates with Japanese audiences, but Capcom's pushing for more Westernized games right now, while Dino Crisis has the unfortunate problem of nobody at the company having "a burning desire" to "light that franchise back up again."

One thing we would've liked to see Svennson discuss is DmC: Devil May Cry. Ninja Theory's reboot doesn't just have the future of that particular franchise riding on it, but could determine how other companies handle -- or don't handle -- revitalizing an older brand for a new audience.
