The previously outed system is quite serious, utilizing NVIDIA's nForce 790i Ultra SLI chipset, a wide variety of Intel CPUs (ranging from the Core 2 Duo up to the Core 2 Duo Extreme), support for ATI Radeon HD 3870 X2 (CrossFireX) or NVIDIA GeForce 8800GT (SLI) graphics chipsets, up to 8GB of RAM, and the ability to install up to four hard drives in various configurations. The real kicker, however, is the H2C cooling system, which has been "enhanced," so this won't blow up when you're playing Crysis (which runs smoothly at 1920 x 1200 resolution, we're told). HotHardware has a nice unboxing of the beast, and PC Magazine has given a $6,629 configuration a full review, and they didn't come to the sweetest conclusion ever. The XPS 730 and XPS 730 H2C are available now from Dell, starting at $3,999 and $4,999, respectively.Read - Dell XPS 730 H2C: Four-Barreled Gaming HorsepowerRead - Dell XPS 730 H2C Unboxing and PreviewRead - Review of the Dell XPS 730 H2C
