At first, there was the (now defunct) AMD PIC, followed by the upstart underdog, the Intel Classmate PC, both of which kinda sorta tried to go head-to-head with the OLPC (among others). Now China's trying to get in the game too, and has just released a new 1600 yuan ($203) computer made by the Jiangsu Menglong Science and Technology Company. The Agence France Presse reports that the unnamed computer, which is powered by the 750MHz 64-bit homegrown Codson IIE chip, comes with a 40GB hard drive and 256MB of RAM. While you've got to BYO keyboard, mouse, and monitor for now, if these same Chinese brainiacs ever manage to swing a laptop out of this or any of the other ultra low-cost Chinese PCs like it, NickNeg may actually have some real competition on his hands.[Via Engadget Chinese]
