And, for the next 21 hours or so, it's even better than that -- because it's free at Amazon's Appstore. So, if you're brandishing Android 2.1 or higher and you type in one of the 17 supported languages, then the source link below beckons. Come back quickly, though, or we'll miss you terribly. (The tablet version of the app is still $4.99, mind -- but there's always tomorrow.)
