The usual suspects from the PS3 era are here, but we've got no complaints, as the likes of Netflix and Amazon Instant Video are our go-to options anyway. Right from day one, you'll also be able to access Hulu Plus, Crackle, NHL GameCenter LIVE, Epix, NBA Game Time, Crunchyroll, Vudu and, well, Yupp TV -- for all your Indian drama needs.
