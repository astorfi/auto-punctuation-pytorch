What do you get when you cross a 5.7-inch screen with 960x540 resolution and a 3,200mAH battery? Pretty sparse pixel density, that's for sure, but the new LG G Vista for Verizon will keep smartphone-ing through a day and then some. Aimed at the mid-range crowd who want a flagship feel, the G Vista strongly resembles the top-end G3 with an even narrower bezel. But don't be confused: on top of the meager qHD screen, it gets by with a quad-core 1.2GHz chip, 1.5GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, microSD and an 8-megapixel rear/1.3-megapixel front camera. On the plus side, it does have LTE, Android 4.4.2, LG software like Knock Code and a prodigious 15 hours of talk time. For all that, you'll pay $100 with a 2-year contract, or $400 off contract with Verizon's Edge. A little pricy considering the competition, but not a bad mid-range option if you're set on Big Red.
