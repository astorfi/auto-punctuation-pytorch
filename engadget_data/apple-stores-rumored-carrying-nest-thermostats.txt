 Tony Fadell might have left Apple to make the Nest Learning Thermostat, but it may be the case that Apple hasn't completely left him. If we go by a pair of rumors, Nest's Internet-savvy climate control could soon be in Apple Stores, presumably across the US, for the same $249 as it costs to splurge for one through Nest itself. We're definitely skeptical -- home appliances and automation aren't really Apple's strong suits, and Nest has already declined to comment -- but 9to5 Mac has heard that the thermostats are already in Apple's inventory system. If the reports are at all true, there won't be long to wait before you can buy a smart energy system while you're shopping for a new iPhone case.
