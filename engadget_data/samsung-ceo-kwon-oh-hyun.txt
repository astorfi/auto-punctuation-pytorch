 Vice Chairman Kwon Oh-hyun is about to become a very busy man, having been tasked with handling "corporate-wide affairs" as Samsung's new CEO while also continuing at the helm of the manufacturer's components business. He'll replace current CEO Choi Gee-sung, who'll take on a role looking for "future growth engines" as the head of the Samsung Group Corporate Strategy Office -- at least once his new XL business cards arrive from the printers. Other top-level positions look relatively stable at this point, with Jay Lee (the son of the current Samsung Electronics chairman, Lee Kun-hee) staying on as chief operations officer.
