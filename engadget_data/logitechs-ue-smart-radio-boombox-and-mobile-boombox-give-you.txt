 In addition to producing a slew of new headphones, Logitech's latest collaboration with Ultimate Ears has produced a pair of Bluetooth speakers and a Smart Radio. The UE Smart Radio comes equipped with 802.11b/g WiFi on board to pull audio from directly from the likes of Spotify and Pandora or from local sources like Mac, PC, iOS or Android devices. A 2.4-inch LCD is on the front, along with the usual audio controls, plus there are six preset buttons that can be programmed to easily access playlists from myriad locales. It's also got a rechargeable battery, good for a claimed six hours of playback, and will set you back $180 when it goes on sale next month.

   LONDON, UK. - August 29, 2012 - Today Logitech (SIX: LOGN) (NASDAQ: LOGI) responded to music fans who want pure, undiluted music wherever they go with the launch of a new line of Logitech UE™ products. The products enable people to enjoy their music when and how they want, delivering seamless wireless audio, facilitating discovery and making sharing simple with a complete line of music products that take you from morning to night. The new offering includes earphones, headphones, wireless speakers, and a smart radio.

   "Today's fans have their music with them wherever they go – they carry it with them on their tablet or smartphone," said Rory Dooley, Logitech senior vice president of music. "But no matter how or where you choose to store or access your favourite music, this line up is the best way for you to experience it. Whether you want to be completely immersed in your favourite song, to share music with friends, or to discover new favourites, Logitech UE is the clear choice."  As people shift away from traditional methods of music consumption toward services that are easily accessed through mobile devices, they are increasingly able to surround themselves with their favourite music no matter where they go or who they're with.

   Combining Logitech's expertise in seamless connectivity with UE's heritage of providing great sound in the tiniest of packages, the new line-up blends form and function to deliver the right sound for any situation.

   Highlights of the new line-up include:

   Logitech UE Boombox

   The Logitech UE™ Boombox is an on-the-go speaker that lets you use your smartphone or tablet to play and control your music from up to 50 feet (15.2 metres) away. Up to eight Bluetooth®-enabled devices can be paired with the speaker – with up to three connected at the same time – so you and your friends can take turns playing music. With eight custom-tuned drivers, the Logitech UE Boombox delivers sound that is rich, balanced and clear, with enough bass to make every song feel as real and as raw as it should. An integrated, sculptured aluminium handle makes it easy to roam – from the kitchen, to the bedroom, to a party at a friend's house or anywhere in between – with uninterrupted music at your side. With a six-hour rechargeable battery, you won't have a power outlet holding you down. The Logitech UE Boombox will be available for a suggested retail price of £199.00.

   Logitech UE Mobile Boombox

   The Logitech UE™ Mobile Boombox is an ultraportable speaker that connects to your smartphone or tablet to play and control your music from up to 50 feet (15.2 metres) away. Because two mobile devices can be connected at the same time, you can keep your two most-frequently used devices connected. Designed to give you surprisingly big sound in a portable package, the Logitech UE Mobile Boombox includes a rechargeable battery that delivers up to 10 hours of music, depending on use, settings and conditions, and can even double as a speakerphone for voice or video calls. With metal finishes, vibrant accents and a grip-action rubber casing, it is built to look good, feel great in your hand, and withstand a little rough and tumble. The Logitech UE Mobile Boombox will be available for a suggested retail price of £79.99.

   Logitech UE Smart Radio

   The Logitech UE™ Smart Radio is a dedicated music device that can play Internet radio, online music services and the music on your PC or Mac® – all through one simple, unified interface. The colour screen displays album art, track and station information. And you can save your favourite stations and playlists for one-touch access to the music you listen to most. What's more, the Logitech UE Smart Radio Controller app for iPhone®, iPad® and Android devices transforms your smartphone or tablet into a master music controller, giving you seamless navigation of your music services, radio stations and personal music collection. The rechargeable battery lets you take your music with you around the home, with up to six hours of continuous playback depending on use, settings and conditions. The Logitech UE Smart Radio will be available for a suggested retail price of £149.00.

   Logitech UE 900 Noise-Isolating Earphones

Thanks to four-armature speakers and a three-way crossover in a universal fit, you'll hear a wide soundstage with soul-satisfying bass, heavenly highs and a crisp, piano-like timbre. The unique UE sound signature faithfully recreates the original recording – and adds a low-end kick. Five silicon and three Comply® Foam tips, each designed with a large-bore opening, ensure audio is delivered cleanly. Two detachable, braided cables – one with a mic and controls, and one without – let you swap out the standard cable for a cable with mic and controls. And ear loops offer a secure, comfortable fit no matter what you're doing. The Logitech UE 900 Noise-Isolating Earphones will be available for a suggested retail price of £329.00.
