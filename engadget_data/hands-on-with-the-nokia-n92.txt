Ok, it was our turn to play with the
Nokia N92, they had a couple on
hand at Nokia's analyst event here in New York today. There's no denying that this is one big handset (you've got to
squeeze that digital TV tuner in there somewhere) and the keypad is not so hot, but they definitely delivered on the
mobile TV experience. The display on the N92 is crisp and bright, and since the video is broadcast rather than streamed
(we watched some live NBC courtesy of a DVB-H node that Nokia setup for the event) there isn't any of the stuttering or
caching you sometimes have to deal with when you stream video over a cellular connection. Click on for a few more
pics.
