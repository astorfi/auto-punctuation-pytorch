 Make of it what you will, but Microsoft's now-old 30GB Zune is perched atop Amazon's bestseller list of hard drive-based MP3 players. 'Course, you've had plenty of opportunities to snag one in the past for a few bucks lower than the current $179.99 asking price, but apparently, the general public has taken quite kindly to the lower cost of entry. As of now, the white 30GB Zune is sitting pretty at numero uno, while the black iteration holds the bronze; the brown version even cracked the top five. Just sayin', that's all.[Via ZuneRama]
