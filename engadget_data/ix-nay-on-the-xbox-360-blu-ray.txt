 Looks like Microsoft had a little PR cleanup to do this week after Peter Moore's semi-pseudo-vaguely wordedstatement to ITMedia at CES on the possibilityof Microsoft's adding Blu-ray hardware support to the Xbox 360. Before, the man told 'em that Blu-ray would be"possible," and while technically he was being forthright in his answer (because it is in fact possible forthem to do), there can be no further mistaken next-gen optical intentions for the 360. Microsoft's issued ablog-release of sorts clarifying that have "absolutely no plans to support other optical formats" (i.e. underno circumstances will they be releasing a Blu-ray drive for their flagship home entertainment device), and that theyremain "fully Committed to HD DVD." Alright then, looks like that settles that.[Via Joystiq]
