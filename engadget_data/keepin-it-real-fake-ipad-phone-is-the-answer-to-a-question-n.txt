 The D-Pad and E-Pad are two pint-sized cellphones that are reminiscent of the iPad, except they are telephones, they are much smaller, and they are totally different. Featuring a 3.5-inch resistive touchscreen, 2.5mm headphone jack, 0.3 megapixel front-facing camera and 2 megapixel rear camera with LED flash, you don't even have to get to the dual SIMs, telescoping antenna, or the CMMB mobile TV tuner before you realize this is all Shenzhen, and very little Cupertino. Available now in either pink or white for 550 Chinese yuan (about $70). Get a closer look -- and some video to boot -- after the break.
