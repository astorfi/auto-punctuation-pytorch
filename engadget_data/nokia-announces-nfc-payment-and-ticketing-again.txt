In what reads like brand-spanking news, but based on our
previous report seems more like a follow-up, Nokia has
announced a Near Field Communications shell for their
3220 phone.  As we covered a few months ago, the shell will allow for use of the phone as a mass transit
pass.  This release makes mention of partnerships with Visa and MasterCard in order to utilize the phone as a
payment device.  They'll be demoing the NFC shell at the upcoming 3GSM World Congress at Cannes, so if the
technology never makes it into our hands we'll be able to blame the French.
