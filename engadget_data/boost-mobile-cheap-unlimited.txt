Remember when you had the option to get unlimited data for $30 on most carriers? Yeah, us too, and we won't hide our envy for those who are grandfathered in. To alleviate some of these troubles, Boost Mobile is kicking off a temporary offer on an all-you-can-have plan, giving folks who sign up for service by March 31st a chance to have unlimited access to voice, text and LTE data for $35 per month. There are a few caveats, however: The deal will only be valid for the first six months of service, after which you'll have to pay the regular monthly fee of $50, and data is set to be throttled once you reach the 2.5GB threshold. If that still sounds good, then head over to Boost's site (or a brick-and-mortar store) to take advantage of the promo before it's too late.
