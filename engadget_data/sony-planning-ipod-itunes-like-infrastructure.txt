       Given Sony's exploding battery crisis, followed by the launch of the the PS3 (and its aftermath), we figured that those two things alone (not to mention the PS4) have already given enough headaches to its board of directors. However, there may be a bright spot in Sony's future -- the company is now hinting at building an "MP3 player" and corresponding online music store that would go head-to-head with the iPod/iTunes combo and the new-kid-on-the-block, the Zune/Zune Marketplace. According to Wired News' Listening Post blog, Sony Electronics head Stan Glasgow earlier this week alluded to a new digital audio player that could be ready by December 2007. He also said that "DRMs are going to become less important," which may lead to us to the holy grail of media players, but we're not holding our breath just yet on either of these developments. Sony, drop us a line when you're ready to show something off.
