Sure, $70 isn't that huge of a difference quantitatively, but emotionally, $30 is basically an overpriced meal or two -- and considering the old adage of "a moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips," wouldn't you just rather have webOS? We've heard of some bad experiences with LetsTalk rebates in the past, but in this case, it's just an instant discount, so it seems like it could be a no-brainer for on-the-fencers.
