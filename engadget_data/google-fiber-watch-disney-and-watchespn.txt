You'd think that Google Fiber would embrace streaming TV services when internet video is practically its reason for being, but it has lagged behind many conventional providers. It's about to catch up, however: Google has just enabled Watch Disney and WatchESPN access for its TV subscribers. As elsewhere, customers who sign in can stream 11 channels of live broadcasting as long as they have both a supported device and a broadband connection. Disney's service will be available for all Google Fiber TV users, so those in Austin and Provo can look forward to one more treat when Google lights up their neighborhoods.
