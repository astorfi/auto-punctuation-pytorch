Well, obviously there are no certain answers just yet, but the fact that in the newest iPhone commercial the video player on the NY Times home page didn't return an error telling the user they need to install Flash (see inset) is certainly an encouraging development. Especially for all those who love downloading massive, annoying flash ads, like the ones you sometimes see on this very site.[Thanks, Andres]
