 
They're not exactly calling off the hounds, but the FCC's standing down just a wee bit in its hunt to get to the bottom of Verizon's astronomical new $350 "advanced device" early termination fee; the original deadline for the carrier's responses was yesterday, December 17, but instead, the FCC will now be checking its mailbox on Monday. Even in the most extreme outcome, it'd likely be months or years before the FCC would actually go from an inquiry to applying pressure on Verizon to lower the fee. In the meantime, though, failure to respond to the questionnaire will probably result in an entertaining series of strong verbal admonishments and -- if Genachowski's in a feisty mood -- perhaps a flurry of punishing blows to Verizon's torso and upper body.
