It's under an inch thick and weighs 3lbs, with an 11.6-inch screen offering 1366 x 768 pixels and driven by integrated graphics. Acer simply lists an Intel Core 2 Solo processor, but others are reporting that it will feature a Core i5 520UM processor which can range from 1 to 1.8GHz to offer decent performance along with great battery life -- eight hours worth according to Acer, but we'll believe that when we see it. Wireless is over 801.11a/b/g/n WiFi, there's a VGA webcam in the bezel, three USB ports, and even HDMI output, making it a relatively port-heavy ultralight. What Acer is not saying is how much it will cost or when we'll be able to get our meaty paws on the thing, but we hope to learn those details soon.

Update: Acer sneaked in a bunch of other TimelineX models as well: the 13.3-inch 3820T, 14-inch 4820T, and 15.6-inch 5820T, each with your choice of Core i3, i5, or i7 processors, all under an inch thick, and again offering eight hours of battery life for frugal computers. No prices on any of 'em, though!
