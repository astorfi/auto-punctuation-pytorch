This wasn't expected to happen until sometime next year, but TiVo achieved something of a milestone today: the
company reported that for the first time ever it managed to make more money than it lost, with revenues surging 46%
over the same quarter last year. We're not quite ready to call off the
Deathwatch just yet, though — TiVo only reported a meager
$240,000 in profit and they're anticipating a pretty serious loss of $20 to $25 million for the current quarter. Still,
it seems like things have been picking up for them lately — they
scored that major deal with Comcast back in March and
they're currently getting ready to rollout their new TiVo
Download service — so we're cautiously optimistic that this won't be the last time they report a profitable
quarter.
