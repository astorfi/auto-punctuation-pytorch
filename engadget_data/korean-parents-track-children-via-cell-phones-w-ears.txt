Joining the growing trend in Asian (and the rest of the world) parents in South Korea can now track their children
by foisting ugly-looking cell phones with "antennas shaped like human ears" on them. The phone has four buttons for
preset numbers ("Mom" and "Dad" are suggested). Assuming you can get your child to carry this sort of thing around, the
phone has built-in GPS so you can track their every move. And we though child safety laws had become widespread - if
you can think of a better way to provoke abuse by other children than a sissy phone with plastic ears, please let us
know.
