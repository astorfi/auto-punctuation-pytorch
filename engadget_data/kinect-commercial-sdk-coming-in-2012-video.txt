We've always called these non-standard uses of the device "Kinect Hacks" as people find more weird and wonderful ways to use it to their advantage. Unsurprisingly, Redmond has been paying attention and it's planning a commercial Kinect SDK. It's teaming up with developers to create the new software and has already received 200 applications from interested parties. It all kicks off early next year, and interested parties should be chatting up the company as we speak. Stuck for inspiration? We've got you covered, check out what other clever bods have already achieved with the technology in the video after the break.
