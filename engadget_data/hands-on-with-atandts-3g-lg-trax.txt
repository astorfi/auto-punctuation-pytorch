Not a whole lot to say: it's skinny, comfortable to hold and use, and quite the looker, but nothing to write home about in terms of build. The phone looks like it'll be a good contender for your mid-level AT&T music phone dollar, but we'll let you be the judge of that whenever it finally hits stores.
