What has six cameras, a large screen and tracks your head? Amazon's new phone, probably. The company's first handset has been long rumored and occasionally leaked, but now the company seems ready to make it official: Jeff Bezos is hosting a hitherto unannounced "launch event" later this month. The company's page for the event is little more than a invitation request form, but an attached teaser video meshes well with the purported phone's rumored head-tracking capabilities. "It moved with me!" exclaims an unnamed tester, staring at an object just out of frame. Sounds neat.



While the video itself doesn't show anything specific, the reactions it shows are consistent with the prototype BGR uncovered back in April. That handset had a 4.7-inch screen and a staggering five front-facing camera, which were said to be used for tracking the user's face as they combed their way through an interactive 3D interface. It was also said to be running a Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU and 2GB of RAM, but what Amazon's going to show on June 18th is still anybody's guess. Still, the teaser page revealed one more thing: the product will have a sleek black bevel and an Amazon logo (pictured above). Well, we can't say we're surprised. We'll let you know all the details when Bezos makes this thing official later this month.

Update: Amazon's teaser betrayed a little more than we thought. At 0:41, the unnamed device peeks out from behind the video's bottom edge, revealing what appears to be a blurry power button and a headphone jack. It's definitely a phone. You can thank Aaron Kasten's sharp eyes (and Google+ post) for the peek.
