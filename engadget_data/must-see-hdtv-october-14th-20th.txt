Pacific Rim is finally coming home on Blu-ray and in 3D, complete with a special effects showcase ready to give your A/V system a proper workout. Directed by Guillermo del Toro it's visually one of the most impressive movies we've ever seen, and is accompanied this week by the release of Weird Science and Orson Welles' The Stranger. Otherwise, Netflix makes a dip into stand-up comedy with a new series and special from Russell Peters available for streaming, while the MLB playoffs rage on with the AL and NL championship series. Look after the break for our weekly listing of what to look out for in TV, Blu-ray and gaming.
