As the third US carrier to sell the iPhone, Sprint has confirmed it will offer the device with the same unlimited plans as the other handsets in its lineup -- much to the relief of loyal customers hoping to make a belated switch to iOS. But we're betting those of you willing to swap providers are just a little curious as to how the plans stack up. Fortunately, we've crunched the numbers for you, so all you need to do is meet us after the break for that bottom line.
