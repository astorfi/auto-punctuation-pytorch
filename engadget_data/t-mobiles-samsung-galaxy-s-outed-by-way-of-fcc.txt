There's now a phone called the SGH-T959 in the FCC's certification database that features AWS 3G support, and while external photos are rudely left out, the device's outline clearly mimics that of the generic, unbranded Galaxy S that we've been seeing since its unveiling back in March. At any rate, we've got this Samsung Android event coming up stateside here in a couple weeks, so we should figure it all out then.
