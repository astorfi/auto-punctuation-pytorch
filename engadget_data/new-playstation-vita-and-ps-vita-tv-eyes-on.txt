Two new devices from Sony today -- and we're still a little shocked. Alongside a thinner, improved PS Vita, Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Andrew House took to the stage to introduce a little TV-connected device called the PS Vita TV. It's capable of playing Vita games, handling Connected Play with your future PS4 and running a whole host of media and streaming services. We weren't allowed to touch either device (though we admit we did handle the new Vita's controls a little bit, sorry Sony...) so you'll have to make do with our gallery of angles just below. Full hands-on impressions, it seems, will have to wait until next week.
