Sony is releasing it into the wilds of retail for $20, alongside The Shoot ($40), an on-rails shooter title that failed to excite when we previewed it earlier this year. Will it be more enjoyable with your Move controller firmly ensconced in this beautiful bit of red and white plastic? Of course it will.
