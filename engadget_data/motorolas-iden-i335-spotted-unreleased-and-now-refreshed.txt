Another rumored Motorola iDEN delight for us to feast our eyes on, this time a pretty stylin' looking refresh on the Motorola i335 called the, ah, Motorola i335. Gone is the funky and lumpy look of the i335 we saw late last year, this refresh apparently adds a VGA camera, updated Bluetooth, and improved music functionality. Apparently due out in Q4 of this year -- we still can't speculate on just how real it is -- with yesterday's news of the "CABO" it seems iDEN is making something of a comeback -- or is it just starting? -- in the cool handset department.[Thanks, iDENguy]
