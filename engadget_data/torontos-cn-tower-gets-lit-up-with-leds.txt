Whipped up by Boston's Color Kinetics (to the tune of $2.4 million), the system consists of 1,300 shoe-box sized light fixtures that can be used to create a range of different effects. According to Reuters, the tower will be red and white by default, with special color effects at the top of each hour, and additional light shows planned for holidays and special events. While the LEDs help to make the system more energy efficient, they obviously won't last forever, with a ginormous lightbulb-changing job in store ten years from now.[Photo courtesy of Reuters/Mike Cassese]
