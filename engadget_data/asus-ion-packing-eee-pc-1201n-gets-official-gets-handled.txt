       
It was late-August when we first got word of a new addition to the Eee PC lineup, the 12-inch, Ion-smuggling Eee PC 1201N. ASUS has just now confirmed the thing and a few sites have rather coincidentally posted hands-on impressions of it -- but let's go over those specs one more time before we dive into that, shall we? It has a 12.1-inch, 1366 x 768 LED-backlit display (that's sadly glossy), a dual-core Atom 330 processor at 1.6GHz, 2 or 3GB of DDR2 memory, either a 250 or 320GB HDD, a six-cell battery, and Windows 7 Premium. All that for just $499 which, to us, sounds like a stupendously good deal. So, those impressions? They seem intentionally brief, as if nobody's quite allowed to give real opinions, but a short video below from Laptop shows off the sleek, Seashell-style design from all angles. Surely more thorough coverage will be online before the latest netbook hits retail sometime in mid-December.
