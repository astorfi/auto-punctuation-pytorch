Otherwise known as the SV420/LV4200/KV4200, this wispy thin 13-millimeter slider is their second Black Label series premium phone and features a new shiny metal design LG hopes will supplant Chocolate in the lustful hearts of consumers. Going brushed aluminum where it counts, the Shine delivers a 2 megapixel Schneider-Kreuznach shooter with flash, a media player with enough room for 1GB of MP3s (and more via expansion judging by the pics), Korea's M-Bank monetary service, and a 2.2-inch QVGA display which goes all mirror-like when off. Oh, and it's apparently coming to SK Telecom's 3G June network. Will it be as successful as the Chocolate? Time will tell but it sure caught our attention. Expected in Korea first just like the Chocolate, only this time LG, let's try to be a bit quicker on the global launch, eh? More pics and snaps after the break. [Via AVING]
