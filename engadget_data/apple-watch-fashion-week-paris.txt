Colette is one of those ultra-hip Paris shops that may tempt you with its eclectic toys, clothing, tech and art -- until you see the prices. For Fashion Week in Paris, it's about to have a shiny new bauble: the Apple Watch. The store has announced a one-day only preview of the 1.53- or 1.33-inch wearable so that le public can see it for the first time. So far, only the press have glimpsed it, though we couldn't try any functions since it was just running a demo program. Apple told us that it'll be a strictly look-but-don't-touch event, with no new details -- and there's no word if Colette will actually sell it yet. If you happen to be in Paris though, you can see it now in it the fancy window display (which resembles the Watch interface) or brave the crowds in the store starting at 11:00 AM.
