Engadget's very own parent company AOL has released its Play music player app for Kindle Fire, and the interface here is actually considerably different from what you'd get on the straight Android version, available in Google Play. The product people behind the application say they re-tooled the design to match the Fire's 7-inch, 1,024 x 600 screen (and also, the tablet's heavily skinned UI, based on Android). Other than the facelift, there seems to be a good deal of overlap in functionality between this and the Google Play version: access to more than 55,000 Shoutcast radio stations and the ability to share favorite songs over Twitter and Facebook. Also like the main Android version, there's a so-called CD Listening Party feature that opens up free, complete albums, with selections changing weekly. (Naturally, you can also use the app to listen to your own MP3s stored locally on the device, but you probably gathered that.) Play will be available as a free, ad-supported app, though you can also get an advert-free version for 99 cents. Download on Thursday, though (that would be Thursday, Eastern Standard Time), and you can get the premium one gratis.
