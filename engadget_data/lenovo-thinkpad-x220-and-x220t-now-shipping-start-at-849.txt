It's now ready to purchase at the company's online store, starting at $849 with a Core i3-2310M processor, and its convertible tablet sibling, the X220T, is also eager to be snatched up, though its starting price is $1,249 with the same CPU on board. Eight business days will be required for delivery to reach you, but we'd wait a whole lot longer than that for the gorgeous IPS display and extreme battery life on offer. Sadly, you can't upgrade beyond the 1366 x 768 resolution nor away from the Intel HD Graphics 3000 "option," but then we hear that PowerPoint presentations should be blindingly fast on these machines anyhow. Hit the source links to see just how high you can raise the price by maxing out the rest of the specs.
