The end is upon us!  Today, the FDA
approved the use of the VeriChip, an RFID microchip that is implanted under skin without need for surgery.  The
chips are designed to include patient-specific information such as allergies or previous procedures that would be
scanned at a hospital emergency room wirelessly.  In order to assure its ubiquity (and eventual mind control of
the masses), Applied Digital Solutions is giving away scanners to 200 trauma centers.  This is the first time the
FDA has approved devices like this, and we'll be watching this slippery slope closely, comrades.
