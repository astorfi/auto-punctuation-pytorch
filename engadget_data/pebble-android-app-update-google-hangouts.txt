With all the work that Google's put into Hangouts lately, it'd be a shame to miss out when you're pinged to join one, no? If you happen to be sporting a Pebble smartwatch that scenario will be less likely, as version 1.8.2 of its Android app has arrived with notifications for the chat service. Though Pebble supports Google Talk notifications (along with call alerts, text messages, calendar reminders and email previews), Mountain View recently said that Hangouts is the future of Google Voice, making it a prime candidate for alerts. Apart from the extra wrist nag, the update also brings improved stability and developer enhancements. To grab it, check the source below or head to Google Play on your Android device.
