Of the third-party keyboards available on the Google Play Store, SwiftKey is among the oldest and most well-known. And although it's getting its iOS8 app ready for the fall, it certainly isn't forgetting the platform that helped the $4 app get its big break. With today's update, SwiftKey's premium Android keyboard is now permanently free of charge. This is great news for fresh users, and the loyal folks who've previously purchased the app won't be left out of the update: Legacy customers will get a $5 theme ten-pack for free. Additionally, the refresh also comes with a SwiftKey store (with 30 themes available at launch), a number row and over 800 emoji. Many of the features in this update were offered as part of a beta, so it's refreshing to see them added into the final product.
