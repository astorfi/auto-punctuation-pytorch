Pantech's eight-inch waterproof tablet, which is set to get its close up next week at CES, is now available for pre-order, a fact we've confirmed with a few AT&T stores -- though the physical locations have yet to actually get some demo models for you to play around with. The tablet is set to start shipping on January 22nd. It'll run you $300 with a two-year contract and $450 with, so you'll have to stick to the cheap champagne for a while with those at home splash tests.
