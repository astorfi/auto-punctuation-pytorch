Now the folks at the appropriately named DellZinoHD blog have found a spec breakdown of the unit, which is apparently also going by the names of Inspiron 300 and Inspiron 400 -- the latter of which seems to be slated for the Zino HD branding, or at least seems to mirror the original concept. The Inspiron 300 has more of a nettop slant, with an Atom processor and integrated graphics, and though it has a DVD burner and 3.5-inch HDD, there won't be HDMI or eSATA ports. Meanwhile, the Inspiron 400 can handle an Athlon or Athlon X2 processor, with an option for ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4330 discrete graphics (not quite a "desktop" part, if you ask us) and all the other goodies like a Blu-ray option, HDMI, gigabit Ethernet, dual eSATA and so forth. Interestingly, the manual also mentions XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Ubuntu as supported options -- though we're not sure they'll all be available as retail configurations.
