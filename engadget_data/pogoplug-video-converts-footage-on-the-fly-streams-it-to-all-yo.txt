The $200 PogoPlug Video may look just like the PogoPlug Pro that tempted your pocketbook in October, but it's got a brand-new daughterboard inside, whose purpose in life is to take your video files, convert them to variable bitrate H.264 and stream them anywhere in the world in real time. CEO Daniel Putterman claims that -- depending on device support -- it can pull footage directly from a connected camcorder and share it with your dearest relatives' computers, tablets and phones then and there. Sony's AVCHD camcorders will be compatible on day one, with other companies negotiating right now, and speaking of promises, the company says that additional printer support for all PogoPlug devices is "right around the corner." Like what you see? They'll be happy to take your money starting March 1st, and devices will go on sale just in time for April Fools' Day. PR after the break.
