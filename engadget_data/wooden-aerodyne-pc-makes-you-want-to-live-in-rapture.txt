He's produced another stunner with the Aerodyne: a fanless mahogany case with Rocketeer-style accents and a radio grille (picture after the break) we'd expect to hear Andrew Ryan barking out of. Unlike his other mods, the amazing Mr Stephenson is planning a small run of these cases for people to buy, so the only thing left to ask is -- can anyone lend us a tenner?
