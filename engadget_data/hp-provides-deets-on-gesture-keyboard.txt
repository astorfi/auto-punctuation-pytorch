 HP justlet loose with some more info on that gesture keyboard thecompany showed off in India a couple of weeks ago.Â  According to HP, the keypad, which was developed by thecompany's Bangalore-based research team, can reproduce the script used in Hindi and other Indic languages, a processthat would require up to 1,000 keys using a traditional keyboard (though most keyboards designed for such languagesrely on keystroke combinations, rather than actual 1,000-key layouts). HP has begun selling the keypad in India forabout $45, including software. The device is being manufactured in India by a company HP declined to name. HP sees thepotential market for the keyboard as comprising up to 1.5 billion non-English speakers in India, Nepal and other SouthAsian countries. At $45 a pop, that could make the keyboard a pretty lucrative product for HP.
