That's right, a new PlayStation 3 model CECHG01 was just unearthed. The juiciest of documents are all withheld upon Sony's request for confidentiality. However, we did manage to scrape up a few details: Bluetooth 2.0+EDR; 802.11b/g WiFi; a 3.2GHz CPU clock speed just like other PS3s; 66MHz ATA, 133MHz ATA, 33MHz PCI and 750MHz SATA1; and a bevy of ports including USB, HDMI, and Ethernet. At least that what it looks like after combing through the data. Nothing new, eh? So the reason for the new model number is likely the result of a hard disk change given Sony's preference for unique models reflecting changes in storage. However, for all we know that could be an increase and not a decrease in capacity so we'll all have to hold tight for now and watch this unfold.[Via Pocket-lint and Spong]
