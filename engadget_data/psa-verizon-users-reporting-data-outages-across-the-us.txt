If you're having trouble getting a data connection on your Verizon-branded handset this morning, you're not alone. We've been receiving a bevy of tips from disgruntled Verizon customers, due to an apparently widespread outage across the carrier's mobile data network. Based on what we're seeing on Verizon's @vzwsupport Twitter feed and forums (linked below), it looks as if both 3G and 4G networks have been affected. We tested some handsets in the San Francisco area, and can confirm that data connections there are indeed down at the moment. We've reached out to Verizon for comment, and will let you know as soon as we hear more.

Update: Verizon's 3G CDMA network appears to be up, but 4G LTE services are still unavailable. Meanwhile, Verizon reps confirmed to us that the company is looking into the outage.

Update: LTE users in New Jersey are reporting that the service is back up, and we're online in New York City as well.

Update (again): And now for something completely different: a statement from Verizon.


		Verizon Wireless 4G LTE service is returning to normal this morning after company engineers worked to resolve an issue with the 4G network during the early morning hours today.  Throughout this time, 4G LTE customers were able to make voice calls and send and receive text messages. The 3G data network operated normally.
