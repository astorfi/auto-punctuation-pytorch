The latest addition to the modular camera's bag of tricks a new 16 megapixel unit with an APS-C sensor, which comes paired with a 24-85mm zoom lens (f3.5-5.5 aperture). Unfortunately, Ricoh isn't getting specific with a price a specific release date (saying only early 2012), but photographer Cristian Sorega reports on his blog that Ricoh will make an official announcement at CES in January, with a release set for January 20th.
