Sunset is a narrative-driven exploration game about Angela Burnes, an American tourist trapped in the fictional South American city of Anchuria after a military coup in 1972 prevents her from returning home. Angela becomes a housekeeper, and once a week, an hour before sunset, she cleans the high-rise apartment of Dr. Gabriel Ortega. As Angela cleans, she uncovers secrets about Gabriel's life and his involvement in the revolution against the new dictator, Generalísimo Ricardo Miraflores.

Sunset includes music by Austin Wintory – as heard in the new story trailer (below), it's a mellow, Latin guitar kind of vibe. Sunset is due out in 2015 for PC, Mac and Linux on Steam.
