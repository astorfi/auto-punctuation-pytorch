"Obviously we want to make a game that looks the best it can on its respective format, so Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC," Massive's Martin Hulberg told Open World Games.

"We address every console, every platform as its own version, so we try to stay away from the thing where you go for the least common denominator and everybody suffers for it," Hulberg explained.
