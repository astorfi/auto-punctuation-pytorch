       Contrary to what the BDA would have you believe, the format war is far from over, but the news yesterday without a doubt extended it -- but for how long? Well, according to the NY Times, the deal between the HD DVD camp and Paramount/Dreamworks for $150 Million in incentives is for 18 months. A lot can happen in 18 months, but one thing that won't is an end to either HD DVD or Blu-ray. We can't say we blame them for going exclusive, after all we doubt there is any way they could have made $150 Million by selling Blu-ray discs between now and February 2009. We don't know about anyone else but those dual format players are looking better and better everyday.
