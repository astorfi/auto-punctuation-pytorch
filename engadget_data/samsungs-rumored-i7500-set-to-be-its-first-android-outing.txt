We'd initially heard Samsung's S8000 Cubic might well be the first Android set launched, but the::unwired's reporting that the Samsung I7500 will be the one to watch. While still all rumor and speculation, the I7500 has a mind numbing pile of features, all of which would guarantee us picking this up no matter what OS it's sporting. Starting with quad-band EDGE, dual-band HSDPA, 8GB of internal storage, a 3.2-inch capacitive OLED display (can we get a wahoo?) 5 megapixel camera, Bluetooth, WiFi, and even GPS. The I7500 is scheduled rumored to be exclusive on O2 as early as June this year for â‚¬300. That, mes amis, is some seriously tasty rumor magic, here's hoping it pans out.
