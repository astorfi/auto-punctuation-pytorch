The creature was recently shown off in Abu Dhabi, where onlookers swooned and secretly crushed on the totally macho being. Its creators have also announced that the 1.47-meter tall robot was the last prototype to be formed, as it has plans for a commercial venture "in the near future." The overriding goal for REEM-B is to have it act as a service bot for the elderly and disabled, and considering that it has no qualms reacting to voice commands and "engaging in simple conversations," we'd say it's pretty well suited to do just that. Check out the video after the break to see it in action.[Thanks, Saad]
