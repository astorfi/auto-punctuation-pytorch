And what's the space called? The Note, of course. At 5.3 inches, the thing does feel a lot more like a cell phone than a tablet -- albeit a really large one. It's still reasonably portable, certainly more so than the also recently announced Galaxy Tab 7.7, but the added screen real estate might not be worth the extra pocket space for those who don't use their portable devices to watch movies.

Interestingly, the major application here actually seems to be enterprise users. While Android 2.3 isn't particularly known for being a great business OS, the ability to scribble notes with the stylus, the "S Pen," harkens back to the old PDAs and will likely appeal to users sick of typing with their fingers. That said, we had some difficulty mastering the pen in the short time that we spent with it. Despite Samsung's insistence on the thing's accuracy, the stylus was quite slippery on the device's glossy screen, and we had a lot of difficulty being precise for simple drawings -- as you can see in the scribble above.

All in all, it's hard to envision the Note as a whole new space, and it remains to be seen whether the S Pen can indeed give the aged stylus new life. Check on our hands-on video after the break and see for yourself.
