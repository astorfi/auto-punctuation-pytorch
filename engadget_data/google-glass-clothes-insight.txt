Facial recognition? Pah. Dahling, the only way to find someone in a crowd is to pick out what they're wearing. InSight is an app being developed for Google Glass by Duke University that helps you identify your chums, even when they've got their back to you, by channeling its inner Joan Rivers. All your pals have to do is submit some self-portraits to the app, which then creates a spatiogram -- identifying the colors, textures and patterns with which they've adorned themselves. That data is then pushed to Google Glass, hopefully allowing you to avoid the usual "I'm by the store, no, the other store" routine. Then again, maybe your friends will find you first -- after all, you're the one with a computer strapped to your head.
