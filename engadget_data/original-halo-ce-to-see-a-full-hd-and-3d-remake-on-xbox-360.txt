Our friends at Joystiq have learned that the remake of Halo: Combat Evolved they've been hearing about will ship this holiday season with new art assets ready for 1080p and 3DTVs. The biggest gameplay enhancement mentioned is online co-op, so we'd suggest calling your old college roommate and clearing a weekend or two around November 15th (the ten year anniversary of the release of the original game) just in case.
