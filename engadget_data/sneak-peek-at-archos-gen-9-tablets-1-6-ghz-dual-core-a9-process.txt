The new Honeycomb slates are set for a June 2011 release and pack a 1.6GHz ARM A9 dual-core chip (the prospect of which should get you spec-heads drooling), up to a 250GB HDD / 32GB SSD, and a patent-pending "disruptive 3G modem" -- all for â‚¬400 (about $566). Archos' fiendish plan is to steal some of the iPad 2's thunder with its speedy processor and competitive price, but history tells us it'll need more than "competitive" to truly yank any marketshare. Too bad the post-PC world can't be bothered to care, right Steve?
