   After having already acquired a stake in Beats Audio, HTC is reportedly looking to expand its reach even further, with the help of a new music streaming service. That's according to a report from GigaOM, which cites unnamed sources "familiar with the company's plans." These plans apparently include a new line of tablets and handsets, along with the aforementioned streaming service, to be spearheaded by Jimmy Iovine -- Beats head and Chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M. Details, of course, remain scarce, but GigaOM's sources say that the service will be included as a default client in HTC's handsets and tablets, and that it could launch as early as this month, at Mobile World Congress. The idea, apparently, is to differentiate Peter Chow's company from its competitors, and it's one that's been in the works for quite some time. Insiders say the manufacturer is planning to launch a new tablet at this year's MWC, as well, and is reportedly working on a new, Bluetooth-controlled wireless boombox. We'll have to wait a bit longer to see whether any of this actually plays out, but we'll certainly be keeping close watch over it.
