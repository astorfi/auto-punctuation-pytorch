The company's apparently doing a little security shopping, picking up AuthenTec for $356 million, according to the mobile and network security firm. AuthenTec's in the business of content and data protection, including things like fingerprint sensors and contactless payment. Seems Apple's looking to get into that business too. AuthenTec's already worked with a number of high profile hardware makers, such as Samsung, Lenovo, LG, Nokia and Motorola.
