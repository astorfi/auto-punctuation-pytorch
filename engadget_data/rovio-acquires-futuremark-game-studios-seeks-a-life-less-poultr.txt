  In what's likely a proactive bid to prevent its one-note franchise from crashing down into unpopular orbit, Rovio's spreading its wings beyond that flock of malcontent fowl and adding to its in-house development team. Helping further speed its forward merchandising momentum is the Finnish company's recent acquisition of Futuremark Game Studios -- formerly an offshoot of benchmarking outfit Futuremark. The small developer, while nowhere near as successful as its new parent company, has a trio of titles, like Hungribles and Unstoppable Gorg, currently available across the iOS, PC and Xbox platforms. No word on what projects the studio will be tasked with under this new regime, but it's a safe bet Angry Birds Rotisserie won't be on the schedule.
