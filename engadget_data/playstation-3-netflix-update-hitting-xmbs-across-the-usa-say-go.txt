As for those old discs? Just in case you were feeling attached to the old way of doing things there is a 31 day transition period before they expire and stop working completely, however our tipster informs us once he downloaded the app he was never able to use the disc again. It certainly seems like an easy trade, but you may want to consider... nothing, there's absolutely nothing to consider. Click the X button to download, then enjoy your new coaster and National Chocolate Cupcake Day. No, really.

[Thanks, Chris]
