Pointing out that it was once mocked as something that would "never replace netbooks," Apple CEO Tim Cook boasted that the company has sold 170 million iPads since the device's launch. "Remember netbooks?" He quipped. According to Cook, there are 475,000 iPad apps, and they're not those "stretched out" apps you may see on other platforms.


Of course, Apple faces continued competition from those other platforms, and, has seen its market share drop from 60 percent of all tablet sales a year ago to 32 percent by this summer, according to IDC. However, iPads, according to Cook, are used up to four times as much as competing tablets, and are ranked first in customer satisfaction (presumably by J.D. Power).
