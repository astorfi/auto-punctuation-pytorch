Since we already knew the specs of the 'high-end' $698 package, the only real surprise here is that you're getting almost the same machine for $498 -- the only difference being a 250GB vs. 320GB hard drive -- with the price drop instead coming at the expense of "extras" like a monitor, speakers, and memory card reader. A little later in the month, those lucky enough to have been accepted into Sam's Club will have their choice of an $828 multimedia bundle featuring the same Dimension E521 desktop supplemented by NVIDIA GeForce 6150 LE graphics and another gig of RAM, or a 15.4-inch dual-core Inspiron 1501 notebook with a DVD burner, 2GB of RAM and a 120GB hard drive for a few cents under $900. Seems like Wal-Mart should be able to push a pretty decent amount of these out the door -- which is good news for Dell, because Michael and friends need all the help they can get to reclaim their top spot from those crafty competitors over at HP.
