 Leave it to photography buffs to leak product shots that are decidedly unblurry, if poorly framed. Dpreview forum goer Bibogue outed a sneak peek at the Sony NEX-F3, a mirrorless shooter that seems to be poised to replace the NEX-C3. The leaked picture appears to reveal a 16.1 megapixel sensor, a built in flash and a 180-degree tilting screen, and Bibogue says the unit sports a new peaking level feature to help fine-tune manually focused shots. The new unit seems to retain its predecessor's proprietary accessory connector as well, so prospective buyers should choose their peripherals wisely.  [Thanks, Sjoer]
