As if Google Glass and its clever surprises weren't intriguing enough, Explorers now have a new app to play with that's courtesy of The New York Times. As you'll recall, this service was first unveiled at SXSW, which delivers the latest headlines and accompanying imagery upon a wearer's request -- even to the point of reading an article aloud, if you so desire. If you're lucky enough to have Glass in your possession, you can configure the app at a special landing page on The Times' website. There, once you hit the Connect My Glass button, you'll be asked to link your Google account with the service, and grant it access to basic account information, your location and your Google Glass timeline. We've configured the app on our own headset, but for the moment, aren't able to retrieve any articles. That said, the crew at TechCrunch have found better luck, who describe the ability to easily navigate through a stream of news and photos with a quick tilt of the head. If you're willing, head on over to The New York Times' website and give the service a whirl -- and kindly share your impressions in the comments below.
