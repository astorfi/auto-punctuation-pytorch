There's the usual round of server errors that come with major software upgrades and some issues with those download codes provided for folks who recently picked up a new Mac. We confirmed the issue with Apple support, who told us to try again in about an hour. Have your Mountain Lion dreams been temporarily put on hold? Let us know in the poll below, and please sound off in the comments.%Poll-76685%
