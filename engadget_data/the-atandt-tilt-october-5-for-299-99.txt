 
Bringing all of the HTC Kaiser's joy to AT&T, the Tilt has finally been set for an October 5 launch. Besides the obvious feature of a tilting display -- hence the name -- the spec sheet reveals a 3 megapixel autofocus camera, HSDPA, stereo Bluetooth, Windows Mobile 6 Professional (the first AT&T device to officially rock it -- can ya believe it?), microSDHC slot for cards up to 32GB, WiFi, an integrated GPS receiver, and BlackBerry Connect support. Last time we checked, that pretty much covers the "superphone" checklist. Grab it starting Friday for $299.99 on contract after the full suite of rebates has been applied. Follow the break for a bonus shot of the Tilt in its upright and locked position!
