Although both watches sport a distinctly bracelet-like shape, this new timepiece for the ladies is a full wraparound design that could easily be mistaken for a piece of jewelery, especially if the display is set to loop animations in so-called "mystery mode." With the male Spectrum still difficult if not impossible to come by -- only 500 have been made so far, supposedly, priced north of $2,000 -- it's not clear when the average consumer will able to get her hands on this, but at least you protesters can stop picketing Seiko headquarters and go back to your jobs if you still have one.[Via I4U]
