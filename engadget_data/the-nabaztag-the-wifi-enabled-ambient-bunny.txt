From Violet, the designers of that USB-powered fragrance
diffuser we mentioned last year, comes the Nabaztag, a cutesy competitor for the Ambient Orb that connects up to
the Internet over WiFi (instead of an FM subcarrier network) and uses changing colors on its belly(or move its ears) to
let you know whether you have new email, or what the weather's like outside, or how the stock market is doing, etc.
There's also something or other about one Nabaztag being able to communicate with another, but it's not clear exactly
what they mean by that. Anyway, goes on sale in France later this month with a retail price of â‚¬95.
