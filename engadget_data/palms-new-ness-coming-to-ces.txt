We did, however, get one of those skips today when Palm mailed out its announcement for CES 2009, promising "all that Palm New-ness you've been waiting for." If you're an avid reader (and we know you are), then you're aware that the crew at Engadget has been waiting / wishing for said new-ness for a long, long, long time. Couple this news with recent chats we've had with sources close to the company suggesting that something kind of amazing is coming that "won't disappoint," and, well... you do the math. Seriously guys, this is the eleventh hour -- if you don't come out swinging this time, you might not get another chance at bat. Fingers crossed -- let 'em rip.
