 Instagram stayed mum on its current usage figures after its big Terms of Service brouhaha last month, but it's now finally changed its tune and offered some details on its monthly active users for the first time. According to the company, that figure currently stands at 90 million, a number that AllThingsD notes is actually up ten percent from December to January -- Instagram's Kevin Systrom also tells the site that the company "continues to see very strong growth around the world." As for how active those 90 million users are, Instagram says that they're responsible for 40 million photos per day, along with 8,500 likes per second and 1,000 comments per second. There's no word on a breakdown by Android and iOS users, or any further specifics, though.
