It's pretty much a landslide, the D700 is a major winner for Nikon. Sure, $3,000 is pricey, but for a camera that basically crams the full-frame imaging prowess of the D3 into the highly portable body of the D300 -- and left out only a few pro features in the process -- it's a relative bargain, and Nikon couldn't have done much better for itself. You'll also need to pony up for lenses that were actually built for a full-frame sensor to really get your money's worth, though our hats off to Nikon for letting you use any old lens you please. The only real complaint we heard is that the shutter feels mushy, which is a relevant criticism and an anomaly for Nikon, but unlikely to be a dealbreaker.Read - Nikonians: "She's capable of making practically all the moves of the rest of the line-up and she's arguably the most versatile of the bunch."Read - Cameralabs: "Nikon further broadens its impressive DSLR line-up and continues to throw down gauntlet after gauntlet to Canon."Read - Scott Kelby: "The D700 just takes a better looking photograph than the D300 (and really, that's what it's all about-all the rest is really just bells and whistles)."Read - Imaging Resource: "One of the finest digital SLR cameras ever produced."Read - PhotographyBLOG: "It comes across as a kind of 'greatest hits' of Nikon DSLRs."
