By this point you're probably getting immune to/annoyed by all the endless Apple tablet rumors, but if you can handle one more round of unverifiable speculation, Rob Bushway relays a report from a source who claims to have actually played with a prototype. His source says that the Apple tablet prototype he handled had instant on, a touch screen, and was running on a stripped down version of OS X. We're not even going to pretend that any of this is even close to confirmed, but Rob's source also says that the report from yesterday about Apple meeting with Intel was (at least in part) about them getting some sort of customized version of Intel's power-saving Sonoma chipset for use in a new Apple tablet.
