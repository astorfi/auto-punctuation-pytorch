As a refresher, Even More Plus was T-Mobile's way for anyone bringing their own hardware (or wishing to pay full price for new hardware) to get a discount on the monthly plan and avoid a contract, but it seems the plans were either not popular enough or too popular for comfort; unfortunately, we're not sure which. In their place, the carrier is apparently recommending customers go with a prepaid plan -- but that's not quite the same thing since there's no unlimited data option... and, well, they're prepaid instead of postpaid. We've reached out to T-Mobile for comment -- we'll let you know when we have more.

[Thanks, Mitchell]

Update: We just spoke to a customer service rep who said that they're "making some changes" and "sneaking away" the Even More Plus plans, but for the moment, they're still available -- you just need to call in to get them or speak to a store rep.
