  Now that Ice Cream Sandwich is rolling out officially in the US on Verizon, it appears at least a few developers have seen the need to roll out Android 4.0-friendly versions of their software. Just as promised a (final?) version of Flash Player of Android has hit the market specifically to make sure ICS devices can get the "full" web. Meanwhile, in a less melancholy update, Netflix also updated its Watch Instantly app to work on Android 4.0, something we're sure on-the-go movie watchers will appreciate. If you've been lucky enough to get your hands on a Galaxy Nexus LTE, let us know if you're seeing any other apps that either have received or need to get an update to keep things working smoothly.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
