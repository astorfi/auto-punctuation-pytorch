 
 After college football got its season under way last week, now it's the professional's turn. But the NFL isn't all we have for you, while a light TV schedule is supplemented by a long list of high profile Blu-ray sets arriving this week. Of course, none of them are bigger than the 32-disc Harry Potter collection pictured above, check after the break for some video of what's inside. Look below for the highlights this week, followed after the break by our weekly listing of what to look out for in TV, Blu-ray and videogames.

 Harry Potter Wizard's Collection Fans of the glasses-wearing kid wizard can invest in the massive Harry Potter Wizard's Collection Blu-ray boxed set this weekend, which arrives packing 31 discs in its collector's edition casing. 3D, never before seen bonus clips, and digital copies -- it's all in there, and all your for the low, low price of $350 or so. Whether or not you're willing to shell out that kind of cash for all eight movies, there's a video look at the set after the break as some of the series' stars take turns unboxing it. ($344.99 on Amazon, September 7th)

 NFL Our fantasy leagues are drafted, our pick 'em leagues are registered for (you're registered for ours, right?) and the beer is getting cold. It's finally time for the NFL to return to us, and it all starts Wednesday night with kickoff festivities leading up to an NFC East grudge match between the Giants and Cowboys. Of course, that's just a teaser for Sunday's action, and finally the first Monday Night Football of the year next week. It doesn't get better than this. (September 5th, NBC, 8:30PM)

 2012 Basketball Hall of Fame For basketball, the Hall of Fame covers both pro and collegiate ranks, and for 2012 it's inducting a class with members like Reggie Miller, Don Nelson, Katrina McClain, Phil Knight, Ralph Sampson, Chet Walker and Jamaal Wilkes. NBA TV is also producing a documentary about Reggie Miller that will air Tuesday night before he joins his sister Cheryl in the hall. The presentation airs Friday night, hoops fans can use it as a crutch between the Olympics / summer league festivities and the regular season which is still several weeks away. (September 7th, NBA TV, 7:30PM)
