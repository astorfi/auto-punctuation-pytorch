Toshiba and the rest of La Familia HD DVD must thought they had this one on lockdown, but Paramount
Pictures announced yesterday that they're going to hedge their bets and release movies in both Blu-ray and
HD DVD (up until yesterday they were committed
solely to HD DVD). So far they're the first — and only —
biggie to say publicly that they're going to release movies in both formats, but now that it's a virtual certainty that
both HD DVD and Blu-ray are going to make it to market we wouldn't be at all surprised to see at least couple more
studios announcing that they're gonna swing both ways.
