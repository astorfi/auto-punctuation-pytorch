 If you're the type who'd rather lug around a 2.5-inch HDD enclosure instead of dozens of easily mixed up flash cards, well, you're probably not alone, and SavitMicro has just released a device to make prolific shooters all the merrier. The company's USB 2.0 HyperDrive SPACE may look like your average Korean-bound DAP at first glance, but actually houses your choice of 2.5-inch hard drive, and can automatically transfer pictures or media from a smorgasbord of flash memory directly onto the HDD to keep your card ready for more. Aside from touting a blisteringly fast 1Gbps transfer rate (maximum), the rechargeable Li-ion purportedly lasts long enough to fill up a 100GB internal HDD, and it even sports a 1.8-inch LCD to control the action. This bad boy plays nice with CF, MicroDrive, SD, SDHC, MMC, xD, MSDuo, MSPro, and nearly every other proprietary format that Sony has kicked out. Although pricing details weren't readily available, the HyperDrive SPACE should hit webstores within the month.[Via AkihabaraNews]
