 Just when you thoughtdisgruntled iPod customers couldn't find anything else to complainabout, a Louisiana man has filed a lawsuit against Apple, complaining that the iPod can cause hearing loss. According tothe suit, the iPod can be pumped up to over 115 decibels, a level that can damage hearing, and the audio players are "inherently defective in design and are not sufficiently adorned with adequate warnings." A lawyer for theplaintiff said he didn't know if his client had suffered hearing loss, but said that's irrelevant. "He's bought aproduct which is not safe to use as currently sold on the market," the lawyer said. Given that iPods alreadyinclude warnings that state that "permanent hearing loss may occur if earphones or headphones are used at highvolume," we don't expect this one to go very far. In the meantime, we're sure someone out there is planning alawsuit over the iPod with video, claiming thatit's an unsafe device because you could be hurt if you watch videos while walking or driving.
