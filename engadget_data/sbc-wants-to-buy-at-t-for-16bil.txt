Someone at SBC must really want to get back together with AT&T—first SBC's joint-venture with BellSouth (a
little company you may know of called Cingular) consumes
AT&T Wireless, but now SBC
Communications wants in on AT&T. The whole thing is kind of antithetical to the whole Baby-Bell breakup of 1984,
but SBC (who is, incidentally, one of the Bell breakoffs from AT&T) is apparently in talks with its former parent
for a possible $16 billion buyout. True, it's possible this could be post-jealous lover thing, since BellSouth
made a bid for AT&T in 2003 and backed out last minute, but it makes sense being that SBC apparently wants to beef
up its home-broadband and data services, and if nothing else, AT&T's already got the most comprehensive fiber
backbone in America. Not to mention their clear delineation between home and business services, respectively. We're
telling you, the telecommunications industry is getting so seedy and incestuous these days.
