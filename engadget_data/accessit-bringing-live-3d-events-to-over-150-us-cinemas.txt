 Remember that one-off Mavericks / Clippers matchup that was shown in 3D in a Dallas-area cinema? If AccessIT has its way, those types of events will be popping up all over the United States here soon. Said outfit has just announced plans to install 150 of its CineLive systems in major markets throughout America. The technology will enable the "live broadcast to movie theaters of both 2D and 3D events such as sports and concerts," and while 50 installs are scheduled to start immediately, the other hundred should be completed by the year's end.
