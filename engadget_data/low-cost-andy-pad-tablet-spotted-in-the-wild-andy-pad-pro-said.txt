What's more, while the basic Andy Pad keeps things cheap with a resistive touchscreen, the company's also now confirmed there will be an additional Andy Pad Pro model that packs a much more welcome capacitive display, plus both front and rear-facing cameras (among other "additional features"). Unfortunately, it's not clear if that aforementioned 16GB model and the Pro are, in fact, one in the same -- Andy Pad itself hasn't confirmed a price for the latter, and is only saying that it will be aimed at early adopters. We'll let you know more as we get it.
