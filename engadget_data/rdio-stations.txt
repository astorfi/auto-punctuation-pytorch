It's been less than a week since Spotify showed the world its new Browse feature, and now Rdio wants in on that action. The vowel-skipping music streaming service is revamping its Stations offering, starting with a player redesign, which includes voting on songs and station fine tuning and pivoting. Users can also create 10 types of different stations, starting with an artist, song or one of the service's 400 or so sub-genre selections. You FM, meanwhile, utilizes Facebook likes, Twitter follows, listening history and track votes to curate a customized listening experience. You can also build stations based on your friends' listening habit. The above offerings are available now on iOS, Android and in the browser.
