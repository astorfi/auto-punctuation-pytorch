Palm's US site now lists the Treo Pro in glossy black "obsidian" for the expected $549 with shipping anticipated in two to three weeks. We'll admit, there's something vaguely sexy about an unlocked smartphone with North American 3G -- no matter how ancient the platform might be. Any chance this'll be upgradeable to Nova, Palm?[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
