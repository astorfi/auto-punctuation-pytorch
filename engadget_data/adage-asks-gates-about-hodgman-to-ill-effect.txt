Check out this exchange from a recent interview of Gatesy by Advertising Age's Bob Garfield:AdAge: I want to ask you one more thing: Those Mac ads -- how do you feel about the John Hodgman character? Gates: I can't comment on someone else's ad. AdAge: OK ... but he's you. Gates: Yeah, I'm not gonna comment on someone else's ad. AdAge: OK, well, Bill Gates, thank you so much for joining us. (Silence) AdAge: Can I just have a clean goodbye? (Silence) AdAge: OK, can you just say goodbye? Thank you or goodbye or something like that? Gates: Goodbye. [Oh, and it was curt alright.]Damn son. We might recommend just pretending you're Justin Long (aka Mac) next time, and see what happens.[Via digg]
