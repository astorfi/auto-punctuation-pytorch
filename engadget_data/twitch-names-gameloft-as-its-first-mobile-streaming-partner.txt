Prior to its recent Xbox One launch, Twitch accounted for 1.8 percent of peak US internet traffic -- and it doesn't even do mobile streaming. That's about to change, however, as Gameloft's ultra-popular Asphalt 8: Airborne stunt and racing game is set to arrive on iOS with Twitch functionality. On top of broadcasting, sharing and archiving gameplay, you'll be able to use your iOS device's camera and microphone to stream video of yourself and monitor chat. To start the festivities, Gameloft will host a 24-hour livestream today, replete with dev team interviews, giveaways and a walkthrough of the options. The update arrives to the App Store soon, but you'll need to implement Twitch service on a game-to-game basis. The new functionality is optimized for the iPhone 5S, iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina.
