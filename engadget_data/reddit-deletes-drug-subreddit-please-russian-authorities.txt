A few days later and the site has returned, mostly because it rolled over and locally blocked the offending content to please the country's internet regulator, Roskomnadzor. The move has attracted criticism from the user who posted the piece originally, saying that the site shouldn't give in to the demands. The plea fell on deaf ears over at Reddit HQ, however, since the company is still suffering through an existential crisis about what forms of speech it will and won't allow.
