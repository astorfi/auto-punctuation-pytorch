Nokia's biggest announcements in Abu Dhabi today are focusing on Lumia devices first and foremost, but it's not leaving the Asha lineup out in the Finnish cold. After boasting that 26 million Ashas have sold so far, the company's announced that it's adding three successors to the Asha 501, the petite smartphone/featurephone hybrid released in May: the 500, the 502 and the 503. All three sport the same primary colored plastic casing as the 501, but with a new "Ice" layer of transparent polycarbonate. They'll be available in bright red, bright green, yellow, cyan, white and black.






Honing in on Asha's social initative, one of the new features is the ability to take a photo with a single swipe, after which you can share it instantly to your social network of choice with a single tap. Even though Whatsapp has been available for Asha phones for awhile now, Nokia highlighted the app at the event, noting that there are over 350 million active Whatsapp users around the globe. It proudly claimed that Whatsapp registers 250,000 users everyday through Nokia handsets, though it wouldn't break down users per platform. Nokia also announced that the social feature on Fastlane, Asha's list-like view of recent activity, is now customizable. For 501 users who might feel a little left out, don't fret, as these features will be available to you via an over-the-air update as well.

Back to the new hardware, it was revealed that the 500 has a 2.8-inch screen and a 2-megapixel camera, while both the 502 and the 503 have 3-inch screens and 5-megapixel cameras with LED flash. The 503 is clearly the best of the bunch, as it also has Gorilla Glass 2 and 3G connectivity. All three have WLAN, quad-band EDGE and boasts one month of battery standby time. They're all available with dual SIM capabilities, though the 500 and the 503 also come in a single SIM variant. The 500, 502 and 503 are priced at $69, $89 and $99 respectively. Availability is set for around Q4 of this year. They'll all be for sale in Africa, APAC, Europe and the Middle East, while the 500 and the 503 will be available in Latin America as well.
