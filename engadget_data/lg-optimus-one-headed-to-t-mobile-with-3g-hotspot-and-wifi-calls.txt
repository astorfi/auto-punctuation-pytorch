We knew the quad-band GSM handset was going to have a shot of Froyo on top of some fairly middling specs, but here's an unexpected treat: the Android handset just might be the first Android device with UMA support. If you've already forgotten what that particular acronym means, we don't blame you, as Unlicensed Mobile Access hasn't held the spotlight since the days of HotSpot@Home, but suffice it to say the tech uses a WiFi access point to make free VoIP calls, no cell signal (or minutes) required. It'd be easy to point to this move as a nefarious T-Mobile plot to free up cellular bandwidth a la the femtocell, except it apparently also works the other way, too -- the Optimus One will allegedly let you share that HSDPA 7.2 Mbps connection over WiFi with your thirsty laptop.
