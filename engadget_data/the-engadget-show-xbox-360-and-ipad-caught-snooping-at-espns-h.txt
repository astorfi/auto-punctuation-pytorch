ESPN's got far more technology going on than you might imagine, with an entire "emerging technology" group dedicated to sprucing up the content you see on screen. We couldn't quite squeeze everything into The Show, so here we've cut up an extended version of our tour that shows off even more of the magic behind the scenes. Ever wonder if a place like ESPN would rely on common toys like an Xbox 360 or iPad to control on-screen play demonstrations? Curious to know what kind of sensor tag technology is being worked on to give viewers a real-time look at how high skateboards (and eventually snowboards) are getting in halfpipe? Hop on past the break and mash play -- there's a lot more to ESPN than just homers, World Cup equalizers and Not Top 10s.
