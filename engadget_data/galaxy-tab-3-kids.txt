We're no experts in Korean back-to-school literature, but it looks as if one retailer has tipped Samsung's plans a little early. If the documents above are legitimate, then the company will launch a kiddie-focused Galaxy Tab in short order. The Galaxy Tab 3 Kids is said to be an 8.5-inch slate with a 1.2GHz dual-core CPU, a 1,024 x 600 WSVGA display, 8GB storage, 1GB RAM and Jelly Bean. The company has also seen fit to include 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 3.0, a microSD card slot (no word on capacity) and a 4,000mAh battery. One thing that lends weight to the listing is that the device's model number is SM-T2105, which evleaks tersely described as a "Galaxy Tab for children" a month ago. There's more pictures over at the source, but not a single spec saying that this new device is resistant to jam-smeared fingers.
