It's a model that GameStop is embracing by offering digital PC game purchases through its retail locations. There are certain benefits to buying from a brick and mortar location -- for one thing, customers can use trade-in credits for their purchases. And those who pre-order a digital copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution -- the first game being offered through this model -- will receive some extras including downloads of earlier entries in the series. Just be mindful of pop-ups -- they're way worse in real life.
