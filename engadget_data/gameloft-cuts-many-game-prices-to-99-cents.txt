 More than a few of us are getting phones and tablets as gifts this year, and Gameloft wants to be there the moment we're hunting for new apps to feed our devices. Accordingly, the developer has slashed the price on many of its recent games to 99 cents during the holidays, even including better-known titles like Asphalt 7 and Dark Knight Rises. Not surprisingly, the discounting doesn't include Modern Combat 4 and a few other releases -- there have to be profit-makers left somewhere, after all -- but it's a huge break for those who want a few starter titles and aren't concerned about always having the latest and greatest. Both Android and iOS gamers can splurge at the source links.
