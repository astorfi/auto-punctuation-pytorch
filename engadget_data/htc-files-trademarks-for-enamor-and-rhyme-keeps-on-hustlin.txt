Okay, not really... but a couple of new names were filed with the USPTO last week, as it keeps spittin' game in the mobile marketplace. Four total trademark applications were filed for the HTC Enamor and HTC Rhyme -- covering smartphones and tablets along with their hardware and software cohorts. No specs have been revealed (or much else) as of yet, but if you'd like to scope out the particulars for yourself, hit the source links below.
