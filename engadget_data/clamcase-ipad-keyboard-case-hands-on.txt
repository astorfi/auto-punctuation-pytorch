In our few moments actually using the thing, we can say that it's got a sturdy build quality and a decent keyboard; although there's a fair amount of travel, it just feels a bit cheap. It's also a bit cramped, but as the company rep pointed out to us, it's as large as they could've made it without adding to the iPad's already large bezel. We'll update this post when a real review unit lands back on our trailer front door, but for now enjoy our photos below.
