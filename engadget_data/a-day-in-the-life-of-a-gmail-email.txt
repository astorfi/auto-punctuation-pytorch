 
 Electronic mail, or email to those in the know, has become so ubiquitous and transparent that many take for granted the effort and engineering required to make this near-instant communication medium a reality. In an effort to remind the general public about this digital miracle, Google (a company that knows a thing or two about the subject) has launched a new mini-site dubbed The Story of Send. The web novella leverages animations and videos to explain what happens to a Gmail dispatch once it's jettisoned from your mail client of choice. Message transmission, data security and green computing initiatives are just a few of the topics on the menu. Saunter past the break, have a peek at the video primer then make sure to check out the full Story of Send site.
