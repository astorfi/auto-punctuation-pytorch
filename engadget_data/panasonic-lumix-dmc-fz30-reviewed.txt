It may borrow its looks from a DSLR and its lens from Leica, but Panasonic's 8 megapixel
Lumix DMC-FZ30 is a prosumer EVF (electronic viewfinder),
and that's fine with Megapixel.net. The site gave the camera high marks for image quality, ergonomics, focusing and
lens. The reviewer liked the DMC-FZ30's 12x stabilized zoom lens, calling itÂ  "the most attractive feature of the
camera." While the $600 price tag might drive some potential customers to spend a couple of hundred more on a DSLR, a
host of beginner-friendly features (preset modes include "Soft Skin Mode," designed to remove wrinkles, and "Party
Mode" for low-light shooting), as well as a solid movie mode, may be enough to keep some high-end customers in the EVF
fold.
