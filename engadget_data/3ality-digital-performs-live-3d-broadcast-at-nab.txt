The 30-minute program was a live feed of Howie Mandel and company showing off a new game show (dubbed Would You Rather?) that could eventually pass the muster and end up on NBC. Notably, the transmission occurred via a single stream using an existing broadcast infrastructure, and folks on the other end were able to see just how swell 3D broadcasts can be -- even when live. The demo was established in order to prove that live 3D airings (for sporting events, game shows, etc.) are indeed viable, but until folks start gathering at cinemas or ditching their current sets for 3D-ready versions, we can't imagine this (incredibly intriguing idea) having mass appeal.[Image courtesy of Yahoo]
