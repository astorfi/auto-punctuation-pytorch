 Improv Electonics' Boogie Boards will continue to lay waste to old-fashioned notepads this year, with a couple of new models joining the company's catalogue. If their current eWriters are a little too big for your liking, you'll be pleased to hear about the Boogie Board Jot 4.5 (stage left), a smaller and lighter entry to the range for quick scribbles, with a couple of holes in the rim for pinning the slab to a corkboard (or something similar). The Boogie Board Sync 9.7 (stage right), however, is bigger and significantly more functional. It'll save any notes you wish to keep to its SD memory, and will also be able to send them to other devices via Bluetooth. Improv Electronics says it'll be compatible with Evernote, OCR and Adobe Illustrator, and some free software will allow it to function as a virtual whiteboard, among other things. Both new Boogie Boards will be bringing their reflex LCD screens to stores all the way off in Q4 2013, and currently, we don't have any info on how much paper you'll be trading in to bring one home.
