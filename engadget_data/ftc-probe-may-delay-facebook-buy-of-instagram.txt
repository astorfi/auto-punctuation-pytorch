Citing the ever-present "people familiar with the matter," the FT believes the Federal Trade Commission is orchestrating a competition probe. These kinds of investigations are common for most deals over $66 million -- we suspect the $1 billion Instagram pact qualifies -- but could add six months to a year to Facebook's originally planned spring closure date. The deal is still expected to go through, and you can keep tilt-shifting your photos to death in the meantime; just don't expect those shots to blanket friends' Facebook walls anytime soon.
