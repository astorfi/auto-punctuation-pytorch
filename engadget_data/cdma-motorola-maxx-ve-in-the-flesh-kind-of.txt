The device has been updated with a new color scheme, will support VCAST Video and Music (sorry, no TV support here fellas), EV-DO, have a 2 megapixel shooter with expandable microSD memory, and that infamous Verizon interface. Other than that, we are on pins and needles hungering for more information. Anyone care to share?
