Find yourself tweeting a lot of photos this time of year? Well, the microblogging outfit has just made that task easier for iPhone users. Twitter made a change to its iOS app today that automatically brings up a device's photo repository first, instead of the usual keyboard for composing a 140-character message. Need to type a text-only update? Tapping in the white box will bring up the requisite tool for doing so. It seems the company has taken notice of increased snapshot popularity as it continues to roll out new items like the recent images in Direct Messages and retooled filters. Photo-first composition shows up in the iOS version automatically without the need to update; however, there's no mention of the feature hitting the Android app.
