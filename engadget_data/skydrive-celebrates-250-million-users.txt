Microsoft's celebrating a rather important milestone for SkyDrive: 250 million users, with 50 million of those signing up in just the last seven months since the debut of Windows 8. With the cloud storage service being so tightly integrated into Microsoft's new OS, it's no surprise that its popularity has started to skyrocket. And, with recent upgrades to the platform, it's becoming an increasingly viable alternative to competitors like Dropbox, Google Drive, Box and SugarSync. To commemorate the milestone, Microsoft has a nice self-congratulatory infographic at the source filled with all sorts of fun stats about Redmond and its favored file-syncing system.
