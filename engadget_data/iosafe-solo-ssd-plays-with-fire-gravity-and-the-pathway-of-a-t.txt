Today's entrant is ioSafe's Solo SSD, which Extreme Tech took for a few rounds to determine its actual survivability. Spoiler alert: the SSD drive is still functional in the end, and it's really none too surprising when you realize the test site is run by ioSafe itself -- who else would have such an appropriate location handy? Still, the journey is what's interesting here, and there's plenty of pictures of incineration, falling, and drowning here -- and even a video of an intimate encounter with a tractor tread. Jigsaw would be proud. Video after the break.
