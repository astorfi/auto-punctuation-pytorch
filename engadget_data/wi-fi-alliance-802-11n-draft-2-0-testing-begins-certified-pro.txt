 In a move meant to ensure compatibility across vendors, the Wi-Fi Alliance has started interoperability testing of 802.11n Draft 2.0 products. That means "WiFi Certified" products should hit for retail before summer is out. Besides sporting that swank new logo, the certification should provide some peace of mind related to WPA2 security, WMM QoS for video streaming, and compatibility with legacy 802.11a/b/g regardless of the manufacturer. While cross-platform certification testing of a draft spec is unusual and likely won't guarantee 100% compatibility, it's still a welcome step by the industry given the troubled history of interconnecting disparate 802.11 draft devices in the past. Besides, with the final IEEE spec (already two and half years in the making) not expected until September 2008, what else could Apple, Dell, Sony, Nokia, Cisco and the other 250 or so members do in the face of such mucho demand?
