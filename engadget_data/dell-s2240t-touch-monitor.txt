Dell may already have a 23-inch multi-touch display, but if you're looking for something a little smaller and cheaper, then we have good news for you. The company informed us of its new model named "S2240T," a 21.5-inch touch monitor with the same 1,920 x 1,080 resolution as its larger sibling. It also stands on a sliding base that can tilt as much as 60 degrees, but unlike the other model this one can't lay flat. Other features include HDMI, DVI and VGA ports, as well as a relatively efficient power consumption of just 20W. Dell's already offering the S2240T on its website for $399.99 -- quite a drop from the S2340T's $699.99 price tag. Hit the source link for more information.
