While we always enjoy a peek into the future of mobile devices -- it pains us that said pics are always out of focus and taken in dark rooms; aren't spy-types supposed to be hooked up with cool James Bond-like gadgets? Sophia is touted as having a 5 MP camera, HSDPA, and maybe even WiFi. Of course all of this is pure speculation - we may learn more between now and CeBIT -- or not. We will leave it all up to your imagination at this point, though all signs seem to point to a very strong not likely. As per usual, if you have a believable better pic, please send it in.
