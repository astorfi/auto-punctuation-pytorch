    What's a lazy Friday afternoon without a bit of completely unsubstantiated rumor mongering? Sure, it's possible that Ed Zander himself wrote this SCPL mockup on a napkin over a recent lunch, but we're thinking it more likely the doings of a fanboy with too much time on his hands. Anyways, the specs are as set above: 0.2-inches thick (compared to the 0.27-inch chubster X820 from Samsung),QVGA display, 512MB flash memory, microSD slot, 3.5mm headphone jack, FM radio (pushing it), Bluetooth 2.0 and a titanium-alloy build. We'd be pretty happy with about half of that, but we're sure this won't be the last savory rumor to drool over before we find out for reals.
