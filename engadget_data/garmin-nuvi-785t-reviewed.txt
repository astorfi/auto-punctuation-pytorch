 
Garmin launched its updated 7x5 series of nuvi navigators back in August, but the high-end MSN Direct-equipped 785T is just hitting stores, and GPS Magazine says it's a solid improvement over previous nuvis -- but if you're not willing to pay the $50 / year for the MSN service, you're probably not going to miss it. The 785T drew high marks for its fast frame rate, nice 3D lane guidance / upcoming turn features, and semi-realistic building displays, but the MSN Direct traffic implementation was less accurate than the free traffic service built into lesser T-series nuvis, and download speeds for the service weren't particularly swift. We're not all that sold on the connected GPS concept yet, so we're inclined to take the reviewer's advice and pick up the otherwise-identical non-connected 765T, but click on for the full exhaustive review to decide for yourself.
