This little gaffe was too good to pass up, so we're passing it on: The Wall Street Journal put out a Friday
afternoon article on SBC's new IPTV set top boxes that ended with the following curious statement: "SBC's Internet-TV
boxes will be smaller than a typical cable box. Cable boxes need to be big enough to store all channel programming at
once, but because Internet-based boxes stream only one channel at a time, they don't need the extra space." Looks like
somebody's got their idea of "space" a little confused â€” we sure hope there aren't too many folks out there wondering
whether or not they should get a bigger cable box to squeeze more channels into.
