Besides toting a 7-inch display with Vista tucked inside a 120GB disk (we think) purring along on a 1.6GHz processor of unspecified Intel make (Silverthorne, please?) we really can't tell you much. Forgive us but the show doesn't open for a few more days -- instead of marketing types the booth is currently staffed with a mustachioed security brute named Dieter. Nevertheless, from the outside we can tell you that it sports a pair of USB jacks, memory card slot, kick-stand for watching videos, and controls in line with the 5-inch R50a. And judging by the way it's displayed as a dashboard-mounted device, it's safe to say that integrated GPS is at least an option. We'll find out more just as soon as ASUS decides to make the R70 official.
