That word comes straight from Microsoft's director of developer relations, Bandon Watson, who confirmed today's release on the PPCGeeks podcast last night, and also announced that the Windows Phone Developer Tools software was about to cross one million download mark. In addition to copy and paste, the new update also includes a number of performance improvements that promise to speed up application launch times -- here's hoping the release is also a sign that Microsoft is about to speed up the roll out to Windows Phone 7 users.
