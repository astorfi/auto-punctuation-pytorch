Apparently the render pictured here is the Sony Ericsson P700i, but we were under the impression it was the M610i (we peeped an XML doc on SE's site that seemed to imply the M610i was "real"). Sony Ericsson's "P" series handsets have always been touch screen, UIQ affairs -- think P800, P900, P910, P990 -- so this is throwing us for a bit of a loop. Whatever the case may be, the specs we're seeing include a 2.6 inch QVGA screen, 3.2 megapixel shooter, 3G, Bluetooth, WiFi, and that rocker-style QWERTY keyboard. If there is anybody out there with more info that feels inspired to chime in, please be our guests!
