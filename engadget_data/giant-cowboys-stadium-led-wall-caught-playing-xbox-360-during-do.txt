Thankfully, Jonas Brothers video director Steve Fatone somehow pulled himself away from concert preparations to do just that earlier this week, and apparently became the first person to ever play Xbox 360 on the display in the process. As you can see above and in the gallery below, the two certainly seem to be made for each other, although it looks like the controller can get a tad touchy if you stray too far while trying to play it.Update: Our man Steve hooked us up with a video of the rig in action -- head after the break to check it out.[Thanks, Steve; photos thanks to Troy]
