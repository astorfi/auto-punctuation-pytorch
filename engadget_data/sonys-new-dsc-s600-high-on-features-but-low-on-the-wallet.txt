TheDSC-S600 retails at SonyStyle for a $199 pre-order and gets you a 6 megapixel res, 32 MB of internal memory, and whatSony claims is their longest effective flash at 33 feet. The long flash throw is helped by reviewing 49 light points inthe frame and by the high-light sensitivity of up to 1000 ISO. For two-hundred clams, Sony throws in a sharp Carl ZeissVario Tesslar wide-angle zoom lens of 31 to 93mm which also helps cap MPEG video at 30 fps in VGA. Add in the standardMemory Stick Duo media slot and two-inch LCD screen and it's not so budget when you think about the whole package, isit now?
