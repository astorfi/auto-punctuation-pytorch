We had presumed it to be regular maintenance since it's not Tuesday and there's not a single Apple rumor in the mix that would warrant such a quiet product launch. Then we peeped MacRumors and low and behold Arn's got a source claiming 4GB iPod shuffles (up from 2GB) are on the way in black, silver, and possibly other colors. Makes sense to us.
