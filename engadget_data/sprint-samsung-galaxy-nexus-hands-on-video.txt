  We were giddy with excitement when Sprint's VP of Product David Owens came onto our stage at CES 2012 and gave us the very first peek at its version of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, one of the Now Network's inaugural entries into the world of LTE sometime in the first half of 2012. It's certainly a fair way to get the next-gen lineup started, we'd say. As was expected, the exterior of both phones are nearly twins, with differences only found in the branding and the inclusion of Google Wallet -- not to mention the exclusion of pre-loaded bloatware -- on Sprint's version. We got some extra hands-on time with the Nexus, but sadly weren't able to get too comfortable with it, as the phone is far from being a final product and still had early software builds. But we were able to get plenty of images and a video to show off below the break.
