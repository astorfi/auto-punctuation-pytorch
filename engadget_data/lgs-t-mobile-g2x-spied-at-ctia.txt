 
Welcome to the CTIA 2011 show floor where the booths are guarded and all the products are kept under lock and key! Oh yes, it's pretty impossible to see what's going to be unveiled here tomorrow when the doors officially open, but we did spot this lovely digital sign at LG's booth of the T-Mobile G2x. This one doesn't come as a major surprise since we heard rumblings last month that Optimus 2X would be headed stateside under the G2x moniker, but it certainly looks like the launch is imminent now. We've got one more shot for you after the break, but stay tuned for plenty more tomorrow.
