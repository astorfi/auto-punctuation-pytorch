 Toshiba's Qosmio G30 maybe the first laptop to launch with a built-in HD DVD drive, but it certainly won't be the last. And as of now, it lookslike Acer will be next to market with the Aspire 9800, a media-centric semi-portable due to hit Europe next month. TheAcer laptop, in addition to its HD drive, will feature a mammoth 20-inch 1680x1050display, NVIDIA GeForce Go 7600, digital/analog hybrid tuner, 1.3 megapixel webcam, DVI-D outand up to 240GB of storage. No official pricing yet, but word on the street puts this baby at over $2,600. Oh, one morething. Acer has three asterisks next to its claim that the box will include HD DVD, leading to a footnote indicating thedrive will be an option "when available." So, depending on whether or not the drivemaker (which may well beAcer itself) gets the units in on time, this may arrive next month sans HD DVD.[Via Stuff]
