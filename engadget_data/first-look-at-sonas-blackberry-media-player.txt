On that ever-shortening list is support for streaming video, and as we told you a couple months back, Sona Mobile is looking to do something about that. Their Media Player appears to presently support the 7130 and 8700 series; it's still in beta form, and this user's first look verifies that, claiming it takes over four minutes to download a 1:30 video, slowing down the device significantly in the process. Reports on picture quality are mixed, but even if the videos crystal clear, download times are going to have to improve for the product to be anything but a novelty.
