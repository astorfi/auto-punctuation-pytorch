When the interface designers at Feng GUI decided they couldn't wait for their Boxee Box, they built their own -- at five times the height. Essentially a PC, speakers, IR receiver, and monitor crammed into a wood box, this is definitely one of the more pointless mods we've encountered in a long time -- but we'll be damned if it doesn't look good!
