The 5-foot 2-inch, 220-pound RI-MAN features plush arms and chest perched atop a wheeled base. A5-milimeter layer of soft silicone covers 320 pressure sensors jacketing most of the upper body including the face,arms, and chest. This allows it to perform such delicate work as lifting perplexed patients into its arms wherepresumably it will whisper little “coo-coo” sounds prior to crushing its victim into a liquid fuel beverage– which of course all robots will do once they obtain consciousness, right?
