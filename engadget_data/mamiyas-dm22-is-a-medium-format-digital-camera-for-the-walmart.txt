It comes with a Mamiya 80mm f/2.8 D Series lens, has a 22 megapixel sensor and can pump images straight out over FireWire if you think your RAW files are too good for a lowly CompactFlash card. It's also being introduced with a $14,990 sibling, the DM28, which has a 28 megapixel sensor and handles higher ISO shots.
