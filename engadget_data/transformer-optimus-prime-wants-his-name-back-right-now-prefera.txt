It doesn't matter that the Transformer Prime really does transform -- you know, in real-life -- or that it exists in a non-competing market, or that the latest Transformers movie was a complete waste of everybody's time. Nope, Hasbro still feels the need to "aggressively protect its brands and products" from illusory enemies, and it's fully prepared to threaten ASUS with a sales injunction until some sort of conciliatory gesture appears on its bank statement. If this lawsuit takes hold -- please, not another DÃ¼sseldorf -- then we promise that our future children will never buy, watch or touch a single Hasbro product. Except maybe that R2-D2 version of Operation, which is pretty sweet.
