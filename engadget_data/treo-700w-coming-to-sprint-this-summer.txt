 
By now pretty much everyone (at least everyone who cares) knows full well that Sprint is getting ready to intro Palm's new Treo 700p sometime later this month, but what's been a little less clear is when (if ever) Sprint was going to get the Treo 700w, the Windows Mobile-powered version which Verizon currently has an exclusive on. Well, we don't have an exact release date, but a highly reliable source has been able to confirm for us that Sprint will indeed be getting the Treo 700w and that they'll be launching it about four to eight weeks after they launch the Treo 700p. P.S. - Yup, that's the Verizon version of the 700w pictured above; we have yet to see any images of the Sprint-branded version.
