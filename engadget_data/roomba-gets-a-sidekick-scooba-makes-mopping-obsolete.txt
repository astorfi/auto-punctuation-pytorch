iRobot, deities of all things floor-cleaning and robotic, have introed a new sibling to the
Roomba robotic
vacuum/child herder. The Scooba is designed for some
industrial strength cleaning action on your tile and linoleum floors, which it achieves by first vacuuming up the
flotsam and jetsam, then applying a liquid cleaner, and following up by drying the floor — making it also safe when
used on wood floors. Price isn't set, though iRobot CEO Colin Angle promised consumers "won't get sticker shock." As to
availability, limited supplies will supposedly be available "this holiday season," which we can only assume means that
whole December 25th time frame — apparently in America, it is the only holiday.
