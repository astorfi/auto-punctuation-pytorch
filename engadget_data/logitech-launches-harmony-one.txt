Centrally-located transport controls and good separation on the numeric inputs go a long way to addressing our gripes. They're touting the "same one-touch, activity-based control" as existing models, so no telling if the programming side of the house has been revamped. We're hoping they take the one-size fits all wizard approach and make tweaks and adjustments a little more easily accessible. Control freaks and those who make a habit of shuffling their gear (sound like anyone familiar?) would really appreciate a more direct way to tweak out their remotes!
