The Always Innovating Touch Book -- a hybrid netbook / tablet -- which we knew was very nearly on its way, is now, apparently, on its way! That's correct -- if you were smart enough to pre-order, you've probably already received an email confirming that your Touch Book has shipped. We'll be anxious to see one of these dudes in a photoshoot, that's for sure. If you've forgotten, these dudes pack an 8.9-inch, 1,024 x 600 touchscreen, a USB 802.11 b/g/n adapter, Bluetooth, a TI OMAP3530 CPU, and 512MB of memory (split 50 / 50 between RAM and NAND), plus a further 8GB of storage on an SD card. The company's website says it may take "several weeks" to fulfill all the pre-orders, so we'll let you know if we get any updates. What about you? Did you order a Touch Book -- or know anyone who did?
