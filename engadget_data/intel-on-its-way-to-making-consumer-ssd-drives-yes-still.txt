 SSDs definitely seem like the boldest new frontier in computer electronics these days, and Intel, which lately has been making some solid developments in the NAND memory department, is apparently still on track to do that whole SSD thing they've been talking about. According to CNET, Intel's NAND marketing manager Troy Winslow supposedly said the company would be coming up with some 80 - 160GB capacity drives in Q2, and 128GB capacity drives in Q3. Sounds to us like someone got something wrong, but there's no denying Intel and its respective partners Micron and STMicroelectronics are out to make a dent in the hard drive market of tomorrow.
