In hybrid mode the five door "sportback" (sporty!) will go from 0-62 MPH in 7.9 seconds, reach a top speed of 124 MPH and squeeze up to 72.4 miles from a gallon of fuel. When in electric mode, however, the vehicle will take you more than 60 miles on a single charge. The adjustable drivetrain / drive shaft / shock absorber system allows drivers to choose between two modes: sport mode (for optimum acceleration) and efficiency mode. The latter not only makes best use of the lithium-ion battery but also ties into the vehicle's on-board navigation, taking your route (and the car's altitude) into consideration when computing things like power usage and regeneration phases. The A1 also allows select cellphones to act as a mobile control unit for WLAN access to the vehicle's navigation, audio and remote monitoring of the security system.
