Previously geared toward Russian and European audiences, its creator now hopes to make a splash with the device at CES. The ViewPhone 3 features dual-SIM technology and will be primarily marketed in Latin America. Connectivity wise, it offers quadband GSM and EDGE, although for North American purposes, 3G is limited to the 850MHz spectrum. Further, it carries a 3.5-inch HVGA display, 512MB of RAM and delivers two upgrades over the international version -- an 800MHz Qualcomm CPU and Android 2.3. For those in the states who really want in on the action, ViewSonic intends to sell an unlocked version for a mere $250.
