Sky is shedding a little light today on its next-generation Now TV box and a new monthly streaming plan for Sky Sports. Its refreshed hardware, which slipped out earlier this year in an investor presentation, will debut this August for £14.99 with an ethernet port and a five times faster processor. It's based on the Roku 3 player, the same as the company's "Sky Online TV Box" in Italy, which means it should finally support 1080p streaming too.



The broadcaster is keeping its Now TV daily and weekly passes for Sky Sports, but revealed today that it's also preparing a monthly tier for those who want to watch their favourite teams week-in, week-out. It'll cost £31.99 per month and be available in time for the new football season. Finally, Sky is also refreshing the Now TV user interface to make it "quicker and easier" to navigate. The broadcaster has again refrained from giving a specific release date, but says later updates in the year will improve discovery, tagging and bookmarking, and also add the ability to auto-play next episodes.
