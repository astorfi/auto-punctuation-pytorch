The lucky two are Whrrl -- a social mapping service that allows its users to mark and rate restaurants, entertainment, and events -- and iControl, a home automation app for doing the usual range of light, sound, and appliance control tasks that one might want to do from a handheld device. It really is like winning the lottery, too -- Kleiner claims to have received proposals from over 1,700 companies hoping to get a piece of the iFund pie, but besides these two, the fund has only made an offer to one other project so far.
