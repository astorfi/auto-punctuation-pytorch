This is one of thosestraddles-the-ultraportable-line laptops that's a solid 4.5 pounds, a number still more than portable enough than toget you by on naught but the most greuling business trips. With it you'll get that whole Centrino thing, a 1280 x 768screen, a built-in 1.3 megapixel digital camera, gigabit Ethernet, 1394, four USB 2.0 ports, S/PDIF out, a 4-in-1memory card reader, and a VGA port (you guys know Apple's had DVI on their laptops like for forever, right Alienware?).Prices start as low as $900, but if after all the gift giving you did this holiday season you're not feeling tooparsimonious to yourself, Alienware would be more than happy to let you drop up to a good $3,000 on one.Read
