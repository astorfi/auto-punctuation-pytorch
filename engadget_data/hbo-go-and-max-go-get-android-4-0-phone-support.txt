New updates to the respective mobile apps take care of that: either premium channel will now stream directly to a phone running Google's latest OS (assuming you're subscribed to pay-TV, that is). Speed-ups and bug fixes are in the upgrades, too. Oddly, Android 4.0 tablets have yet to make the leap, ruling out your Transformer Pad TF300 for catching up on episodes of True Blood.
