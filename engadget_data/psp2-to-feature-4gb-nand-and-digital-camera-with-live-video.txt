Theoff-the-shelf video camera is said to be located directly below the PSP's screen (where the logo is currently) andpresumably of the MotionEye variety already available in some Sony Ericsson phones and Vaio laptops. Oh, andthat 8GB ofNAND storage rumor -- not gonna happen according to this source. It'll still be NAND but of the 4GB varietyinstead. We should also see about 1/4-inch whittled off the current PSP choice of black, white, andsilver. We're not in a position to vouch or validify any of these rumors, however, so if it doesn't happen, not ourdeal (but if it turns out to be true, you heard it here first -- hopefully)![Via TGDaily]
