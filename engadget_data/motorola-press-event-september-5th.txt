 
 September 5th is going to be a pretty busy day, by the looks of it. While we'll likely get to see a few Windows Phone 8 devices in Nokia's Lumia lineup in the morning, Motorola has scheduled a Save the Date for the afternoon. We're not sure exactly what to expect, though it's certainly possible we'll see a Droid RAZR HD or XT907 to balance out whatever Stephen Elop will be showing off. (We especially love the dig at Nokia by saying it's "the day's main event.") We'll keep you posted as we hear more, and we'll be there to give you word on the latest and greatest from HelloMoto.
