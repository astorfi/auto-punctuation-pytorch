It's a pen, it's a phone, it's a… yeah, yeah.  Chinese manufacturer Haier (who you may know formaking just about everything else in your house but a phone) have created the P7 pen phone, a 5.9 x 1.0 x .7-inchlittle cellphone with color screen and a VGA camera (we have no idea how).  It's also tri-band GSM(900/1800/1900), supports GPRS, and claims 3 hours talk time or 120 hours standby time, with a 128 x 64 pixel, 65Kcolor display. And to top it off, it sports a USB interface for uploads and downloads of those gorgeous VGAphotos.  The big irony, however, is that we're pretty sure the thing can't actually write anything.
