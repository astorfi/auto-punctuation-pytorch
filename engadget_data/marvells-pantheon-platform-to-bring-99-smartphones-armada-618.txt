First off, we've got the new Pantheon platform, which is designed to "provide breakthrough levels of integration that lower the bill of materials for mobile devices while offering consumers excellent performance, connectivity, and a compelling user experience." In other words, this is said to be the core ingredient in a future wave of "$99 smartphones" that can handle 3D gaming, HD media and some random thing called "calling." Next up is the latest member of the Armada family, the 618. Packed with a 1GHz clock speed and the ability to chew through 1080p content, 3D graphics and pretty much anything else you can throw at it, there's a halfway decent chance we'll see this under the hood of a few upcoming tablets, e-readers and bodacious smartphones. Hopefully we'll learn more at MWC next week, and we'll be sure to share it as soon as we get it.
