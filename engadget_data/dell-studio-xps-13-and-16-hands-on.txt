We're really digging the leather panel on the lid, and while the machines are total fingerprint magnets, when they're cleaned up they're pretty eye-catching -- particularly the light-up circles on the hinges and the backlit keyboard and mouse buttons. Even the bottom is slick -- it's nicely detailed and the whole things lifts off (Dell calls it a "garage door") for easy access to the RAM and hard drive. We nabbed a ton of shots, check it out in the gallery!
