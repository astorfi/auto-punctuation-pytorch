 
Details around the wireless edition of Sony's Bravia Internet Link kit -- most notably peeped during CES -- are coming into focus. Using that WHDI tech the kids are so into these days, this system is for Sony's Digital Media Extender-equipped HDTVs, and according to Sony Insider will debut for a price between $350 and $500 at the IFA conference in Berlin. Unfortunately, SI's info suggests we may only be spec'd for 1080i streaming of up to 5 feet, a bit less than the 200 foot range originally expected -- for only the fraction of the price of Monster Cables. Punch the read link for the rest of the details on the DMX-WL1T, while the rest of us hope Sony can turn the distance up enough to make it worthwhile.
