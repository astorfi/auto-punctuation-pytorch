The Canadian Private Copying Collective (CPCC) was finally
forced to stop appealing in the case of taxing digital
audio players in Canada because of alleged copyright infringement, and now Apple Canada is offering those who paid
extra for their players a little lovin' in the form of a refund. The tax was in effect from December 2003 until the
following December when the Federal Court overturned it, though the CPCC continued to appeal until the
Supreme Court finally told them to cut it out already
last month. It's a nice gesture on the part of Apple, sure, but some will remember it was the company's choice to pass
the tax on to consumers in the first place.
