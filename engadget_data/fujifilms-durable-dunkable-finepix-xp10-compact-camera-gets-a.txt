Photography Blog has taken a look at Fujifilm's new 12 megapixel FinePix XP10 waterproof shooter and, while it predictably falls short of DSLR-level quality (or even high-end compacts), it overall scores a very positive review thanks to its 5x zoom lens, 720p video recording, solid construction, and a "pleasingly compact" design that we think looks very funky (in a good way). The camera's cause is also helped dramatically by an MSRP of Â£169.99, or $199.95, and we're finding this thing available online for way less than that. For that kind of money this thing wouldn't make a bad side-kick for your go-to camera, a sort of stunty stand-in for when the going gets tough... or perhaps just damp.
