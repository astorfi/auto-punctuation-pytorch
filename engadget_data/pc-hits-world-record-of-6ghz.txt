Remember when overclocking your Celeron like fifty percent was so cool? Apparently things haven't changed
too much, the stakes are about just these days, far as we can tell. Some Finnish guy overclocked his 3.6GHz P4 to 6GHz.
Six gigahertz. Sure, it's not stable, but come on, don't you still have a softspot in your heart for some
geeks who spend hours and hours just so they can take a screenshot of their CPU's speed that might well have been
Photoshopped anyway? Er, we mean, good job, and 10GHz, ho!
