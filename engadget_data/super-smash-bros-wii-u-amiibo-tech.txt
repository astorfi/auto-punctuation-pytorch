Super Smash Bros. for the Wii U isn't just leaning on your nostalgia to clinch a sale; it also has a few technological tricks up its sleeve. Nintendo's latest brawler will let you bring the characters from its NFC-based toys (now known as Amiibo) into the game by tapping them on the Wii U's gamepad. They can fight alongside you or in your place, and they'll gain abilities as they level up. Other titles (including Mario Kart 8, Mario Party 10 and Yoshi's Woolly World) should support Amiibo in the future, as well. If you'd rather introduce your own persona, though, you can. Super Smash Bros. has an option to add your Mii, giving it both a character class as well as a handful of special moves.



You'll still have to wait until sometime during the holidays to pick up the Wii U version and try out all its spiffy new features. If you're impatient for some fisticuffs, though, you'll be glad to hear that Super Smash Bros. 3DS will be available a bit sooner -- it's now set to launch on October 3rd. You won't be locked out of Amiibo, either, as Nintendo is promising a peripheral (sadly, due in 2015) that puts your figurines into 3DS games.
