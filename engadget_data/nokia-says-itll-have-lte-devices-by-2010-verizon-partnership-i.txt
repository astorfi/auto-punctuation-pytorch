Indeed, the company has now gone on record saying that it'll have "data intensive" LTE gadgets launched next year, though they've failed to go into the nitty gritty details of what kind of devices those might be. That could very well be where this new rumor comes into play, though: TheStreet.com is claiming that there's chatter of a Verizon / Nokia partnership that would see a serious full touchscreen multimedia phone launched to help inaugurate Big Red's LTE airwaves -- and considering that Nokia has ramped up its Verizon-branded product portfolio over the past year and publicly cheered on the carrier for choosing LTE over WiMAX or UMB, it's not all that difficult to believe. If the rumored device comes in a brown pleather wallet, count us in.[Via Phone Scoop, thanks papari]Read - Nokia bringing LTE in 2010Read - Verizon partnership?
