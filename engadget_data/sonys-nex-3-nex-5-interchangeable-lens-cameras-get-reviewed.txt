Unfortunately, according to Digital Photography Review at least, the cameras seem to be a bit of a mixed bag. While the site says that they are unquestionably a "brave and interesting attempt to redefine the camera," it says that they also represent a "distinctly unsteady first step." The biggest problem with them, it seems, is that the much of the high-end capabilities of the cameras are hindered by "one of the strangest interfaces" seen in some time, which the site says is confusing at times and "actively unhelpful" at others. Both cameras are also said to suffer from poor startup and shot-to-shot times, lackluster battery life, and a video mode that offers high quality video but decidedly limited controls. On the upside, the cameras do apparently mostly deliver the goods when it comes to image quality (especially with their high ISO capabilities), and the build quality is said to be solid, particularly on the NEX-5.
