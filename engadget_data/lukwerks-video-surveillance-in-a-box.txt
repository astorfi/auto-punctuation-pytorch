 Sometimes paying a little in the beginning meansyou'll wind up paying a lot in the end. Take the LukWerks Starter Kit, a digital video surveillance system-in-a-boxwith a super-easy setup (it transfers data over AC from cam to PC via USB adapter) that costs only $299. It sounds likea pretty good deal, and it may well be if you don't have the money or tech chops to install a better system, but whenyou read the fine print you'll find that you can only access your video feeds from the LukWerks site- for only 10minutes a day! Bumping up to a generous hour-per-day will cost you $8-a-month (but lets not forget, that extra lootalso jacks your per-view limit up from 2 minutes to 15), and extra cams for the system (max: 6) cost $225 each. As youcan see, the dollars can add up quickly here, and LukWerks cams don't even pan, tilt, or zoom (save for the 50 degree"manual" pan mentioned in the specs). Still, the VGA vid examples looked pretty decent to us, so if yourgrandpa needs to keep an eye on his war mementos while he's in the common room for bingo, this could be the solutionyou and he have been looking for.
