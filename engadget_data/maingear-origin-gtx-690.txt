 Gaming stalwarts Maingear and Origin have casually announced that the duo will now happily sell you a rig packing NVIDIA's beast of a graphics card, the GeForce GTX 690. The $1,000 hardware packs two 28mm Kepler GPUs and is tipped to be the world's fastest graphics card -- unless you work in an NVIDIA testing lab, we suppose.
