Unfortunately, the unit we were playing with had zero content loaded on it, but you can check out the slick unlock mechanism, swooping screen-change animations and a bit of pre-loaded Zune video on the gorgeous OLED screen. Plus we tossed together a few pics and a shot of the Tegra chip that's doing all the work into a gallery below. Video is after the break.
