 It appears to be nothing more than a little playful legal wrangling at this point, but Verizon's threat to straight-up disconnect Amp'd serves as a stark reminder to customers and other MVNOs just how critical the national carriers are to a virtual network's day-to-day operations. Verizon's argument, of course, is simple: Amp'd burns through tens of millions of dollars per month of The Network's airwaves, and nonpayment is grounds for sending out the "can you hear me now?" guy to Amp'd's house to disconnect the service, metaphorically speaking. This'll all play out in the courts over the next few days and months as Amp'd navigates the wide world of bankruptcy, but we've gotta believe Verizon isn't heartless enough to leave its paying customers in the dark.[Via Phone Scoop]
