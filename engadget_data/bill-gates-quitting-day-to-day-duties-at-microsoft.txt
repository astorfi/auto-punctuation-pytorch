But after more than 30 years at Microsoft, Bill Gates says he's going to quit his day-to-day Microsoft duties in 2008 in order to concentrate on the charitable work of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He'll stick around as chairman, and we're sure we haven't seen the last of him in a broader sense, but he's not going to be doing any more software architectin', and probably won't have as much time for continuing his series of Engadget interviews. Don't worry Bill, we won't forget about you. We just hope those charitable efforts don't take you away from your true passion: reading Engadget daily like every good knighted billionaire ought.
