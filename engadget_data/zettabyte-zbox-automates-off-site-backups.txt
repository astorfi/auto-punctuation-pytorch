 The good news is that Zettabyte is shipping out these zBox backup units of their absolutely free of charge, the bad news is that if you want to do any backing up with 'em, you'll have to fork over at least $49 a month. See, the zBox doesn't do any storage on its own, it only has 128MB of RAM to buffer data that it pipes off to Amazon's S3 storage service. That means you'll have a truly safe backup of your data, but for the hefty cost of $49 per month for 30GB of storage, ramping all the way up to 690GB for $299 a month. Sure, with that kind of money you could probably just buy a new drive every month and do your own off-site backup, but the zBox provides a good bit of convenience, security and geek-cred to the procedure. The PowerPC-based device features gigabit Ethernet connectivity, just in case you've got a crazy fat pipe for sending out your data, and includes AES-256 encryption, web-based administration and automatic updates. It's not for everyone, but if you're tired of lugging those commodity hard drives or DVD backups off-site, the zBox's hourly backup service just might be the ticket.[Via MobileMag]UPDATE: Turns out the box does house its own local storage, acting as a plain ol' NAS, but backing up the data along the way. There's also a pro version with RAID-1 for the ultra paranoid. Thanks to everyone who figured this out before we did.
