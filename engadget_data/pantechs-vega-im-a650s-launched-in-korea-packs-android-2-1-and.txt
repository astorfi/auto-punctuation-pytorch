Dubbed the Vega (IM-A650S), Pantech's latest 4.02-ounce offering -- a mere 0.14 ounces less than the Samsung Vibrant -- is pretty much just a lighter rehash of its predecessor: 1GHz Snapdragon processor, 3.7-inch 800 x 480 AMOLED capacitive touchscreen, Android 2.1, 5 megapixel camera, 500MB internal storage, and 8GB external memory to boot. If this phone's somehow tickling your fancy, then you're in luck -- Pantech claims to be "in talks with AT&T and Verizon" to bring this baby to US of A. They better hurry up though -- that Froyo ain't gonna stay frozen forever.
