Like its sibling, the T1006 comes with VGA, HDMI, and three USB ports (one 3.0, one 2.0, and one combo USB/eSATA port) along with a 1366 x 768 capacitive display. (Pixel density enthusiasts should note that those pixels are packed into a 10.1-inch screen unlike the 11.6-inch panel found on the T1132.) Instead of the Core i5 CPU found in its relative, the T1006 is powered by an unspecified Atom chip with Intel GMA 3650 graphics -- which tells us that it's Cedar Trail silicon. There's also 802.11b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 2.1, and an optional 3G radio rounds out the wireless connectivity. Interest sufficiently piqued? There's plenty more pics and an owner's manual to quench your curiosity at the source below.
