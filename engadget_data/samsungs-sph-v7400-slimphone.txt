Samsung, we're not sure that adding a zero to the
V740 is going to make it ten times better, but we're
still down with your new SPH-V7400. It's got a 1.3 megapixel camera, external audio playback buttons, and Bluetooth,
but it's not that slim at 17.6mm (0.7-inches)â€”granted, it is CDMA, though, so that always puts on a few mm
around the waist.
