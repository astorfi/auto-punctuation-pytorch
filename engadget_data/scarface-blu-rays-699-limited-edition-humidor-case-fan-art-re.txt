There will only be 1,000 sold and we're sure your imported cigars will appreciate the untreated Spanish cedar and 1,000 coat brilliant finish. You can see a few angles in the pictures here, while the Blu-ray trailer and snaps of winning fan art to be included in the set as collectible cards await after the break. How much will it cost to get your hands on one of these boxes? The MSRP is $999, but Amazon as always is offering them for the low, low price of just $699. Slightly less rabid fans can grab the SteelBook release for $24.99.
