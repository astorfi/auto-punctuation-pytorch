So on that note, you might want to sit up and pay attention to this little piece over on Nokia Conversations detailing four popular grip styles that won't kill your signal, including the four-edge -- a work of art that we've attempted to demonstrate for you with limited success in the picture above. We totally buy the claim that this particular grip causes zero signal degradation in virtually any cellphone ever launched (the curious stares you get are just a bonus), but Nokia goes on to boast that "realistically, you're free to hold your Nokia device any way you like... and you won't suffer any signal loss." Thing is, hands have never really gotten along with phone antennas -- see the shot of a Nokia user's manual explaining this phenomenon after the break, along with a video of an E71 exhibiting some signal drama when touched the wrong way -- but seriously, just use the four-edge and you should be good to go. Come on, do it.
