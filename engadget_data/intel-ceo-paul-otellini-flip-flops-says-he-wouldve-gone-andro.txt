Either way, the most recent quotes coming from the highest of highs at Chipzilla paints a very different story than the one we first heard, and it's beginning to look like Intel and Microsoft may eventually wage some sort of war -- even if it's one that remains strictly at the software level. Reuters is reporting that Otellini had this to say when questioned about Stephen Elop's decision to select Windows Phone 7 as the future of Nokia's handset business:

 "I wouldn't have made the decision he made, I would probably have gone to Android if I were him. MeeGo would have been the best strategy but he concluded he couldn't afford it."

 That contrasts starkly with comments made just days ago, where he was quoted as saying that he would've made "the same or a similar call" if found in Elop's shoes. Continuing on the topic of differentiation, Otellini noted that "it would have been less hard on Android, [but] on MeeGo he could have done it." That said, he's confident that Intel "will find another partner," noting that carriers "still want a third ecosystem and the carriers want an open ecosystem, and that's the thing that drives our motivation." Now, the real question: which Paul can be believed?
