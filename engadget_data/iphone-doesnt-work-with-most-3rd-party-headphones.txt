You'll need to buy a $10 headphone adapter if you want most third party headphones to function correctly, which sounds like a great business plan to us: just break an important device function, and sell the solution for fun and profit. For now, one of the few third party 'phones that do work are the Zune headphones.





Do Work • iPod headphones • Zune headphones (despite the tension in the air, the Zune's headphones do work on the iPhone)• Etymotic ER6i  Don't work • Shure E4c • Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro • Sony MDR-V150 • Generic wrap-around headphones • Grado SR80
