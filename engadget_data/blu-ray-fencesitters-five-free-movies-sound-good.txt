Starting on July 1st (just hold out a few more hours) and lasting through September 30th of this year, customers who purchase a qualifying Blu-ray player will be eligible to receive five flicks gratis through the mail. Among the options of players are Sony's BDP-S1, BDP-S300, or 60GB PlayStation 3, Panasonic's DMP-BD10K or DMP-BD10KA, Philips' BDP9000, Pioneer's BDP-94HD, or Samsung's BD-P1000 / BD-P1200. As for the free movies, you'll be able to choose five from a library of 21 titles, and while we can't really argue with the upside in this deal, be absolutely sure you don't mind receiving "notices and information from the Blu-ray Disc Association" before mailing in your claim.[Via Blu-ray]
