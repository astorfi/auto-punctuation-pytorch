 Galaxy S 4 or Galaxy S IV? Disagreements over the naming convention are likely to rage on now that Samsung's dropped hints that it's planning to replace the Galaxy S III in the spring of next year. A company official reportedly told Korea Times that "the new device is expected to hit shelves globally in March at the latest" following an initial announcement at MWC in February -- and while it would retain the "inspired by nature" design language of its predecessor, the screen might get a bump from 4.8 to 5-inches. It may seem odd for a company to talk up its next product so soon after the last one, but perhaps it's a deliberate marketing move in light of a certain new contender.
