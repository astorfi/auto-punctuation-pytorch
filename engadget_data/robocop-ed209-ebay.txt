 If you're a fan of RoboCop -- and if you were a child of the '80s, why wouldn't you be? -- then today might be your lucky day. A ten-foot-tall prop of the executive-gunning ED-209 is now available for purchase on eBay for the low, low price of $25,000. Okay, so that's not exactly cheap for what isn't even a real working bot, likely made as either a stand-in or a marketing piece. It also apparently needs a couple of wooden planks to stand on its own and was built for the infinitely less cool RoboCop 2. Still, did we mention this thing is ten feet tall? And its leg extensions contain metal bars and pneumatic cylinders? And there are real electrical connections below the legs there? Sure, it might not actually power up, but it's certainly more intimidating than the robotic officers we have now. So go ahead and bid on it if you have the cash; just keep it away from stairs.
