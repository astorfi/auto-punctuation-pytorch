We should be starting in a few minutes, so sit back, relax and enjoy all the fruits a profitable relationship with James Cameron's Avatar can offer -- along with plenty other flatter technologies, to be sure.
 

3:49PM We're out, time for some hands-on with this stuff! 3:48PM Panasonic knows how to keep to a schedule, and there's no time for Q&A.3:48PM Oh, and that's it!3:47PM Having a slide problem, but there's a new audio system / photo frame / iPod dock / CD player.

The Audio SC-BT730 home theater in the box with built-in WiFi.3:46PM We're going fast and furious here, another Blu-ray player with a half second boot up time, and a second generation portable Blu-ray player.3:45PM PP-BDT350. Full HD 3D Blu-ray Player, Viera Cast IPTV enabled, and pumps out the 3D over HDMI 1.4, which is a requirement for the new standard.3:45PM HDC-TM55 camcorder. Full HD, 8GB storage, 25x optical zoom.3:45PM New Lumix DMC-FP3. 3-inch touchscreen, the camera turns on when you slide the cover off the lens.

It's a GF1. Not bad!3:38PM Alright, back to product! "Relaunching" the Lumix brand. Oh wait, it's just another marketing move. Ads and retail positioning.

And now he's talking up his new Ad Agency...3:36PM "2010 is a breakthrough year for us at Panasonic, we will spend twice as much as we did last year on talking directly to the consumer." That's a lot of marketing, about 3x the amount they spent in 2008.3:35PM Improved retail share, including a few weeks of the year that they attained the #2 spot in the display market. Also received more product awards and attained "improved awareness of unique features."
