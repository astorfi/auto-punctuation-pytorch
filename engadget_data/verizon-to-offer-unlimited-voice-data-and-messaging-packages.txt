       We've gotten a flood of tips that the notoriously miserly Verizon is lining things up to offer unlimited calling plans. Starting Tuesday the 19th (of this month) should see the following plans sprout up:

$100 - Nationwide Unlimited (voice)
$120 - Nationwide Select Unlimited (voice, SMS, MMS)
$140 - Nationwide Premium (voice, SMS, MMS, VZNav, VCAST, email)
$150 - Nationwide Email and Messaging (voice, SMS, MMS, and data)
$170 - Nationwide Global Email and Messaging (voice, SMS, MMS, and international data)
$200 - Family plan with two lines, $100 per additional line.

That's not all though. There are even more perks and benefits in store for premium-paying unlimited users:

5GB cap on data is out
No contract extension for current customers
Available on one or two year agreements
All plans include Mobile Web 2.0 portal access (skip it)
No roaming or long distance
