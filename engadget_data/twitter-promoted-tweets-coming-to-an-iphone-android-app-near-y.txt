   Roughly two years after first launching Promoted Tweets on the desktop, Twitter is rolling out the ad revenue model to its iOS and Android apps. The feature, which places sponsored tweets in users' timelines, is already available in the mobile web version of the site. Updates to the app will bring the ads to a select number of users who already follow those businesses in the next couple of weeks, followed by a wider rollout to users who don't. #ka-ching
