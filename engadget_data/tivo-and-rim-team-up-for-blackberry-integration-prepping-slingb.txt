  TiVo and RIM are getting all friendly on us, teaming up to build software for the BlackBerry that could strike fear in the hearts of Slingbox and Orb. Right now it's pretty innocuous, utilizing the phone to check listings and schedule recordings, but in the future the two are looking to "further simplify mobile access to video content" -- which means streaming video straight off the TiVo to a BlackBerry's ever-expanding screen, if we had to guess. Everything's pretty preliminary at the moment, the two are just announcing the partnership, and say to expect the first software from the duo later this year.
