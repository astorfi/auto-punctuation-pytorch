While the front end got tablet friendly in December and received a Retina Display makeover in March, this version brings a new player UI to all iOS devices. The new scrub bar seems much easier to reach and control now, while the button for subtitles has a received a tweak reminiscent of the new look recently pushed to Netflix's web based player. Also under that button is a new option allowing for alternate language soundtracks (where available), while the changelog goes on to mention "general performance improvements". Not documented but present is the addition of thumbnails in that scrub bar, easier access to "do not share" for Facebook-connected members and the ability to restrict streaming to WiFi-only in the settings. The new version is shown above, check after the break for a grab of the old player to see the difference. As always, the latest update can be found in the app store, we'll let you know if we hear of any extra details or changes on other platforms.
