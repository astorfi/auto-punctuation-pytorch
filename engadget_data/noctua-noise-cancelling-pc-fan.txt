There may be an end to our cringing, as Austrian company Noctua is gearing up to debut a fan with integrated noise cancellation at Computex. The cooling fan to be shown in Taipei is only a prototype, but we know it's a Noctua NF-F12 model that uses noise-control technology from RotoSub. Luckily, Computex is less than a week away, so we'll soon have a better idea of whether this fan can keep our PC from sounding like a 777 ready for takeoff... we're sure our coworkers would appreciate it.
