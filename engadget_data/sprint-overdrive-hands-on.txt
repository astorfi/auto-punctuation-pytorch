The Overdrive's only marginally bigger than a MiFi and takes on a diamond-cut square shape (as opposed to the MiFi's rectangle) while adding a monochrome LCD up front that can be triggered on by touching (but not pressing) the power button. Other than that, you've got a micro-USB port, a microSD slot... and, well, that's about it. For something designed to slide into your pocket, we'd have it no other way.
