And we're back! After a week off to consume as many summer cookout foods as possible here in the US, our tablet mag is returning to action. This time around, we take a look at how Facebook has taken your identity and turned it into a profit-making online entity. We also put the Razer Blade 14 and Samsung Galaxy Mega through their respective paces to see how they stack up against the competition. Eyes-On peeks at Wacom's Cintiq 13HD, Switched On examines the plight of the Nook and Visualized takes a look at printed pastures. Hopefully the week off gave you time to rest up, because our return is jam-packed with slate-reading goodness.
