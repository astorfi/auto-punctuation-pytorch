The details in the invite are few and far between, though apparently our favorite Intel exec Mooly Eden will take the stage to show off the "world's fastest processor" as well as technologies that "enhance visual life." Our guess is that we will also hear a number of Sandy Bridge system announcements from major laptop and desktop manufacturers at the show. Of course, we're also hoping to hear some solid Oak Trail / tablet news and more details about LightPeak at the presser, but there's one thing you can count on... us liveblogging our hearts out!
