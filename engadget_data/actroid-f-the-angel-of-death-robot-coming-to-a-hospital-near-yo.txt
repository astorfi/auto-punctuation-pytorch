Ltd. and ATR's latest iteration of the creepy humanoid robot that can mime the operator's facial expressions and head movements with unbelievable (but not quite human) accuracy. Her current job is to act as "as an observer in hospitals to gauge patient reactions." We guess that's one way to get around euthanasia laws. See what we mean in the video after the break.
