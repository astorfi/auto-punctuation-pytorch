Motorola's Moto G was a great handset, but if we had a gripe, it was that it lacked a 4G modem. Last night, however, Amazon let it be known that a tweaked version of Motorola's mid-ranger was coming, and this time it would be able to take advantage of super-fast mobile speeds. At the London launch of the Moto E, the company confirmed that the Moto G with LTE is real, and is even packing a microSD card slot, too. The unlocked handset is priced at Â£149 in the UK and $219 in the US with a choice of black or white bodies -- and both should be hitting retailers in the next few weeks.
