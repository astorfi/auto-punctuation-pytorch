 While we're eagerly awaiting the day that wecan lounge around while armies of nanobots performtheir magical alchemy on our garbage and turn it into hot cellphones and delicious Big Macs, one British scientist iswarning that the medical implications of nanotechnology have yet to be properly explored, despite numerous productsalready finding their way to market. Specifically,  	Edinburgh University Professor andenvironmental health expert Anthony Seaton argues that almost nothing is known about the potential effect of inhalingnanoparticles, likening the situation to the dangerous particle-emitting asbestos that was installed in buildings priorto 1970 without a second thought. According to some estimates, there are already 200 products containing nanoparticlesavailable to consumers, with hundreds more expected to hit shelves this year -- but Seaton claims that so far,recommended nano testing "simply hasn't happened." Damn, way to ruin our nanobot fantasies, ProfessorLetdown.
