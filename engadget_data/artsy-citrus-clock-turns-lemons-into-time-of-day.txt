Anna Gram's artsy Citrus Clock combines the magic of stellar design with basic science in order to create a timepiece that's powered by lemons (or the citrus fruit of your choosing, presumably). Reportedly, a single juicy lemon will keep the seconds ticking for a fortnight (or two weeks, if you've got an inexplicable problem with said synonym), which ain't half bad if we should say so ourselves.[Via Unplggd]
