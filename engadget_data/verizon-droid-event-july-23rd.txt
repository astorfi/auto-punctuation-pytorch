Verizon is sending out invites to the press regarding a mystery event next week. While the invite doesn't reveal which products are set to be announced, we have a pretty solid indication of what to expect: we're told that the event will involve "the next generation of one of [its] most popular family of devices." Given that the Droid is Big Red's most popular device lineup -- not to mention the fact that the rumor mill indicates a series of new Motorola-made Droids are on the way in the near future -- it's quite likely we can expect to see two or three devices decked out with Verizon's favorite brand.



*Verizon owns AOL, Engadget's parent company. However, Engadget maintains full editorial control, and Verizon will have to pry it from our cold, dead hands.
