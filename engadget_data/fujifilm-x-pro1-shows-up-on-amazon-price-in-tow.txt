   Oh Amazon, why must you tease us so? Not content on leaking the Fujifilm X-Pro1's lenses before the mirrorless ILC was even announced at CES, the retailer just confirmed the camera's price. It appears you'll have to plunk down a hefty $1700 to get your dirty little mitts on this high-end rangefinder-ish 16 megapixel APS-C shooter -- and that's just for the body. As a reminder, you'll also be able to purchase the 18mm (27mm equivalent) f/2.0 and 35mm (53mm equivalent) f/1.4 lenses for $500 each, and the larger 60mm (91mm equivalent) f/2.4 macro lens for $600. This camera may not be quite a sexy looking as its fixed-lens cousin the X100, but it sure looks more than up to the task of taking beautiful pictures. Guess we'll have to wait until late February to find out for sure.  Update: Looks like Fujifilm has confirmed the info we reported on above. You'll find all the details in the press release after the break.  [Thanks, Amad]
