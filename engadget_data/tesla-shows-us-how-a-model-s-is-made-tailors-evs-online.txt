The automaker's first peek behind the scenes shows us just how quickly it can make the aluminum body parts that make the electric sedan: a single part can be stamped out in just six seconds. If you'd rather get to ordering a Model S than watching it built, though, Tesla is about to kick off Design Studio, a new way to customize the company's EVs for orders. Build-and-price sites aren't anything new, although Tesla will be rare in eventually letting you pull the trigger online instead of having to plead with a dealer to place an order. Design Studio goes up this week, with full sales in a few months; new details of the Model S production process will go live every Tuesday if you need a steady intravenous drip of Tesla news.
