 I know it isn't news, but it is good to hear someone mention it since CES. Each year at CESthere are at least a few items that end up being vapor ware. Here at HDBeat we love to stream HD Content around our houseand using XP Media Center Edition with an Xbox360 isalways a good option. Of course the biggest problem is that we can only stream OTA content and other HD content from our PC,but not content from Cable or satellite. We are so excited about being able to use either CableCARD or a Viiv powered DIRECTV STB that you can bet we will keep you updated assoon as we find out more. For now all we have is a mention by DIRECTV CEO Chase Carey at the Intel developmentconference's keynote. He said that the Viiv-certified DIRECTV boxwas in the works. The real question is if it will be available before the standalone HD TiVo. I probably won't buyboth, but I will buy the first to market.
