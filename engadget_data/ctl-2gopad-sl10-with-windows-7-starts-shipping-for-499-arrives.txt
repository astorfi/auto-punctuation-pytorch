 
We've been keeping an eye on CTL's 10-inch 2goPad SL10 since we saw it chilling out at Computex back in June, but as of today it's no longer just another elusive Win 7 slate: the company's finally boxing up and shipping the Atom-powered tablets. Compared to some of the other Win 7 Home Premium slates we've seen lately, the 2goPad has an impressive array of specs for the price -- it packs a Atom N450 processor, 2GB of RAM, an 250GB hard drive, and a front facing VGA camera all for $499 (though, it will go up to $599 on October 20). However, it's the touchscreen experience that'll obviously make or break the SL10, and from what we've seen so far, it may just be one of the better ones out there right now. We just got our review unit yesterday, but we've been finding the capacitive display to be very responsive to finger swipes and light taps. Our major complaint about the screen is actually its distracting glossy coating, but at least it packs an accelerometer, which rotates the orientation at a decent pace. As for software, CTL's preloaded something called QuickBits, which is really just a menu with large shortcut buttons, but it's certainly better than nothing. Our full review of this pad should be ready soon, but in the meantime enjoy the gallery below and the press release after the break.
