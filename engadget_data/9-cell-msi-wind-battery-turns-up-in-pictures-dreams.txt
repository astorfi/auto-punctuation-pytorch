Apparently, the pictures (more of which are available at the link below) came straight from an unnamed battery manufacturer and, yes, it's still in prototype form, which hopefully means there's still some refining to be done. There's no indication of a release date, unfortunately, but Eee PC News seems confident, for one reason or another, that the batteries could find their way into Winds as soon as November.[Via Laptop, thanks Kevin]
