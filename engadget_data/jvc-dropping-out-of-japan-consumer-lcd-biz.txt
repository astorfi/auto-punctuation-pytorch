Despite selling 300,000 units in Japan last year, its market share shrank to just 2.7%, and Reuters reports the company's stock has risen 11% on the news. With more cooperation among the biggest manufacturers driving prices down, its place as a high end brand based on advanced picture quality has slipped (sound like anyone else?). Expect official word April 25 when JVC unveils its latest earnings result and LCD strategy going forward, but we admit a morbid curiosity about how this will affect the Snap and Gesture HDTV's development.[Via Reuters]
