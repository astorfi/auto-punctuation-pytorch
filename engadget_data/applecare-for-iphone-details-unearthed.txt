As with most other Apple hardware, an AppleCare Protection Plan will indeed be made available for the iPhone, and "will extend the hardware repair coverage to up to two years from the original purchase date." Per usual, the plan must be procured sometime within the first year of ownership, but unique to this one is the "service phone" available for those who've sent their mobile in for repair. This theoretical loaner will run users $29 while their device is being mended, and Apple spells out all the details surrounding data transfers in a handy FAQ. Strangely enough, no definitive price has been announced just yet, but the plan will be available for purchase sometime this month.[Via TUAW]
