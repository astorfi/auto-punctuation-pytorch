Those are each now available with Penryn processors ranging from 2.1GHz to 2.6GHz, and for the same price as the earlier Merom processors, although Dell warns that opting for Penryn on the M2300 may delay your ship date. Otherwise, you can load 'em up with a max 4GB of RAM and 32GB or 64GB SSD drives, but you'll have to make do with an NVIDIA Quadro FX 360M for graphics. If that's not too much of a compromise, you can customize your system right now by hitting up the appropriate link below.Read - Dell Precision M2300Read - Dell Precision M4300[Via Electronista]
