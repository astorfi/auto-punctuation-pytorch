Frankly we're alittle bummed they're gonna miss the holiday rush with this one, but somehow we have a feeling a 30-inch display, Dellor not, is still one of those things we'd have to pony up for ourselves.[Thanks, Matt and Chet]Update: for all those interested, the 3007WFP user manual has indeed surfaced. And it doesquite in fact show the unit as having a SD / MMC / Memory Stick / SmartMedia / CompactFlash card reader and HDCPsupport. Thanks to everyone who sent this in.
