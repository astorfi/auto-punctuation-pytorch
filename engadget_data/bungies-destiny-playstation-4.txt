It wasn't clear if Bungie's 10-year project was headed to a next-gen console, but now the developer has made it official: Destiny is headed to the PlayStation 4. Gamers hoping to pick up the PS4 version of the title aren't in store for an extra-long wait either, as it'll be available at the same time the PlayStation 3 flavor launches. In order to sweeten the pot for fans of Sony's gaming console, Bungie's also promising "exclusive playable content just for the PlayStation community."
