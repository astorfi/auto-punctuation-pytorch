There's no doubt that's a major shot across the bow at Hulu, which offers only 720p in its limited HD Gallery, but when we tried it out though the picture remained sharp even blown up to full screen, the jittery framerate of the Flash video made it clear we weren't watching a Blu-ray disc or even broadcast HDTV. Check it out yourself and see how it runs, all the CSI's, How I Met Your Mother and more are up in "full high definition."[Via Video Business]
