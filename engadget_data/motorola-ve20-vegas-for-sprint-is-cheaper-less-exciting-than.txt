The FCC has revealed the VE20 "Vegas," a flip that smacks of the V3's design cues while taking an ever-so-cautious approach to updating the styling and making sure that the package still stays firmly planted beneath the V9 in the food chain (or at least that's what the abundance of plastic would lead us to believe, but with Motorola, who the hell knows). It'll do EV-DO, a 2 megapixel camera, and touch-sensitive external controls on a fairly generous secondary display whenever it gets around to launching -- just don't expect the excitement, expense, or debauchery of an actual weekend in Sin City.[Via phoneArena]
