Last week we wrote about the Berkeley biology professor
who made an attempt to put The Fear into the heart of a student who nicked his laptop. His story was not only over
the top but technically implausible, which tons of you called out in the comments. Well, it turns out Jasper Rine did,
in fact, make the whole thing up in an attempt to scare the kid into giving the laptop back. And it didn't work. So
he's still got no laptop, but at least he's left with the satisfaction of having gotten international press coverage
that incited a barrage of scathing cries of "foul" from pretty much anyone with any tech knowledge whatsoever. Perhaps
he was just banking on that old adage about there being no bad PR?
