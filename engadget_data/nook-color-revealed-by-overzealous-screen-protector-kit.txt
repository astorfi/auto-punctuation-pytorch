CNET discovered the protective film hanging out on Barnes & Noble's website, and quickly grabbed this picture before it could be removed. Even if we're legitimately looking at the new Nook, of course, this doesn't tell us much about the seemingly button-less product underneath. How's this: We'll go out on a limb and tell you it's got a color touchscreen.
