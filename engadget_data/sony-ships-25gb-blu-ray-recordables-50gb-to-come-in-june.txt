 Lest anyone question their position as king of the Blu-ray mountain, Sony has announced that it hasstarted shipping single-layer 25GB Blu-ray discs, and will begin follow up with 50GB discs in June. Yes, we know thatTDK has already announcedtheir own dual-layer discs (and is even working on eight layer 200GBversions), but it looks like Sony may just get their 50 giggers out the door first. Pricing is set at about $20 perdisc for the single-layer version and $48 for the 50GB discs. Yes, that's right. The higher-capacity disc will have ahigher per-GB price than the single-layer version. Such is the price for burning on the cutting-edge (and, no, we'renot even going to try to visualize that horribly mixed metaphor).
