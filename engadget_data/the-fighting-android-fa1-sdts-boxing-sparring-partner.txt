Enterthe Fighting Android FA1 from Self Defense Technologies, a robot that can jab, hook, and cross, but still keep theviolence to a minimum with adjustable difficulty levels. The FA1 can also dodge your punches with"human-like" movements and he should be hanging out on the show floor at CES -- so we'll be sure to challengehim to a round of verbal barbs from a distance.[Via The Raw Feed]
