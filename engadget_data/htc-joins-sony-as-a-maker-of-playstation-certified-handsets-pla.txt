Well, sorry to disappoint you, but that doesn't mean there's no news on the PlayStation front, as Sony's just informed the world that the PlayStation Suite has been renamed PlayStation Mobile. Not only that, but it's opening PS Mobile to third-party Android manufacturers, and as was rumored, HTC is the first handset maker not named Sony to get certified -- meaning that you'll soon be able to get your PlayStation on using the Taiwanese outfit's hardware. Unfortunately, we don't know when HTC will debut its first such handset, nor when other Android makers will get in on the action, but it's nice to see Sony finally start to share the gaming love.
