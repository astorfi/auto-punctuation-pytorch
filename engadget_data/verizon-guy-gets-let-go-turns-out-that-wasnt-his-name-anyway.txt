As it turns out that wasn't even his character's name, VZW settling on "Test Man" when scripting the early shots. Now that company is "taking its ads in a different direction," a direction that apparently does not include Mr. Marcarelli. But, based on the tales he recounted to The Atlantic, that may be a good thing. Paul once heard someone say "Can you hear me now?" at his grandmother's funeral -- as her body was being lowered into the grave. Yup, it's time for a role change.
