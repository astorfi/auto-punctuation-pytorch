       Well folks, it looks like the funky, PS3 price-drop happenings you've been hearing about lately may very well be dropping all over the place. Apparently, hot on the heels of a new filing with the FCC, and various rumors concerning an approaching $399 console, Sony (which has heretofore denied the chatter) has announced a "Big Bang" press conference to take place on October 12th, where many believe they will intro a new, lower priced 40GB console. With nothing big slated for the holiday season yet, and Xbox 360 price-cuts and bundles being bandied about, it makes sense that Sony would come out swinging before holiday shoppers hit the stores. It's truly a good time to be a buyer.Read -- PlayStation 3 getting holiday makeover: $399 PS3 rumor has legsRead -- Rumor: Sony has 'big bang' announcement Oct. 12
