As the months have worn on though, Americans have simply been left wondering when (if ever) they'd be able to start leaving fingerprints all over one of their own. Well, we finally have an answer... kinda. President of Samsung's mobile division, Shin Jong-kyun, told reporters on Wednesday, "we expect to release the Galaxy S II in the US market sometime in August." So there you go -- on some undetermined date, for some undetermined price, with some undetermined carrier, you'll finally be able to get your greasy little paws on a Galaxy S II next month. It's not much, but hey, it's better than nothing.
