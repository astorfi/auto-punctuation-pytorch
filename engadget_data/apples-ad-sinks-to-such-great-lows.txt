But it looks like the final piece to the puzzle's in; Apple's commercial, which "sets free"the Intel chip for its new life in a Mac, was in fact a surreptitious replication of theÂ  "Such GreatHeights" video -- at least according to The Postal Service and their label, Sub Pop. Here's what band frontman BenGibbard had to say:It has recently come to our attention that Apple Computers' new televisioncommercial for the Intel chip features a shot-for-shot recreation of our video for 'Such Great Heights' made by thesame filmmakers responsible for the original. We did not approve this commercialization and are extremely disappointedwith both parties that this was executed without our consultation or consent.Was it an illegal move onJosh & Xander's (or Apple's) part to produce this ad? Depends on who ultimately owns the copyright to the original(probably SubPop), but either way it's pretty poor form. Seems like if Apple wants to avoid further criticism and thepossibility of litigation -- and snag a little indie cred while they're at it -- they'll pull their ad and make thingsright. Likelihood of that happening? Slim -- unless they get a call from SubPop's lawyers, anyway.[Via TUAW]
