Want to control that iPod when it's buried deep in your bag or
(in homage to his Steveness) pocket? While there's no shortage of
iPod remotes out there, Scosche has taken what seems like a
pretty obvious idea and actually produced an iPod wrist remote. Strap it on watch-style, and you're in control, as long
as you're in range of its RF signal.
