The folks in Redmond have announced that the aforementioned mobile software is now available for those who fancy Google's operating system. As you might expect, the list of features follows suit with the existing iOS and Windows Phone applications -- including multiple photo or video uploads, file sharing, opening stored files and file management with the ability to sort folders. While the app was built to work best with Android 4.0, it'll play nice with any handset that runs Gingerbread and above. If you're ready to install, a few clicks will do just that via the Google Play link below.
