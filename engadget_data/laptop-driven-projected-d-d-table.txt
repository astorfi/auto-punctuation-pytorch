Picture it: it's back in the day, and you're gathered around ye olde Dungeons and Dragons table for a nerd's night
out of virtual adventure. You've got your imaginations strapped on tight, and perhaps a few pencil graphs of your game
terrain in tow to aid in your quest. Fast-forward to today, when version 2.0 of the gaming table includes a
laptop-based projection system to beam Photoshopped adventure maps masked with only the players' currently visible
areas showing. We suppose it only makes sense that gaming geeks take advantage of the high tech that is their
birthright, but hasn't some text-based charm been rather lost here?
