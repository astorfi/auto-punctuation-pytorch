Clear your calendars, defenders of the internet: The next big development in the net neutrality battle is due in February. First reported by the Washington Post, the FCC has confirmed it plans to vote on new rules next month. The rumors indicate a draft proposal will go around first with a vote planned for a couple of weeks later, but there's no word yet on whether the ever-controversial "fast lanes" will be included, or if the FCC will reclassify internet services under Title II. The President has weighed in with his opinion, along with thousands of internet comments -- we'll find out more about how those balance against the interests and threats of the big telecommunications companies next month.
