Actually the $999 Satellite E205 seems like one big group hug between Intel, Toshiba and Best Buy. Exclusive to Best Buy and actually designed by those Best Buy customers (okay, they just gave Toshiba feedback), the 14-incher is powered by an Intel Core i5-430M processor and has a 320GB hard drive. But its most impressive spec is its Intel Wireless Display technology (or WiDi) which lets you wirelessly connect your laptop to your HDTV to stream video and audio with an HDMI adapter. Check back soon for a hands-on, but full specs after the break.
