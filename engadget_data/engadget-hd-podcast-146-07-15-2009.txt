       There's a good spread of topics on the podcast this week, while staying light on the HTPC, Blu-ray and broadcast news. What does that leave? For starters, a bunch of news under the streaming, online and download headings. Continuing the theme of news from unexpected places, TiVo popped up twice in this week's show; unfortunately, no news about a revamped, mind-blowing new model or service. We saved our favorite stuff for the end of the show, as we trumpeted plasma over LCD, dispelled conspiracy theories about Blu-ray being an evil plot, and talked about how even though we love lossless audio, we don't hate the PS3. Well, at least not for the lossless audio performance.Get the podcast[iTunes] Subscribe to the Podcast directly in iTunes (MP3). p[RSS - AAC] Enhanced feed, subscribe to this with iTunes.[RSS - MP3] Add the Engadget HD Podcast feed to your RSS aggregator[Zune]Subscribe to the Podcast directly in the Zune Marketplace[MP3] Download the show (MP3).Hosts: Ben Drawbaugh, Steven Kim, Richard LawlerProducer: Trent WolbeProgram00:53:00 - Comments from Engadget HD Podcast 145 - 07.08.2009 00:11:40 - Blockbuster OnDemand en route to Samsung HDTVs, Blu-ray players, and home theater systems00:18:36 - HBO, Cinemax coming to Comcast's On Demand Online00:19:40 - Starz jumps on Comcast's On Demand Online trial, promises HD on the way00:19:53 - CBS, Comcast On Demand Online partnership faces off premium vs. free internet streaming; 17 cable channels jump onboard00:26:55 - Silverlight 3 out of beta, joins forces with your GPU for HD streaming00:33:05 - 85 percent of the 14 billion videos downloaded last year were illegal00:45:10 - TiVo asks court for a billion dollars in EchoStar case00:54:00 - TiVo and Best Buy alliance to yield co-branded DVR, TiVo software on Insignia and Dynex TVs01:00:23 - Numbers be damned, plasma eats LCD's cake in DisplayMate's tests01:07:10 - Poll: Would you buy a TV running ChromeOS?01:11:30 - Wal-mart rolls back cheap Blu-ray player price to $9801:18:40 - So is Blu-ray really ripping off consumers?01:22:50 - LPCM is not always equal to bitstream     LISTEN (MP3)LISTEN (AAC)LISTEN (OGG)
