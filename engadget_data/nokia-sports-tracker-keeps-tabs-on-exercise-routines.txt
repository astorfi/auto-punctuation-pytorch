The Nokia Sports Tracker unfortunately doesn't keep tabs on your favorite scores, but it does encourage owners of a Nokia S60 3.0 phone (with integrated or Bluetooth GPS) to get out and move those aging muscles a bit. As expected, runners will be able to view speed, distance, and time -- all of which will be automatically stored to your "training diary" -- but there isn't a mapping feature built-in just yet. Of course, the biggest boon to this here tracking software is the totally reasonable pricetag, so be sure and tag the read link to snap this gratis program up, but make sure you actually make good use of it, you hear?[Thanks, Antti]
