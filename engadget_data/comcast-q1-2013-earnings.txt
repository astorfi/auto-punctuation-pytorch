Comcast had a dramatic Q4 last year when it announced the buyout of NBCUniversal for $16.7 billion along with the purchase of New York's iconic 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Still, it's the cable TV and internet business that pays the freight, and that side of the Comcast's operations didn't it let it down in Q1 2013 thanks to a 6.4 percent bump in revenue to $10.2 billion along with 583,000 new subscribers. Other operations didn't fare as well, as revenue for NBCUniversal dropped 2.4 percent to $5.3 billion, but the overall picture was still pretty sunny, as the communications giant saw an 11.2 percent increase in operating income over last year to $3.1 billion.

Update: Comcast also revealed its new X1 set-top box platform is now available in 10 markets (Atlanta; Augusta, Ga.; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Greater Boston; Philadelphia; New Jersey; Washington D.C.; Independence, Mo.; Colorado Springs, Colo., and the San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento, Fresno, Stockton and Santa Barbara, Calif. ) It claims it's working to bring the tech to half of its service areas by the end of June, with more major markets to be announced "soon." While most of us wait, the other good news is that it will add 4-tuner recording to the X1 platform in an update set to roll out later this month.
