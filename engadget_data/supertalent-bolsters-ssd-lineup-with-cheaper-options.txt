Like the company's earlier "world's thinnest" 256GB drive, the three new models are external units, and you're looking at capacities of 30GB, 60GB, and 120GB for $299, $449, and $699, respectively. That's actually not all that bad, considering a bare 64GB SLC SSD can run an easy grand. Available now, it looks like.[Via jkOnTheRun]
