What we have here is another tablet offering almost identical netbook-like specs (though with only 16GB of SSD storage compared to HP's 32+) at a price of just $418. That's quite a savings if you can get over the rather chunkier styling -- and the unfortunate Windows XP install. You can even get 3G wireless for an extra $80 if you're so inclined, and according to the site it's available to ship right this very moment. But, after the recent issues with another no-name tablet, we'd think twice before dropping our credit card on this particular order form.
