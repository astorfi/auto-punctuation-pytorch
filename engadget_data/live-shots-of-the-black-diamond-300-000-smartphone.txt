 We've managed to get our hands on some live shots of a prototype Black Diamond smartphone, a handset that's gained publicity not because of its feature set (WM5, 400MHz CPU, WiFi, quad-band GSM) or its design, but thanks to a $300,000 bank-busting pricetag and an exclusive five unit manufacturing run. Subtlety and style seems to be the main theme here, with the designers avoiding the obvious temptation to stick thousands of diamonds on the case. Click on for comparison shots with AXIA's EMXI 700, and for pictures of our lucky insider cradling the most expensive hunk of plastic he'll ever hold.
