According to a report, the booth (shown above in its vacated state) was shut down by cops for piracy during CeBIT and passersby were told that, "The venue is closed until further notice." It appears that after stopping down the M8 show, cops proceeded to confiscate equipment and literature associated with the painfully obvious knock-off, and will be making a more detailed statement on Thursday in regards to the action. Meizu, it might be time to get yourself a makeover... and a good attorney.Update: As you've probably already read, the Meizu booth was apparently shut down due to its use of an unlicensed MP3 codec. At the time we wrote this, all signs were pointing to the cause being the M8's alarmingly familiar UI, though that appears to have slipped through unscathed.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in; Image courtesy Heise Online]
