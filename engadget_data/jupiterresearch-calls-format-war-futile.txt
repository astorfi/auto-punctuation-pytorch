 JupiterResearch has added its opinion to the line of analysts weighing in on the format war. Its report titled "Next Generation DVD: Will the Winner Be HD DVD, Blu-ray, or None of the Above?" found both formats at risk, so it'll come as no surprise that they picked choice "C." Citing confusion between formats, larger catalogs for DVDs and competition from other distribution mechanisms, the report concludes that upscaling DVD players are the real competition faced by HDM. But rather than throwing in the towel for HDM, we think hardware manufacturers should take a hint form the study and tout the fact that every HDM player is a great upscaling DVD player, too!
