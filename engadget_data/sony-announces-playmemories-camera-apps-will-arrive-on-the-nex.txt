  PlayMemories family of apps and services from Sony gains exciting new features
   PlayMemories from Sony keeps growing with a series of exciting new possibilities to enhance your digital imaging experience, before and after shooting.

   PlayMemories is an easy-to-use family of services and applications that lets you enjoy photo and video memories across multiple devices – from cameras, smartphones and tablets to PlayStation®3 and compatible BRAVIA TVs.

  PlayMemories Camera Apps
   PlayMemories Camera Apps is the world's first application download service （*for interchangeable-lens digital cameras as of August 2012）that lets you install new functions on demand to boost the capabilities of your camera.

   PlayMemories Camera Apps offers a variety of applications that expand camera functionality, personalising your photographic experience and enhancing your network connectivity. Just download the applications onto your camera and start enjoying even richer photographic expression.

   PlayMemories Camera Apps is initially supported by the new NEX-5R interchangeable lens compact system camera. From launch, there's a range of imaging apps to broaden your creative options and utilities.

   "Picture Effect+" expands the range of artistic treatments available in the camera's standard Picture Effect mode. "Bracket Pro" automatically shoots a rapid burst of three images at different 'bracketed' settings – for shutter speed, aperture or focus – allowing you to choose the best shot. "Multi Frame NR" captures a series of images in rapid succession. They are automatically superimposed by the camera to create one low-noise photo at the selected ISO speed. It's ideal for capturing atmospheric night-time scenes, or shooting in dark conditions without using flash.

   "Photo Retouch" adds a generous palette of adjustments like brightness, saturation and contrast plus Soft Skin, re-size and other post-shooting effects. Also available is the Auto Portrait Framing feature which detects the faces in images captured and intelligently applies the recommended composition afterwards.

   Sony also plans to introduce more new apps, including "Time-lapse" and "Cinematic Photo". "Time-lapse" automatically captures a series of still pictures at adjustable intervals. These images are automatically combined by the camera, and can be replayed like a video clip. "Cinematic Photo" captures a series of frames, creating fun animated picture effects where part of a static image appears to move.

   Downloadable utilities include "Smart Remote Control": remotely check the image on screen, adjust exposure and release the shutter of the NEX-5R with your smartphone1 or tablet (such as the Xperia™ Smartphone and Xperia™ Tablet). Captured pictures are also sent automatically to your smartphone or tablet. "Direct Upload" lets you upload images directly from the camera to PlayMemories Online and Facebook.

   New PlayMemories Camera Apps will be initially available from October 2012 in 17 countries2.

  PlayMemories Online
   From this August, Sony's compatible BRAVIA TVs will become able to view photos and video posted on PlayMemories Online directly, broadening the width of devices capable of enjoying the service.  (*Availability of PlayMemories Online varies according to country or region)

  PlayMemories Mobile
   This Android/iOS app simplifies video and photo transfers to smartphones or tablet devices from the Wi-Fi enabled cameras such as the NEX-5R compact system camera. As detailed above, the app now lets you remotely control the NEX-5R and the HDR-AS15 Action Cam using your smartphone: it's great for family group shots where you want to be in the picture, too. ("Smart Remote Control" app needs to be installed to the NEX-5R to use this feature.)

  PlayMemories Studio
   PlayMemories Studio makes organizing, editing and viewing videos and photos on your PlayStation®3 (PS3®) as easy and intuitive as playing a game.

   PlayMemories Studio3 evolves with the brand-new ability to output images on Sony's 4K TVs. 4K displays contain around four times more detail than Full HD. You can enjoy high resolution images taken by current digital cameras on Sony's new 4K-enabled BRAVIA KD-84X9005.

   Other enhancements include easy content uploads to YouTube and PlayMemories Online.
