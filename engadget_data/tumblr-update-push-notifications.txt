A barrage of apps might've just gotten an iOS 7 refresh, but there's one for Android that's left its iOS counterpart in the dust: Tumblr. The microblogging site's Android app now boasts push notifications, adding blog follow and comment pings to the mishmash of Facebook and Twitter replies you get. Of course, if you like suspense and would rather see interactions when you're on the Yahoo-owned site, you can alway turn notifications off via Settings. Despite this notable feature, the new version's changelog is quite short -- the only other item is the activity screen redesign that you can see in the image above. Have fun lording these changes over your iOS-using friends while you can, though -- Tumblr says an update for iPhones and iPads is "coming very soon."
