According to the outfit's Building Windows 8 Twitter account, the next major installment of Win8 is due out in "the first week of June," with the Windows 8 Release Preview to hit the intertubes at that time. Go ahead and take off the whole week in preparation -- we're sure you can think of a few DIY activities to bide your time in the event of a Friday release. (Oh, and in case you're wondering, this is just yet another step in the march to a hopeful October ship date for the final build of Windows 8.)
