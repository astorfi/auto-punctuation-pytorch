What's that... it's not actually for sale? Indeed: the entry has been pulled from GameStop and a Google Shopping search reveals only a single Buy.com entry showing the adapter as "temporarily sold out." That's wishful thinking. While Microsoft has confirmed the adapters' existence they have not officially announced a street date or price. We'll let you know if that changes.

Update: Amazon.fr lists the adapter for 80 euro bucks with an expected November 20th ship. We'll see.
