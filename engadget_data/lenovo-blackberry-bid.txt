According to the Wall Street Journal, Lenovo has supposedly signed a non-disclosure agreement with BlackBerry to take a look at the Canadian company's books. Rumor has it that the Chinese manufacturer is considering a bid to buy the ailing BlackBerry, a move that isn't entirely shocking considering the latter's persistent financial troubles. While the WSJ's sources are anonymous and spokespeople from either company unsurprisingly refused to comment, it's far from the first time we've heard this sort of chatter about a possible acquisition. Previously, Google, Intel, Samsung, LG and even BlackBerry co-founder Mike Lazaridis were just a few of the parties reported as having interest in putting in bids for the company. Meanwhile, the fact that this report is circulating just days after BlackBerry's optimistic open letter to its customers is a rather ironic bit of timing. Details are sparse at the moment, but we'll keep you updated as we learn more.
