Before we make too much of the JupiterResearchsurvey, though, it should be noted that the numbers they report seem a bit contradictory. Even though the firm makes abroad initial statement that 41% of mobile subscribers are interested in video content, they go on to specify that only17% of respondents were interested in TV on their handsets and just 11% are down with short, streamed video clips. Sowhat type of mobile video do the rest of that 41% want that isn't either TV or short clips? Your guess is as good asours.
