The Raon Vega weighs in at just 350-grams / 160×80×27.5-mm compared to the UX's 544-grams / 150×95×38-mm. Of course, the Raon Vega cuts corners by shaving 0.2-inches off the screen, and delivering a 500MHz Geode LX800 processor, 512MB of memory, 30GB disk, 1.8 hour battery, and 800x480 (WVGA) screen resolution while opting for an externally attached USB WiFi adapter. In fact, the Raon Vega is bested by Sony in every category. We're tempted to call it the poor man's ultra-portable at nearly half the price of the UX, but with an expected retail price of ¥139,800 or about $1,178 when these hit Japan later this month, well, you'll still need a fistful to take 'er home.[Via Impress]
