The image was every bit as beautiful as we expected but surprised us with the frame's ability to playback HD video in such a fluid manner. The touch-controls along the bezel did what we wanted with little thought, albeit, with some lag. Not horrible but certainly annoying if we ever decide to hand Kodak $1,000 to take one home.Update: We spoke to Kodak's product manager who gave us another spin with the frame -- this time with WiFi turned off. Voila, the lag was gone. Turns out the previous unit was struggling to connect to the encrypted WiFi network on the crowded convention center floor. Problem solved.
