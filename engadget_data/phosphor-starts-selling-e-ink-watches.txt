 
You may remember that super rare E Ink watch we gave away a while back -- the company only handbuilt nine of 'em, and we were lucky enough to get our hands on one. Well, it looks like the club is about to get a little bigger: Phosphor is now selling two models of watch with the same E Ink display for $250, one with a leather band and one with a polyurethane band. Just like the originals, the watch can switch from white-on-black to black-on-white, and also displays the time, date, or just the E Ink logo on its face. Oh -- you know we're totally giving another one these away later on, so check back in a couple hours tomorrow for your chance to score one.
