If you want to live like common people and think poor is cool then you've got a friend in Martin Mairinger (most
probably a graduate of St. Martins College). Martin recently won an artsy fartsy grant for his concept to sew an RFID
tag into "USED Clothing" which can save information about the previous owner(s). Then when sold at a custom second-hand
shop, the new buyer can access the clothing's history on-line "yielding interesting hook-ups" — 'cause people who dress
the same think the same, dig. So let's see, Lonsdale T-shirt: where to buy a stiff pipe — narrow lapeled suit: discuss
best-ever Who album — too-tight polyester shirt: find good lounge bar in East Village.
