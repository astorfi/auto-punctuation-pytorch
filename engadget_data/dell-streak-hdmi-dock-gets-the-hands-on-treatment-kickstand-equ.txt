Of course, there's not exactly a lot to go hands-on with, but it seems that dock does indeed function as a dock, and it also thankfully has a USB port and a line-out in addition to that HDMI port. Perhaps just as notable, however, is a Streak case that Laptop has also managed to get its hands on, which has a built-in kickstand. Check it out after the break.
