We all know that there is TONS of bad info out there about HDTV and the digital transition, but CircuitCity seems to be on the ball. Check out this sign that was located at one of our readers local store. It reads:


If you rely on a TV antenna to receive your TV signal please note: Congress has passed legislationrequiring "analog" TV broadcasting to end on February 17, 2009. After that date, all "over the air"TV broadcasts will be available exclusively in "digital" format. If you rely on a TV antenna to receivetelevision broadcast and are shopping for a new TV, you should check whether that TV has a digitaltuner.

This change will not affect the ability of any TV to work with cable boxes, satellite boxes,DVDs, VCRs or game consoles. For more information ask a product specialist or visit www.circuitcity.com/tvsignal.

This statement is simple andcomplete. The link is even better and gives a very extensive, but easy to read explanation of the DTV transition. Welldone Circuit City.


[Thanks for the tip Kyle!]
