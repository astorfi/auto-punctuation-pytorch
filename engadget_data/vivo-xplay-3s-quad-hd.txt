China's appetite for top-spec phones has apparently reached an all-time high. Vivo, the company behind the super slim X1 and the audiophile-friendly Xplay sold in the Far East, announced on Sina Weibo that its upcoming multimedia-centric phablet will be dubbed the Xplay 3S. And yes, it's intentionally skipping the "Xplay 2" name "to break the routine." The main highlight here is that this is the world's first smartphone known to pack a Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440) display (though Vivo calls this "2K" instead, which isn't as precise). While no screen dimension was mentioned, LG did announce a 5.5-inch panel with the same resolution back in August, so it's likely that Vivo will overindulge our retinas with this 538ppi display.


Other specs mentioned include Qualcomm's faster Snapdragon 800 SoC variant, the MSM8974AB, which has already been announced for the WCDMA and CDMA2000 flavors of the Xiaomi Phone 3 due later this year. Thanks to this piece of silicon, the Xplay 3S will also support both China's TD-LTE and the more common FD-LTE. That's all the information we've been given so far, so stay tuned for a launch date.
