Tired of having to slog through web portals on your Windows Phone just to sign on to a coffee shop's WiFi? That won't be a problem once Windows Phone 8.1 arrives. Its Wi-Fi Sense feature can automatically accept the terms of use for networks that are both free and trustworthy, getting you online much faster than usual. You also won't have to verbally share login details for your own WiFi network. You can securely share your router's password with contacts in Facebook, Outlook.com and Skype, giving friends an internet connection (but not full network access) without setting up a guest mode. If you're the sort who sometimes avoids WiFi because of the hassles involved, you may want to give Microsoft's mobile OS a closer look.
