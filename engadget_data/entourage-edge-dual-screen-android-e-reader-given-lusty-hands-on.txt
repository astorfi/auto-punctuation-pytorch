Ina got down with a prototype of the Marvell-powered, dual-display, 9.7-inch E Ink and 10-inch LCD hybrid with built-in WiFi. The video walkthrough after the break shows that Android-powered resistive touchscreen browsing the web and launching other apps from the familiar Android desktop. The E Ink display lets you read EPUB and PDF files, as you'd expect, in addition to taking notes and manipulating text with the help of an included stylus. You can also move content between the displays and record audio via a pair of mics (one to record the lecture, one to cancel the noise). Unfortunately, Fried says that the device is still buggy and "definitely has the look and feel of a first-generation product." Sounds like the company has its work cut out in order to launch as planned in February as a textbook / notebook replacement for "typical highschool students" with $490 to burn. Let's hope they have more luck with that than Amazon did in its early Princeton pilot. Right.
