This N is supposed to bung right smack in the middle of mobile TV devices. Like any good Nokia it packs DVB-H mobile broadcast technology and runs S60 3rd Edition beneath that 2.4-inch, 16 million color display. It packs a 2 megapixel camera, integrated stereo speakers and standard 3.5-mm headphone jack, visual radio, and support for MP3, AAC, AAC+, eAAC+ and WMA media. This tri-band GSM / EDGE with UMTS 2100 MHz handset starts shipping in Q2 to "countries were DVB-H services are available" for a pre-tax, unsubsidized price of about â‚¬370 / $481. One more picture after the break.
