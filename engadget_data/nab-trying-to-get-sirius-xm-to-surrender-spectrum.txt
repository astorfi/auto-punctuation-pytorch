 As the recent action in the 700MHz auction has shown, wireless spectrum is a valuable commodity -- which is why it looks like the NAB and Clear Channel might drop their lawsuit against the Sirius / XM merger if the two companies agree to give up a chunk of the airwaves. Industry observers close to the deal have called this the "endgame," saying that the broadcasters have been after the spectrum all along, but we're not so sure -- we'd think that the NAB would be pretty happy if Sirius and XM decided not to get hitched after all. Still, it's an interesting tactical move, if true -- let's just hope it doesn't delay a decision on this merger even longer.
