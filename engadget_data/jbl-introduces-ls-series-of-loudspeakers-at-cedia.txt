This year, the speaker giant is introducing a few newcomers to the minty fresh LS Series: the LS40 bookshelf, LS60 / LS80 floorstanders and the LS CENTER -- wait for it -- center channel. These sophisticated speaks were designed with fashionistas in mind, as they boast curved contours, tapered sides and a high-gloss stained-wood finish. Retail prices on the new crew are expected to range from $999 to $1,999 each, so yeah, don't even think you're getting all that pizazz on the cheap.
