Right, we're talking LCD, not OLED. In fact, the entire TV measures just 29-mm (1.14-inches) at its thickest point while covering 150% of the NTSC color gamut and consuming just 140 kWh/year. Shazam! Unfortunately, Sharp fails to mention the resolution but tells us to expect the new TVs sometime in 2010. See her in profile after the break with plenty more over at Japan's Impress in the Via link below.[Via Impress]
