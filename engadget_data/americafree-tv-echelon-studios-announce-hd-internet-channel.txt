 We know, Echelon Studios and AmericaFree.TV aren't exactly the biggest names in their respective industries, but considering the dearth of online streaming material out there in high-definition, we'll take whatever we can get. Reportedly, the aforementioned companies have agreed to establish an HD streaming channel that will carry films from Echelon Studios, and site visitors will soon be able to tune into A Halfway House Christmas free of charge. Unfortunately, we're not told when additional films can be expected, but here's to hoping that more HD content finds its way onto the 'net sooner rather than later.
