Finally. Following a false start a couple of weeks ago (and some protracted discussions), Apple has confirmed that the iPhone 5s and 5c will reach China Mobile on January 17th, 2014 as part of a multi-year deal. As hinted earlier, both smartphones will support the carrier's TD-LTE and TD-SCDMA networks. Pricing isn't available just yet, but customers can pre-register starting on December 25th. The partnership is Apple's largest to date, at least in terms of sheer numbers -- even if only a small fraction of China Mobile's 700 million-plus customers buy iPhones, they're bound to significantly improve Cupertino's bottom line.
