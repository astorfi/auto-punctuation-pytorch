As NewScientist points out, however, these latest issues are far from the first to plague Opportunity (and its counterpart, Spirit), and it's still suffering from a malfunctioning wheel and an "arthritic" robotic arm, both problems of which first cropped up in 2005. While NASA has currently suspended all work involving the rover's rock grinding tool and its infrared spectrometer, it's apparently hoping to get the spectrometer back up and running by shaking off some of the dust causing the problems, and at least one NASA official expects both rovers to keep "going for years more."
