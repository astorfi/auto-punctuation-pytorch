Roughly this time last month, we opened up our second Insert Coin: New Challengers competition to all you entrepreneurial makers. The first one was an unquestionable highlight of March's first-ever Expand event in San Francisco, and we're psyched to see what you guys have in store for us this time. Ten semifinalists will get tickets to the show and a $1,000 travel stipend. One Judges' Choice winner will walk away with $10,000 and one Readers' Choice winner will get $15,000. Both will also score a product review on this site.


Ziphius, which managed to pick up both prizes back in March, is entering the home stretch in its own search for $125,000 over on Kickstarter. The aquatic drone managed to capture the imagination of the Expand crowd and our online audience, beating out a number of impressive finalists, including the Make-a-Play, SmartPulse, Smart Knob and Snapzoom. Think you've got something just as good in the works? Well, now's the time to show us. Submissions are open now through September 27th. You can find all the necessary rules over on our event page.

 The Process
Phase 1: Submissions
Submissions accepted: 06/17/2013 to 11:59 PM EDT on 09/27/13
Submit all of the details about your project and your contact information using this form -- keep in mind: you must not have an existing crowdfunding effort underway for this project already! Your product must also not be launched or in production currently; we would prefer that your project not have received widespread media coverage to date, but if you have already attracted attention, we will take these individual projects on a case-by-case basis.
Engadget editors will review all submissions and select 20 contenders. We will be judging according to the following criteria: Project connection on an intellectual level, Project connection on a behavioral level, Project connection on an emotional level, Market potential, Ability of creator / team to deliver it to market, Level of solution (coarse to refined), Social impact, Environmental benefits and Ingenuity. After submissions close, we will begin contacting the 20 prospective contenders the following week to confirm eligibility requirements, so please be sure to provide current and accurate contact information.
Phase 2: Online voting 10/4/2013 - 10/10/2013 
After the 20 contenders are selected, Engadget will open online voting from 10/4/2013 to 10/10/2013 to let the audience choose 10 semifinalists that will appear at Expand NY and receive a $1,000 travel stipend. We will announce the slate of 10 semifinalists on 10/14/2013. 
Phase 3: Semifinalists at Expand NY 11/9/2013 - 11/10/2013
On Day 1 of Expand NY: All 10 semifinalists will take the stage to give a demo and presentation of their gadgets in groups of three or four. Judges will select the top 5 finalists by their vote, and we will open up online audience voting for the Readers' Choice award after the finalists have been announced.
On Day 2 of Expand NY: The 5 finalists will take the stage again to give a quick demo one last time before the judges cast their votes for the Judges' Choice award. 
*Please note all 10 semifinalists are also given space on the showroom floor. 
Phase 4: Winners crowned on 11/10/13
We will crown two winners on Day 2 according to the following criteria:
  Judges' Choice: Selected by the judges based on presentations and a list of criteria. Winner will receive $10,000 to help fund the project, as well as a review on Engadget.
   Readers' Choice: The project with the greatest number of votes from the total pool of online voting will receive $15,000 to help fund the product, as well as a review on Engadget.
