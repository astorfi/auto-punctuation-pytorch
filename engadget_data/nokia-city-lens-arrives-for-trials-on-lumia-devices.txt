Not to be confused with existing efforts, it throws together an augmented reality interface to give you a better overview of the best places to eat in town, and those tourist hotspots you simply must see. It'll then connect with your current location (which can be shared with your your contacts) and even offer up directions if you're in need. The app remains in testing for now, but you can help Nokia out by donning your labcoat and registering for its Beta Labs at the source below.
