While our US staff neglected to renew their passports in time for their flights, the folks over at Engadget Chinese (traditional or simplified, your choice) were just a hop, skip, and jump away from Taipei, Taiwan, so they've graciously stepped up to the plate and provided the coverage necessary to make us feel that we're right in the thick of it. They've already posted a number of booth tours of your favorite companies, like Intel (who've apparently rented out an absolutely mind-boggling swath of hall), Sandisk, Toshiba, and, um, A Data, with the latter company's tour proving that our Asian colleagues have the same unhealthy obsession with cartoon-inspired gadgets as we do. Don't worry, we'll keep you apprised of the highlights from this year's show, but for the full in-your-face Computex experience, chinese.engadget.com is the place to be.Read - IntelRead - SandiskRead - ToshibaRead - A Data
