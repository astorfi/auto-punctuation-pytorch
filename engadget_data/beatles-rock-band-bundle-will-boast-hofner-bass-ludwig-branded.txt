The email also mentions other "custom" content, which we are hoping will be either a Rickenbacker guitar like the one Lennon often used or a gigantic Harrison-esque moustache / beard combo. We're just going to have to wait it out together guys -- it's not expected until September 9th -- so let's chill and enjoy the video after the break.
