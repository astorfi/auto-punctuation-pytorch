As expected, the grass muncher is ultra-quiet and outputs zero emissions, and you can even program it to take off and get to work whenever you please. Reportedly, a fully charged battery can get about 40 minutes of cutting done, and best of all, the unit will automatically return to its charging base to juice back up if the sun isn't out. Still, with a price tag of around Â£2,000 ($3,971), you may just be better off paying that punk kid down the street to handle your mowing needs.[Via Pocket-lint, video at Megawhat]
