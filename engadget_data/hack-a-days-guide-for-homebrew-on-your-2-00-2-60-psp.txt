Sample III on how to get some homebrew running on yourown PSP, including those running the latest and greatest 2.60 firmware, which was just hacked yesterday. It involvesGrand Theft Auto and a bit of faith, as usual, and the eLoader can't quite handle all the homebrew that's out there,but give 'em some time and you should have a nice little setup for running whatever you please on that shiny littleportable.
