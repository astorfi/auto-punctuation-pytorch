We'll spare you the obvious jokes about hospital food (but probably won't avoid making one about the prospect of
sexy nursebots), but the Delta Regional Medical Center in Greenville, Mississippi is using the Pyxis HelpMate SP
Robotic Courier System to move stuff around in the hospital like meals for patients, medicine, lab samples, supplies,
and medical records. Once the hospital's floorplan has been programmed into it (along with info about how to deal with
the elevators), you just load the robot, which they've nicknamed the "EMMA" (which stands for Electronic Materials
Management Associate") up with whatever you want to sent and then tell it where you want it to go. Too bad it looks
like a photocopier on wheels, it's really ruining our secret fantasies about being tended to by futuristic
nursebots.
