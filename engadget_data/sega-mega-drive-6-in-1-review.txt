We reported on the
return of the Sega Mega Drive (aka Sega Genesis in the
US) at the Tokyo Game Show, and now this plug-and-play system which squeezes that whole 16-bit game console, plus a
mess of games, into a replica of an original controller, has been released in the UK (there are similar ones for the
Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 already available here). Pocket-Lint likes the nostalgia factor of this system from a
decade back, but they suggest you just pick up a used system from eBay, as a few of games included are real throwaways
(namely Kid Chameleon and Flicky). Too bad you can only play solo in all these games, too, since Golden Axe and Dr.
Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine were solid multiplayer games.
