That's the same price as Big Red's Pixi Plus and a pretty substantial discount over Sprint and AT&T, both of which will charge you $149 -- and man, AT&T hasn't even started selling the thing yet, so someone's going to look awful silly on launch day. No word on whether this cut-rate pricing will last or whether the Pixi Plus will fall to free, but if you're looking for a cheap way to get in on the future of HP, well, now's your chance.
