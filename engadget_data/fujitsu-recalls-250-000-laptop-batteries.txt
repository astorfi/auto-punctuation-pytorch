Looks like Apple isn't the only company with batteries
giving them headaches: Fujtisu Siemens is now recalling 250,000 batteries that were shipped with a number of its Amilo
laptops. The affected models include the A7640, A1640, M1405, M1424, M1425, M7405, M7424, M7425, and Pro V2020. Unlike
the Apple case though, the problem with these batteries isn't just that they conk out too soon â€” these can actually
overheat and potentially cause a fire, so you might want to stop using them until you get a replacement.
