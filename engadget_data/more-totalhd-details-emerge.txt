       Although Total HD was announced with plenty of fan fare, there weren't many details. Those details are finally starting to come out and they're not good. We expected the Total HD discs to be available this summer, but we also expected dual layers on both sides. Warner previously said that, after they started to release Total HD discs in June, that they will stop releasing normal discs and that both sides will contain the same material whenever possible. We really hope this doesn't mean that the Blu-ray side will be capped at 15GB like the HD DVD side. They plan to release discs with dual layers on the HD DVD side by August, but this still caps the Blu-ray side at 25GB. While this is supposed to be a temporary problem, the question is when?[Via HighDefDigtest]
