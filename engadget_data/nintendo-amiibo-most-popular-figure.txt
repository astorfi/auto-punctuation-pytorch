Nintendo said its now shipped over 5.7 million of its NFC-connected Amiibo figures, and more interestingly, it's showed which ones do the best around the world. There's indeed some variation, but Link, bless him, is the best-selling Amiibo globally, claiming first place across Japan, the US and Europe. Mario, however, prevents the the Zelda protagonist from getting a grand slam, claiming top spot in Australia. (Mario gets second place in the US, followed by Pikachu.) During the investor-only meeting, Nintendo added that it plans to use Amiibo to unlock vignettes of older games, as well as launch NFC-compatible cards to complement its figure series. We've translated the US' Top Ten right after the break. People like Donkey Kong! Who knew!
