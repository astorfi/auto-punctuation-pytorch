The idea behind a magazine or a newspaper is that you will actually sit down and read it -- but if you only have time to glance at a few headlines, the latest update to Google Play Newsstand is for you. The content aggregator now features a "mini card" view that compresses each story down to just its headline, expanding to the full story only when tapped. A new widget offers truncated versions of the latest stories too, allowing users to click through a limited set of stories from their device's home screen. The update also adds new organization features for magazines, additional language support, a smattering of bug fixes and the ability to translate foreign news sources instantly. It's hardly a visual overhaul, but the the update is certainly a no-brainer for the Google Play news junkie.
