Now, rumor has it that the Xbox 360's preening for a date with Hulu, too. Though plans aren't set in stone, Gear Live tells us Hulu has been spotted in internal Xbox 360 dashboard builds, and that Microsoft will introduce the streaming video service as part of their Xbox LIVE experience at E3 2010. The publication is mighty certain here, but at this point we can't corroborate for ourselves. If this does end up happening, the question is how much it might cost, as we hear there's going to be some sort of fee -- perhaps Hulu will be part of that "Xbox LIVE Platinum Tier" rumor that gets dragged out most every year.
