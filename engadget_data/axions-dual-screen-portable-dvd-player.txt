Enter Axion's new AXN-6079 dual 7-inch screen portable DVDplayer, capable of accepting a video-in for in-car gameplay, or good for just splitting the screen two ways for yourlittle brats darlings who haven't yet learned to play nice and share. We're pretty sure, however,these things aren't wireless, so if you're cable-phobic, be forewarned before plunking down your $230 when they'reavailable at some point this month.
