As recently as just a few weeks ago Sony had staunchly deniedthe delay, though, and is now laying the blame squarely at the feet of the "copyright protection" inSony's own Blu-ray Disc next-gen format, which is now expected to be finalized by next month. Whatevs, at this pointwe'll just be happy to see ours land Stateside in time for the holidays. Mr. Kutagari also confirmed that at least somePS3s will feature an upgradeable 60GB disk supporting the Linux OS, support a variety of TVs, and have backward compatibility for PlayStation 1 and 2 games. Also, that rumored HUB service wasconfirmed, which will go by the working title of the PlayStation Network Platform, and will be free (the Basic versionanyway) supporting voice/video chat, messsaging, on-line shopping, and more. While an exact price for the PS3 was notstated, a minimum price range of about $425 was announced. See, fessing to the delay wasn't so so hard now, was itSony? Glad you finally got it over with.[Thanks everyone who sent this in]
