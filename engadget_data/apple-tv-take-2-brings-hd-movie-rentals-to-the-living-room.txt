Better yet, it's hitting back with the Apple TV, take 2 (same box, new firmware), which enables users to rent movies directly on their HDTVs in high-definition with full 5.1-channel Dolby surround sound (but only on "select" films). Announced today at Macworld, owners will be able to rent HD movies (still no 1080i/p) for $3.99 and $4.99, and there are reportedly 100 HD titles to choose from starting today. So, what's the admission price? $229 and shipping in two weeks, but best of all, existing Apple TV owners will be entitled to all the fancy extras as well courtesy of a free update that'll be available as a free automatic download in a fortnight.
