If you've ever stumbled across a Flipboard article that you just had to share with the world, you'll want to grab the iOS app's latest update. The new version lets you share articles directly from the app, delivering notifications to friends if they're already Flipboard readers. All shared articles now show up in a central area, and you can turn this list into a magazine if your friends have impeccable taste. Flipboard hasn't said when Android and Windows users will get to spread the literary wealth, but we'd expect a corresponding app upgrade before long.
