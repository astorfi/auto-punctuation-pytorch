The exclusive broadcast will include three high definition airings with 5.1 surround audio beginning at 6 p.m. If you're somehow unaware of the High School Musical series phenomenon, this is likely caused by not being a girl between the ages of 9-15, or somehow related to one. This preview is just a taste of what to expect when Disney Channel HD launches on DirecTV in early 2008, or when High School Musical 2 is released on Blu-ray in December. We're sure that Zac Efron, Corbin Bleu and the rest are exactly what you had in mind for your new HDTV.
