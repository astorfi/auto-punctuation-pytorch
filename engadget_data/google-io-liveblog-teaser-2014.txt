Google's developer conference is but an annual affair, and it's kicking off in 24 hours with its traditional keynote. We'll be liveblogging it as it happens, and if it's anything like past years, expect it to be incredibly long (last year's went on for 3.5 hours, and we're hearing this one will be around 2 hours) and packed with plenty of news for developers and consumers alike. So if you're into anything Google-related, you'd best virtually skydive into the Moscone Center with us as we cover all of the company's crazy antics. Bookmark the link below and meet us there tomorrow!
