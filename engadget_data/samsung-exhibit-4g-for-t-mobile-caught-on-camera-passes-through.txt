We can tell from the photos and fillings that the T759 packs both front- and rear-facing cameras (the latter with an LED flash), a microSD card slot, Android 2.3.3 with a TouchWiz veneer, and an HSPA+ radio. It's been suggested that the Exhibit could possibly have specs that line up with the rumored Galaxy S II Mini, including a 3.7-inch Super AMOLED screen and a 1.4GHz processor -- according to TmoNews, that CPU might be the older ARM11 variety, which could help explain the underwhelming Quadrant score in the images. Price and availability are up in the air, but we'd err on the side of cheap and soon. Check out the source for a few more pics.
