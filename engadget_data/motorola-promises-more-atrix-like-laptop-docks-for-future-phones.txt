Sounds like Motorola CEO Sanjay Jha is ready to give it another try, though -- on the company's earnings results call this past week, he told investors that Moto is planning a whole series of Lapdock devices in the second half of the year:
You will see multiple devices from us in the second half launching with these capabilities, and we will expand the range of our Lapdock devices so we cover a broader price point, addressing both the enterprise premium tier as well as more consumer tiers. "We plan on introducing successive iterations of our Webtop software and accessories that incorporate improved productivity tools and multiple price points," he also said, echoing previous promises to include Webtop in all high-end smartphones starting this summer. Perhaps those closely spaced I/O ports on the Droid Bionic and Targa won't go to waste after all? If you simply can't wait, Sanjay claims there's also an official price drop inbound for the Atrix 4G -- AT&T will offer a bundle with the Lapdock and phone for $400 later this month.
