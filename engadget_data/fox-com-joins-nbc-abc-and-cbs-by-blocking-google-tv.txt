Blocking by Flash ID is the order of the day and takes simple browser workarounds out of play, so unless users want to go the PlayOn route, there's large swaths of legitimate video on the web that's now inaccessible. This same type of blocking is likely to affect other devices like the Boxee Box that launches tonight, so prepare for a bit more preening by the "get an HTPC!" crowd while fans of dedicated media streamers will have to look elsewhere for video to feed their hardware.
