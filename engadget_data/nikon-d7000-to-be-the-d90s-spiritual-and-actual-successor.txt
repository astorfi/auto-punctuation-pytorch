 With the Nikon D3100 now official and out in the open, it's time to tilt the rumor mills back towards a successor to the company's much-loved D90. Nikon Rumors has a few morsels, including what it's confident is the official name: D7000. (Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?) No source is provided, so until we get something official, just use pencil to write it down on your wishlist. Got that? Good. The site also has a few other details that it's less sure on... but just to tease: 100 percent viewfinder coverage (in contrast, the D90 has 96 percent) and dual memory card slots of some sort. Last we heard, the whispers pointed to a mid-September reveal with a 16 megapixel sensor, 1920 x 1080 HD video, and a $1200 price tag -- tempting, but then again, that D3100 is looking mighty nice for the impatient consumer in us.
