Swedish music streaming giant Spotify has updated its iOS app with new features to help you find and follow artists both online and offline. Already present in its desktop counterpart, gigs and concert dates have made their way onto iPads and iPhones thanks to live music-tracking service Songkick. Spotify has also boosted the app's search features, expanding its reach to include user playlists and profiles while giving it a noticeable speed bump. Localization support for Japanese, Russian and Indonesian has also made it into the app, giving us a clue as to where the music service will open for business next.
