  The Pantech Element has been hanging around the rumor mill for quite some time, so it wasn't much of a surprise when we saw it show up at the AT&T Developer Summit keynote earlier today. All of the specs were right on with what we'd heard before: 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon CPU, 8-inch TFT XGA display, 5MP rear camera / 2MP front-facing, 6,400 mAh battery for over 12 hours of high-use battery life and of course, waterproof with IP57 certification. We got a little clarification on what Pantech means by this, and it turns out that the tablet can be submerged in up to one foot of water for thirty minutes without batting an eye.  Playing around with the tablet, we were surprised by its light weight and classy look. It was incredibly glossy, however, which was painfully obvious by the number of times we felt compelled to wipe smudges off the front and back. The ports of entry were all covered appropriately by secured plastic flaps, but it's necessary in order to keep water or other liquid from getting inside. The tablet runs on Android 3.2, and in our limited time with the device felt smooth and without lag. Overall, it felt as though the tablet certainly fit the price range, which isn't something we were able to say about the $600 (on contract) HTC Jetstream. The Element will be available starting January 22nd for $300 with a two-year commitment, though AT&T is running a limited promotion in which you can get both the Element and the Pantech Burst together for $250. Take a look below to check out some up close and personal images and a snazzy video.
