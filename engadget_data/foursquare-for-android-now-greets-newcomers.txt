 Foursquare gave more adventurous iOS users an updated Explore section at the start of the month that, among many other things, better highlighted either just-opened locations or the hottest places to be. It's the Android crowd's turn to check out new scenes: their updated Foursquare app will tell a traveler what sights and sounds are worth catching when visiting a new location, and better emphasizes what's new for anyone on familiar turf. If you're a tourist worried about fitting in like a local, or just want to check out a fresh location before it's ruined by popularity, hit the Google Play link at the source.
