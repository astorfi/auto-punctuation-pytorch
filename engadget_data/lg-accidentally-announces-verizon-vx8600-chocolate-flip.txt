Dotting all your i's and crossing all your t's is a painstaking process, we know, LG... we don't fault you in the least for leaking press shots (accidentally, we presume) for your VX8600 at CTIA. It looks like the official fact sheet slipped through your fingers, too: EV-DO, internal 220 x 176 and external 160 x 128 displays, Bluetooth 1.1 with A2DP, microSD expansion, and a real, actual speakerphone this time around -- nothing we didn't know or suspect already. Now go get your stern talking-to from Verizon, make amends, and we'll be talking to you shortly when this thing actually goes official.[Via Phone Scoop]
