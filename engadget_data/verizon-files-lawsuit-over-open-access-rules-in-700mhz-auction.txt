 Talk about gettin' riled up. Verizon Wireless has reportedly "challenged in federal appeals court the FCC's 700 MHz open-access rules," claiming that the auction "violates the US Constitution, violates the Administrative Procedures Act, and is arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by the substantial evidence and otherwise contrary to law." Once you're done swallowing that mouthful, it'll likely be difficult to resist rolling your eyes, as it's pretty clear whose interests are being looked after in the suit. Nevertheless, neither Verizon Wireless nor an FCC spokesman would comment further on the filing, but needless to say, at least one carrier isn't exactly kosher with that succulent 22MHz block of spectrum being so open.
