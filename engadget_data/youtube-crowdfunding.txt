Plenty of users weren't happy when YouTube ditched its commenting system in favor of Google+, and following that backlash the video-sharing service has been working hard to prove it's listening. Its latest effort is a "Creator Preview" video teasing upcoming features inspired by the feedback of channel owners. These include a standalone mobile app with more useful tools and a new crowd-funding option that lets you contribute money directly through YouTube.



The ability to donate to projects without having to hit up Kickstarter or Indiegogo is probably the most interesting tidbit, but a new app tailor-made for creators is also pretty interesting -- especially for those who want to manage their accounts on the go. Finally, captions and subtitles will soon be crowd-sourced for 60-plus languages, as YouTube says more than 80 percent of its traffic comes from outside the US. No word on when these new features will show up, but for now you can check out the video below.
