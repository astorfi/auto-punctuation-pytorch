But, interaction with the app itself was a bit sluggish, something that's said to be fixed in version 3.0.4, also dubbed SR4. This version offers some serious performance improvements for tapping around the interface and also mixes in POI reviews from Qype. Qype is a sort of European version of Yelp with a similarly silly name, and while that doesn't help we Americans much, we always did feel like something of an afterthought to Nokia anyway. The new version of Ovi Maps is out now, so get it while the gettin's good.
