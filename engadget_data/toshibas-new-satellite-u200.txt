Toshiba, for instance, just dropped their new U200 series of ultra-portables into their Satellite range where quality and affordability are meant to merge. Starting at just 4.1-pounds and measuring-in at 1.4-inches thick, this 12.1-inch laptop maxes-out with a 2.16GHz Core Duo T2600 CPU, 4GB DDR2 RAM, 100GB of 7200 RPM SATA disk and still manages to slap in a pair of stereo speakers, 6-in-1 media adapter, fingerprint reader, 802.11a/b/g WiFi, Bluetooth 2.0 with EDR, and DVD dual-layer writer. All that goodness and yet they only offer measly Intel 950 graphics acceleration. Of course, if you can only muster the $929 starting price, your config will drop considerably to a Celeron M, 256MB RAM, 40GB disk, and CD-RW/DVD-ROM sans Bluetooth or WiFi. Yeah we were thinking the same, that entry-level $1,099 MacBook or $699 Dell D520 are both looking pretty sweet right about now.Â  [Via CoreDuoInfo]
