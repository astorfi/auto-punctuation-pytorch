 Dell's revenues and profits continued to shrink in Q3 of fiscal year 2013. While the manufacturer did manage to rake in revenues of $13.7 billion, that marks a significant drop from Q2's $14.5 billion and the $15.5 billion it pulled in over the same period last year. Profits also took a sharp downturn, with only $475 million of the money coming in boosting the bottom line. By comparison, Q3 of 2012 saw Dell padding its pockets with $893 million in net income -- that's a 47 percent drop. One of the few bright spots for the Texas company continues to be its Enterprise Solutions division, which has seen its revenues grow three-percent year-over-year. Unfortunately, that may not be enough to stave off losses for much longer as its consumer division continues its dramatic slide, posting a total loss of $65 million for the quarter. The drop off was global as well, with revenues falling by double digits in Europe and Asia and 9 percent here in the US. With its small and medium business units holding steady and the enterprise services accounting for almost 50 percent of the company's gross margin, we wouldn't be surprised if Dell further shifted its focus from the consumer sector.

   Revenue of $13.7 billion  GAAP earnings of $0.27 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $0.39 per share  Cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion  Dell Enterprise Solutions and Services revenue grew 3 percent year over year to $4.8 billion  ROUND ROCK, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dell announced fiscal 2013 third-quarter results today with revenue of $13.7 billion, GAAP operating income of $589 million, and GAAP earnings of $0.27 per share. Dell's enterprise solution strategy continued to show positive results with server and networking revenue increasing 11 percent year over year.

   "In a difficult global IT spending environment we saw solid proof points that demonstrate progress in our strategy"  "We are consistently executing our end-to-end solutions strategy for the benefit of our customers," said Michael Dell, Chairman and CEO. "In the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Quest Software which – along with other recent acquisitions like SonicWALL and Wyse – adds leading management, security, virtualization and cloud capabilities to our expanding portfolio of powerful solutions."

   "In a difficult global IT spending environment we saw solid proof points that demonstrate progress in our strategy," said Brian Gladden, Dell CFO. "A highlight has been the strong progress of our newly introduced servers, with our server and networking business up 11 percent. We're also encouraged by early interest in our new Windows 8 touch portfolio and the opportunities it creates for our commercial and consumer businesses."

   Mr. Gladden added that strong cash flow from operations generated over the past two years continued with $1.3 billion in the quarter and, combined with a strong cash position this fiscal year, helped enable Dell to invest in new capabilities and return almost $900 million year to date to shareholders through the company's recently adopted dividend and share repurchases.

   Strategic Highlights:

   Dell Enterprise Solutions and Services revenue grew 3 percent year over year to $4.8 billion. The company year to date is 4 percent ahead of last year's ES&S revenue at $14.2 billion, accounting for greater than 50 percent of the company's gross margin thus far this year. The ES&S business is on an annual run-rate approaching $20 billion.  Server and networking revenue for the quarter grew 11 percent. Dell was the only top-3 server provider to have positive unit growth in the quarter. Dell's server growth was driven by its new, 12th-Generation line, leadership in hyper-scale infrastructure solutions and an increase in customer adoption of cloud solutions for their IT requirements. Dell's differentiated intellectual property and solutions have resulted in solid growth in this business.  Dell's Services business continues to execute well, with gross margin percentages improving sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter, as the company focuses on the most profitable areas of the business. Growth in support, deployment and security services highlighted the quarter.  Business Units and Regions:

   Large Enterprise revenue was $4.2 billion in the quarter, an 8 percent decline. Operating income was $325 million, or 7.8 percent of revenue.  Public revenue was $3.8 billion, an 11 percent decrease. Operating income for the quarter was $352 million, or 9.2 percent of revenue.

   Dell sees the challenging global macro-economic environment continuing in the fourth quarter, which will continue to impact the company's results. The company expects sequential revenue growth of 2 to 5 percent. For the full year, Dell maintains its expectation for at least $1.70 in earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis. Going forward, the company is committed to its end-to-end solutions strategy and creating value over the long term.
