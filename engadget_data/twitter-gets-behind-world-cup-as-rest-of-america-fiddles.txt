An event so magnificent it can only be held once every four years for fear of causing economic collapse as businesses shut down to watch their nation's sons play soccer football. Twitter gets it, and has launched a special site that aggregates tweets on a global and per match basis allowing you to voyeuristically share in the human drama via a real-time twitter feed. All without risk of getting punched in the eye. Twitter's also making it easy to connect with players and teams, at least those of whom have not been restricted from using the service, right Holland? Check it out as the first match between host South Africa and Mexico begins shortly.
