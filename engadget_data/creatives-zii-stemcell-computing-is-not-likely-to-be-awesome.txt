A new teaser on its site promises that "Everything you know is about to change..." and forwards on to the dubious Zii.com -- with a logo that couldn't be more obvious about its Wii inspiration. Four leaf clovers shimmer and shake, and a trademarked term chills us to our very core: Stemcell Computing. Yeah, how about no. If this is at all interesting to you, we recommend registering for updates soon, before this company manages to implode the Earth with its mad, mad science.[Thanks, Grayson S.]
