Of course, that matches the original information mentioned to the Wall Street Journal by James Cameron, plus Panasonic has participated heavily in the movie's promotion and would love a little return on its investment sooner rather than later. Still, this remains firmly in rumor territory so we'll bring the question to you, will we be able to watch Avatar in 3D, at home, in 2010?
