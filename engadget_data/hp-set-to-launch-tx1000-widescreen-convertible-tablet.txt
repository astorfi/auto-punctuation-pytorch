 Although HP's had the business-centric convertible tablet down pat for awhile now, it's mixing in a bit of that general consumer lovin' with the forthcoming tx1000. Taking design roots from the entertainment-based Pavilion laptops, this two-faced machine boasts a twistable touchscreen, built-in webcam, fingerprint reader, and a removable LightScribe-compatible DVD burner to boot. Other niceties include a 12.1-inch widescreen LCD, 5-in-1 flash card reader, Altec Lansing stereo speakers, dual headphone jacks, an HP mini remote control, WiFi, twin omni-directional microphones, and a lightweight shell. While we'd love to spill more exact specifications, the Windows Vista Partner Stories brochure put the brakes on the particulars before things got too frontal, but as with Toshiba's elusive R400, we expect this bad boy to show up alongside Vista's big release, if not sooner.
