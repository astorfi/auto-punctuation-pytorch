It'll let you search for anything in the iTunes Store, preview it, and download it directly to your iPod touch. That then gets synced to your main iTunes library for safe-keeping and, if the download isn't quite done, it'll even finish things up for you. Those less certain of what they're looking for can also make use of the buttons for featured music and top tens. Unlike the ringtones for the iPhone, songs bought on the iTunes WiFi store cost the same as they do in the regular store and it'll be available in all 22 countries Apple operates in.
