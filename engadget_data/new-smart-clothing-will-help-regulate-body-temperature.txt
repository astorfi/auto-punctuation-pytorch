The University of Bath and the London College of Fashion are working on biometric clothing which will help you to
release your seed. Uh, metaphorically that is. See, they're currently researching a special material with teeny tiny
"spikes" that react to your sweaty meat sack (read: skin) to regulate airflow â€” when you get warm the spikes open, when
you get cold they close. Just like the system used by pine cones to drop their seeds, dig? Expect to see this new
material on display at Expo 2005 in Japan starting March 2006.
