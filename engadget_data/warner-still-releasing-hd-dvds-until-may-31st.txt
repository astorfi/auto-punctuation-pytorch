We definitely assumed that Warner would continue to release HD DVDs until May 31st -- even after the format completely fell apart -- but thanks to DVDTown, now we've got a nice cushion of confirmation. According to "studio sources" that spoke with the site, the outfit will indeed continue pushing out red flicks as promised until June dawns, after which it will crank out Blu-ray Discs alone unless demand necessitates any restocking of older HD DVD titles. Nothing new here, but nice to know Warner won't be ditching the failed format early.
