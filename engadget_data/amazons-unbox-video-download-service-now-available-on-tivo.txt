So excuse our surprise to find Amazon's Unbox video download service "Now Available!" to any broadband connected Series2 or Series3 TiVo. That's right, after a brief pilot kicked off in February, TiVo subscribers can now register their box with Amazon and get $15 worth of free movies and TV shows in the process. Not all Unbox content is available for download -- only about 1,376 titles are tagged for TiVo download as of this posting. We presume that's due to the need to transcode titles into a TiVo-playable format and not the result of some nefarious meddling by the studios. TV shows cost $1.99 per episode while most movies can be purchased for between $9.99 and $14.99 -- movies rentals start at $1.99 although most are listed for either $2.99 or $3.99. If you already own a TiVo then this is about as easy as movie downloading can get. [Via TiVo Lovers]
