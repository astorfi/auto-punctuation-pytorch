We don't know if it's the clinical green background, the X-acto knife used to take it apart, or the blood red
membrane revealed beneath the surface, but these iPod
shuffle dissection photos are strangely disturbing.Â  Remember kids, don't try this at home (unless you're
going to send us some pictures, that is).
