While we'd already heard the typical techie hub bub that goes along with such systems, IBM is now explaining a bit more about how the process will eventually work. Essentially, researchers have created a system in which "tree-like branched trenches" are placed in the copper cap, where a newly-thinned thermal paste can be applied with half the pressure of current renditions, netting a "twofold increase in cooling performance." The micrometer-sized channels basically act as an "irrigation system" to allow the toasty particles to homogeneously escape rather than building up in the self-proclaimed "magic cross" section. We know, this still isn't spelling things out in layman's terms, but if you're truly interested in knowing precisely how IBM plans on slashing the heat emitted by your future CPUs, grab your reading glasses and hit the read link.
