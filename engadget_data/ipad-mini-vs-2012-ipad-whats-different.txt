We've all known that iPad prototypes of every shape and size reside inside Apple's design lab, but few of us believed we'd ever see one on store shelves. Of course, when the rumor machine leapt into top gear, it seemed that Apple had relaxed its legendary stance on "tweener tablets." Now Tim Cook and chums have whipped the covers from the iPad Mini, it's time to delve inside.


Given that this is an entirely new product from the company, we thought we'd stack it up against the third and fourth generation iPads -- the latter coming out just seven months after we threw down cash on the former. That way, we can identify what compromises and concessions have been made to squeeze the iPad experience into a smaller body. Join us after the break to to take part in the stats extravaganza, but excuse us if we're a little distracted -- we're still suffering from concussion where Apple kicked all of us third-generation iPad owners in the teeth.
