The Activa 4G isn't just Huawei's first LTE smartphone in the US, it's temporarily the least expensive LTE phone in the country at $149 contract-free for a "limited time." Digging around, it's certainly possible to find out how Huawei and MetroPCS reached that price: the 3.5-inch, 320 x 480 screen, 800MHz processor and five-megapixel rear shooter won't have Verizon Galaxy S III customers developing second thoughts. Still, there is a front VGA camera on the Android 2.3-toting phone, and MetroPCS preloads a copy of the movie Kung-Fu Panda 2 on the bundled 4GB microSD card. You won't have to wait at all if it sounds like a bargain, as the Activa 4G is already sitting in stores real and virtual as you read this.
