We know RC lawnmowers have been around a while,
but we're into Evatech's RCLM2006S not because "its mission is to deliver fast straight lines and pleasure of the
strong kind," but because it looks something a bit more like a really fugly 4WD offroaderâ€”not a tool you're supposed to
use to trim down that jungle you've got growing out front. It'll set you back $2,300 US though, so if you really want
it, make sure you have a secret bank account hidden from your significant other; basically there's no way you're going
to be able to justify this thing to anyone, even yourself.
