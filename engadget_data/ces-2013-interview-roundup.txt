Our CES plates were jam-packed full of eye-opening conversations this year. We had the chance to speak to top tech luminaries, entrepreneurs, celebrities and fellow journalists. Much of that opportunity arose from the return of our stage, parked right in the middle of the Las Vegas Convention Center's Grand Lobby. We blew things out this year, packing the schedule from the show's opening on Tuesday morning to its close on Friday night.


Below we have a list of the interviews we did at this year's show, both on-stage and off, so you can relive the thoughts, theories and comments that defined this year's Consumer Electronics Show.



CompaniesWe were fortunate enough to run the spectrum with our interviews this year, from top execs at companies like Sony to the heads of crowdfunded startups to a lawyer from non-profit digital rights organization, EFF. The conversations were fascinating and ongoing, running the gamut of the CES experience, including grizzled CES veterans and wide-eyed first timers. And then, of course, there were the demos: speedy wireless transfer, shiny new mobile operating systems, a flipping drone and some insanely cool wearables.

CelebritiesIt wouldn't be CES -- or Vegas -- without the celebrities. We had some fascinating run-ins with the likes of Richard Dreyfuss and Danny DeVito, but it was on-stage where the famous attendees truly shined. We spoke to a sash-wearing, shirt-ripping geek icon, a headphone-hawking rapper, the spiritually fascinated founder of a blogging empire and a YouTube-famous racecar driver. And then, of course, there was an encounter with an '80s prop comic that we'll almost certainly never forget.

JournalistsWe may have been the official online news source of CES 2013, but believe us, we know we were far from the only media company present. To help broaden our own news-gathering perspectives, we used each night's podcast, to discuss the show's events with some of our favorite folks in the media.
