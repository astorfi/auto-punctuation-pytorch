Between LG and the rest of the leakers running wild these last few weeks, there's not a whole lot we didn't know about the G4 before today. Screen details? Leather? Word of that sweet, sweet f/1.8 camera lens? Common knowledge, dear friends. Now that LG's G4 has crossed the boundary between leak and actual, honest-to-goodness product, though, let's take a quick first look at how those elements -- and quite a few more -- have come together in the company's finest flagship.​

Pick up a G4 with that latter, plastic back and it'll feel instantly familiar, like a very slightly curved G3 (for extra durability, natch), or a flattened-out G Flex2. Trust me, though: If you're in the market for one of these things, you're going to want one clad in LG's vegetable-tanned leather. The company's event invitation showed off its fashionista ambitions to anyone interested, but it's even more handsome in person. We spent most of our time pawing a G4 with a deep caramel-colored leather back -- it was sturdy and unyielding, with less springiness than the leather you'll find on the back of the 2014 Moto X. To hear LG's brass tell the tale, it takes a full three months to convert a cow's skin into a cover for your phone, and some fetching stitching with Gütermann thread acts as icing on the cake.
