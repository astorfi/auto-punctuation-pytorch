Augmenting that impression is ASUS, who has now made its heavyweight presence known with the newly announced ECleaner, to be released under the AGAiT brand. This new bot comes with a UV light for disinfection, a fragrance slot, the usual photo sensor to prevent it from falling off a cliff, and naturally a remote control for the hands-on househusband. The biggest attraction though -- beyond that killer paintjob -- is likely to be the $150 price tag, which significantly undercuts most of what's out on the market right now. Video of the little spherical hipster lies after the break.
