The 6267 (€240/$322) clamshell features dedicated music keys, a 2 megapixel camera with flash, 3G data, and up to 4GB of storage expansion you'll have to locate yourself. The 6121 classic (€260/$349) on the left goes quadband GSM and WCDMA 2100 and "900" (we presume is a Nokia typo meaning 1900) with HSDPA data and packs in a couple of cameras topping out at 2 megapixels. Bringing up the tail is the budget 3500 classic (€135/$181) candybar which ships with an FM radio, 2 megapixel camera, and about 3 hours of talk time or 12 days of standby. All are expected to ship by Q3 in quiet fulfillment of your prosaic ambitions. Feign interest in the pics over at Engadget Mobile.Update: Oh lord, the spec sheet is up and sure enough the 6121 goes WCDMA at 900MHz. That makes it one of, if not the first production caliber phone to do so. The lower frequency is meant to complement 2100MHz deployments by extending UMTS coverage in Europe[Thanks, Matt]
