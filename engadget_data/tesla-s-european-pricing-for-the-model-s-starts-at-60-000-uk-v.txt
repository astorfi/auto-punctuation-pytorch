 Hot on the heels of the announcement that it'll open a distribution center in The Netherlands, Tesla Motors has spilled the beans on how many limbs Europeans will have to auction to afford one of its Model S EVs. The 60kWh edition will set you back €60,000 with the sportier (and faster) 85kWh version will begin at just under €92,000. Britons eager to get their hands on the cars will take heart that a right-hand-drive model may hit production in the tail-end of next year, but if you place your order before the end of December, you'll get the same €1,700 discount that our friends on the continent will enjoy.
