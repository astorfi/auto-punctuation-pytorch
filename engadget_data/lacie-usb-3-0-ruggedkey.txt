Yes, it's as fat as it looks in the SanDisk Extreme comparison photo after the break, but most of that girth comes from the rubbery orange cushion designed to protect your data from water, extreme temperatures and 100-meter drops. Exactly how much of that protection you'd retain even after removing the orange part isn't yet clear, but we can vouch for the fact that an 850MB video file made it across from the RuggedKey to a Retina MacBook Pro at almost exactly the claimed maximum transfer rate of 150MB/s. The write speed wasn't so stunning compared to the SanDisk -- only around 40MB/s when data travelled the other way, or a quarter of the speed of a 64GB Extreme stick -- but then, at $40 for 16GB and $70 for 32GB, the Lacie also comes in a lot cheaper.

The RuggedKey is the latest addition to LaCie's award-winning line of Rugged drives designed by Neil Poulton. From inclement weather to unauthorized access, the RuggedKey protects data from any threat.

   Ready for life's Adventures

   The iconic orange bumper is back, this time to protect a USB key from heat, cold, and 100m drops. The RuggedKey is a great accessory for an adventure photographer who needs a way to keep his photos protected and accessible while on the road. If the key is dropped off a cliff or stepped on during a hike – no problem! The files are still intact. Furthermore, it's IP-54 certified to resist damage from dust and water making it the best device for on-the-go data protection.   Usb 3.0 speeds

   USB 3.0 continues to proliferate as the industry adopts the technology. The RuggedKey, with USB 3.0 speeds up to 150MB/s, is excellent for transferring files. Users can transfer an HD movie, 3,000 photos or a 5GB file in less than one minute. It is also backwards compatible with USB 2.0, making the key a fast and convenient device.

   Cloud storage and data encryption

   Wuala Secure Cloud Storage makes data on the RuggedKey easily accessible without compromising security. Wuala lets users keep one copy of their data on the key and one in the cloud. That way, if a user forgets the key at the office, they can still access the files via the cloud. And for the ultimate in security, AES 256-bit encryption prevents unauthorised file access to the key with password protection.   Availability

   The LaCie RuggedKey comes in 16GB and 32GB capacities and will be available at Apple® Retail and through LaCie Online Store and LaCie Resellers starting at the suggested retail price of £34.95 (VAT included).
