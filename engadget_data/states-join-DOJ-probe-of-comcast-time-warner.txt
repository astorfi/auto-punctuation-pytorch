The future of Comcast's plans to bring Time Warner Cable's subscribers under its umbrella are still very much up in the air. The Senate is planning hearings about the merger later this month and now several states are joining the Justice Department (DOJ) in its probe of the buyout. The attorneys general in Florida, Indiana and other states are working with the DOJ to determine if the deal would violate antitrust laws. Each state is also looking at how the combination of two of the biggest cable providers in the US would effect local markets. While it's not unusual for states to join the federal government in antitrust investigations, it does give the DOJ additional resources to work with. At the moment the exact number of states joining the probe is unknown, but we're sure all will be revealed in time.
