Perhaps in a preemptive strike against supposed Wiimote competition from the likes of Microsoft and Sony, Nintendo is beefing up its motion support with this add-on, which is supposed to proved "an unmatched level of precision and immersion," with sensors to supplement the accelerometer and sensor bar to provide 1:1 motion -- as in, I move my arm this much, my character moves his arm that much. So far that's all we know about the unit, Nintendo will be detailing more at its E3 media briefing tomorrow.[Thanks, Erie T.]
