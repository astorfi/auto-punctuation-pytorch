Well, your search is over, because some completely unknown team working for an anonymous company which is definitely located in the heart of China has created the "Portable Media Player". While you're gestating on that name, get a load of what this "system" can do: NES, SNES, Sega MD and SMC support, AVI, MPEG-4, DivX, XviD, MP3, WMA, and FLAC playback, built-in 1.3 megapixel MPEG-4 video camera, MP3 voice recorder, E-Book reader, SD card support up to 4GB, and holographic multi-phasic projection mode (okay, we made that one up). Sure, you could carry around 12 or 13 separate devices to do all of the above, but why go to the trouble when one of these confused little puppies can be yours for just $109.68?[Thanks, Craig]
