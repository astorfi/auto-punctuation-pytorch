But in truth you need some spankin' good software to back up the 802.11, or you're just wasting a chip. From the looks of the documentation of the Archos 604 WiFi, they've at least got it half right. The new version, which we spotted last week, includes not only 802.11b/g connectivity, but replaces the 4.3-inch 480 x 272 screen with a touchscreen version. As reported, they've packed in an Archos-specific version of the Opera browser, making the device much more akin to Nokia's 770 tablet than the Zune. Along with tabbed browsing and other touchscreen-based perks, the new 604 has full-fledged Windows file sharing capabilities, and seemingly robust WiFi connection tools. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any snazzy WiFi-based sync, sharing or purchasing capabilities -- all main selling points of the Zune -- so the verdict is still out on how successful this could actually be. Still, we're definitely willing to give it a once over, and a harmless little cage-match-to-the-death between it and our 770 shouldn't go too far amiss. Keep reading for a few pics of the WiFi in action.
