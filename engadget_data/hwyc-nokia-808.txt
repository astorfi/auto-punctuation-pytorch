 Nokia's 808 PureView. It's a Symbian phone... but it's got a magical camera. It's a Symbian phone... but... that lens! You can imagine the wrangling when people were deciding if they wanted to buy one of these last summer. On one hand, it was running a Zombie operating system with weak internals. On the other, it had a camera sensor that took truly beautiful images. So, for the merry few of you who purchased this handset, what was it like to use on a daily basis? Normally, we'd ask you to chime in with suggestion on how you'd change it, but let's be honest. If Nokia slapped this 41-megapixel sensor on a Lumia 920, we'd have difficulty looking at anything else.
