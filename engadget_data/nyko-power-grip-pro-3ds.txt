If so, Nyko is looking to oblige with its Power Grip Pro case for the aforementioned Nintendo handheld. The outfit boasts that the peripheral will triple your battery life alongside the added functionality of an analog slider control. As you might expect, the unit sports a comfy ergonomic design that should keep you and your device quite cozy. Of course, we'll be the judge of that ourselves when we give the Power Grip Pro the hands-on treatment later this week. No word on pricing yet, but the accessory is slated hit shelves this October -- in plenty of time to snag one for the holiday season. For a look at the kit when from another angle (closed for transport), head on past the break.
