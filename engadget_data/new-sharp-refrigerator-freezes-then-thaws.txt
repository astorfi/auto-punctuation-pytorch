 You know, we love a good "love hot warehouse" (thanks Google Translation!) as much as the next guy, but we're not really sure what that has to do with Sharp's new refrigerator. From what we can tell based on our poor Japanese language reading skills and our uncanny ability to decipher strange cartoons, it appears that this fridge has a thawing mechanism inside one of the drawers so that you can unfreeze that meat you bought a month ago. We're still not exactly sure how it this fridge works its magic other than by blowing warm air into the thawing tray, but perhaps all you Nipponophiles can help us out, ok? The only other information that we can glean from this cartoon is that apparently this mechanism takes place by sacrificing your right eye to the Japanese fridge gods.[Thanks, xman]
