The ultraslim Lenovo ThinkPad X1 is most definitely real, coming soon, and just so happens to be packing some fancy new battery technology as well. This intel comes straight from Lenovo's own servers, where a highly informative PDF (intended for reseller partners, but accessible to all) dishes the dirt on the upcoming laptop. The X1's "slice" battery won't be user-replaceable, but what you lose in flexibility will be made up for in sheer performance gains, as Lenovo is touting it'll last three times as long as a normal battery and will recharge 2.5 times faster than previous ThinkPad cells. That's thanks to some fanciness named RapidCharge that will revitalize the X1 to 80 percent within 30 minutes. The presentation slides show the X1 right alongside Lenovo's latest Edge models, the E420s and E220s, as part of "a new generation of ThinkPads," and given that both of those are now shipping, the ultraslim, but still unannounced, X1 can't be far behind. Finally, just for some added intrigue, we've also spotted mention of an "X Slate" within the document -- any ideas as to what that might look like?
