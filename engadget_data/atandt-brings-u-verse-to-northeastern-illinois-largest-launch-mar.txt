You heard right -- Northeastern Illinois has just been dubbed AT&T's largest U-verse market launch to date, giving more than 175 communities the ability to acquire its fiber-based services. More specifically, residents in Bellwood, Buffalo Grove, Crystal Lake, Dolton, Elmhurst, Harvey, Hoffman Estates, Melrose Park, Oak Lawn, Orland Park, River Grove, St. Charles and Waukegan (among many, many more) can all phone up AT&T and get U-verse headed to their abodes. And yes, Big Ten Network is indeed included in the lineup, so you can let loose that pending sigh of relief.
