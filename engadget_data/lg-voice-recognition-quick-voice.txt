Just announced in Korea and rolling out soon for various members of the Optimus family like the Vu (later this month) and LTE II (in July), it brings natural voice recognition to commonly used functions like searching, setting up appointments or pulling up videos on YouTube. For Korean users it's even tuned to check dates on the lunar calendar, although there's no word yet on when or if it will arrive elsewhere.
