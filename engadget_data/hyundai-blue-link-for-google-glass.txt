Tired of reaching into your pocket just to lock your car's doors? You won't have to when Hyundai rolls out the 2015 Genesis sedan next year. The automaker plans to launch a Blue Link app for Google Glass that offers Genesis owners the same remote services they'd get through a smartphone, including basic remote control, maintenance updates and the option of sending Google Maps directions to the car. Drivers won't be stuck using Google's eyewear, as Hyundai promises Blue Link support for other wearables. Convenience won't be cheap when you'll need to buy both the car and at least one piece of exotic technology, but the solution will certainly be more affordable than its unofficial Tesla equivalent.
