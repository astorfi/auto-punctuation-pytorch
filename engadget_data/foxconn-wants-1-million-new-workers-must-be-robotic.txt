According to Xinhuanet, Foxconn's founder and chairman chose a workers' party last Friday night to reveal plans for a surge in the company's robot contingent. There'll be 300,000 robots in operation by next year and a swarm-like 1,000,000 within three years -- versus just 10,000 today. The bots will be required to spray, weld and not kill themselves. We can only imagine how this news went down at the party, but soon stuff like that will hardly matter.
