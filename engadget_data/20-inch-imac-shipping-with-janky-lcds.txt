Well, it looks like Cupertino isn't too fazed by the uproar, because it appears that the new 20-inch iMac is shipping with a similar 18-bit panel -- and, not surprisingly, prompting the same type of complaints. We're not sure how widespread the issues are, but we're starting our lawsuit clock...now.[Via TUAW]
