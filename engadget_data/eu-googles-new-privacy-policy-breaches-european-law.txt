  Remember how proud Google was when it unified all of its services under a single privacy policy? Well, Big G's excitement was tempered when the EU asked it to hold off on the policy's implementation while it investigated the changes. And its enthusiasm is likely all but extinguished now that EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding has declared the policy to be in breach of European law. She found fault with the fact that the EU wasn't consulted in the policy's formation, the policy doesn't meet transparency requirements, and it allows Google to give people's private data to third parties. No word on what Europa's governing body will do with such findings in hand, but it seems certain that the crew in Mountain View's got some policy revisions to make. Guess simplifying those privacy policies wasn't so simple, was it?
