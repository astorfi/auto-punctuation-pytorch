What we do know however, is that the movie is expected to be another leap forward for 3D technology, and apparently the game will be as well, now that Sensio has announced Ubisoft will deliver it in stereoscopic 3D. All that should be required is connecting one of the consoles to a Sensio-compatible TV (Panasonic's 3D Full HD Plasma Home Theater System was used to demo the game at E3, although its unclear if that was a special version) and a pair of 3D glasses.
