After a slight delay -- which must have been torture for pre-order customers, we're sure -- the $1,500+ Model 02 is now available either directly from the company or through "select enterprise and retail channels," and still comes with the option of EV-DO goodness from either Sprint or Verizon. That 3G connectivity is obviously gonna cost ya, though -- that is unless you're the lucky winner of our birthday cake contest (to be announced shortly), in which case your culinary skills have already got you covered.
