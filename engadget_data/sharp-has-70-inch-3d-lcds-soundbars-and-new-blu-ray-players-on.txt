Sharp intends to keep its position in the large LCD market with the help of two new lines which both top out at 70-inches -- finally. The LC-70LE732U 3DTV sits at the top of the LE835 series which is also set to be available in sizes ranging as small as 40-inches and is expected in February. No word on what any of these sets will cost ya, but they will all feature built-in WiFi and a wide range of streaming options including VUDU and Netflix, as well as other internet apps like Flickr, Facebook and Twitter. The trio of new 3D Blu-ray players, the BD-H25U, BD-H35U and BD-H75U, will also ship this February with many of the same network and streaming options as the TV, but will also be IP controllable for home automation fans. Meanwhile there are five new soundbars on tap starting with a USB model, the CP-USB500, for great sound on the go and ending with the HT-SL70 which can pass 3D signals via HDMI 1.4a and even supports an audio return channel.

"Sharp makes bigger better with Quattron HYPERLINK "http://www.sharpusa.com/ForHome/HomeEntertainment/LCDTVs/WhatIsQuattron.aspx"Quad Pixel Technology and other unique technologies to captivate viewers with color never before seen on TV." Each AQUOS Quattron model features Sharp's proprietary HYPERLINK "http://www.sharpusa.com/ForHome/HomeEntertainment/LCDTVs/WhatIsQuattron.aspx"Quad Pixel Technology that adds the color Y (yellow) to the three colors of R (red), G (green), and B (blue) of the traditional television pixel structure. This technology enables the reproduction of colors that have been difficult to portray using conventional LCD displays, such as the brass color of musical instruments. The addition of the yellow sub-pixel also allows more light to pass through to the panel. Sharp's advanced pixel control technology minimizes light leakage while offering a wider aperture to let more light through. The combination of these factors results in brighter, more vibrant images. This added brightness is particularly important for 3D images, enabling the Sharp's 835 Series HYPERLINK "http://www.sharpusa.com/ForHome/HomeEntertainment/LCDTVs/Quattron3D.aspx"3D LCD TVs, as well as the current 925 Series HYPERLINK "http://www.sharpusa.com/ForHome/HomeEntertainment/LCDTVs/Quattron3D.aspx"3D LCD TVs, to compensate for the common problem of images becoming dark and dull when viewed through active shutter 3D glasses.
