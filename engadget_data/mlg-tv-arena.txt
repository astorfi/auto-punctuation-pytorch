Competitive gaming is practically an institution in countries like South Korea, but it hasn't really had a permanent home in the US. That's going to change pretty shortly, though; Major League Gaming has revealed that it's opening its first dedicated eSports location, MLG.tv Arena, in Columbus, Ohio. That may sound like an odd place to set up shop, but it makes sense for the league's audience. Columbus has a track record of hosting successful MLG events, and it's within range of "hundreds of thousands" of students -- there should be no shortage of competitors or spectators. The arena will no doubt pale in comparison to the giant stadiums of conventional sports, but it's proof that pro gaming is sticking around for a while.
