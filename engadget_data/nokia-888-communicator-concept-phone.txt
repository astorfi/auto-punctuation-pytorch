Now, you're not going to see this in stores any time soon. But if
you'd like to get an idea of what Nokia thinks the future of communications will look like, take a look at the Nokia
888 communicator, a concept design that recently won Nokia's Benelux design contest. The bracelet-like 888 is
envisioned to use a liquid battery, feature speech recognition, a flexible touch screen, and a touch sensitive body
cover. A video showing off the device's potential features shows off close to a dozen functions, including an alarm
clock, PDA, GPS, phone, push email receiver, digital wallet and, of course, jewelry. And, other than the "liquid
battery," we can actually see this in the not-too-distant future. Just give us some full-color
E-ink,
flexible OLED displays and
inkjet-printed circuit boards, and we're almost
there.
