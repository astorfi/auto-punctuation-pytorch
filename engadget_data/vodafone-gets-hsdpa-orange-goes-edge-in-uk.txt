 UK wireless carriers Vodafone and Orange haveboth announced upgrades to their data services, with Vodafone beginning HSDPA trials and Orange enabling theless-exciting 2.5G EDGE in certain areas. One hundred central London firms are trialing the high-speed service forVoda, with general London rollouts scheduled over the summer and other major UK cities and towns hooked up by the endof the year. Orange, meanwhile, is throwing a bone to those folks who won't see 3G for a long while, in the form of 300EDGE-enabled cell sites in what we assume must be outlying and rural areas. 1500 sites will be live by the end of theyear, but to put this rollout in perspective, the network will reach just one-eighth of Orange's UK customers.Read- VodafoneRead- Orange
