LG has just the thing, as it's finally getting set to drop a 42-inch HD plasma that sports "built-in OCAP (open cable application platform) technology," presumably nestled close to the integrated downloadable content protection (DCAS). The 42PC1DN also rocks multistream CableCARD support, "iDCR interactive capabilities," and HD interactive services such as HD VOD. While the full skinny of specs hasn't yet been revealed, be sure to keep an eye out for more tidbits on this set during the buildup to CES.
