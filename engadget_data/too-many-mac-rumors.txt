While we know how much you'd love for us to report on these as we go, we'll give you the short list, and invite you to leave rumors for us to add in comments. Bon appetit!

A chap named Brian sent us another iPhone picture, this time it's called the iCall. The story goes: it was supposedly found by an insider on the floor in a storage room at the Moscone. Hey stranger things have happened (then again, remember the iHome?). 
MacRumors says we'll have Xeon Xserves, the Mac Pro, and new 1:1000 contrast ratio Studio Displays with iSight and Apple Remote support, Core 2 Duo mobile MacBook Pros, and loads of new stuff for Leopard.
Scoble says Apple is "readying a dizzying amount of new products," but not much else.
FirstAdopter thinks the Mac Pros will run Xeons, run from $1,800 - $3,200 in base configs, and have pretty much all the usual options. Ars Technica seems to think roughly the same, and pontificated on it for a few thousand words.
Going back a little, Macworld reported that Blu-ray drive support may (or may not) make its way into Steve's presentation.
Apple joins Kronos, therefore must be developing iPhone. Sure, take it to the bank.
iPhone software found in iPod updater. Hurrah! Oh, wait, it still doesn't mean anything (yet).
Someone posted an oh-so-bad iChat Mobile video on YouTube. In case you missed it, that was the iPhone rumor du jour last night. Thanks, Steve.
Apple Insider is insisting MacBook Pros are going to go Merom (Core 2 Duo). Yeah, and why not? Just about every other laptop manufacturer already has, and they'd be downright foolish not to launch the MeromBooks at WWDC.
