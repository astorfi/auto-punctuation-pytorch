Especially stylish and expensive PCs, yes, but that doesn't make them any less unreliable (and we should know, we've owned more than our fair share of "non-PC PCs"). Anyhow, in their probably-not-meant-to-be-viral flash ad (shown after the break), Vaios are the cute, fun-loving girl to the stodgy and farting PC, and the annoying too cool for school Fonzie wannabe HEY!-ing Mac. Of course, the greatest irony of all here is that the original ad campaign often depicts the PC as a sad, silly Mac imitator. The tables certainly have turned.[Via TUAW]
