Looks like Centro successor Eos might be coming sooner than expected, with this purported AT&T powerpoint slide listing a second half 2009 ship date, along with a "new Palm OS experience" tagline that we're gonna take to mean webOS for now (still no 100 percent confirmation, unfortunately), all the specs listed were the same as we heard before: 2.63-inch, 320 x 400 capacitive touchscreen, 4GB storage, POP3, IMAP, and EAS support, integrated IM client, Bluetooth 2.1, A-GPS, and a sexy thin and light form factor. Keep an eye out for this one, we think it might go places.
