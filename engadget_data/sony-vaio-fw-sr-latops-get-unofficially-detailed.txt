That includes details on two different 13.3-inch VAIO SR models, the VGN-SR19XN and the VAIO VGN-SR19VN, the former of which boasts the usual integrated graphics, while the latter bumps things up to a Radeon HD3470, along with a boost to a full 4GB of RAM and a 200GB, 7,200 rpm hard drive -- both pack a 2.26GHz Core 2 Duo P8400 processor. On the decidedly larger end of the scale is the 16.4-inch VAIO FW, which looks to be available in a whole host of configurations, with options including ATI 3650 or 3470 graphics, a Blu-ray drive, and the same Core 2 Duo P8400 processor used in the SR. Of course, none of this is quite set in stone until we get the official word straight from Sony, but we wouldn't bank on any surprises with these.
