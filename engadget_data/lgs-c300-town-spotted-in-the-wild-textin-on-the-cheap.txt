It's got a few other tricks up its sleeve, though, namely support for push email, a 3.5mm headphone jack (hopefully accompanied by a decent music player), and a 2 megapixel cam on back to capture those amazing moments with enough clarity (in theory, anyway) to make for a decent MMS. We're still waiting for details on pricing and availability, but we know that it'll be available on Orange at some point -- appropriate, we must say, considering the orange accents.

[Thanks, Willeke]
