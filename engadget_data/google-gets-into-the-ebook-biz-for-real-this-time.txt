Details are still rather sketchy, but according to The New York Times, the plan involves selling the books at prices set by the publisher -- as opposed to the rather strict Amazon pricing guidelines that sees most Kindle titles selling for $9.99 (to the chagrin of many publishers). In addition, the company will be selling readers online access to the titles. On one hand, this means that access to your books won't be limited to specific devices, but it will require Internet access and some sort of off-line caching (presumably Google Gears). This news has us wondering if we weren't a bit hasty in putting down the money for Danielle Steel's limited edition Sony Reader. Aww, who are we kidding? You know we can't get enough of those Sisters.[Via Paid Content]
