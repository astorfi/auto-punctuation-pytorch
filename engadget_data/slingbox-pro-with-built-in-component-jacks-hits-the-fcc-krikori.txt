First, the TV-transporting company has just gotten approval on a brand new, unnamed variation of the Slingbox, which forgoes the external Slingbox HD Connect cable used with the Slingbox Pro (that gives you component ins / outs) and instead includes a single set of component hookups right on the box. Additionally, during a Revision3 interview with Blake Krikorian (Sling Media's CEO) the venerable Om Malik managed to get Blake to let loose new about the now-rumored Slingbox HD, which (after some arm-twisting) Krikorian says is coming in "January," though in what year he wouldn't say. Honestly, if it's any later than 2008, it's too late.Read -- Slingbox FCC reportRead -- The GigaOm Show Episode 3 - Sling It, Baby
