First announced way back at CES in January, both the WowWee Roborover and WowWee Joebot are now available to order for $79.99 or $99.99, respectively, or in one of WowWee's usual "mini" versions for a mere $15 apiece. While those latter options are basically action figures, the two full-fledged versions should keep you occupied for a little longer than your average toy robot, with each able to be controlled remotely or operate autonomously, play various games and, in the case of the Roborover, traverse "rough terrain" and "inclines."Read - WowWee RoboroverRead - WowWee Joebot[Via SlashGear]
