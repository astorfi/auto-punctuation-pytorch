The device, which pledged to let you call home and explore your abode like some domesticated rover, stood poised to open new avenues for the confusion of cats and other small pets. Perhaps $500 was a bit too steep for the beta group, or maybe users spending that much wanted something that looked a little less like a sentient vacuum, but, regardless of the reason, we're not expecting anything like this to hit retail until we pull ourselves out of these economic doldrums.
