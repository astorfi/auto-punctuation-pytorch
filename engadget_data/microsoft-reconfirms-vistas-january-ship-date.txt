 "Aw, shucks guys, we were just foolin' around." After years of successive Vista delays, and keeping the computer world on edge for the past few months about even further delays, Microsoft is once again settling into their January launch window for Vista's consumer launch, with OEMs supposed to receive the OS in November. Vista Release Candidate 1 (RC1) should be out early September, though the word on the street is that Microsoft isn't planning on finalizing Vista until October sometime, making RC1 a bit of a misnomer. What RC1 should be is light years ahead of Vista Beta 2, and it sure better be if Microsoft isn't kidding this time about a January launch.[Via CrunchGear]
