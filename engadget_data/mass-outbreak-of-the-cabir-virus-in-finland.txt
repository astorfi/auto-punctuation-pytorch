A few dozen visitors to the world atheletic championships in Helsinki went home with a little souvenir of the game:
a cellphone infected with the Cabir
virus. Mobile viruses haven't been quite the plague that computer viruses have been, but apparently at least one person
went to the games, which were held at Helsinki's Olympic Stadium, with a handset infected with the Cabir virus. The
virus was then able to wirelessly jump from Series 60 phone to Series 60 phone via Bluetooth, with each newly infected
phone automatically searching for other phones to infect.
