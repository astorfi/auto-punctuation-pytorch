       Looks like AMD and its graphics division ATI have a couple of new bits to announce today. First up: the Phenom X2 and X4 CPUs, AMD's latest dual and quad-core chips destined for their new FASN8 (get it?) enthusiast platform, which also features DDR2 SDRAM, HyperTransport, 128-bit FPUs, shared L3 cache, and the Socket AM2 and AM2+ interface with Dual Socket Direct Connect. We're not done yet, though, since the other half of the FASN8 platform is ATI's Radeon HD 2000 series graphics adapters, including the new R600, erm, Radeon HD 2900 XT ($400), 65nm DirectX 10 devices with Avivo Blu-ray and HD DVD acceleration. Also, be sure to keep an eye out for other versions, like the HD 2600, HD 2400, Mobility Radeon HD 2300, and the like. Watch out, we're sure to be flooded with new machines and accompanying benchmarks in short order.
