Sure enough, this seems to be a Sprint-specific version of the Samsung i830 Pocket PC slider, packing both CDMA and GSM radios for globetrottin' goodness. True, Verizon's had the predecessor i730 for a good while now, but at least the i830 will come out of the gate with Windows Mobile 5 plus AKU2, and of course, that GSM support is going to be music to the ears of many a traveling businessman. No details yet on availability or pricing, but given that the fact sheet encourages readers to "order or view online" at Sprint's website, it shouldn't be long.
