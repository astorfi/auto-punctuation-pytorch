 Itseems that Napster chairman and CEO Chris Gorog could learn a thing or two from Ed Zander about harshing on other companies when frustrated byone's own business woes, as Gorog recently placed some of the blame for Napster's inability to gain market sharesquarely at Microsoft's feet. After saying "There is no question that their execution has been less than brilliantover the last 12 months," and citing technical glitches in Microsoft software and device hardware, Gorog qualifiedhis statements by conceding that the Big M has a more difficult task than Apple in that it must coordinate with manydifferent device manufacturers. Still, instead of playing the blame game, perhaps the company that named itself after aP2P piracy network in a very transparent attempt to gain street cred should re-evaluate some of the decisions being madeat home before pointing fingers abroad.
