Nintendo seems to be going full steam ahead with the wireless capabilities of its DS; they have just announced a
partnership with Buffalo Inc. that will bring
WiFi gaming to both home and retail locations. For the home user, Nintendo will begin selling a USB WiFi dongle on
November 25th that attaches to a gamer's computer and acts as a de facto wireless router for multiplayer gaming. The
partnership with Buffalo will also result in hundreds of "Nintendo hotspots" at videogame retailers in Japan, where
"Nintendo Wi-Fi Stations" will allow users to congregate and connect free of charge. The home-use dongle will ship with
Mario Kart DS, all for the low low price of $52.
