 Google must take as long to sift through vacation photos as everyone else. A few months after it sent its Trekker cameras to sweep the Grand Canyon, the resulting panoramas are at last showing on Google Maps. The expansion gives us 360-degree views from paths spanning roughly 75 miles, including tougher routes like the South Kaibab Trail. The views won't fully convey the majesty of standing on the canyon's edge, but they're quicker than booking a hiking expedition in Arizona -- and certainly easier on the legs.
