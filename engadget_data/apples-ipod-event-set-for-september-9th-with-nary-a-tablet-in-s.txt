Upgraded iPods are the apparent main course, along with some Cocktail discussion, but as for tablets... well, the sources are adamant it won't get brought up at all. We're still awaiting official word to come shooting out of Cupertino headquarters, but in the meantime, plan on keeping that Wednesday afternoon as free as possible.
