This week's Blu-ray movie release list has several highlights, but fans of the Fast & Furious movies should look out for the sixth movie as it arrives just days after the sudden death of star Paul Walker. On TV we're looking at a slew of midseason finales, mixed in with a few season finales including Sons of Anarchy and Homeland. On disc we also have the 50th Anniversary release of Mary Poppins and Despicable Me 2, and streaming viewers can check out the second season of one of Netflix's first original series, Lilyhammer. Check after the break for our weekly listing of what to look out for in TV, Blu-ray and gaming.
