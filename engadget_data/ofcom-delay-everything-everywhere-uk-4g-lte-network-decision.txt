  UKers hoping for a hasty rollout of Everything Everywhere's 4G LTE network are apt to be sorely disappointed, as regulation entity Ofcom has shoved back the final decision on its proposal. We're told that the ruling will be moved from April 17th to May 8th, with the decision made to give stakeholders more time to respond. With the additional weeks, folks like O2 and Vodafone are expected to voice their own thoughts (read: objections) on the matter, likely pointing out that its proposal would give Everything Everywhere the lion's share of spectrum in the 1,800MHz range. For now, we'll have to wait and see what kind of rebuttals are cooked up, and if history is any guide, we're guessing one or two more delays will be making themselves known before we get a definite answer one way or the other.
