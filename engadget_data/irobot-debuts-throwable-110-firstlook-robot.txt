As you may be able to tell from appearances, this one's also primarily a military bot, and iRobot says it's ideal for "hasty situational awareness," as well as for investigating tunnels and other confined spaces (it measures just nine inches by twelve inches and weighs only five pounds). What's more, it also promises to continue operating for more than six hours at a time, and it can be controlled using a nifty wrist-mounted touchscreen controller. Head on past the break for a video.
