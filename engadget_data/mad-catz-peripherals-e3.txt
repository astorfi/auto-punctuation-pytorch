Having announced its Android-based Project M.O.J.O. gaming console, Mad Catz is now turning to peripherals: it just unveiled a couple of universal headsets, a PC gaming keyboard and two other PC and Mac headsets. Kicking things off, the TRITTON Kunai Universal and F.R.E.Q. 4D stereo headsets (coming summer and fall 2013, respectively) follow the earlier GameSmart initiative by working with gaming consoles like the Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii U along with PCs, Macs and handheld devices. PC gamers get the S.T.R.I.K.E 3 gaming keyboard with mechanical keys, adjustable backlighting and programmable macro keys sometime in the fall.


For PC and Mac users, the TRITTON Pro+ headset (based on the console version) brings 5.1 surround sound via a built-in decoder, while the TRITTON Kunai for PC and Mac offers an inline remote and breakaway cable for use with handheld devices. The latter two models will arrive this summer, but there's no word yet on pricing for any of the bunch. Head after the jump for the PR and galleries.
