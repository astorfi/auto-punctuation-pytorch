While it may not be ideally suited for much more than calls or the odd text message, it is fully ruggedized and IP54-certified for dust and splash resistance, and it boasts an impressive 67-day standby time (and 22-hour talk time) to ensure it lasts throughout your next arduous expedition (or regular business trips, as the case may be). Still no indication of a release over here, but the phone should be rolling out across Europe next month for just under $100.
