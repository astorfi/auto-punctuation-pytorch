Unfortunately, it's still MIA, but if you've got to get in on the action early you can apparently buy Dell part #310-9760, an AC adapter listing compatibility with two laptops the company hasn't yet announced. Um, just in case you weren't following along, that'd be the Inspiron Studio 1535 and 1536 (or maybe it's just the Studio 1535 / 1536 -- we don't really know).[Thanks, nizzy1115]
