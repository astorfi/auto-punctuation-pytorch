Can we let you in on a secret…we're tired of all those wimpy
iPod sound accessories pushing
tin-speakers with single-digits of wattage which get cranked out by anyone with access to a machine press, a roll of
plastic, and some white paint. So when a 600 watt RMS "made for iPod" rumbler shows up…well, we just start salivating
like one of Pavlov's pets. Oh sure, they don't have any actual product shots up yet (just renderings) and you can only
pre-order, but there is no doubt that the Geneva Sound System designs are hot. These puppies come in L or XL models
slammin' 100 to 600 watts-o-tie-flapping-power respectively. Each unit features an iPod Universal Dock connector, a
built-in slot-loading CD, and FM radio all controllable by included remote. An LED display under the front cover shows
input and track playing which is a good start. But if they could just scroll the now playing artist and track all
Holzer-truism-like across the entire face then we might be willing to throw down the $1,075 for the XL model or $599
for the L. Said to be available this "fall"... hopefully meaning the northern hemisphere. More pics after the
break.
