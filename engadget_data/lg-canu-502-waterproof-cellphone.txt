Want to be sure not to miss a single call while you're off surfing or piloting that speedboat? Check out LG's canU
502S, an international version of Casio's Japan-only G'zOne
TYPE-R waterproof cellphone. The clamshell has rubber-sealed seams, and all jacks can also be sealed. The $500
phone also includes a 1.3 megapixel camera and a 2.2-inch LCD. Of course, we're not quite sure how you would use this
on a speedboat or your board, given that you're not likely to be able to hear a whole lot, but that's for you (and the
first manufacturer to come out with a waterproof Bluetooth headset) to figure out.
