   In what will surely be welcome news for many, it turns out you don't have to drop another $100 to get everything the new Apple TV offers. Owners of the second generation model can now download a software update (version 5.0) that adds the same interface found on Apple's latest device, along with support for other new additions like the ability to pay for Netflix through your iTunes account. No magic upgrade to 1080p, though. Check out the gallery below for a closer look at the changes.  [Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
