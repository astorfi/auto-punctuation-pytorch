So far, we've only had furtive glances of the rumored BlackBerry A10 through basic specs and a short video. However, CrackBerry forum member nereuszeer may have given us much more insight by posting what appears to be a presentation slide with most of the A10's details. If accurate, they suggest that the 5-inch, 720p OLED screen wouldn't be the only standout feature -- there's also a much larger 2,800mAh battery and a slightly faster 1.7GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro. The phone wouldn't otherwise represent a big break from the Z10, although the leak hints at both a preloaded instance of BlackBerry 10.2 and a thicker Verizon variant. When the slide reportedly dates back to May, there's a chance the hardware could change before release. Still, don't be surprised if this ultimately represents BlackBerry's fall flagship.
