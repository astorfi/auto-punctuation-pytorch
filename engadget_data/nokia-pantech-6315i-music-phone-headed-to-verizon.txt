This cozy little clamshell phone should be hitting shelves within the next 45 - 60 days as reported by the Roc. As previously noted, this phone features a 1.3 megapixel camera, Bluetooth (sorry, no OBEX -- who'd you think you were dealing with?), microSD, and Music Controls (plus Music On Demand) 1.2. And as always, for your viewing pleasure Roc supplied Engadget with a marketing photo for Verizon users to drool over in anticipation.
