At the CES they are showing a working prototype (Windows only), which uses USB 2.0 and up to 60fps, and with its 3D recognition technology, the user can bring elements back and forth, and more importantly, play videogames. It is expected to be on the market by the end of the year, for a "competitive price".[VÃ­a Engadget ES]
