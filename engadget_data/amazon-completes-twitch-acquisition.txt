A filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has confirmed the $970 million deal is now on Amazon's doorstep, poorly hidden under the welcoming mat.

As a reminder that paying $970 million for Twitch isn't so crazy, last month's report from The New York Times noted that Twitch draws more viewers than HLN, CNN, E!, MSNBC, TruTV and MTV during peak hours. There's room to grow though â€“ the same report estimates that Netflix is eight times bigger than Twitch, with YouTube standing about 24 times as tall.
