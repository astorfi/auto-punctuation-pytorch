 Linksys had some gear to announce at this year's E3, and when we caught up with them last night they hooked us up with the skinny: they've officially gone ExpressCard with the EC1000 gigabit Ethernet adapter, the followup to the PC Card PCM1000, which will have an integrated pop-up RJ45 jack and will fit in your 34 or 54 slot. They also had a dedicated hardware network traffic optimizer which goes by the callsign of OGV200. This one will make sure your game and VoIP traffic will make it to its intended destination faster than any other traffic traveling out of your home's data pipe -- simple enough. Both are available now for $59.99 and $69.99, respectively.
      

 

 Here's that EC1000. Seems like it wouldn't be Linksys at E3 if it didn't have the obligatory pre-N hardware.
