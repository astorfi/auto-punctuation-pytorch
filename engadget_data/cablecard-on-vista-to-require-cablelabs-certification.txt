 If youwant to be able to use the forthcoming CableCARD 2.0 standardon a Windows Vista-powered Media Center PC, you'd better make sure to read the label on that box carefully. According toMicrosoft's Jim Allchin, CableLabs plans a rigorous certification program for CableCARD 2.0, which will requiremanufacturers to submit their machines for approval. Part of the approval involves making sure the computer includes a"protective path," which we assume means it adheres to CableLabs' standards for DRM. While this may not meanmuch for customers who plan on buying an MCE PC through an established manufacturer, most of which will likely getCableLabs certification, it could pose a challenge if you plan on buying a Media Center through one of the manyboutique manufacturers that have cropped up to meet the demands of high-end customers -- or if you plan on buildingyour own. And if you already have a Media Center PC, you can probably forget about CableCARD 2.0 compatibility, andjust hang onto that set-top box forever.[Via HDBeat]
