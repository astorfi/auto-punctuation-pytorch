 Audiophile headphone and audio component company Sennheiser announced their new PXC 450 noise cancelling headphones at a little consumer electronics show you might have heard about. Its active noise reduction reportedly allows you to distinguish between the sound of someone speaking to you and the sound of an aircraft, enabling you to have a conversation without actually removing the headphones (although they don't address the social awkwardness of actually putting this into practice, wherein your new best friend in 17F starts shouting at you to be heard over your cans). The closed ear cup comes with plenty of padding and can be collapsed for more convenient storage. Convenience and audiophilia don't come cheap, though -- expect to part with $500 to offend people on planes with these come March.
