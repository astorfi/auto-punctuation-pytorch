But we could be swayed into a somnolent stupor if those sounds came from epic storms -- on Saturn. Captured by NASA's Cassini probe last March, this 11-second clip of AM radio-like electrostatic is actually the agency's first glimpse into storm activity on the planet's Northern Hemisphere. Alright, so we admit the recording's more of a weak 'snap, crackle and fizzy pop' than outright terror-inducing awe, but still these are the noises of another world. Would it help if we told you this storm's been raging since December 2010 and hasn't shown any signs of stopping? Shocking, we know. It's not all doom and gloom, though as the folks behind Cassini think this is simply a sign of impending summer. So basically, it's spring break at the saturnine Se√±or Frogs. Check the source for a sample of otherworldly rumbles.
