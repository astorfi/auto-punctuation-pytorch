Ok everyone, it's time for yet another installment of How would you change. Last week the suitably
appropriate 5G iPod with video was put under the gadget
critic's microscope, but today we want to put a query out to all those who plunked down $400 on Creative's new Zen
Vision portable media player. We've been freaking in love with the thing in theory, but what would you change about it?
Here's a couple to get you started:




4:3 aspect ratio screen? Try 16:9 on for size.




... and a better viewing angle on that screen, while you're at it.




An SD slot might be nice




So would more drive size options




As well as support for some more audio codecs (c'mon, OGG and FLAC, they're free!)




Oh, and that bundled software only transcodes to QVGA? Pssh.
