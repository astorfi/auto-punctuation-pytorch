We live in a magical, magical world. A world where we can print almost anything we want in chocolate. Yes -- chocolate. 3D Systems and The Hershey Company are basically making your wildest confectionery dreams come true with the CocoJet, a 3D printer for delicious chocolate. You can choose among dark, milk or white chocolate for your creations (though, we all know that white chocolate isn't really chocolate). And so long as your desired shape isn't too complicated, the CocoJet should be able to spit it out. You could even print functioning chocolate nuts and bolts if you really wanted. Sadly, the press release states that, "The company intends to share its commercial plans for this class of chocolate 3D printers at a later date." So... don't get too excited about printing out chocolate hearts for your loved one (or white chocolate daggers for your enemies) just yet.
