The long-overdue update upgrades the calendar and sorts out problems with email as well as the 4G device itself. It will likely take a few weeks before every Galaxy Nexus owner on Big Red is up to speed, but there's no doubt that many of them will just be happy to have caught up to the One True Nexus in features and fixes.
