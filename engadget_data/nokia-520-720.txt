 Nokia's already got the Lumia 620, 820 and 920 in its hand, but could it be going for a running flush? That's the question we find ourselves asking, after a filing from Indonesia's POSTEL, a regulatory body much like the FCC in the US, declares that a Nokia "520 / RM-914" and "720 / RM-885" have successfully completed testing. The Lumia title doesn't appear in the database, but it wouldn't be too far of a stretch to believe they could be unannounced Windows Phone 8 devices -- and successors to the 510 and 710 -- given the familiar naming convention. That's really all we have to go on right now, but with MWC drawing ever closer, is this just coincidence, or does the Finnish company have a couple more Lumias tucked up its sleeve?
