This glossy T9 slider was spotted with a two megapixel camera (sans flash), and sadly forgoes such niceties as WiFi and 3G connectivity -- presumably in the name of keeping cost down. There's no word on pricing (yet), though we do know this handset is running Series 40 6th Edition, and thankfully features Bluetooth (revealing the name of the device as C2-06). All told, Nokia is far removed from the bleeding edge on this one, although it's always comforting to know they're looking out for the little guy.
