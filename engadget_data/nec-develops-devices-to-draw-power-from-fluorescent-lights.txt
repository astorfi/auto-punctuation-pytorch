 NEC has just announced two new devices thatshould eliminate the need for some of the sub-ceiling wiring in new and existing industrial structures by drawing powerfrom regular fluorescent lighting. The first device, shaped like a ring and designed to fit around a fluorescent bulb,coverts faint pulses of radiated electromagnetic energy into usable electric current. Unlike the ring-shaped gadget,which produces electricity from energy that would normally go to waste, the second NEC device simply slips between thebulb and metal connector in its housing to siphon power from the existing electrical infrastructure. NEC developedthese solutions mainly to provide juice for the growing number of data transmitting devices that need to be ceilingmounted in commercial spaces.
