Google has just activated Gmail Mobile
that (surprise, surprise) allows you to check you
Gmail from your mobile. There have been all
sorts of ways for the resourceful Engadgeteer to do this for themselves, — we've been checking Gmail
over POP for a while now — but a web interface is pretty
ideal for many phones since they won't choke on downloading a few days of mail if they haven't been used to read
messages in a while, and who better to do it than Google? They're also bringing those sweet attachment converting
services of theirs, so, using no more than your phone's browser, you can browse Word documents and PDF files. Of course
you're not getting any of those fun abilities like e-mail auto completion and auto saving from the mother Gmail, but
there are a few features like a frequently mailed contacts list and replying to messages by calling the sender that
should help ease the pain.
