This righauls up to a 2.16GHz Intel Core Duo T2600, 17-inch widescreen display, 512MB NVIDIA GeForce Go 7900 GTX graphics, 4GBof DDR2 RAM, a 120GB SATA disk, dual-layer DVD combo drive, and an array of ports including Firewire, 6 x USB 2.0, DVIand component video, S/PDIF digital audio out, hi-def sound with integrated sub, and 5-in-1 memory card reader. Butthis type of performance ain't cheap. A fully specced slab in Special Edition Formula Red "armor" will setyou back right around $5,000. Look out Velocity,game's on cuz.[Thanks, Micum M]
