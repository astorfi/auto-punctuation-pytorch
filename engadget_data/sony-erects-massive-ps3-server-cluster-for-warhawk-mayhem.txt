Thankfully for those who are itching to jump right into a worldwide dogfight when Warhawk lands, it looks like Sony has you covered. Granted, the game will allow for PS3 owners to host and play on their own matches, but the Ranked-Dedicated servers that you may also opt for shouldn't be lacking in terms of sheer power. Constructed by the SCEA IT team, this ginormous PS3 cluster will soon be used to connect Warhawk gamers everywhere, and while we're never told precisely how many PlayStation 3s were scrounged up in order to make this happen, feel free to click on through for another shot and start countin'.
