Which is why,of course, we think it's so funny that the day after this announcement MacDailyNews gets some blurry cameraphone shots(they're always blurry cameraphone shots, aren't they?) of a new Apple Media Cube -- the box you see above, with abunch of ports on the back side, and the intention to make it do something "media-related." Ok, we'll skippast the very-likely-it's-fake and the looks-like-a-cardboard-box spiels and get to the meat: yes, Jobs does love Cubes-- in fact, he's obsessed with them -- and yes, the Mac mini would never have enough room to become a full DVR. Wherewould the tuner(s) go, where would the 3.5-inch drive go? So if we're to pretend, dear reader, that this is real, couldthis then be the Mac mini media center box we've been waiting for?[Thanks, Jimmie]
