Shortly after Sharp announced that it would likely be cutting LCD panel production by around 10%, in flies word that Panasonic is making an even more drastic move. Currently, the outfit produces 65-inch plasma panels at a plant in Ibaraki, while all other sizes are concocted at two factories in Amagasaki. Starting soon, all sizes will be made at the pair of plants in Amagasaki, a move that will supposedly cut production costs by up to Â¥4 billion ($41.92 million) per year. Panny is hoping to use the Ibaraki venue to "concentrate [on] development and testing of flat-panels," which follows logic given its intentions to spark up a "development segment for LCD panels there next fiscal year."
