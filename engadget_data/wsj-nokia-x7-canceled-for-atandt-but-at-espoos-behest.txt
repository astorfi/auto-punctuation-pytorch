Originally, the phone would have waved the white globe banner at Mobile World Congress next month, but Nokia reportedly decided that AT&T didn't have its back, and wouldn't provide sufficient marketing support -- and cheap enough subsidized prices -- to make it worth the company's while. If you simply must have the handset and live in the US, though, we're sure you'll still find a way. It's only a matter of time before Nokia launches in countries more willing to play ball... and unlocked models appear on eBay.
