 Fresh on the heels of last week's editorial comes confirmation that HTC's superior hardware isn't being overlooked by consumers alone. According to a statement in the Wall Street Journal, an HTC executive has acknowledged that a reduced shipment forecast prompted certain suppliers to downgrade the company's status, saying "HTC has had difficulty in securing adequate camera components as it is no longer a tier-one customer." That component, along with metal casings, is being blamed for the HTC One's shipment delays -- the device may still reach pre-order customers this month, but many markets won't see the flagship smartphone until April. The company has a lot riding on this very well-received device, but with Samsung's unrivaled marketing spend and these latest supply issues, glowing reviews alone won't carry the One to success.
