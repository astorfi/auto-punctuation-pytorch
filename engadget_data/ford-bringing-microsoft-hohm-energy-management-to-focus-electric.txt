That makes it the first automaker to hop on board, and Ford even goes so far as to call the move a "needed step in the development of the infrastructure that will make electric vehicles viable." As with other devices, the internet-based Hohm service promises to help car owners determine when and how to most efficiently recharge their vehicles, and help utility companies manage demand as a result -- if enough folks use it, that is. Ford hasn't yet announced any other vehicles that will use Hohm, but the Focus Electric is apparently just the first of more to come, and will be available sometime next year. Head on past the break to see Microsoft explain the partnership.
