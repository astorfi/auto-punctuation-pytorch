Hell, our crowd-sourced fan sequel to The Social Network about that "Tom from MySpace" guy would never have got off the ground without it! Well, if you're as enthusiastic about cloud storage solutions as we are, you'll be more than excited to know that Dropbox 1.0 has just been announced. Among the new features that we're most looking forward to putting to the test are Selective Sync (choose which folders get downloaded to which computers) and Extended Attribute Sync (improved support for Mac apps like Quicken and Quark whose resource forks bedevil most sync applications and corrupt data in the process). But that ain't all! Hit the source link to get started.
