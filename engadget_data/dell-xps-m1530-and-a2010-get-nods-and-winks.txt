 One rumor ends, and another one begins: now that the M1730 (pictured) is all out in the wild, rumors abound of a mid-range 15-inch M1530 to fit between the M1330 and its bigger brother. The evidence? An error message on a Creative webcam, and a potentially mistyped AC adapter listing on a cheap battery retailer's site. Not very compelling, but we've seen reality borne out of less. Also on the radar is an A2010, probably to replace the M2010, that 20-inch behemoth of a gaming laptop. Keep your eyes peeled.
