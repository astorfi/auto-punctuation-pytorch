The video turned a little weird, however, when, at the end we were greeted with a maniacal monsterish cackle. Unsurprisingly, we thought, "this is fake" and moved on with our day. Turns out, however, the ad is in fact real, sans the laugh track, of course, which was someone's idea of a great goof. The full ad is below.
