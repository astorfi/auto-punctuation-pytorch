 Oh c'mon Mike, why you gotta ruin all our fun? Dell issued a killjoy statement today, warning that "Dell is constantly evaluating new technologies. However, we have no plans to launch a Gaming handheld at this time." It doesn't really do anything to contradict the word from Abizar Vakharia that such a handheld was "on the radar screen," but it definitely does put a damper on hopes that such a device will be hitting the market anytime soon. Then again, "no plans to launch" could very well mean they just haven't set a date, so we're going to continue to stick our fingers in our ears, sing the national anthem, and dream of a Dell-branded, CE-based, PSP killer to shake up the oh-so-boring handheld market.
