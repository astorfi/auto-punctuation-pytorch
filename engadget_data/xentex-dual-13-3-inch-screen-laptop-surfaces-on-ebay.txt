You'll have to provide a custom hard drive cable and figure out how to boot it past the BIOS, but if you do, you'll have ultimate giant laptop bragging rights over your friends -- as well as an 850Mhz Athlon, 128MB of RAM, and a floppy drive. Yeah, we know you want one anyway. Some more pics past the break and at the read link.
