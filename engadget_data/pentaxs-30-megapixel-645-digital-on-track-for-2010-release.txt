For those odd, eccentric souls who somehow managed to answer "yes" to both of those inquiries, you'll be elated to know that Pentax's long awaited 645 Digital -- which was once rumored as canceled altogether -- is on track to be released next year. According to an update on the company's Japanese website, the device will boast 30 megapixels and will play quite nicely with the FA645 55mm f/2.8 lens that should launch simultaneously. Start saving those tax credits right about now -- we can say with absolutely certainty that you'll need every spare dollar you can find to afford this sucker.[Via DigitalCameraInfo]
