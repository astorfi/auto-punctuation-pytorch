We don't have much to go on yet, but ASUS has just unveiled its new U Series Bamboo Collection laptops. First up in the collection is the U53. We don't have specs on this guy yet, but here's what we do know: it boasts a Core i5 CPU, discrete graphics, and USB 3.0 support. Stay tuned for some more information and hands-on shots.

Update: As promised, here's the hands-on!
