Oooooh, a lot of people aren't going to like hearing this, but a study by the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found
that the risk of ear tumors is 3.9 times higher for people who have been using a cellphone for more than ten years, but
only on the side of the head where they hold their cellphone. We know what your next question is: Ear tumors? Yeah, in
addition to brain cancer you'll have to also worry about acoustic neuroma, a benign tumor which affects the auditory
nerve and can possibly lead to brain damage. There is one thing that'll help some of you sleep a little easier tonight:
it's only analog cellphones that seem to cause this, there doesn't seem to be any evidence that digital cellphones
(i.e. ones that use GSM or CDMA) raise the incidence of ear tumors at all. Which is good, because we're sorta into
being able to hear and all that.
