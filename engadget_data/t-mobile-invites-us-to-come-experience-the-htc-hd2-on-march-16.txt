That lines up nicely with the company's earlier assurances that we'd see a launch in March -- but what day in March, exactly? Well, we're hearing from a number of tipsters (including trusted sources) that the 24th is the day this thing breaks loose at retail, so set your watches and calendars accordingly -- assuming you haven't been wooed into Windows Phone 7 Series' tender, loving grasp, that is.

Update: MobiTV -- which has an app bundled with T-Mobile's version of the HD2 -- says the HD2 is launching on the 23rd, and frankly, they're probably in a position to know. Thanks, Stephen!
