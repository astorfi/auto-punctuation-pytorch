 If you've already pre-ordered someHD-DVD videos for that HD-DVD player that you alsopre-ordered, you may end up getting the deck before you get the flicks. Warner Home Video -- the only studio thathad set a firm date for a rollout of HD-DVD movies -- has now backed off and won't commit to a specific timetable. Thecompany hadoriginally planned to launch a slate of films including "Batman Begins" and "Million DollarBaby" on March 28, and had even allowed major retailers such as Wal-Mart and Best Buy to take pre-orders. However,division head Ron Sanders now says "the outlook is tenuous -- we're still coming out with an initial slate, but wemay be a week or two later; we just don't know." That can't be good news for Toshiba, which has been promoting itsnew HD-DVD players with a nationalroadshow, and still plans to have players in stores by the end of the month -- whether or not there's anything towatch on them.
