The beer pouring creature itself has actually doled out a few pints in its lifetime, but apparently, the latest spotting showed off a snazzy new paint job and a few additional lights. Heck, there's even a built-in microphone and speaker for "audience interaction." Best of all, however, is that the operator of this fellow can make it talk to party goers in the vicinity, and while we're currently unsure of its marital status, we have all ideas that it's a real hit with the ladies. Check out a few more snapshots in the read link below.[Via UberReview]
