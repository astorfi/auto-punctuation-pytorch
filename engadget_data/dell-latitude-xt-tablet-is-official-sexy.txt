  It's absolutely no secret that Dell's been working on a tablet PC -- we've been hearing about the damn thing since as far back as mid 2004 (no joke!) and the company did promise it in 2007, which it's almost not. What took them so long to get it out the door we've no idea, but it's hard to deny the appeal of this little ThinkPad-esque bugger. Here are those specs which you've absolutely never seen before:  12.1-inch WXGA (1280 x 800) in CCFL ("outdoor display," up to 400cd/m2) and LED backlight options Capacitive touchscreen(!!) with palm detection (this, if anything, could enable that supposed multi-touch), and active digitizer. Intel Core 2 Solo or Duo ULV at 1.06 and 1.2GHz, respectively ATI Radeon X1250 UMA Graphics Up to 3GB memory, runs Vista Ultimate or Business 40GB or 80GB 4200 RPM drive, 120GB 5400 RPM drive, or 32GB or 64GB SSD HSDPA or EVDO rev A., 802.11a/b/g/n options, Bluetooth 2.0, and gigabit Ethernet connectivity ExpressCard54 and SD slots, 1394, VGA, (3) USB 2.0 Scroll wheel, biometric reader, TPM 1.2, super low profile power adapter Up to 5 hours battery life with standard 43WH pack, up to 9 hours with extended 45WH pack; Energy Star 4.0 compliant 3.57 pounds (presumably without battery), 1-inch thick Starts at $2500  Okay, we'll hand it to these guys, alongside the M1330 the Latitude XT is the sexiest machine Dell's ever produced -- and the addition of a capacitive touchscreen totally blew our minds. But $2500 for the most stripped down option? Dell just priced itself right out of the game, if you ask us. Hands-on coming right up.
