We had some issues with Huawei's Ascend P6 when we reviewed it last year -- despite a sleek thin design, a gorgeous display and a solid camera, it simply lacked oomph. Now the company has given the handset a slight revision, bumping its original 1.5GHz quad-core processor up to 1.6GHz. Unfortunately, the phone's new silicon still doesn't support LTE, and not much else has changed: the phone still has 2GB of RAM, a 4.7-inch display and a 2,000mAh battery. All in all, it doesn't sound too different from the original model, but it Huawei did tweak its moniker; it's now the Ascend P6 S. Well, that's something. Folks looking for the revision will find it at Huawei's Vmall store at the source link below.
