  After adding live TV streaming features to the DirecTV iPad app last fall, the company is expanding the feature today by pushing an upgrade that lets viewers watch video (but no live TV, yet) even when they're away from home. Dubbed DirecTV Everywhere, it follows up on the company's promises of more video for customer's mobile devices, offering "selected" video on-demand programming for on the go viewing. The Solid Signal Blog has an early preview of the new features with more screenshots and a video, revealing that available content at the moment consists of premium movie channels (HBO networks, Starz, Sony Movie Channel) and DirecTV's own Audience Network. While we wait for more content, other new features include the What's Hot social module pulling from your Twitter and Facebook friends to see what they're watching, and social checkins with Miso. We haven't gotten any official info from DirecTV on the upgrade beyond the changelog, but for now you can check out iTunes for the details.Update: We've heard back from DirecTV, and its stance is that the DirecTV Everywhere service is still under beta test, which may explain the limited content availability at the moment. Other than the iPad app content is also going to be available through DirecTV.com, and we should look for a national launch in late spring / early summer.[Thanks, Brandon & Brian]
