The phone in question here is LG's Optimus T, stablemate to the Optimus S, Optimus One, and Optimus Chic featuring a 3.2-inch HVGA display, 3 megapixel cam, and pre-loaded Swype all sitting atop Android 2.2. In order to get down to the promised $29.99, you'll need to sign up for a new two-year contract (naturally), score a qualifying data plan, and wait around for a $50 mail-in rebate when the phone goes on sale Wednesday, November 3 in your choice of black or burgundy (pictured).
