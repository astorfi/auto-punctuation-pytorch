Guess that iPod cobranding thing is really working out for Apple, since now they're doing a Harry Potter iPod too.
Besides the crest on the back, it's more or less more of the same, being a tie-in for the exclusive they scored on all
six Harry Potter audiobooks. Apple also launched iTunes 5 today,
which will have an improved song randomizer they're calling Smart Shuffle, parental access controls, a new "streamlined
look," and faster search toolâ€”apparently reviews will also be added to the mix (no pun intended).
