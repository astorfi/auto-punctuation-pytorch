       Even if the the Nike+iPod Sport Kit were inaccurate, unintuitive, and uncomfortable to wear -- which it doesn't seem to be -- the handful of reviews we've read so far all agree that it possesses at least one attribute that might still make it a worthy purchase: it actually motivated the reviewers to run harder and more often than normal. Fortunately for people who also like their gear to function properly, the wireless pedometer cum personal trainer sounds like it does indeed perform as advertised, offering runners and joggers an easy setup, useful mid-workout statistics and updates, and perhaps most helpfully, a polished online interface to plot one's progress against personal goals or compare esoteric stats with exercise enthusiasts around the world. There are a few downsides here, though, not the least of which is the fact that this is basically a disposable product; the non-rechargeable, non-replaceable battery will supposedly crap out after about 1,000 miles or a year of regular use (and that's assuming you remember to reach into your stinky shoes and turn off the transmitter after each run). You'll also have to shell out for a new armband to secure your nano, as most currently available options (except for those from Nike, of course) won't hold the combination of iPod plus wireless receiver. Overall, it doesn't seem like the kit alone is compelling enough to encourage more folks to snatch up a nano, but if you already own one of these diminutive DAPs, it's a cheap way to give it some extra functionality -- especially if you forgo the special pair of $100+ Nike sneakers for a quick and easy DIY mod to your current kicks.Read - CNETRead - Shiny ShinyRead - TewksRead - iLounge Read - WSJ
