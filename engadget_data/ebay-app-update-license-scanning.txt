eBay has trotted out an update to its iPhone app that sports a slew of notable changes. First, the app is draped in a redesigned UI that enables users to checkout multiple items at the same time, view larger photos and touts improved last-minute bidding for those hot commodities. The software also tacks on driver's license scanning via the handset's camera for quick registration on the go -- but only in certain states in the US, for now. If you're looking to give it a whirl, you'll need a device that wields iOS 5 or higher in order to get in on the action.
