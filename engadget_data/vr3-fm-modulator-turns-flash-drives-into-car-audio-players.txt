We have to admit that most
FM transmitters for digital audio
players offer pretty mediocre sound quality — especially in urban areas where the spectrum is crowded. That said, we
could go for the VR3 FM Modulator, a $30 unit that plugs directly into your car's lighter port and gets its storage
from any USB flash drive (a similar model came out in Japan a
year ago — for $115). It also includes an audio-in cable so you can use it as a transmitter with other audio
players. Given the number of flash drives we've got lying around, $30 seems like a reasonable price to give them a new
lease on life, and for that price we can live with FM's limitations as well.
