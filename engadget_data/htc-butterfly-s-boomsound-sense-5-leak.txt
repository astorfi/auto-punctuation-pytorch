OK, HTC, we're starting to see a pattern here. Following the One, the Desire 600 (including China's 606w and 608t) and the much anticipated One Mini, it's no surprise that Peter Chou is keen to spread some BoomSound love to more devices. This will apparently include the upcoming Butterfly s, according to the above photos obtained by our friends over at VR-Zone. The leak claims to confirm that the display is still a 5-inch 1080p panel, and naturally, the old loudspeaker on the back has been made redundant by the new front-facing stereo speakers. There's of course Sense 5 as well, as evidenced by BlinkFeed in the above shots, but we're uncertain of whether the camera's been swapped with an UltraPixel version. Well, we shall find out at the launch event in Taiwan next week.
