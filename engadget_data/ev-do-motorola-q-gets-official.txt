Ok, one bit of solid product news out of Mobius today: we
pretty much already knew this, but Motorola just
officially confirmed that they're going to be launching the EV-DO version of their Q Smartphone in the first quarter of
next year. They wouldn't go so far as to confirm which carrier is getting it, but it'd be very, very surprising if it
wasn't Verizon. So what happens to the EDGE version of the Q they were showing off a few months ago?
