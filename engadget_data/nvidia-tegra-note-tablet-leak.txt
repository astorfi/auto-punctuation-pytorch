Not satisfied with tiny, blurry photos of NVIDIA's self-branded tablet? We don't blame you -- and neither does ChinaDIY, which just posted clear snapshots of the unannounced device. Labeled with a previously rumored Tegra Note badge, the 7-inch slate on display has a Galaxy Note-like detachable stylus and a removable cover that doubles as a stand. While there aren't many other details to learn from the powered-off unit, we've noticed both a micro-HDMI port and a microSD card slot. We're still left with the question of who the Tegra Note is for, however -- it's not certain whether this is a reference design or a consumer product. While we wait for answers, you can check out a photo of the tablet's front after the break or visit ChinaDIY for the full gallery.
