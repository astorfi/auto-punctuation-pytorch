I know, I know: The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V seems like it's been delayed at least a dozen times, but maybe the snazzy new 1080p, 60FPS trailer below will help heal those old wounds. Predictably, it looks gorgeous and should give the PC master race something to antagonize console gamers with for just a bit longer -- last fall's current-gen re-releases couldn't hit that silky frame rate or quite that level of detail. The sun reflecting off those slow-mo shell casings is pretty great, right? Come April 14th you'll be able to see that sort of thing first-hand, and then regale us with your tales of glory when we stream it on Twitch the following week.
