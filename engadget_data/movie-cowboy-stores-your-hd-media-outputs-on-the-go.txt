Comically titled as such by manufacturer Digital Cowboy, this portable HD multimedia hard drive comes ready to accept whatever 2.5-inch SATA drive you want to toss within, and after you've loaded it up with material via the USB port, you can slam it down in the bundled cradle for big screen enjoyment. Said dock boasts stereo / coaxial digital / Toslink audio outputs along with component / composite / HDMI video outs. The media player itself supports a respectable quantity of file formats, including WMV, DivX HD, MPEG1/2/4, XviD, ISO, IFO, VOB, AAC, WMA, MP3 and OGG. Not that we really see this thing heading Stateside anytime soon, but those in Japan can pick one up in the coming weeks for Â¥24,800 ($237). Shot of the rear is waiting after the jump.[Via AkihabaraNews]
