 As widely expected by most folks who speculate on such things, President Obama has now formally nominated lawyer and former venture capitalist Julius Genachowski to head up the Federal Communications Commission and fill the slot vacated by Bush appointee Kevin Martin. Among other things, Genachowski's nomination is particularly notable given his support for net neutrality, which he made quite well known during the Obama campaign in his role as a top technology advisor. Of course, if and when he gets confirmed, he'll also have his hands full with a few other tricky issues, including the widespread rollout of broadband services as a result of the recent stimulus package, and that small matter of the digital TV transition.
