Just days after the Samsung-built superphone went back on sale at the Play Store, Google has officially announced that Jelly Bean's rollout to Galaxy Nexus HSPA+ handsets has begun. Those hoping to snag it should keep an eye out for an over-the-air prompt to update, while Nexus S and Motorola Xoom owners are still being placed in a holding pattern.
