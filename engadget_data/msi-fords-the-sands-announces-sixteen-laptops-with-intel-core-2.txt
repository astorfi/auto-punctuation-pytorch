The chunky G-series will sport those new quad-core Core i7 chips, with the 17.3-inch GT780 and 15.6-inch GT680 delivering Dynaudio speakers, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 500 and 400-series graphics and dual SSDs, while the GR620 and GE620 are left to fend with lower specs of some sort. The F-series retains the Core i7 chips, but swaps in switchable NVIDIA GT 500-series graphics, excepting the 14-inch FX420 which makes do with Core i5 and loses the dedicated number pad. Finally, the C-series will shoot for eight hours of battery life. MSI's not dropping terribly detailed specs at this point (though you'll find a few in the gallery below) but if you're aiming high, you won't have long to wait for a rig -- that GT680's hitting later this month for $1,500, and the top-tier GT780 in Q2 of this year. PR after the break.

Update: Guess what we saw when the press conference ended, and we stood up to leave? Those Sandy Bridge all-in-one PCs. Find pictures (and specs!) in gallery number three.
