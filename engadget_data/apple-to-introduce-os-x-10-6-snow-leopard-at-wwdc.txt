 The pre-WWDC Apple rumor mill has finally churned out something that doesn't have the words "3G" and "iPhone" involved -- sources have told both Ars Technica and our friends at TUAW that Steve will also use his keynote to introduce the next major version of OS X, codenamed "Snow Leopard." As the derivative release name indicates, there aren't many changes in store from 10.5 Leopard -- Apple's said to instead be focusing on tightening up speed and stability as it starts producing more mobile devices. What's more, this could be the end of PowerPC and Universal support in OS X, as Snow Leopard is said to be Intel-only. That's bound to ruffle a few feathers, but things could get even more heated if Carbon is deprecated as is also being rumored. We'll see when we see -- Monday can't get here fast enough.Read - TUAW postRead - Ars post
