We knew
Delphi was planning something, but they
surprised us all with the release of SkyFi 2, a new Satellite Radio receiver.  While it features a new scroll
wheel and better display, the most interesting new feature is the addition of a 30-minute buffer that allows pausing
and rewind.  While 30 minutes isn't a huge buffer time, it does allow some basic rewind and pause functions for
when you get that annoying phone call and simply must hear the rest of that Simple Minds track.  It will retail
for $129.99, and install kits for home and vehicle are $69.99.
