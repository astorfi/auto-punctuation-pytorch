 It was but a mere eight days ago when we suggested that the number one thing that would currently improve the Zune's status would be to get firmware v1.3 out to end users, and thankfully, that day has come. Sure, it's arriving ever-so-slightly behind schedule, but ZuneInsider is reporting that the latest software is finally available for download now, and it sounds like that annoying skipping problem with Zune Marketplace content will be addressed, as well as throwing in "improved device and software reliability" in the "device detection / syncing" departments. Additionally, the FM tuner drain has also been fixed so that it no longer eats away battery life in sleep mode. So while Microsoft still has a ways to go in our estimation in order to seriously compete, here's to taking the first baby step.[Thanks, Matt]
