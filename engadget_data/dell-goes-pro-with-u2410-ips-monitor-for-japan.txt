The big selling point here, of course, is the monitor's color reproduction, which promises to reach 96% coverage of the Adobe RGB color space, and 100% coverage of the sRGB color space. Otherwise, you can expect some suitably high-end specs across the board, including a 1,920 x 1,200 resolution, a 6ms response time, a 1,000:1 contrast ratio, a full range of ports including DVI, DisplayPort, and HDMI, not to mention a built-in 4-port USB hub. No word on a release over here, unfortunately, but folks in Japan can grab one now for Â¥72,450, or about $760.[Via Impress]
