 Breaking up is hard to do, and it took Microsoft and NBC a few more days to hammer out all the details and make it official. NBC is buying the software maker's half of the MSNBC website for a reporter $300 million, which will be renamed NBC News -- a change which has already taken place if you try to hit up the old site. Its HQ will also move across from Microsoft's hub in Redmond to New York. Following the split, Microsoft is apparently readying its own news service for launch later this year, aiming to hire around the same number of people that were put to work on the previous site -- and looking to improve on its recent online fortunes.
