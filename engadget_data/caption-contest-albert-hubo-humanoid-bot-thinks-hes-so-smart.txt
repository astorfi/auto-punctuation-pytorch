We saw a bad photoshop mock-up of this floating around the internets a few days ago, but we didn't think anyone had
actually been crazy enough to build it. This
humanoid robot named Albert Hubo
walks, talks, shows emotions all disembodied Einstein style, and gives us the absolute heebie-jeebies.


Ryan: "That's right 'Steiney. World-changing intellectual, Nobel Prize-winning physicist, head grafted to an
immortal robot body, total silver fox. Why, hello missâ€¦"

 Paul: "I'm real glad and all that you guys decided bring me back to life after 50 years of peace and quiet, but giving
me the body of a 6 year old in a space suit doesn't really win you any points."

 Marc: "It's not the robot bod I mind; it's the mullet. Please, someone get me a barber!"

 Evan: "Yahoo Serious, older but hardly wiser, reflects upon the evils of typecasting."
