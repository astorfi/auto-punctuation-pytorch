In fact, it's not entirely clear what makes this different from the last year's 1690, but GPSTracklog speculates this will offer Garmin's traffic trends feature also found in the 3700, augmented by real-time updates from every other 1695 user similarly stuck in traffic. Seems like a good guess to us, but we're of course more curious about how much the thing will cost -- $500 for the 1690 when it was new was a bit of a bitter pill to swallow.
