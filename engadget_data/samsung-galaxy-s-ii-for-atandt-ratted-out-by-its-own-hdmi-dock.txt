Samsung's Singapore division has a series of professional shots of planned accessories, including this "Samsung Galaxy S II Desktop Dock," a handsome pyramid stand sporting HDMI and 3.5mm stereo-out jacks -- and of course, an AT&T logo on its comfortably cradled smartphone. We're still not quite sure when Samsung's flagship will hit the US, but it had better get a move on -- we're slated to see a Galaxy S III by this time next year, after all.

Update: We should probably note it looks like the Galaxy S II's seen a bit of a makeover for AT&T, gaining the four familiar capacitive touch buttons and generally appearing more like the Infuse 4G.
