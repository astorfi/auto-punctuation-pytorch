As this would cause much gnashing of teeth and woe for the affected terrestrial parties, some researchers from NASA's Ames Research Center have pitched the idea of moving said junk with a laser -- once again proving that everything's better with lasers. The idea is to use a 5kW ray, likely similar to the one we've got at the Starfire Optical Range, to slow our galactic garbage -- perhaps slowing it down enough to burn it up in earth's atmosphere. Current estimates say such a laser could migrate ten pieces of junk a day, which gives us the promise of a future with neat and tidy skies.
