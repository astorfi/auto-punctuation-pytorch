If you happen to own a Slingbox media streamer and a Windows 8.1/RT device, it's your lucky day. After announcing last month that a SlingPlayer app for Windows was on the way, it's now in the Windows Store, ready for download. Like the iOS and Android versions, which have been out for quite some time, users can take advantage of mobile DVR control and watch either live or recorded TV on their device. Slingbox owners will receive a free, 24-hour trial, but will need to cough up $15 to continue using it.
