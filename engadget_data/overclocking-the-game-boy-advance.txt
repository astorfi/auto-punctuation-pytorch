Probably just to prove that they can, the modders over at Ahead Games are overclocking the Game Boy Advance so that
they can play Super Nintendo games on it. There's apparently already an SNES emulator for the GBA available called SNES
Advance, but the portable console doesn't quite have the horsepower on its own to do the job properly.
