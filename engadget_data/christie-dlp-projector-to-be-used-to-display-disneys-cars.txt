A group is going to premier Disney's Cars at Lowe's Motor Speedway on four 125-foot screen with the proceeds going to Speedway Children's Charities and Association of Hole in the Wall Gang Camps. Christie, ultra-high end provider of projectors, is donating the use of two CP200 3-chip DLP projectors. These units are deemed the "brightest in the industry" and has some amazing specs. Like 35 trillion colors, 45-bit color processing, 2048 x 1080 resolution and light output that meets SMPTE standard 14fL. The screens were made just for this event on the tracks of the speedway and is going to be matched with a state-of-the-art sound system. There are going to be four screens lit up that night and Christie is going to power two of 'em. This is going to be the first multi-screen digital cinema premiere ever staged and we imagine it is going to be spectacular.The event is going to be held on May 26 and we are hoping that some of our readers will be in attendance. Snap us some pics if you would and let us know how it was.
