They're both slick little smudge-loving machines with handsome design sense and super glossy finishes. In case you've forgotten, the dv2 is the first netbook to have AMD's Neo platform, and it boasts a 1.6GHz Athlon Neo MV-40 processo, up to 4GB of memory and a 500GB hard drive and starts at $699. The dv3 starts at $799 and comes in several configurations, including either a 2GHz Athlon X2 QL-62 or a 2.4GHz Turion X2 Ultra ZM-86, with ATI's Radeon HD 3200 graphics, up to 8GB of DDR2 RAM, 160/250/320/400GB hard drive choices. They're both available now, but check the gallery for some photographic evidence.
