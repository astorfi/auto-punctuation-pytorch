You may recall the S1080 for its 320GB drive, dual-core Atom N570, Ethernet port, and (curious) VGA output. Or perhaps you were stoked on that optical mouse and tactile mouse button combo. Well, all that stands between you and your future LAN-partying, tablet-toting self, are 650 clams and a handful of days -- you know, given that scheduled ship date of July 1st. Rounding out the remaining specs are 802.11b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 3.0, 1.3 megapixel webcam and a USB 3.0 port. If the thought of a Windows 7 slate with a mouse and a smattering of ports has your heart aflutter, we'd like to ask: why are you still here? Oh, and before you hit the source links, don't forget the snazzy optional dock with optical drive + speakers that'll ship later this summer.
