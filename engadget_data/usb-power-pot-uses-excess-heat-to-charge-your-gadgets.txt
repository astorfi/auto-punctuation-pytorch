Released yesterday in Japan, the Hitochaja HC-5 USB power pot can generate up to 400mAh of juice -- enough to charge your iPhone in three to five hours. Considering it needs a constant heat source to generate electricity, the Â¥23,000 pot (about $285, before tax) is even less practical than last week's C-type battery laptop charger, but if you want to expand the service offerings at your local soup kitchen, this double-duty cooking vessel may be the solution you've been looking for.
