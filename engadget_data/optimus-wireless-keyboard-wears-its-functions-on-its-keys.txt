Yeah, and it's about time someone shook up this stagnant keyboard market, already. Good old QWERTY day in, day out —
we love ya — but this wireless offering from Optimus gets a little funky on us. Designed by Art Lebedev Studio in
Moscow, the device's keys light up to indicate each associated function. There's a dedicated bank of keys on the left
for switching applications and modes, and the keys in the regular QWERTY bank can change to display any number of
languages as well as numbers, symbols HTML codes and mathematical functions. Unfortunately, this doesn't look like
actualware quite yet as they're still waiting on a patent. Ain't it always the way?
