Now, it seems like the floodgates are officially open across the industry. On the same day that TWC users in Austin, Texas began scooping up tuning adapters of their own, we're seeing multiple reports from Northern Virginia that consumers are finally able to claim one from their local office. It doesn't seem as if installation is totally a breeze for everyone, but Cox has evidently trained its CSR staff to handle quirks quickly judging by positive vibes felt on the TiVoCommunity boards. Moral of the story? Your carrier just might have a TA with your name on it, but you may never find out without giving 'em a ring.[Thanks, Phillip]
