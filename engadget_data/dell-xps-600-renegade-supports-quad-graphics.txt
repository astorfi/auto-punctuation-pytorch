You'reimmediately drawn to the custom painted case courtesy of Mike Lavallee from Killer Paint, but it'swhat inside that matters most. Fired by a factory overclocked Intel Extreme Edition running at 4.26GHz, theRenegade fully supports four graphics cards. To be more specific, those zippy cards are NVIDIA's GeForce 7800 SLIcards; two fit in the PCI-Express slots and two more are slaved from those, each with 512MB of memory. Can you saysuper high res at mucho frames per second? Storage is a non-issue as Dell planned ahead with one 10,000 RPM 150GB driveand two 250GB drives running at 7,200 RPM. Dell expects this custom hardware available by end of the month and we'relooking at the $4,000 to $7,000 range, depending on options. Not that there's room for more in this hot box, but whatelse could or would you add?
