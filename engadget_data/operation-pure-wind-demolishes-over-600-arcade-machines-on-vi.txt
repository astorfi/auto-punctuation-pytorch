The soothingly named "Operation Pure Wind" took place earlier this month, focusing on illegal and unlicensed criminal activity, including pornography and electronic gambling, and resulted in some 165 arrests. Sure, they're only Baccarat games, but who knows? Maybe if they hadn't been brought up in such a terrible environment they'd have grown up to become Galaga or Mappy consoles. Either way, it's quite sad. Video after the break.
