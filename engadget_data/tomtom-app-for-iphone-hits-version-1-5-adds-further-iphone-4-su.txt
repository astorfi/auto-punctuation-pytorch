The new 1.5 version adds enhanced graphics to match the new iPhone 4 screen resolution, along with "faster, more-responsive navigation" on that handset. Not good enough for you? Try the new navigate-to-photo feature, a not-a-gimmick-at-all addition that allows you to select a geotagged photo as your destination instead of messing around with pesky addresses and facts. The update is free for existing users, newcomers will have to shell out $50 for the US version.
