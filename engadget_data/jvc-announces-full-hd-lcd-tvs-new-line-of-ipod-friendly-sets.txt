From the top, we're look at four newcomers with 1080p panels -- the LT-32J300, LT-42J300, LT-46J300 and LT-52J300 -- all of which tout a dynamic backlight, the company's own Smart Picture technology, there HDMI inputs and a new cabinet with a snazzy new bezel and a black glossy finish. Moving on to more Apple-friendly pastures, we've got an all new TeleDock line that spans from 31.5-inches to 46-inches. All five models come with an integrated iPod dock for playing back portable media and recharging your player, and the whole crew should be in stores by April. Check the links below for all the minutiae.Read - JVC's new Full HD lineRead - JVC's TeleDock line
