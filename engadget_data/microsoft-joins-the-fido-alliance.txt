The FIDO Alliance is on a roll: It already has support from heavyweights like Google and Lenovo in its quest to eliminate password-based sign-ins, and it's now bringing Microsoft into the fold. The software pioneer is taking a seat at the Alliance's board of directors, where it will help shape open authentication standards. Microsoft isn't revealing what it would like to do with FIDO at this early stage, but it's easy to see the company improving both its verification methods and Windows' support for biometric readers. There are still gaps in the Alliance's membership -- Apple and Samsung aren't involved, for instance. Still, Redmond's involvement makes it clearer than ever that the group will have a lot of say over our future digital security.
