Turion-based laptops are turning up now that the
chip has been around for a while, and PC Magazine has a look at one of the faster ones, the 2 GHz HP Compaq Presario
V2000. The reviewer gave the laptop good ratings for performance, weight (5.4 pounds), and standard specs, which
include 512MB RAM, an 80GB HDD, a DVDÂ±RW drive and a 6-in-1 flash card reader. However, battery life was a mere 2 hours
29 minutes, especially disappointing given that the whole point of AMD's Turion is to provide an alternative to Intel's
Pentium M. However, HP makes available a $25 extended battery that boosts battery life to over 5 hours, long enough to
enjoy a couple of DVDs on a long flight.
