 
 Digital Storm gets plenty of coverage for its boutique gaming PCs and coma-inducing prices, but its latest Marauder lineup serves as proof that it's willing to also build quality, affordable rigs for the masses. Consumers may choose between four configurations, which feature AMD processors on the low-end and Intel counterparts on the high-end. For example, the entry-level Marauder sells for $799 and offers a quad-core 3.6GHz AMD FX-4100 CPU and a Radeon HD 7750 GPU, whereas the most expensive variant sells for $1,299 and includes a quad-core 3.3GHz Intel Core i5 2500K CPU and a Radeon HD 7870 GPU. Regardless of system, consumers will fetch a Corsair Vengeance C70 case, a similarly respectable Corsair GS 600W power supply, 8GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM and Windows 7 Home Premium. In every case, the prices rival the DIY alternative quite well, and if you'd like to take a look at the full array of configurations, just hop the break for a spec sheet and the PR.
