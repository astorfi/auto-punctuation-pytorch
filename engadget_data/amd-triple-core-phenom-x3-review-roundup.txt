Make no mistake, we've been waiting quite some time for these buggers to ship, but they've finally made it into the capable hands of reviewers web-wide. The general consensus seems to be that the tri-core processors offer no real surprises: it performs better than a dual-core AMD CPU, yet worse than a quad-core AMD CPU. Needless to say, it tends to lag even further behind an Intel quad-core. Still, the Phenom X3 wouldn't be a terrible option if quad-core Intel chips were still as pricey as ever, but with it slashing prices a few weeks back, the X3 seems to lack the value AMD was hoping we'd see. Still, don't take our word for it -- there's lots and lots of words on the matter right down there.Read - HotHardware (...the X3 8750 should also appeal to modders on a budget.)Read - MaximumPC (Basically, it's a quad core with one core turned off.)Read - TweakTown (...a perfect choice to replace Athlon 64 X2s...)Read - PCPerspective (...isn't a slam dunk in performance or value...)Read - Bit-Tech (...Phenom X3 8750 is a good processor in isolation...)Read - Computer Shopper (...a worthy choice for Athlon X2 owners on a tight budget...)
