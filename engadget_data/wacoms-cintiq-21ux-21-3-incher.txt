If you can afford it, you're probably a professional who's been tracking it a while now, but Wacom's introduced their new Cintiq 21UX 21.3-inch UXGA (1600 x 1200) tablet / monitor and the peeps at PC World got to take a gander. Sucker comes with DVI and VGA inputs (as well as the obligatory USB connections), not to mention a fancy pen stand and slick adjustable monitor stand-freakin' better for
$2,999 ($2500 street) is all we're saying. What'd they think? Well, it was good, but definitely not a paper substitute; what'd you expect?
