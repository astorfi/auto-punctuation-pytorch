LaCie has just unveiled the SAFE Mobile Hard Drive, a USB 2.0 hard drive with built-in fingerprint
authentication.  It's not the
first such security-conscious drive, but this one's
software is embedded so you won't need to install stuff on every computer you use it with.   Two models are
available for pre-order now (shipping mid-July), the 40GB one'll run you $150 with the 80GB model costing fifty bucks
more.  Both are 5400rpm drives with 8MB cache, and they'll each hold five different user profiles.
