We were kind of hoping Sega's feel good robot of the fall, the
iDog, might be followed up by something even more
cuddly and innocuously pointless, such that we might continue adding more iAnimals to our desk, bobbing their heads and
wagging various tails and ears to the beat. But the iFish? We're not saying Hasbro's not gonna bring it over, but for
something that could easily pass as an iTrilobite will be a helluva lot harder sell in the US than, say, an iCat or an
iBunny.
