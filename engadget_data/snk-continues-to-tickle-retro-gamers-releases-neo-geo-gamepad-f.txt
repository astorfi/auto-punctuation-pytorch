Sure, it isn't as majestic as the giant, hulking arcade stick that came in a pair with the $650 Neo Geo Gold System. However, the system's gamepad (released with the Neo Geo CD) would go on to be even more popular thanks to its much lower cost and novel floating 8-way d-pad. That controller is reborn (again) for the PS3 with USB connectivity the addition of a PS button in the middle, meaning you can even use it to pull up the XMB and taunt your friends into joining a King of Fighters match. Sadly this is only getting a release in Japan, where it sells for 3,129 yen (about $37), but Play-Asia will import you one for $45. Small price for such a lovely thing.
