 Phone Scoop is reporting that doomsday is imminent for Motorola, possibly as soon as this week. First off, up to half of employees from the company's handset division will be shown the door, though the other divisions -- Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Home & Networks Mobility -- will be unaffected. Fewer employees inevitably leads to fewer phones, and it's being said that Moto will produce just twelve models per year; among smartphones, only Android will be considered. What's more, the company is pulling out of April's CTIA show -- the largest mobile event in the States -- so it looks like that Android gear won't be coming until later on. We'll have more on this as soon as we know what's up.
