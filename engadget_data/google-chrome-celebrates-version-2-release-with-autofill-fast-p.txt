You don't need the folks in Accounts Receivable knowing every detail of your life (including all the time you spend in the Cat Fancy online forums). Well, you're in luck! Google's infamous browser is now officially out of beta, and has been designated version two -- and among the improvements is a feature that allows you to remove those pesky thumbnails from the browser home screen. Also in store for faithful users are such key features as Form Autofill and Full Screen Mode. Sadly, neither Linux or Mac users get to join the party just yet -- but we'll let you know as soon as that changes. Check out the video after the break.
