Google has committed to pushing software updates to its Glass headset each month, and a post on Google+ reveals this month's tweaks are focusing on pictures. If you're a fan of using the device for POV shots, it should take better pictures by capturing a sequence of images for improved low-light performance and HDR pictures in bright situations -- check out a gallery of enhanced images at the source link below. Also new is a prompt to add a caption after you take a picture. Users can tap their headset, speak the caption and it's automatically inserted. Last month's XE5 update addressed a wider range of issues, but this one will make sure any impromptu pictures (with your subject's full awareness and permission for the photo, we're sure) are high quality.
