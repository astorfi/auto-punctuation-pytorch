Once only known as the Nike, the Touch Dual now measures in at 107 x 55 x 15.8-mm / 120-grams (slightly different than its Japanese sib) and packs WCDMA/HSDPA 2100MHz and GSM/EDGE 900/1800/1900MHz radios. Of course, it brings the TouchFLO interface riding atop Windows Mobile 6 Professional and 2.6-inch QVGA touch-screen as you'd expect. Inside you'll find a 400MHz Qualcomm MSM7200 processor; 256MB flash, 128MB RAM and microSD expansion; Bluetooth 2.0+EDR; 802.11b/g WiFi; HTC ExtUSB (HTC's mini USB 2.0 jack with support for data and audio); and enough juice to power WCDMA talk for up to 240 minutes or up to 360 minutes on GSM frequencies. Available this month on Orange in select European countries. Pricing? Yeah, we'd like to know that too.Update: Whoa Nelly, what's this? No WiFi? Although we're fairly certain we saw it (wishful thinking?) a second look at the specs reveals the lack of WiFi on this HTC device. Oh my.Update 2: We just received confirmation direct from HTC: no WiFi unlike its Japanese twin. Yes, we're also surprised.
