The "good will" program that would have provided free (or at least heavily discounted) digital copies of games already purchased on UMD discs has been scrapped. A spokesman for SCEA said, "We were evaluating a UMD conversion program, but due to legal and technical reasons we will not be offering the program at this time." Adding insult to injury, the PSP Go Rewards program offering 3 free games to European UMD owners will not be offered in the US. That's the bad news. The not so bad news is that 16,000 pieces of digital content will be available for the US PSP Go launch on October 1st. These include 225 downloadable games (full PSP titles, PSN exclusives, UMD legacy titles, and Minis), 2,300 films, and 13,300 television episodes. Still, not quite the "at least 300" digital games we were expecting. So US PSP owners, still planning to "upgrade?"Read -- UMD-to-PSP Go program scrappedRead -- 225 games at US launch
