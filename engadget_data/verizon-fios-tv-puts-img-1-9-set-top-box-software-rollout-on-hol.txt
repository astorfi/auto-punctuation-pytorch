Zatz Not Funny links to a forum thread where Director of Consumer Product Development Joe Ambeault confirms the rollout is "pausing for a moment to incorporate some customer feedback." Two issues specifically mentioned are the contrast between text and background and SD override wizard. There's no word of any change to the originally expressed plans of delivering the software to all of its customers in "the coming months" so we don't expect the delay to last too long, we'll let you know when we hear something more specific.
