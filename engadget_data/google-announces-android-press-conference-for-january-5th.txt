       
Well well. Look at this. Taking a page from the CES-challenging Apple / Macworld playbook, Google has announced a press event on January 5th (just like we told you) in Mountain View, stating: 

With the launch of the first Android-powered device just over a year ago, we've seen how a powerful, open platform can spur mobile product innovation. And this is just the beginning of what's possible.

Please join us in Mountain View on January 5, for an Android press gathering.
If this lines up with the news we've seen recently, it's likely a Nexus One announcement will be the order of the day, and most (if not all) of your nagging questions will get answered. You know we'll be there live... so hang on to your hats, and mark down the date!
