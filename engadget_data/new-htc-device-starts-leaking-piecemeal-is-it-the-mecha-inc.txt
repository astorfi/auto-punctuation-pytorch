Could it be that Taiwan's finest are "leaking" us these shots in an effort to drum up interest going into CES in a couple weeks? We wouldn't doubt it in the least -- with the LG B, Optimus 2X, and Samsung Nexus S all fresh off the presses, HTC probably wouldn't mind getting a little boost in mindshare right now, and there's no better way to do it than by teasing a phone that looks an awful lot like the previously-leaked Mecha. As a refresher, the Mecha is the beast that might end up on Verizon as the Incredible HD, offering LTE compatibility for the carrier's new 4G network -- and we know that Verizon plans on showing a whole bunch of LTE devices at CES, so this is all lining up pretty nicely. Follow the break for the other shot we received along with SlashGear's.

Update: Android Central got another picture, too, presumably from the same source. Shenanigans!

Update 2: Gizmodo, too. At the rate we're going, we'll have these pictures assembled into an actual working phone by the time the night is over.

Update 3: And PhoneDog! Collect all five!
