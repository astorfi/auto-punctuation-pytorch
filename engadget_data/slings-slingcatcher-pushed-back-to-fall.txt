Well, we put it out there and heard back from Sling: apparently that summer launch was a little "aggressive", and the release has been silently moved back to fall. Bummer, because we were really stoked to fool around with this sucker. Ah well, as long as Sling isn't too worried about the Apple TV eating the SlingCatcher's lunch, we'll sit quietly like well behaved gadget nerds.[Thanks, Cole]
