 
Alright Q fans, we've got some good newsfor you. We've received word that Verizon and Motorola are holding a joint news conference in New York this May22nd -- no, not May 22nd 2007, though we should qualify that -- to announce the Q. We know, wipe the look of shock offyour face; we don't really have much more info to give you than that, but really, what more do you need? By this pointyou're either completely sick of hearing about this thing, or have some insane pent up urge to get one, so for thelatter crowd: keep your eyes and ears tuned to May 22nd.
