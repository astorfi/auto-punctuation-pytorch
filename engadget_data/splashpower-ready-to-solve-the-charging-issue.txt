Splashpower are gearing up to finally
release their SplashPad charging mat.  The mouse-sized pad allows users of cellphones, PDAs, and other portable,
recharcheable devices to simply place them on the pad for recharding rather than plug them all in separately. 
Great idea, right?  Only problem is that the SplashPad requires the use of SplashModules, thin little receiver
modules that fit onto the portable devices to be recharged.  It would have been nice if the SplashPad worked on
its own without having to put stickers all over our devices, but we'll still give this thing a try. Could solve some
serious wiring (and more serious electrical fire) issue we always seem to battle, what with about 800 adapters under
the desk.
