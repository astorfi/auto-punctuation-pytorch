       Everybody who had problems with the 1080p support on their Xbox 360 with the fall update rollout, we have good news. According to the Major, Microsoft is now rolling out updates for improved 1080p and VGA supports (as well as some performance fixes for wired headsets on wireless controllers). Get it while it's hot (i.e. log on to Xbox Live, let it do its thing).[Thanks, Manh]
