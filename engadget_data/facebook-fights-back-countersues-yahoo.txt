  Surprise, surprise, Facebook has decided to sling a lawsuit Yahoo's way after the latter first filed a patent infringement action against Zuckerberg's crew a few weeks ago. According to Florian Mueller over at FOSSPatents, the social network's alleging some IP infringement of its own -- claiming that Yahoo has run afoul of ten of its patents. The patents in question cover myriad technologies, ranging for ad placement and information arrangements on web pages to privacy controls for managing what info is shown to individual users and instant messaging using email protocol. Just another ho-hum legal battle between tech behemoths here in Silicon Valley, folks, with mere millions of dollars at stake. But, if you're yearning for more, you can read the full complaint at the All Things D source link below.
