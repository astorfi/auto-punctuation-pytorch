 HTC is throwing its hat into the phablet ring and it appears that its sleeping giant is set to awaken on Verizon's network, but not before smiling for the cameras. Pictured above is a (presumably) leaked press shot of the highly anticipated Droid DNA, which is believed to be Big Red's stateside rendition of the 5-inch Super LCD 3, 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon-toting J Butterfly. While this device has generated quite a buzz, it remains to be seen if this Japanese behemoth's red, white and blue counterpart will ship with identical hardware. Thankfully, all should be revealed soon, as Verizon and HTC have scheduled a get together later this month in the Big Apple and of course we'll be on hand to bring you all of the gory details, no matter how difficult to handle.
