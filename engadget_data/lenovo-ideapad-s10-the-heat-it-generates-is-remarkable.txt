The keyboard itself gets pretty warm, with temperatures measured between 38 and 42°C (100.4 and 107.6°F). That slightly edges out tests performed on the Eee PC 900 (101°F / 38°C), and leaves your Cloudbook (83°F / 28°C) as cool as a cucumber. There's no word on the bottom side's heat signature, but with keys like this we aren't expecting good things.[Thanks, Patrick]
