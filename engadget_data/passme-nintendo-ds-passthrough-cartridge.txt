Now available for preorder is an assembled and tested PassMe chip for running and developing homebrew programs and
games on your Nintendo DS. The chips are hand-soldered, come assembled with the cartridge connector installed, and are
up for grabs for $20 plus $10 shipping to any country. You'll need a GameBoy Advance flash card and linker and one DS
game to start your tinkering once you receive the PassMe, reportedly shipping out at the end of next week. Of course
you'll be using this at your own risk, and should it cause any blindness or infertility in your DS, you can't go
whining to the PassMe creator, dig?
