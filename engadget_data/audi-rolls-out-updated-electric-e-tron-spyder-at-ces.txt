It's the Audi e-tron Spyder, a hybrid with a twin-turbo V6 and dual electric motors as well capable of 0 - 60 times of 4.7 seconds, and we thought you might want to see. Still no price or availability, though. Audi Chairman Rupert Stadler also took the time to show off the company's latest MMI system, with its character-recognizing touchpad, and also spoke a little bit about the future -- vaguely, anyway. He refuted our thoughts on the car of the future, replacing the dash with a mobile device, saying that those devices are designed to draw your attention which is, of course, a bad thing while you're driving. However, we can't help but think that there are ways to eliminate that problem with the right software layer.

Anyway, we'll be speaking with Stadler a little later today and will be picking his brain a little bit more about this and other topics of the future.
