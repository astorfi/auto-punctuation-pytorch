What's more, Samsung Hub is reporting that at least one retailer in France is already selling the device, which is basically a Samsung Galaxy phone without the phone. That means you'll get Android 2.1, a decent 3.2-inch screen, a 2 megapixel camera, built-in WiFi and GPS, 8 or 16GB of storage, and a microSD card slot for expansion. Head on past the break for the video, and look for the phone to officially hit other retailers in Europe later this month (still no word on a release over here, unfortunately).
