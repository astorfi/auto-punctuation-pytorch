Mercedes-Benz is far from the first automaker to experiment with self-driving cars, but it's making up for that in style at CES. Meet the F015 Luxury in Motion, a previously hinted-at concept car designed from the ground up for robotic transportation. Passengers normally sit face to face so they can talk more, and anyone can control the car through remote units and gestures (courtesy of Leap Motion) -- this is really a classic, luxurious carriage remade for the modern era, according to Mercedes. The vehicle even has color-coded LED lights on the front and back to let you know what the car is thinking. It can tell you whether or not it's in autonomous mode, or give pedestrians a heads-up when it's safe to cross. You probably won't ever see the F015 go on sale, but it's a good clue as to what Mercedes hopes you'll drive (or rather, not drive) in the years ahead.
