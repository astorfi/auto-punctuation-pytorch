 We don't normally rock the mobilesoftware announcements, but we know how long, patiently, and eagerly a lot of you have been waiting for Opera to get released on Pocket PC since its release for Smartphonelast summer. Well, we've got some good news for you: today the Opera 8.5 beta for Pocket PC devices hit the 'Net in allits CSS2 / JavaScript / DOM 2 rendering glory. We gave it a brief whirl on our HTC Wizard and found it to be asignificant improvement over PIE (then again, what wouldn't be anymore?), especially its page formatting, load times,and having the ability to run multiple browser windows and close them completely from within the app (i.e., not needingto stop the task in the process manager).[Via Geekzone]
