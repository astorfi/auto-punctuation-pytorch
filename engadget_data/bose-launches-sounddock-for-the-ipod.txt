Adding to the vast
amounts of speaker-docks already available for the iPod,
Bose steps up to the plate with their SoundDock system. So if you're the type who likes to put some speaker magnets
right next to your precious iPod, the SoundDock has an IR remote, and, you know, a dock that plays audio. No official
word on size or other specs, but we expect it'll be pretty decent and pretty high-priced.
