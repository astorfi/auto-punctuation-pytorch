Jokes aside, this new Vertu-logoed clone looks decent, but definitely is not up to par (from images, anyway) to the real deal. While we love smaller-sized Vertu knockoffs, this time around the larger "semi-lookalike" handset smacks of real Vertu design. However, it does not resemble any publicly known Vertu handset. Still, the Vertu logo is stamped on this baby and telltale yet subtle signs of it being a Vertu handset are woven in there as well. Tech details include a QVGA touchscreen, no physical keypad, stereo speakers, microSD slot and a 4 megapixel cam. Throw in a 2,000 mAh battery and this is one phone with major-league specs. Except that it's not a Vertu.[Via Just Another Mobile Phone Blog]
