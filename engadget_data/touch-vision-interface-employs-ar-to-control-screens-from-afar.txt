While the "how" behind it is no doubt complicated (and being kept largely under wraps at the moment), the end result is fairly simple: you just point your smartphone at a screen (or two) and start manipulating it from the point of view provided by the phone's camera. Of course, it's all still in the early stages right now, but group sees a wide range of applications for the system -- even including large outdoor billboards. Check it out in action in the video after the break.
