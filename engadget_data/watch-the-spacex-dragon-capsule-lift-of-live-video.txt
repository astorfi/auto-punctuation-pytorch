 There's nothing like a good ol' fashion rocket launch to spice up a lazy Sunday evening -- the SpaceX Dragon capsule is ready to soar. Following a successful docking test back in May, NASA has approved Dragon for a series of delivery missions, carting a thousand pounds of cargo to astronauts on the International Space Station. Today, at 8:35PM ET, the capsule is scheduled to ride a Falcon 9 rocket into orbit -- the first of what should be a series of round-trip delivery missions. Barring bad weather or engine problems, it should be a good show -- join us after the break to enjoy the launch right here.

 Update: Dragon made it into orbit -- check out the instant replay after the break.
