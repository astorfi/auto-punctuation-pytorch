Apparently TiVo thinks it's just a drop in the bucket, as the company is now selling a "premium remote" that bears resemblance to Logitech's Harmony 670, which supposedly lets you take "maximum control" of your oh-so-pricey PVR. The "Glo," as it's so aptly called, sports only one main distinction over the bundled flavor: a chrome rim around the edges. However, the remote will reportedly still operate exactly like the non-glamorous version with Series2 boxes, Series1 units made by Philips, and "Hughes, Samsung, and RCA DirecTV DVR boxes with TiVo service." It also touts a "DVR switch" to dictate dual TiVos with the flick of the finger, and hopes to reel folks in with its fingerprint-loving glossy black finish. While we don't see much value in this "ultimate edition," you can place you order now for $49.99 if you've just got to have it all.[Via Zatz Not Funny]
