 Following the footsteps of its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is making its way to Android and iOS. Rockstar announced today that a special 10th Anniversary Edition of the open world Scarface / Miami Vice inspired sim will be hitting the two popular mobile platforms on December 6th for $5. This spiffed-up mobile port includes updated character models, enhanced lighting effects, improved targeting and fully customizable control options. Technical upgrades aside, we caution not to drive directly against the sun while riding a motorcycle within the game; it nearly blinded us in the original console version, so we can only imagine how harsh it will be on your fancy high-res display. Don't say that we didn't warn you. Move past the break for a complete list of supported devices.
