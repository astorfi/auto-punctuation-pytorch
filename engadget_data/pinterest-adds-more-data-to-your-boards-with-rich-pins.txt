Pinterest is already an absurdly popular way to save stuff from around the web, be it shoes you love, accessories for your bridesmaids or decorations for your man cave. One thing the social-bookmarking service has been missing, however, is context. Now it's offering a way for companies to deliver more info, through metadata attached to particular types of pages. Rich pins, as they're being called, can automatically attach price and availability to a product, or ingredient lists to recipes. There are also movie pins, which let sites attach ratings and credits to films. Pinterest has lined up an impressive list of partners to help it launch the new feature, including Netflix, Etsy, ASOS, REI, The North Face, Modcloth, Bon Appetit, Epicurious and Real Simple. All your old pins that now have contextual data will automatically be updated (which you'll be able to identify thanks to icons below them), and you can check out some example boards at the source link.
