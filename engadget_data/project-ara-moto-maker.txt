Sure, Moto Maker makes it easy to deck out your phone with a fresh paint job, but the company's CEO has bigger goals in mind for the customization engine. Speaking with YouTuber Marques Brownlee, Dennis Woodside envisioned a Moto Maker capable of customizing not just your smartphone's color scheme, but its functionality too. He was talking, of course, about Project Ara. "The idea is you have a skeleton that holds together a set of components and the components slide in and out," Woodside told Brownlee, explaining the modular cell phone project that was revealed in October. The CEO said that a prototype is "pretty close" to being ready, and the final product could find its way to Moto Maker. "Ara is much further out, but you can see how those two things tie together and how, as we introduce new materials into Moto Maker, we're going to pursue that theme across our product line going forward." It's a vague prediction, but it is encouraging to hear that the customization platform might eventually grow beyond its one phone trick.
