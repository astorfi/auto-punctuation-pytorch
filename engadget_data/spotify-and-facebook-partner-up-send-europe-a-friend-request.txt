Neither party is dropping any cash on the deal -- set to be called either "Facebook Music" or "Spotify on Facebook," according to Forbes's anonymous sources -- which will let members of the social network stream songs at the same time as friends and share their listening habits with those in their social circle. The service is reportedly currently in testing and could be launched in a fortnight, but its arrival in the US still hinges on those ever important label deals. In the meantime, we'll all have to share our listening habits the old fashioned way: by posting on our friends' walls.
