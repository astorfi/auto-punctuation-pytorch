The 6-inch, Android-powered Reader is now available for pre-order (at the source link) for $150, just as expected. The current shipping date is listed as "on or about" October 16th, so if you put in your order now, you'll still have a couple of weeks to wait. Still, if you could hold out six years for A Dance with Dragons, what's three weeks to you?

[Thanks, knowmadd]
