   Last year was a hoot, so why not get excited for the next annual Nokia shindig? The folks from Finland already have Nokia World 2012 in their sights, as they've announced September 25th and 26th as the magic dates for this year's event. So what's in store for us in Helsinki six and a half months from now? Hard to tell this early in the game, but we'd expect to see Stephen Elop touting some new Lumia devices that run Apollo, and -- should we be so lucky -- even one or two with PureView thrown in. It's an exciting prospect, but remember to exercise patience, grasshoppers.
