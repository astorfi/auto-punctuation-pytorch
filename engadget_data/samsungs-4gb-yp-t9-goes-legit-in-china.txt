Maybe Sammy didn't get the memo, but that FCC of ours is best used -- in our opinion, at least -- for Stateside releases, none of this piddling China stuff. Of course, a China release doesn't preclude a US release, and it's not like Samsung ever drops anything first over here anyways, but that doesn't mean we can't be total whiners about it. As for specs, everything seems to match the FCC docs, including a 1.8-inch screen, MP3, WMA and OGG codec support, Flash games, 30 hours of music playback, 6 hours of video playback (down from the 7 we spied, take that China!), and of course the 4GB of flash memory and Bluetooth support. Keep reading for some purty press shots of the player, but don't get too attached... gadget love is a cruel mistress.[Thanks, Samsung-the-man]
