We've been playing with it a little since we got it, and while it's definitely one of the more attractive mobile Twitter clients we've come across, it's also distressingly laggy: it's stalled out several times just scrolling a list of tweets, button presses go ignored, and refreshing data seems to cause all sorts of consternation -- our Zune's dropped its WiFi connection several times now. Not sure what's going on with that, but we've definitely seen some far more polished apps running on the Zune, so we're hoping these glitches get cleaned up soon.

Update: Turns out there's a bigger problem here than just poor performance -- as reader Scott Zero points out, it censors naughty words out of tweets in your timeline. (Seriously -- here's his original tweet that we've highlighted above.) Sure, it's a free app, but this kind of active content censorship just rubs us the wrong way -- even worse than Apple's various Twitter-related App Store shenanigans. Bleh.
