YouTube's finest, a certain pimmysays, has uploaded just such a video, and is making the notable claim of hacking the Wii to run game backups. Just like the rest of these fools do, pimmy's video quality is horrible, and there could easily be a cut at 1:16 -- or just about anywhere else, for that matter -- where pimmy could've stopped the camera and swapped in an actual Zelda disc instead of that burned DVD the video shows being loaded at the first. Luckily, we won't have to wait too terribly long to find out: pimmy is promising "something special" on New Years, implying an unveil of the hack for all to see. We're not holding our breath. Peep the video after the break.[Via MaxConsole]
