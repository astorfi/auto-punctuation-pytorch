This eliminates one of our two favorite plasma manufactures and leaves Panasonic with less competition. This is of course the size that competes head to head with LCD more than any other size. We can understand where Pioneer is coming from on this one, as the 42-inch market is all about value and we've seen a few big named manufactures getting away from low margin HDTVs. Pioneer will however continue to focus on panels 50-inch and larger, so don't worry, our beloved Kuro line isn't going anywhere.
