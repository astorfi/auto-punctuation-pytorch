With any luck a few more years of global warming will leave Antarctica fit for beach volleyball and we won't need
this sort of thing anymore, but a team at the Royal College of Art in London, in collaboration with the British
Antarctic Survey, have developed a new two-person vehicle dubbed "Ninety Degrees South" that's designed for exploring
the one continent that doesn't yet have a McDonalds. The Ninety Degrees South can operate on ice and snow without a
problem and also comes with a smaller GPS-controlled companion unit that's supposed to scout out the terrain up
ahead.
