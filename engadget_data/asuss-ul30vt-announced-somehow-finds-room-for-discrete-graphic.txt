Now the 30 is getting the discrete treatment, enabling users to choose from molasses rendering and "all-day computing" battery life or slightly more robust graphics and slightly (about an hour) shorter longevity. The system also packs DDR3 memory, a 1.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo SU7300 processor (able to be overclocked), and that "stylishly robust" aluminum lid. No word on release or price, but the earlier Vt models didn't come with a massive leap in MSRP, so we'd expect this one not to fall too far from UL30's $749 street price.
