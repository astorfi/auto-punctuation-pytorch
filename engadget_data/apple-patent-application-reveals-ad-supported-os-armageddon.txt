But sometimes they predict the product pipeline as did this application for what ultimately became Apple's new Magic Mouse. So seeing an Apple patent application for "Advertisement in Operating System" attributed to "Inventor" Steven Jobs himself is enough to send chills up the spine. The idea is to make the OS free or at a reduced cost, something Google knows a thing or two about. Unfortunately, the idea presented would offer "visual or audible" advertisements that "disables one or more functions while the advertisement is being presented." Ugh.
