Sony kicked off the initiative, but now has about 15 others playing along who have all managed to put aside their differences to finalize the specs on both the physical and connection layers. All they need now is hardware, and so starting today they're graciously asking for more members to join their consortium -- not that they would have turned you away yesterday. Still no sign of when actual devices using this technology will hit retail, but where there's a spec there's always a prototype.
