Given the site's track record with previous Apple component leaks like the white iPhone 4 and the unibody MacBook Pro enclosure, we're somewhat inclined to believe this is real, but we have no idea what it's for -- a new iPod nano? The next-gen Apple TV's remote control? Steve Jobs's dream watch? -- but we're definitely interested in finding out. One more pic showing the Apple label on the ribbon cable after the break.
