This brisk trip through the Xbox Live Arcade version of SotN follows "any %" rules (reach the end of the game by any means necessary, glitches included), and zooms through both the normal and inverted castles in an astounding 18 minutes and 20 seconds. Things to look for: lots of back-dashing, item-duplicating, and an unexpected use of the Heart Refresh item at the end of the game. Poor Dracula didn't stand a chance.
