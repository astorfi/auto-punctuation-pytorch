According to a report in Korea's Electronic Times, those oh so familiar "insiders" are fingering an October launch for the Samsung handset. It will apparently rock a 4.5-inch HD AMOLED display and a 1.5GHz dual core processor, which squares mighty nicely with previous reports. Of course, we'll believe it when we see it -- or at least an official announcement -- but for now, we're keeping the Ice Cream Sandwich dream alive.
