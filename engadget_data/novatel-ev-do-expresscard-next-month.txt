 We've still yet to hear of anysolid 3G ExpressCard device releases as yet (we were kind of hoping CTIA would have yielded at least one or two), butOm seems to have the scoop on a Novatel EV-DO ExpressCard 34 launch for May -- whose most obvious application right nowis, of course in Apple MacBook Pros. Granted, we wouldn't be inthis predicament if Apple had just followed through with internal integrated 3G like so many other laptop manufacturers,but hey, you've got what we've got, and we'll takes what we can gets. There's no way of knowing, however, when thecards will hit the market with Sprint or Verizon even if Novatel launches their card in May, so stay tuned.[Via TUAW, image via EVDOinfo]
