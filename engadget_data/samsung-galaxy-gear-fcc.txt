Granted, the picture we see above us would've been much more intriguing a couple days ago, prior to Samsung Unpacked, but it shows the Samsung SM-V700 (aka Galaxy Gear) getting the official stamp of approval by the FCC, which means it's one step closer to store shelves. The docs don't give us any juicy tidbits that we didn't already know -- essentially, the device has Bluetooth and not much else in the way of wireless connectivity -- but this doesn't come as a surprise for an already-announced gadget. Still, the Galaxy Gear's appearance in the FCC is at least a clear indication that things are going in the right direction, and folks in the US may see it closer to the September 25th launch date than they initially feared.
