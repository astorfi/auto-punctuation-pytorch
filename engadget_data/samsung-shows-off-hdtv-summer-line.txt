We got a peek at 'em, including their LN-S4696D, LN-S4096D, and LN-S3296D (priced at $4,000, $3,300, and $2,200), the  46, 40, and 32-inch versions of their 96 series of LCDs. The 40 and 46-inch models are 1080p sets, but all include USB 1.1 (huh?) and FireWire connections, and a 6000:1 contrast ratio. Also introduced were  their new 32-inch LN-S3251D, and 26-inch LN-S2652D and LN-S2651D LCDs, all with integrated ATSC, as well as their  67-inch HL-S6767W and 61-inch HL-S6165W 1080p DLP HDTVs. Dear lord, though, do we ever wish these companies would stop making their model numbers more arcane and difficult to remember than said models' serial numbers.
