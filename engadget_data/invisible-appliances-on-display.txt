The stylish dryer pictured above was just one of the appliances proudly displaying its innards at the National Electronics' Innovation Station exhibit in Japan recently, apparently making use of "natural dry air" to conserve energy (we're hoping that's not a roundabout way of saying it's a glorified plastic box). Also not shy to show off its contents was a transparent fridge (pictured after the break), which looks even more suspiciously non-functional but does provide plenty of space for your various beverages. No word on price or availability, naturally, although given the chances that they'll ever find their way over here, we wouldn't suggest that you hold off on any refrigerator / dryer purchases you've been planning.
