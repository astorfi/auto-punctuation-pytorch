After getting weirded out by some buggy behavior, then discovering that there were number differences between our version and the version shipping with new iPhone 3Gs, we got a little suspicious. Today, we noticed that the file which Apple made available for upgraders via iTunes sported a slimmer file size and separate designation (1,1 as opposed to the 1,2 of the previous iteration). The new version (supposedly the "official" version) is now available from Apple's servers -- so if you had any misgivings about that initial update, you can snag this and get a do-over. We've updated and restored on our phone, and we'll be honest -- it does seem a little bit snappier. Hit the read link for the file, and let us know if you notice any differences.[Via MacRumors]
