 Tonight is the season premiere of the 16th edition of Survivor on CBS, and yet again, its not ready for HDTV. We've gone so far as getting in-car NASCAR cameras in HD, but reality shows continue to lag behind. According to an interview with host Jeff Probst, CBS brass are still concerned about the cost, and that he's not in a big hurry to see himself in HD. C'mon CBS, if ESPN can put cameras in anything with wheels, surely you can trot a production crew out to the South Pacific or where ever, and bring some waterproof HD makeup for Jeff.
