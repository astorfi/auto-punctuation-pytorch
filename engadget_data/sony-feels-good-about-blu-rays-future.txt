 Some may question Blu-ray's future but not Sony. So much so that their Sony Digital Audio Disc Corp group is investing $75.8 million into their Terre Haute, IN manufacturing plant. Sony DADC has plans to retool this plant for Blu-ray disc production. Who knew that this format war was so healthy for the American worker but this plant employs 1,223 jobs and this expansion must be good for some type of pay increase. Sony must feel good about Blu-ray's future if they were going to drop that type of cash into the format - good thing Blu-ray has some dedicated fanboys.
