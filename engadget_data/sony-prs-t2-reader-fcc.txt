Sometimes our probes are met with full-on spec sheets and user manuals to peruse, while often we're greeted with a simple model name and number, and perhaps a hint of said wireless capabilities in a test report. That's what we have today -- most of the information available is listed in that product label above, including confirmation that we're looking at a Sony Reader with the model number PRS-T2. Additionally, the report reveals that the device will sport 802.11b/g/n WiFi (but not 3G), along with a microSD slot for external storage. For now, that's all we have to share, but you're welcome to do some digging of your own at the FCC link below.
