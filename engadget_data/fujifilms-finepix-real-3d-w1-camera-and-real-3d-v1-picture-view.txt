Some of more notable features on the W1 -- aside from being the touted "world's first 3D imagine system," of course -- is a 3x optical zoom, a 3D LCD system for on-camera viewing, Dual Capture Shooting Mode for taking two shots simultaneously with different settings, and just to be perfectly clear, the ability to shoot video in three mind-blowing dimensions. Additionally, the two lens can be used for some more creative, but decidedly old-fashioned 2D photography. As for the V1 display, it's got a 3D / 2D LCD panel with 800 x 600 resolution, supports playback of 3D pics and movies, and supports SD / SDHC. No word on what the resolution / card support is for the camera, but for now we're gonna guess it's at parity with the frame. If you're wanting physical 3D prints, Fujifilm says it'll be providing that service, doing the prints in-house and send them your way. Actual printers for purchase will come once a sustainable market exists (assuming that happens). The W1 camera and V1 frame are listed with a September 2009 launch date, as we previously heard -- price is curiously listed as TBA, but since Time already let slip a $600 estimate, take that as your ballpark estimate for the interim.
