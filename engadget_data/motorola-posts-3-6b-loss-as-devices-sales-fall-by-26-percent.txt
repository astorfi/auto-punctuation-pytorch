 Things just aren't getting any better for Motorola -- just weeks after the troubled phone manufacturer announced deep layoffs, it's revealing that it lost $3.6 billion dollars in the fourth quarter. The loss is mainly attributed to falling device sales: handsets were down 26 percent, and mobile devices total were down 51 percent. According to Motorola CEO Sanjay Jha, the answer for now is Android phones, which the company thinks will be more competitive than WinMo devices in 2009 -- and he interestingly said that Moto plans on continuing to make Windows Mobile devices because it thinks WinMo 7 will be a big deal when it comes out in 2010. That's the first time we've ever heard a date on WinMo 7, if you're keeping track -- and if it's right, it'll be the second time Jha's blown the lid on an upcoming version of Windows Mobile. Whoops! We'll be watching that one, but for now here's hoping Moto rights the ship with something like an Android-based SURF A3100 -- otherwise it may not even be around in 2010.
