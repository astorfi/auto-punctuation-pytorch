Maybe it's not yetchosen (or maybe they're just not revealing it), but no matter what its status, those images we saw before ofquestionable validity of the blue and yellow mockups have shown up on the OLPC site as "concept images,"nothing more. So yeah, at least they weren't too far off base (or completely fake). Frankly though, after all that Origami buzz we kind of think the OLPC is almost a more desirableand cost effective multipurpose handheldÂ  / ultramobile anyway. Besides, does the 3-hour battery life Origami havehand crank power or mesh network radios? We think not.[Thanks, Daniel]
