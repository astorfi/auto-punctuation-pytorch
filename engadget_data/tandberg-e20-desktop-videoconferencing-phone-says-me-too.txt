The company promises DVD-quality video (at 448P) in a fast, secure, and relatively affordable -- at least when compared to its massive telepresence systems -- package. The E20 is compatible with most IP phone and video services and also includes a 20kHz speaker phone, and -- perhaps most importantly -- a 10.6-inch widescreen LCD display with WXGA resolution. As far as speed, it's listed with SIP up to 1152 kbps. Priced at $1,499, Tandberg argues a couple of these are a lot cheaper than a business-class ticket for that meeting in Europe. Expect to see availability in early 2009.[Via InformationWeek]
