Cogs in the company's media machine are turning once again, as the company has posted a teaser press image on Facebook with confirmation that a launch is just three weeks away. It's difficult to read the tea leaves from the oblique shot we're given, although we already know that the Android 4.0 slate will support microSD, mini-HDMI and a connector for that Eee Pad Transformer-style keyboard dock. Our main questions now center on when the G10 xs pops up in the US as well as the degree of bang we'll get for our buck.
