As usual, much of the growth comes from pulling in new smartphone customers, who were among 882,000 new retail postpaid connections and who helped to bring Big Red's average revenue per user (ARPU) up to $54.89, which is 2.3 percent higher than the same quarter last year. We'll have to wait for the Q4 results to see any impact from the iPhone 4S or the new Droid RAZR, but, in the meantime, there are plenty of double-digits in Verizon's data revenue figures: it made $22.22 from each postpaid retail customer for data usage alone, which adds up to a 15.7 percent leap year-on-year. Read on for the full green-tinged breakdown in the PR.

With another strong showing by Verizon Wireless, and continued growth in FiOS and strategic business services, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) today reported third-quarter 2011 financial and operational results that keep the company on track to achieve its full-year earnings and revenue guidance. 		Verizon reported 49 cents in EPS in the quarter, compared with 23 cents per share in third-quarter 2010. 		Adjusted third-quarter 2011 earnings (non-GAAP) of 56 cents per share exclude 7 cents per share for a non-operational charge relating to a remeasurement, based on an actuarial valuation of pension plans. No adjustments were made for the previously announced $250 million (5 cents per share) negative impact in the quarter due to storm-related repair costs and a two-week strike affecting the Wireline segment. Comparable adjusted third-quarter 2010 earnings were 55 cents per share, excluding the impact of non-operational charges, the largest of which was related to pension and benefits remeasurements. 		Well-Positioned for 4Q and 2012 		"Verizon emerges from the third quarter in a strong position to accelerate growth," said Lowell McAdam, Verizon president and chief executive officer. "We faced significant challenges in recent months, yet delivered results that keep us on track to meet our 2011 earnings and revenue guidance, with great momentum expected entering 2012. We continue to grow revenues from strategic products and to increase free cash flow through improved operating performance and disciplined capital spending." 		McAdam added, "Verizon Wireless delivered impressive results across the board in the third quarter, and we are geared up for an even better fourth quarter, with new smartphones, tablets and data devices coming to market. In FiOS, we expect to capitalize on pent-up demand and deliver stronger growth in the fourth quarter. In enterprise, the integration of Terremark and recent acquisition of CloudSwitch have significantly improved our competitive positioning."		Verizon has targeted 2011 adjusted EPS growth of 5 percent to 8 percent from an adjusted base of $2.08 in EPS in 2010, and 2011 revenue growth of 4 percent to 8 percent on a comparable basis with 2010. 		Consolidated Revenue and Cash Flow Growth 		In third-quarter 2011, Verizon's total operating revenues were $27.9 billion on a consolidated basis, an increase of 5.4 percent compared with third-quarter 2010. Total operating expenses were $23.3 billion, an increase of 0.7 percent. 		Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the quarter totaled $8.8 billion, up 19.2 percent year over year. 		Cash flow from operating activities totaled $21.5 billion in the first nine months of 2011, and capital expenditures totaled $12.5 billion -- on track to meet the company's full-year guidance of $16.5 billion. From the $9.0 billion in free cash flow (non-GAAP, cash flow from operations less capex) over the first nine months, Verizon has paid $4.1 billion in dividends to shareholders, and in September the Verizon Board of Directors approved a dividend increase for the fifth consecutive year. 		Verizon Wireless Delivers Strong Results 		In third-quarter 2011, Verizon Wireless again delivered strong growth in revenues, retail customers and other connections, driven by increased smartphone penetration and increased retail postpaid ARPU (average monthly service revenue per user).

Verizon Wireless was also named a Small Business Influencer Champion for 2011 by Small Business Trends and SmallBizTechnology.com. 		FiOS, Strategic Services Transform Wireline Revenue Mix 		Revenues and customers continued to increase for FiOS fiber-optic services, and sales of strategic services to business customers remained strong -- countering the adverse impacts to Verizon's Wireline segment in third-quarter 2011. FiOS and strategic services continued to become a larger percentage of the wireline revenue mix. 		Wireline Financial Highlights 		• Third-quarter 2011 operating revenues were $10.1 billion, a decline of 1.3 percent compared with third-quarter 2010. Consumer revenues grew 1.1 percent compared with third-quarter 2010.		• Consumer ARPU for wireline services was $94.20 in third-quarter 2011, up 8.8 percent compared with third-quarter 2010.

International revenue, which makes up approximately 15 percent of global enterprise, grew 9.8 percent year over year.		• Segment EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $2.2 billion in the quarter, including the $250 million impact from the storms and strike. This compares with $2.3 billion in third-quarter 2010. As a result, segment EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) was 21.4 percent in third-quarter 2011, compared with 22.7 percent in third-quarter 2010.

With the clearing of FiOS installation backlogs caused by the storms and strike, Verizon expects to add at least 200,000 FiOS Internet and 200,000 FiOS TV customers in fourth-quarter 2011.		• FiOS penetration (subscribers as a percentage of potential subscribers) continued to increase. FiOS Internet penetration was 35 percent at the end of third-quarter 2011, compared with 31 percent at the end of third-quarter 2010.

Total voice connections, which measures FiOS Digital Voice connections in addition to traditional switched access lines, declined 7.6 percent to 24.5 million -- the smallest year-over-year decline since fourth-quarter 2006.		• During the quarter Verizon continued to aggressively execute its global cloud strategy, expanding its portfolio of secure IT solutions and acquiring CloudSwitch, which will enable Verizon to boost industry adoption by simplifying the move to the enterprise cloud. Multinational companies including ARINC adopted Verizon enterprise cloud services during the quarter. In addition, enterprise customers including RWE of Germany, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Plunkett & Cooney Inc. and Smile Brands Inc. completed new agreements for a wide range of strategic advanced communications and information technology solutions.		• Verizon also continued to broaden the scope and capabilities of its global network infrastructure. The company completed the integration of Terremark data centers in Florida and Virginia with Verizon's Global IP network; activated its first 100 gigabit-per-second network route in the United States; expanded its 100G capabilities in Europe; and completed deployment of advanced network equipment on its global network in Singapore and Sydney.
