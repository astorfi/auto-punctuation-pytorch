Panasonic's taken to the stage at CES and has just revealed the VIERA Life+ Screen in an effort to "redefine what a 21st Century TV should be." Televisions under this banner are kitted out with Xbox One-like facial recognition that will display information relevant to users on an "Info Bar" relegated to the lower part of the screen. Voice recognition has also been baked into the set along with a feature called "myStream" that helps you keep favorite channels organized. And of course, it wouldn't be 2014 without social integration, particularly content sharing and Facebook notifications. When it comes to picture quality, the line of sets shown off today boasts a 4K LED display (which is said to look just as good as the company's old plasma tech) and will come in 58 to 65 inches when it arrives this year, with an 85-inch -- the firm's first LED TV of that size -- joining it later in 2014. Even if you aren't in the market for a UHD TV, every one of the outfit's 4K and 1080p sets fresh out this year will have the VIERA Life+ Screen moniker attached.
