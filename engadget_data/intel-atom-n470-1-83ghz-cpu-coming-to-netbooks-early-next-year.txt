In addition to the N450 1.66GHz system-on-a-chip due to hit the streets in early 2010, Intel is said to be releasing the N470, which will run along at a cool 1.83GHz and sport a 667MHz FSB, hyperthreading support, and a TDP of 6.5 watts (which, considering you won't need a separate graphics controller, is none too shabby). It really makes the whole concept of microprocessor without its own graphics seem a little 2009, doesn't it? Not a bad deal all around -- provided this thing comes in at a decent price point it's sure to put a smile on the face of netbook manufacturers and consumers alike. But NVIDIA? Not so much.
