If you haven't started thinking about next year's CES yet, Daimler AG has beat you to the punch. Not only will Mercedes Benz CEO Dr. Dieter Zetsche be delivering a keynote about autonomous vehicle tech and its greater impacts, but he's going to debut a new concept vehicle too, according to the Consumer Electronics Association. Considering the the topic of his speech and the fact that Mercedes has been showing off a semi-truck with a pretty impressive auto-pilot system for the past year or so, it isn't much of a stretch to guess this new ride will be at least semi-autonomous. Don't want to miss his address? Set a calendar reminder for 8 p.m. Pacific, January 5th, 2015 at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. Or, you know, you could always come back here where we'll be covering the show from the ground. It's up to you!
