Maybe you're tired of that whole LCD thing, maybe you're really into pleats. Either way, you can don the A-Nerve
sleeve accessory that notifies you of incoming SMS by changing the pattern of pleats in the fabric. They say you can
recognize who the sender is by the pattern, which gives you an alternative to doling out AC/DC's greatest ringtone hits
amongst your contacts for differentiation purposes. If you respond by flattening the pleats after an incoming message,
the A-Nerve sends a corresponding text back to the sender that says, and we quote, "i call you back." This, in case you
missed it, is a more "subtle and intimate way" of doing SMS. That's cool â€” we'll be over here in the corner with our
brute force T9 method, regardless.
