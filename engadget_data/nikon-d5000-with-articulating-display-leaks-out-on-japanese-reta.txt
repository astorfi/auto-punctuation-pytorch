Apart from the movable screen, it looks like the D5000 will be a pretty hot blend of the D60 and D90, complete with D-movie mode, 11-point AF system, and ISO 3200 sensitivity, all for a body-only price of Â¥76,320 ($762). Whether or not that pricing will make it to the US and tempt would-be Canon T1i buyers right out of their shoes remains to be seen -- we'll let you know as soon as we find out.[Via Electronista]
