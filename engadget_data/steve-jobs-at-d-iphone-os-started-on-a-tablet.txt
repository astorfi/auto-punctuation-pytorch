When asked by Walt why they originally put their new OS on a phone and not a tablet, Steve said, "I'll tell you a secret. It began with the tablet." After working on the tablet OS which had a glass display and multitouch, another idea occurred to Jobs. "My God, I said, this would make a great phone ... so we shelved the tablet and built the iPhone." And there you have it.
