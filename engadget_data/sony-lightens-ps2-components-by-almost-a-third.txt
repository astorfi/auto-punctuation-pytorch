 Unlike Microsoft, which dropped the original Xbox in favor of the Xbox 360 in manner similar to Paris Hilton dropping her old cellphone, Sony has continued to maintain the PlayStation 2. Somehow, Sony has managed to make a new iteration of the PS2 that decreases the console's weight by almost a third: they've trimmed the console itself down to 600 grams from 900 grams, and the power adapter to 250 grams from 350 grams. The external design of the console is unchanged, but the lower weight and the new components should decrease production and shipping costs. Not bad for an old console that continues to sell well (and sell for more than the value of its components, at that).
