They're also saying that the phone will be dubbed the Xperia X8 at retail, a name that probably makes sense considering that the 3-inch Android phone is clearly designed to slot in below the high-end X10. Beyond that, we still don't have much to go on -- pricing, availability, target markets, and so on -- so we'll just hang out here on the edge of our seats for a while longer, or until we're distracted once again by the X10 mini pro's mind-numbing cuteness.
