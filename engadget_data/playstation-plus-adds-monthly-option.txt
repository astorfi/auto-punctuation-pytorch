PlayStation Plus offers do come around every now and then, but Sony has just announced a more permanent addition to the service: the option of a $10 (or 7 euro) monthly membership to supplement the regular 90-day and annual subscriptions. The lack of commitment comes at quite a price, given that the longer contracts bring the the effective monthly cost down to $6 and $4 respectively, but it may still make sense for flighty types. Anyway, once you're in, you'll find a secondary, time-limited offer: an annual Music Unlimited Premium subscription for $42 (42 euros), which is okay, but nowhere near the discount offered in 2012. Those who remain outside of Sony's inner circle can also temporarily get 12 months of Music Unlimited for $60, or half of the usual cost. Lastly, a few more E3 crumbs: the PlayStation Network is now officially called "PSN", which is pretty much what we called it anyway, and PlayStation Plus also gets a new logo (shown after the break, not that it's especially shocking.), reflecting reflect its heightened status in the PS4 era
