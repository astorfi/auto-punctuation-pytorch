 In a move sure to excite both business travelers and wandering geeks, Qualcomm announced earlier this weekthat it expects to ship chips for high-speed world phones by the end of this year. Handsets with the new Qualcommchipsets will be able to access both EV-DO services on CDMA networks as well as W-CDMA-powered GSM UMTS networks,effectively allowing for 3G connections almost anywhere in the world. Even customers not willing to shell out the bigbucks that these first models will cost will still benefit from the new chips, as prices on current-gen 2G and 2.5Gworld phones will drop accordingly as a result of their new mid-tier market status.
