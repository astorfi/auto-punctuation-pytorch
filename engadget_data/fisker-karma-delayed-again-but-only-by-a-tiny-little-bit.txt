Last we heard from Roger Ormisher, Fisker Automotive's Communications chief, the electric supercar was set to debut in the US during the June / July timeframe, but that's now been nudged that extra bit later, with "the first" dealer demonstration vehicles and customer orders landing firmly in July. So, you'll have to keep stashing that $95,900 under your mattress for a little while longer, but look on the bright side: Fisker's delays are getting shorter all the time!
