Now, it looks like the company's codified that promise in this allegedly leaked German roadmap. Spotted by a tipster at the Xperia X10 Blog at IFA 2010 in Berlin, the document describes a 720p video recording mode (with continuous autofocus) for the Xperia X10 alone, plus Facebook and Twitter contacts integration, an HTML5-compliant browser and five homescreen pages for the entire Xperia series with the release of Android 2.1. There's also a separate "2.1x" release after that to bring the two 'scapes up to snuff, and it seems the Xperia X8's being bundled with the mini and mini pro as far as updates go. There's sadly no mention of Android 2.2, but we wouldn't yet count it out -- for all we know, the very next page of that leaflet could be oozing delicious frozen yogurt all over these phones.
