The key bit of kit in the forthcoming accessory, it seems, is the IDG-600 multi-axis MEMS rate gyroscope, which InvenSense describes as a "truly disruptive technology" that boasts just the right combination of manufacturing and performance advantages to make it ideal for Nintendo's purposes. InvenSense also says that it has already begun shipping to Nintendo in mass production quantities, which is certainly assuring, if unsurprising.
