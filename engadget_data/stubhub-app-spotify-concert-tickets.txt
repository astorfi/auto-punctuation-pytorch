Just in time for the summer concert season, Spotify's launching a StubHub app to give fans of sweaty, cramped music venues (indoor and out) quick ticket access. Starting today, Spotify users in the US and UK will be able to access the free app using App Finder to search upcoming concert schedules by location and purchase tickets through provided StubHub links. It's pretty basic stuff, but if you're the impulsive type, this mini-app could be the best thing for your social life and the worst for your wallet.
