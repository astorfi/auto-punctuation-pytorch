       It looks like CU500 shoppers may want to hold off for just a few days. Cases, cables, chargers, and other knickknacks for LG's latest hunk of 3G love for AT&T -- the shiny CU575 -- are said to be arriving in stores as we speak, suggesting that a release probably isn't too far off. Stay tuned![Thanks, anonymous tipster]Update: Looks like the CU575's government name will be "Trax." Music theme, anyone?Update 2: We may be looking at a launch as soon as tomorrow, July 17. We'll keep you updated.
