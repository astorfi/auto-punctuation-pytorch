 Intel just confirmed its 4th generation Intel Core Processors at its press conference at CES. They'll run on as little as 10W and are designed to enable thinner devices thanks to smaller cooling systems. These are the very same 22nm Haswell chips we've been hearing about since late last year, and Intel promises they'll represent one of the largest generational leaps in battery life in the firm's history. In fact, it's already shown off a reference design for a 17mm-thick Haswell hybrid laptop, aka North Cape, nestled amidst other goodies that you can catch up with in our liveblog.
