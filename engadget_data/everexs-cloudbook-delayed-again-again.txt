 Oh Cloudbook -- it's like you just keep floating off on us. We all thought Everex's little Eee competitor was going to drop today (the 15th), but since that turned out to be a bust, we started to get curious. As you might have guessed, the $399 UMPC has been ever-so-slightly delayed, again, this time until February 21st (or so they say). We've covered an unboxing if you're really jonesing for a look at the gOS-sporting device -- but keep in mind you could ruin that x-mas-morning feeling of wonderment when you pop open the box.[Thanks, Travis]
