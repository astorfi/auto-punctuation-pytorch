And some, like the TZ4 and TZ5, offer pretty compelling features, such as a relatively monstrous 10x optical zooms in a relatively pocketable form factor. For the full list of models in the gallery below, which run the gamut from 8.1 to 10.1 megapixels, be sure to check out the official announcement post from a few days back.
