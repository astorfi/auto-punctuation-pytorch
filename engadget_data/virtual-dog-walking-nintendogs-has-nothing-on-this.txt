TOKYOMANGO recently spotted this dog walking game, which has been around for a few years, and puts a virtual pet's life in your hands. To walk the dog, you have to maintain a good speed -- not too fast, not too slow -- while keeping the idiot mutt from getting hit by oncoming traffic or the neighborhood bully dog. The result for failure? The dog dies, and you get to blow some more yen on this oh-so-stimulating form of entertainment.
