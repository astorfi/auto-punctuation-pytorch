Looks like Toshiba's serious about the 20-ounce pocket projector we
peeped a couple of months ago. The specs are now out on
what is officially known as the TDP-FF1A, and it looks like this one could be, er, handy. To keep power consumption
down, the projector uses an LED, and Toshiba rates it at 18 watts — not exactly something that will light up a room,
but a bulb that could make this adequate for presentations in small offices. Battery life is rated at about 2 hours on
a charge; not surprisingly, the battery weighs about as much as the projector itself, so be prepared to double your
weight calcs if you're planning on doing on-the-go presentations. The projector — expected to retail for about $800 —
also has the ability to display JPEGs directly from a USB thumb drive, making it possible to give PC-free presentations
(if you're willing to give up all of your fancy PowerPoint transitions, that is).
