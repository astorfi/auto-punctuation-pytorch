 Google updated its YouTube app for Android back in November to allow for pairing with TVs equipped with Google TV, and it looks we'll soon be seeing quite a few more sets ready to work with your smartphone or tablet. The company confirmed today that new TVs from Bang & Olufsen, LG, Panasonic and Sony will be making their debut at CES, with additional sets and set-top boxes coming from Philips, Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba, Vizio, Western Digital and others over the course of 2013. In related news, Google's announced that its new UI for YouTube on TV -- previously seen on the Wii U and PlayStation 3 -- will also be featured on those new devices, offering full 1080p videos and a fairly minimalist interface. You can check out a quick video of how the pairing works after the break.
