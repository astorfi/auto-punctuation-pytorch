 One thing we have no problem giving thanks for is new HDTVs, and there should be even more of those on the way as Samsung is expanding its brand new eight-generation LCD plant. Even though Sony and Samsung split the bill to build the 8G facility that cranks out 46- and 52-inch panels, they apparently couldn't reach an agreement and Samsung is handling the re-investment on its own, to the tune of $2.21 billion. No word on that proposed 11G line, but we have a 70-inch space on our wall just waiting to be filled.
