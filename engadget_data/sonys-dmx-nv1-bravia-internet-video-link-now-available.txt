Well apparently the $299.99 units have hit stores, and are now available for your purchasing pleasure. If you'll recall, the pricey boxes allow you to stream internet video, music, and light content (like weather and traffic) into your television via the company's familiar Xross Media Bar interface. Of course, you'll be dropping a pretty big chunk of change on something with fairly limited use, but hey... it's your money.[Via Zatz Not Funny!]
