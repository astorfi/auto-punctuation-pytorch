That's why the company has just announced Nubia, which apparently means "cloudy" in Latin. It's also teased details of the first handset to arrive under this new cloud (geddit?), the Z5. This new 5-inch smartphone will have quad-core internals, a 13-megapixel camera and "Italian" design -- which makes us hope above hope that they hired Pininfarina and it'll come in Ferrari Red.
