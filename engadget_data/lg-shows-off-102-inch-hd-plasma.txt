Matching hometown rival Samsung inch-for-inch, LG is
now showing a 102-inch plasma display, which the company says offers full HD resolution at 1920 x 1080, with a contrast
ratio of 5000:1. Don't expect to buy one anytime soon, though. It's being displayed at the Korea Electronics Show, and
no announcements have been made about actually making this a production model.
