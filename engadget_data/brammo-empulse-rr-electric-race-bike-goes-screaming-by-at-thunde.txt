The bike and its crew were out for some testing, abbreviated tail all taped full of telemetry and spitting back data as the it quietly screamed its way around the track. The race-ready Empulse RR is getting ready for the 2011 TTXGP series for electric race bikes, where it'll be competing against the likes of the Mission R -- which hopefully will have put its fairings back on by then.
