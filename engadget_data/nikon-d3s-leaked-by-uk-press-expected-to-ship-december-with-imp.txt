You don't have to tell the British Journal of Photography, who today published an article dated for tomorrow (oops!) all about its time with the as-of-yet unannounced D3s. So what can we glean from this report? For starters, standard ISO settings go as high as 12,800 (low is 200) and can be further boosted to an incredulous 102,400. The 12 megapixel DSLR also touts a 720p 24 frames per second HD video capture mode, and as far as price and release date are concerned, look for it this December, at least in the UK, for Â£4200 (about $6,685 in US). Nikon Rumors is expecting an official announcement from tonight, so perhaps we won't be waiting too long -- in the meantime, that site's also hosting pics of the camera supposedly in the wild doing a photoshoot in Barcelona. Enjoy!
