 We guess we all knew this was coming, granted, but it's still a sad day whenever you see another carrier fall to the dreaded "unlimited" ambiguity syndrome. Following Verizon's and AT&T's leads, Sprint is the latest to declare that unlimited does not, in fact, mean unlimited when it comes to data card usage -- it turns out that 5GB should be quite enough for you, apparently. Taking a page out of their rivals' books, Sprint "reserves the right to limit throughput speeds or amount of data transferred and to deny, terminate, modify, or suspend service" if that soft cap is violated (or you exceed 300MB of data while roaming) once their Terms of Service are modified on July 13. TOS modifications are famously ripe opportunities for escaping out of contracts, so if this leaves a bad taste in your mouth, feel free to try to get out in a couple months -- not to say there's hardly any carrier out there that's friendlier to heavy data users at this point.[Thanks, Croft]
