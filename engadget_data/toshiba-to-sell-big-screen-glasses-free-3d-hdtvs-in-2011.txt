Today at CES, executives have reportedly stated that the company will be kicking things into high gear for 2011. It'll be showcasing 56- and 65-inch prototypes here in the desert (and a 4K one at that), and according to Reuters, it'll "probably launch two models, one over 40-inches and another over 50-inches." Atsushi Murasawa, Toshiba's head of visual products, even cleared up the distribution question: "These will not only be for the Japanese market, but also America, Europe and China." Sadly, no details were given surrounding eventual prices and release dates, but we'll see if we can't coerce someone into spilling a few more beans here in a moment.

Update: We were able to grab someone here at the show, and were told a more realistic date of "end of fiscal year," which could mean into early 2012 before consumers can bust out their credit cards.
