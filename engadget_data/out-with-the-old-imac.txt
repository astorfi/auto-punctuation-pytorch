Somewhat fittingly given today's news, I was walking
down Orchard Street yesterday afternoon when I spied these two girls jumping up and down on an original iMac someone
had thrown away (we've seen a lot of broken and obsolete computer gear tossed out on the street in our day, but this
was the first time we'd ever seen an iMac). Anyway, not only did it not seem at all weird to them that I would pull a
cameraphone out of my pocket to snap a pic, one of the girls even asked me if I was using a Treo (she'll actually be
guest-editing Engadget next week).
