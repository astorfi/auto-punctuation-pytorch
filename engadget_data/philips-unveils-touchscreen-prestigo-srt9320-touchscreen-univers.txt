The company's new top-of-the-line IR-only clicker has a 2.8-inch color touchscreen and can be programmed to control up to 20 devices entirely from the remote itself without using a PC -- which can be a blessing or a curse, depending on your setup and macro situation. It's all yours for $249 sometime in the first quarter of twenty-oh-nine.[Via Electronista]
