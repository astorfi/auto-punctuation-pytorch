The world of competitive gaming revolves around young players, but it's not always easy for them to participate -- many of them are college students without the resources to host large tournaments. They'll soon get a helping hand from Blizzard, however. The StarCraft II developer is now promising support for college gaming groups that are part of the The eSports Association (TeSPA); as groups get larger, Blizzard will offer increasing amounts of cash, in-game bonuses and promo material. Groups with over 200 members will even get special guests. While the move is no doubt meant to sell more games, it could also create a stronger eSports community that nurtures rookies until they're ready to hit the big leagues.
