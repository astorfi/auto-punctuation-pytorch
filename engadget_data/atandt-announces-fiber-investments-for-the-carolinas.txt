Aside from bringing U-verse to more of the southeast, the telco is also hoping to provide some 4,400 jobs in the Carolinas, and while we'd certainly love to mark down a launch date, one can only guess at this point as to when the first rollouts will occur. Notably, a lot depends on the smoothness of the Atlanta IPTV launch, which is slated to occur before the year's end, but for those frustrated by current cable offerings, looming competition is never a bad thing.[Via TheWolfWeb]
