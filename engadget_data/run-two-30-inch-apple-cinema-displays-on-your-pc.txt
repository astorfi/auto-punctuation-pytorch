This goes out to the reverse switchers among you, who want to set up those two 30-inch Apple Cinema Displays you
happen to have lying around (don't we all?) to work with your Windows machine. This guide explains everything you'll
need, including which obscure graphics cards will support this configuration and a step-by-step of how to get it all
going, which isn't quite as easy as plug and play. When you're done, you'll have so much freakin' screen real estate
you'll be able to rent some out.
