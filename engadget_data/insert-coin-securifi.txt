 In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line. 
 We've been talking about Securifi's Almond router a fair amount, since the new year rolled around. Darren put the thing through its paces, just after the company announced plans to release its successor -- or, rather, plans to Kickstart the followup. As of this morning, the crowdfunding push has landed. The Taipei-based company launched the Kickstarter page for the next generation of its beloved touchscreen router.

 The latest version, which we had the opportunity to play around with at CES, features a 2.8-inch display, as before, but adds some much welcomed additions, including support for 802.11ac, Zigbee and Z-Wave. The former promises a WiFi speed bump, the latter two bring the promise of extended home automation. Speaking of home automation, the Almond+ lets you control things like security alerts, heating and light control on the go with your iOS or Android device.

 Securifi's currently working toward a $250,000 goal, and has some solid prizes to offer up. Those who pledge $95 or more will get the $99 router, along with free shipping. Pledging at $129 will get you one of a number of Kickstarter exclusive colors. Those winning routers are set to ship around September.



 Previous project update: At last look, the Pinoccio microprocessor is well on its way to becoming a real device, with around $44,000 pledged of its $63,000 goal, with a full 22 days left to get in on the action.
