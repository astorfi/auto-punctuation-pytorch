(In ceramic white, no less!) It's nothing you haven't already seen here on Engadget, but feel free to inspect the package porn in the gallery below, letting waves of envy wash over you as that Â¥5,500 ($50 US) burns a hole in your pocket. But hey, no reason to get too worked up, after all what possible need could your next-gen PlayStation have for the hottest "last-gen" feature on the block?
