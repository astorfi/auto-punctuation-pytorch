Overall, it seems the presentation was impressive, including a 58-inch Panasonic plasma, Blu-ray player and a Yamaha surround sound system. Tyler liked the demo -- which included a few movies not even avaialble on Blu-ray like, Cars, Ratatouille , and Meet the Robinsons -- but couldn't help but laugh when they plugged Monster HDMI cables. We don't know about anyone else, but we'd rather seem them release more movies, than to go on tour.
