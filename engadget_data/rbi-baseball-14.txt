The MLB recently dropped a bombshell: One of the most beloved baseball games of all time, R.B.I. Baseball for the NES, is getting an update. It's coming to current and next-gen consoles in addition to mobile devices, and given the span of time between now and its vague spring 2014 release window, it being a downloadable arcade title seems likely. The game's webpage doesn't offer much by way of details, but according to Joystiq it's being developed internally by Major League Baseball Advanced Media -- the division responsible for WWE's streaming channel, MLB.tv and At Bat. Sure, it probably won't stand toe-to-toe with Sony's MLB: The Show franchise, but, for non-PlayStation gamers it's the only real option for a virtual home run.
