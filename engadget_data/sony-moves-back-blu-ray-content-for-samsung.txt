Toshiba delayed launching their first volley of HD DVD players until there was some content to play on thethings, but today Sony Pictures Home Entertainment confirmed the opposite. They're postponing launching their contentuntil Samsung'sbelated BD-P1000 first hits stores in late June, so as to "better coincide with the first commerciallyavailable Blu-ray-compatible hardware." Gee, this sounds so much like Toshiba's delay to "synchronize thelaunch of our players with HD DVD title releases" that we're starting to think the thing these two camps are bestat synchronizing is their pattern of delays to be tit for tat. So to those hoping to snag some Blu-ray titles forstaring at listlessly while their players are being manufactured and shipped from Korea will have to find other, lesscapacious data mediums into which they'll cast their gaze.
