 It's not just Japan that's ending production of the PlayStation 2, apparently. Sony tells The Guardian that production is over on a worldwide scale. Of course, it shouldn't be too hard to find one anytime soon, as Sony says over 150 million units are already out in the wild. Of course, the first production run of Sony's PlayStation 3 also included full PS2 backwards compatibility, so that number's magnified even more. And then there's always the possibility that Sony will eventually put many (or most) of its PlayStation 2 games online in some form. Regardless, it's a sad day for Sony's most popular console, and we're pouring out a cold one for the console that helped birth modern gaming. We'll miss ya, dude. It was a good run.
