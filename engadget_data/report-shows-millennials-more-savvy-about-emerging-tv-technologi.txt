Reportedly, just 31-percent of millennials (primarily in the 18 - 34 media target) found "new television technologies" to be complicated versus 55-percent of baby boomers. Furthermore, nearly half of those in the former category use their DVR regularly while just a quarter of boomers do so. Humorously enough, a staggering 87-percent of the millennials surveyed said that they "regularly fast-forward through commercials," and we can certainly raise our glasses to that. Laugh while you still can, young ones -- one day you'll be calling your kids to get the remote working with your 19-year old BD-UP5000.[Image courtesy of Chris's Picasa Gallery]
