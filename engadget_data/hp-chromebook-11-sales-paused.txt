If you were looking to nab up one of HP's latest Chromebooks for that special someone this holiday season, you might have to wait a bit. The laptop maker and Google decided to "pause" sales of the Chromebook 11 that made its debut last month "after receiving a small number of user reports that some chargers included with the device have been damaged due to over-heating during use." In a statement to The Verge, the duo confirmed reports that Best Buy had pulled the device from shelves. HP and Google also recommend those customers that have already taken the leap discontinue use of the included charger immediately in favor of a "Underwriters Laboratories-listed micro-USB charger" that came with a smartphone or tablet. Hopefully a quick fix is in order, because despite a sticky trackpad and the limitations of Chrome OS, we thought the $279 HP model was worthy of consideration after our review.
