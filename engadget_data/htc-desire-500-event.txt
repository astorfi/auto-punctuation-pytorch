Despite HTC launching the Desire 200 and Desire 600 earlier this year, it looks like there's still a bit of room left for the Desire family to grow. According to an invitation we've just received from the anxious Taiwanese smartphone maker, it'll be launching a device called the Desire 500 next week, on July 23rd. The text in the invite has the slogan "Energy of the young, imagination of the boundless," which makes us think this might be a lower-end device targeted at first-time smartphone owners. We saw a leaked document from a European operator referencing the Desire 500 earlier this month, so this phone may very well launch outside of Asia. If it doesn't, though, we'd happily settle for a Butterfly s.
