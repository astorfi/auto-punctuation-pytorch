Apart from hints at an OLED screen, we don't much about the specific hardware, but Joe also showed off a slide of the WP7S minimum requirements, so we can tell you it has at least 256MB of RAM and 8GB of flash, as well as DirectX9 acceleration. We're due to meet with Joe in just a few, so we'll obviously dig for more -- stay tuned!
