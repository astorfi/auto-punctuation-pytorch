Remember when the FCC said that it'd be studying the best way to monitor mobile broadband speeds? A year (and a new chairman) later and it's finally come to a conclusion: an Android app. According to the Wall Street Journal, the commission will launch FCC Speed Test next Thursday, with the aim of getting users to test their speeds in order to crowdsource accurate data nationwide. We're excited to see if the truth stands up to the advertising, but we do wonder if Tom Wheeler couldn't have just nicely asked Ookla for a peek at its Speedtest.net database.
