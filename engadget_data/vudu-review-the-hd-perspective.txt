Whether or not that name is positive one, however, is most certainly up for debate. Soon after launching at $399, reviews came pouring in that seemed to harmoniously shout "meh," but we still had hope for it. Upon speaking with company representatives at CEDIA, we knew that potential was still untapped at its coming out party -- the only question was how much support would it get from studios when pleading for their precious content in high-definition. Needless to say, garnering said backing still seems to be an uphill battle, but we managed to wrap our paws around the now-$295 device and put it through the paces that we HD junkies care about. Follow us after the break for the full spill, won't you?
      

 

For those still unaware, VUDU began pushing out its v1.2 software to owners on the final day of last month, and merely 24 hours later, we had our first glimpse at the (admittedly underwhelming, but quickly expanding) HD movie library. As of the time that this article was published, we found some 86 high-definition flicks listed, though not all of them were accessible immediately.UnboxingUpon unwrapping the VUDU, hastily scanning the instructions for anything out of the ordinary, and plugging in our HDMI and optical audio cables, we were greeted with a simple, albeit well laid out home screen. Unfortunately, we were forced to stare at said home screen for half an hour before a technical representative walked us through the steps to re-pair the remote with the box. Granted, we're chalking the mishap up to having a very early production unit, but still, this isn't exactly the way you want to start off your experience with a device that truthfully has little value if it can't provide instant gratification.
