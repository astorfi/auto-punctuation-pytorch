Yes, there arenumerous -- almost uncountable, in fact -- mentions made of future iPods (including, of course, the "2nd gen videoiPod"), and an interesting tidbit that we're once more seeing recycled about an Apple "iPhone with possibleVMO model [that] could launch later this year." Not that any of this is surprising to us (or to anyone who's beenfollowing Apple on Engadget for the last, oh, two years) but we're getting appropriately bored withthe "suspense." Apple: care to pull the trigger on these products already? We're getting a mite tired of thekind of mild iPod (with video) and Motorola (with iTunes) product toe-dipping you've been doing, eh?
