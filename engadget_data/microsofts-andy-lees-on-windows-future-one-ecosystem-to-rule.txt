Windows Phone head honcho Andy Lees -- who said that we won't be seeing WP7 on tablets during Microsoft's Worldwide Partner Conference yesterday -- still sees slates, phones, consoles, and PCs playing together in perfect harmony. His plan is to provide users with a consistent experience across all Microsoft-powered devices, though he didn't flesh out exactly how this singular ecosystem will work. Given recent evidence indicating Xbox integration in Windows 8 and the UI similarities between the forthcoming desktop OS and WP7, it seems that Microsoft is well on its way to a consolidated future. But, only time will tell if Mr. Lees' can deliver us from fragmentation with a unified Windows.
