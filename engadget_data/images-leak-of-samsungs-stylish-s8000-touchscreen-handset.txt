We get the feeling this so-called S8000 was already shown to us in that now-famous slide of Sammy's upcoming lineup, but the whole "blur factor" kept us from really keying in on it. At any rate, we're really feeling the style presented here, and despite the fact that we know absolutely nothing about its specifications (save for the flash-equipped 5MP camera), we definitely want to hold one. Check the read link for a few more (amazingly clear) looks.
