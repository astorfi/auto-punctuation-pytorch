ViewSonic has revealed its latest Android phone, the V430 -- though you'd be hard pressed to tell who made it from looks alone. Putting the incognito design aside, vital statistics include a meaty WVGA 4.3-inch screen, and a 5 megapixel primary camera paired with a VGA front-facing camera, all chugging along on a 1GHz Snapdragon processor. ViewSonic has cut down to only three buttons below the screen, a change from the four-button setup we've seen on its previous Android tablets and phones. Sadly, the Android version number has been similarly reduced -- the V430 is apparently running Android 2.2, not the Android 2.3 Gingerbread deliciousness we've come to expect from Google-powered smartphones in 2011. The V430 looks set on launching first in Russia, but no word yet on whether it'll board the Trans-Siberian across to Europe and beyond. Price is also Russian secret.
