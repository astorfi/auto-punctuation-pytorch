Every now and again, Google likes to give something back to Chromecast owners. In July, it celebrated the streaming dongle's first birthday by offering a free 90-day subscription to Google Play Music All Access, but now it's now decided to provide UK streamers with more of a visual treat. If you head on over to Google's Chromecast Offers site right now, you'll be offered a free three month Entertainment Pass for Now TV, allowing you to stream all 13 of Sky's pay TV channels live or on-demand. Sky's streaming service hasn't been available on the Chromecast all that long, so now might be the time to see what it's all about.
