 Scott Wilkinson of The Perfect Vision was testing out his demo Samsung Blu-ray player and was surprised by the poor PQ, especially compared to the Blu-ray demos he had seen in the past. A few calls later and Samsung engineers determined that the noise-reduction circuit in the player's Genesis scaler chip was enabled, causing the picture to soften significantly. Wow, how could this happen and could it really be this simple to resolve the poor reviews from Blu-ray? Talk about getting off on the wrong foot. Samsung plans to resolve the problem in future units and as well as release a firmware update for existing owners. via [High-Def DVD Digest]
