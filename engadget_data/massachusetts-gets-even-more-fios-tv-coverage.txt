As if The Bay State really needed any more love from Verizon (okay, so we're envious), consumers in Waltham and Sherborn now have access to its fiber-optic television service. The new additions have made FiOS TV available to some 20,000 more households, and it bumps the amount of Massachusetts communities it's available in to 60. Oh, and just in case it wasn't apparent -- Verizon is "currently negotiating with several other communities in [the state] to obtain additional franchises."
