In case you missed it, Sony's own smartphone-pairing wearable got a refresh earlier this year, and it's about ready to take America. The SmartWatch 2 launches today, and you can order one for yourself over at Sony's dedicated store. There's no camera, but there is a 1.6-inch "transflective" screen, compatibility with Gmail, Facebook, SMS, Twitter and easy NFC pairing with any smartphone running Android 4.0 or above. If you don't already have such a phone... well, look at that, both the waterproof Xperia Z1 (HSPA+, $670) and the titanic Xperia Z Ultra (HSPA+: $649.99, LTE: $679.99) will also be up for grabs starting today. Both devices will go on sale in black, white and purple variants, although only the Z Ultra will offer LTE connectivity across the 900, 2100, 850, 1900 and 1700 bands. Waterproof or 4G-capable? Make your choice.
