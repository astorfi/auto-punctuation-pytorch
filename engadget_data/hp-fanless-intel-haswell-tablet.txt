While investigating Intel's fanless tablet reference design, HP told us that its own iteration -- one that was apparently also on stage during Intel's Computex events -- will be coming soon. While the tablet (or hybrid) wasn't being shown publicly at the event, an official announcement is coming later this year. We thought we wouldn't get to see a fanless Intel Core portable until Haswell's successor, Broadwell (and its even smaller 14nm chips) started doing the rounds in a few years, but some clever hardware design could mean we see space-hogging, power-consuming fans dropped a little early.
