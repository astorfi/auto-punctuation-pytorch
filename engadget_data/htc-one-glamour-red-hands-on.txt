A lot of the smartphone color options we see announced are no big deal, but there was a certain something about HTC's metallic red One that demanded closer attention. We've just handled the burgundy bombshell, which has the same hardware credentials seen on the silver and black options (4.7-inch 1080p display, UltraPixel camera, Snapdragon 600 processor), but coated in a metallic "glamour red" finish just in time for summer. The color extends across the rear of the smartphone, the two speaker panels on the front and the chamfered edge that connects the two. The effect is slightly textured to the touch (more than the initial monochrome models, at least), making it a bit easier to grip, while bouncing around any ambient light that manages to hit it. That's pretty much all there is to say, but you can scrutinize the new choice of color in our gallery below -- and check our full review, because the phone's fortunately otherwise unchanged.
