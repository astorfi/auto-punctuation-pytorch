Ah yes, another iPod shuffle dock.
For you poor sods afflicted with recessed or tightly-spaced USB ports, this $19.99 accessory from Digital Lifestyle
Outfitters can cure what ails you. It's a 7-inch flexible gooseneck cable with a regular USB plug at one end and a
connection port for the shuffle on the other, designed to hold the player upright next to your screen â€” which makes
this seem more handy for laptop users than desktop users, unless you've got a machine with front-facing USB ports.
