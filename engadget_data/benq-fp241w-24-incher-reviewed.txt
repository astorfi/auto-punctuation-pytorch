 The folks at bit-tech.net recently took some time to sit down and stare at BenQ's new FP241W 24-inch widescreen LCD to see how it stacks up against the competition, coming away mightily impressed with the monitor in most respects. Specs-wise, the FP241W hits all the right marks, with the de facto 1920 x 1200 resolution, 6ms response time, 500cd/mÂ² brightness, 1,000:1 contrast ratio, and an ample supply of inputs (both video and USB), not the least of which is an HDMI port -- something its biggest competitor lacks. Of course, specs alone aren't exactly a hard and fast way to judge a monitor, but bit-tech finds the BenQ lives up to them, performing well in both gaming and regular desktop use and, in their opinion, beating Dell's more popular option in just about every respect. About the only faults they found were a few problems with adjusting the monitor (you'll have to live with it about three inches off your desk), a lack of memory card reader, and a relatively plain design -- although given some of some of the monitors we've seen, we're content with BenQ playing it safe.
