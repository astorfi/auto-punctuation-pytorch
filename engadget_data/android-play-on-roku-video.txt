Just over a month after its iOS debut, video support for "Play on Roku" is now available for the streaming box's Android app. You'll need a second gen or newer Roku running at least software version 5.1 to push hand-crafted video from your Google gizmo, and then it only works with "select" Ice Cream Sandwich or later devices. Which ones? The company's blog lists the Samsung Galaxy S III and S4, HTC One, Nexus 4 and 2012's Nexus 7 tablet. You have one of those, right?
