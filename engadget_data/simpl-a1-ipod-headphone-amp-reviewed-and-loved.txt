Ron Harris of the Press Democrat thinks the iPod is really shiny.  "It gleams," says he.  All love stops
there, however.  You see, Ron also says the iPod sounds too tinny without Simpl Acoustics' A1 iPod clip-on
headphone amp.  The unit adds what is supposed to be louder, deeper sound response for those who want a little
extra kick in their pods.  Ron sure seems to think the A1 makes a difference, and he even tried them out with
everything from the stock Apple earbuds to the Sennheiser 590 earbuds.  His conclusion?  The $149 Simpl
Acoustics A1 is a good thing.
