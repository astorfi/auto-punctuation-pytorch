 
 Right on schedule, Sony and Activision have teamed up again for this "Limited Edition" Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 bundle that's due to ship May 25th. Unfortunately, once you've opened the box the special experience is pretty much over, with only standard console and game inside, replacing the usual Uncharted 3 offering -- unlike last year's 160GB Black Ops combo, there's no free DLC (or anything else) to be had. Still, if you somehow don't have Sony's gaming machine in your living room already and have been aching to own some noobs on PSN then it's a decent option, even if any perks will have to be earned in-game.
