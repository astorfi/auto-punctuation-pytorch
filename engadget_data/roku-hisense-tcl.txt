 
With scads of set-top boxes and sticks on the market, you could just choose a basic TV and play the field. But if you like Roku enough to shack-up, HDTVs from TCL and Hisense powered by the Roku OS are finally available. You can access the usual array of Roku content, including 1,500 channels like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon. The company's iOS and Android apps also work on the TVs to stream and control your content, just as they do with Roku streaming devices. Rather than Roku's standard remotes, however, you'll get custom TCL and Hisense models with prominent buttons for Netflix, Amazon, Rdio and Vudu (no headphone jacks though). TCL has four models from 32- to 55-inches, with the top-end 1080p model running $649, while the Hisense lineup has 40- to 55-inch 1080p models and pricing to be set by retailers. You'll be able to grab them starting next month.
