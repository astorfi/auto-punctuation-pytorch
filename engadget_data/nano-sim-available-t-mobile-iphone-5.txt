 The iPhone 5 may not be ready for sale unlocked officially just yet, but that doesn't mean T-Mobile isn't ready to be your service provider. As evidenced by the photo above, the folks at TmoNews and YouTuber BigRicksChannel have confirmed that the carrier is now selling iPhone 5-compatible Nano-SIMs. Of course, these'll work just fine with the Verizon-variant of the 4-inch device, as it's technically unlocked out of the box. Need proof beyond a photo? Catch the video after the break to see it connecting to T-Mobile's network for yourself.
