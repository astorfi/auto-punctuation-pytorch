 

It looks like you'll have a few more viewing options than usual at your next Super Bowl party. The NFL announced today that the Super Bowl, plus wild card Saturday and the Pro Bowl, will all be streamed online for the first time on both the NFL's and NBC's websites. Mobile users will also be able to get in on the act, albeit only if they have a Verizon smartphone with the NFL Mobile app. What's more, those broadcasts will also give viewers access to quite a bit more than old-fashioned TV watchers have access to, including multiple camera angles, in-game highlights, and live stats. No word if the streams will include ads.
