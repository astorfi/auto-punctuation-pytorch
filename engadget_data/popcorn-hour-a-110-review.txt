 With HD media streamers being a dime a dozen these days, when one particular one seems gain popularity we take notice. So we figured there was no better way to learn what all the fuss is about then to spend a little time with it. The main point of our curiosity was to go beyond the specs and to try and determine how usable it was. To learn what sets the Popcorn Hour apart from the rest, click on through.






HardwareWhen it comes to media streamers we don't expect much, as it's the content we're interested in, but the two most important factors -- temperature and noise -- were both easily covered by the A-110. The box is dead silent and doesn't seem to generate much heat at all. Next on the list is connectivity, and that is pretty good, too. There are two regular USB ports -- one on the front and one on the back -- for things like USB thumb drives and one USB-PC adapter that can be used to connect to a PC so if you installed an internal hard drive (it makes the A-110 an external HDD but EXT2 support on your computer is required).There are of course component and HDMI (1.3a) HD outputs as well as standard def' ones like composite and S-Video. The only connector we'd like to see added is coaxial digital, but perhaps we're the only one that still uses that. The one thing that is missing though is built in WiFi, but there is an optional USB dongle that fills the gap. The only real gripe we have is with the remote. It is actually a pretty good looking remote, but without any programmable buttons like TV power and volume, it pretty much makes it a throw away for a programmable one. We also found the power LED lights confusing, red for off is obvious, but yellow for on had us scratching our head when we were troubleshooting some HDMI handshake issues and weren't sure if it was on or off.
