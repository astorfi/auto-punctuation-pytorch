 There aren't many premieres this week, but Syfy's new show Defiance is bringing a new approach, and our old favorite Awkward has returned. Look below for the highlights this week, followed after the break by our weekly listing of what to look out for in TV, Blu-ray and videogames.

 Defiance Syfy's TV show / game hybrid makes its broadcast debut tonight. The multiplayer game had experienced some server issues after its debut a couple of weeks ago, but those are apparently being addressed via patches. Now we'll see if the TV show's narrative can hold up its end, or even get more viewers interested in its unique approach. Taking place in a future St. Louis after years of human vs. alien warfare, a small town sheriff and his adopted alien daughter try to keep all sides at peace. If you're into second screen apps, the Syfy Sync iPad app is also promising a few new features for the show. Check out a trailer for the TV show after the break. (April 15th, Syfy, 9PM)

 Django Unchained The latest flick from Quentin Tarantino comes home this week, starring Jamie Foxx and Oscar winner Christoph Waltz. Set in the Antebellum South, this revenge fantasy is as violent and shocking as you may have heard, but should align well with what QT fans have come to expect. ($22.99 on Amazon)

 Hemlock Grove Netflix's next big dive into original content debuts later this week, as the world is introduced to Eli Roth's Hemlock Grove. A horror series focusing on an outbreak of werewolf attacks in a small town, it may not appeal to all the high-minded fans of House of Cards, but could be a nice True Blood (or at least Vampire Diaries?) alternative. Check out the trailer after the break -- but note the incredibly specific content warning first. (April 19th, Netflix Streaming)
