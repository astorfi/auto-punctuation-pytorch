Just in case you thought not being a Verizon customer meant you weren't covered by yesterday's report of widespread NSA logging, the Wall Street Journal says the program extends much wider. Citing "people familiar with the NSA's operations," it stated phone call metadata is also being collected from AT&T and Sprint, along with data from other ISPs and even credit card purchase info. Members of Congress have come out today stating that the program -- an evolution of warrantless wiretapping that began after the Patriot Act was enacted -- has been ongoing for several years and must be renewed every three months by Congress.
