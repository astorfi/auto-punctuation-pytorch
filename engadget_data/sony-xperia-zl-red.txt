 In the land of gorgeous phones you won't be able to play with, Sony's red Xperia ZL is king. The prototype was pawed around at the south east asian launch of the handset, but the company has conceded to XperiaBlog that it currently has no plans to release it globally. We suspect a letter-writing campaign is in order, as phone geeks shouldn't be denied something so lovely.
