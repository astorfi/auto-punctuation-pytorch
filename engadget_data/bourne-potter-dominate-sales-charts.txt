Reportedly, Potter topped the DVD sales charts for the week ending December 16, 2007, but 'round these parts, it's the high-definition iteration(s) that we're concerned with. Regrettably, it seems that the actual breakdown of HD DVD vs. Blu-ray sales on the latest installment of Potter has yet to be divulged, but we were told that Bourne outsold the wizard and his posse by a margin of "nearly 2-to-1" on HD DVD. Furthermore, Order of the Phoenix managed to slip in at number two on the Blu-ray charts, falling shy of leader Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Hopefully we'll hear a few more specifics on all of this soon enough.[Thanks, Ali]
