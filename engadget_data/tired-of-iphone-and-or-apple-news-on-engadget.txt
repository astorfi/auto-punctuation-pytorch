       Ok, we'll level with you. It's our job to cover the gadgets and consumer electronics space the best we possibly can -- and that often includes covering gadgets that one crowd or another isn't particularly interested in. (See: iPod fans when we blew the door off the Zune launch; or Microsoft fans when we took over WWDC this year.)So here's the straight dope: it's not like we're going to ignore the iPhone or anything, so for those of you told us you wanted to opt out of our iPhone or Apple coverage, we hear ya! We whipped up some slightly modified Engadget RSS feeds with Yahoo Pipes; we wouldn't suggest using these forever, but until we get our blog platform up to speed on exclusionary news it's a good enough temporary solution.Opt out of Apple / iPhone newsEngadget classic without any iPhone news - RSS feed, Pipes pageEngadget classic without any Apple news - RSS feed, Pipes pageEngadget Mobile without any iPhone news - RSS feed, Pipes pageEngadget Mobile without any Apple news - RSS feed, Pipes pageOf course, if you have laser-like focus on this stuff and want a separate feed for Apple and iPhone news, we offer that too!Get only Apple / iPhone newsEngadget classic only iPhone news - RSS feed, tag pageEngadget classic only Apple news - RSS feed, tag pageEngadget Mobile only iPhone news - RSS feed, tag pageEngadget Mobile only Apple news - RSS feed, category pageAnd hey, let us know if you see any problems with the Pipes feeds!
