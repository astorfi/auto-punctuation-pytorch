Leave a comment below. You know the drill!
You may only enter this specific giveaway once. If you enter this giveaway more than once you'll be automatically disqualified, etc. (Yes, we have robots that thoroughly check to ensure fairness.)
If you enter more than once, only activate one comment. This is pretty self explanatory. Just be careful and you'll be fine.
Contest is open to anyone in the 50 States, 18 or older! Sorry, we don't make this rule (we hate excluding anyone), so be mad at our lawyers and contest laws if you have to be mad.
Winner will be chosen randomly. That winner will get a Philips 42PFL5603D, value of $1,399.
Entries can be submitted until Sunday, February 24th, 11:59PM ET. Good luck!
Full rules can be found here.

Oh, and don't forget our HDTV + Xbox 360 combo Old Spice contest, too. Don't be shy about entering both. Good luck!
