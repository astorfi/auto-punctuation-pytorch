Nintendo of America's VP of marketing and corporate affairs, Perrin Kaplin, pulled double duty at a recent Q&A session, and confirmed the cease of production: "Are we producing any more GameCubes? No," said Kaplin. "But do we have the inventory there for people to still purchase? Yes." She says the console has moved past the point of being for core gamers, but the remaining inventory should still be plenty desirable for a Family's First Console, thanks to the dirt cheap pricetag and decent catalog. On the other end of Nintendo's console front, the Wii is rocking preliminary sales numbers for January, and might even have some sort of revision due in the not so distant future, according to a different interview with Kaplin. When asked if the Wii is going to see the sort of revisions Nintendo's handhelds have, she responded: "Sure, absolutely. You'll see the ways in which we do that." Not exactly the confirmation of the century, but it'll do for now. Oh, and in case you missed the GameCube love song on Valentine's Day, you can peep it after the break in some YouTube trimmings -- the passionate lyrics seem all the more appropriate after the passing of this dear console.[Via Joystiq]Read - Nintendo kills off GameCubeRead - Nintendo confirms Wii 2.0?
