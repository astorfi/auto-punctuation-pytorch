 Compared to competitor DISH Network, DirecTV is having The Best Week Ever. Second quarter results posted today were up to analysts estimates, adding 129,000 to its 17.2 million subscribers in the U.S. and lowering its churn rate to 1.49 percent. Average revenue per user (i.e. how much cash they get from you every month) rose 7% thanks to people signing up for high definition and DVR service, while revenue in Latin America jumped 49%. Add to that news that DISH Network wants to give things another go, and we imagine they're feeling pretty good about themselves in El Segundo, you'd think they could find the time to return our wallet one of these days.
