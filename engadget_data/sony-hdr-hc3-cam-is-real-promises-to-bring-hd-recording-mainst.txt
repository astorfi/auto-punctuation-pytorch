At $1700, the new cam will retail for $300 less than its predecessor, the HC1 (although the latter can now be had for around $1600), andimproves on some features while seemingly falling short on others. Like the HC1, the HC3 records up to 1080i ontostandard mini-DV cassettes in HDV format, but it ups the ante with stills up to four megapixels (and even simultaneouswidescreen 2.3 and 4:3 1.7 megapixel stills while shooting video), although it has a lower gross pixel count,no manual focus ring, and we've heard grumblings of a "noisier" picture. Still, the 2.7-inch Clear Photo LCDplus-powered touchscreen display, HDMI output, and relatively compact size (26% smaller than the HC1) may actually helpthis cam live up to Sony's hype and become the first consumer-oriented HD model to the gain a foothold in the covetedsoccer mom demographic upon its April debut.[Via HDBeat]
