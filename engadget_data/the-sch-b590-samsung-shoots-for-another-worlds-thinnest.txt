As you might expect, you give up some goodness to minimize the bulge in your pocket; the SCH-B590 gets off with a measly 1.3-megapixel cam, not to mention a fairly pedestrian clamshell design -- none of that rotating slider nonsense here. Expect the B590 to drop on Korea's SK Telecom for around 500,000 won (about $520).
