The 12 megapixel (1/1.72-inch CCD) FE-300 is the big pixel-huntin' dog of the bunch packing a TruePic III image processor, 17 scene modes, xD expansion, and 2.5-inch LCD in a 22.1-mm thick package. Next up is the 7.1 megapixel (1/2.5-inch CCD) FE-290 which lacks the face detection of the FE-300 but squeezes in a 3-inch LCD and 4x wide angle optical zoom lens. The FE-280 then, crams 8 megapixels into a 1/2.35-inch CCD and super slim 19.1-mm body. Ammusingly, it features a "Smile Shot" mode which automatically tracks faces and then throws the shutter when your subject smiles, or grimaces presumably, when snuggled up with aunt vinegar. Bringing up the tail-end is the ho hum 7.1 megapixel FE-270. Look for 'em all to ship starting September.
