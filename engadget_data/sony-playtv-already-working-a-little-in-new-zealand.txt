       How close is Sony's PlayTV DVR to working with New Zealand broadcasts? Very, or so it would seem, one reader wrote in to let us know the UK PlayTV unit he brought down to NZ in '08 has, since the 2.10 firmware update, put its DVB-T compatibility to work and started picking up some broadcasts. So far he's able to catch TV3 in 1080i and AC3 surround and even pause and buffer video, but no program scheduling support. On the other 7 Freeview channels? Video, but no audio so far. Sony hasn't documented any New Zealand compatibility in its upgrades, but at least judging by one users experience everything is being "worked in" in good time.[Thanks, Jim]
