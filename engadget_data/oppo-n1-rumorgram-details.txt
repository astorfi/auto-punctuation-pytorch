Buttons and trackpads on the back of mobile devices? It's becoming a trend. Oppo has revealed that users will be able to scroll, double click and long press with the backside touch feature of the forthcoming Oppo N1. Apparently it'll be possible to swipe through pages (or change songs), activate and control the camera or bind the actions to other apps as you see fit. At the same time, the N1's chassis has been snapped in this rather beautifully composed rumorgram shot, so you can see exactly what you'll be reaching around when this unit gets an official announcement in September.
