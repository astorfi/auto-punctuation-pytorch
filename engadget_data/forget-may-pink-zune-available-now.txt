 We've had our fair share of Zune gripes lately, but there's nothing not to love here: you can pick up one of those new pink Zune models now at Amazon, instead of waiting for the promised May release date. You know the drill by now, we're sure. $250, "limited run" of 100k, doubleshot casing won't save your life but it doesn't look bad neither.[Via Zune Scene]
