In the year since we recoiled at spending $7,500 for the OnCinema Teatro, more boutiquemanufacturers have brought out their wares, with the latest being the UK's Entertainment PC. The company's Fidelity-Thas some impressive features, including an HD tuner, 3GHz P4, storage capacities of up to 2TB and a dual-layer burner.But $7,400 (that's for the 2TB version; you can get a 300GB version for a mere $5,300)? That's almost double the priceof VoodooPC's Aria, which we thought was a little dear at $4,000,and which has most of the same features, plus a touchscreen LCD. Still, we imagine EPC will sell a few of these; and atthat price, they should only need to sell a few to be a fairly successful little company.[Via BIOS]
