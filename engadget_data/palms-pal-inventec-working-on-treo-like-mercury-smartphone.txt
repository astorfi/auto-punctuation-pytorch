The FCC letthis one slip, and though we're not sure it's destined for Treohood, we do know it's destined for Windows Mobile and it packs a GSM radio for use withCingular or T-Mobile. The phone also has a 2.6-inch QVGA touchscreen, QWERTY keyboard, Bluetooth, WiFi, miniSD andpossibly even GPS. We're not quite sure about the size of the device, but it appears pretty small for what they'repacking in.[Via phoneArena]
