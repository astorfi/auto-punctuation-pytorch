The Australian Defense Force and Marathon Robotics took a number of two-wheeled RMP 200 Segway robots, placed hoodie-clad foam dummies on top, armored the bottoms, and then programmed them to wander randomly around a small village. A sniper perched up on a hill then picks off his target and, like magic, the remaining robots all scatter automatically in a game way more fun than Modern Warfare could ever hope to be. There's a video of that after the break, along with an RMP 400 doing some sweet jumps off-road, even roaring up stairs. The YouTube channel at the source link has plenty more Segway demos, some new and some old, so if you have some time to kill today you know where to click.
