Microsoft Xbox chief product officer Marc Whitten has been with the company for quite some time -- from before the launch of the first Xbox through the company's latest gaming effort, the Xbox One. As such, he's got a longer term perspective on the Xbox brand than most folks in Redmond, so we put those kind of questions to him when we spoke for 20 minutes yesterday following the company's big stage show at The Galen Center.


First and foremost, we asked about the fate of Xbox Live Arcade. Given that Xbox One will have all its games available digitally as well as physically at launch, what would become of the traditionally small game digital service? Will the marketplace change dramatically given the changing nature of game formats? Find out that and much more in the full interview, dropped just below the break.
