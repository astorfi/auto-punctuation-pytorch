       Verizon keeps on rolling out their FiOS service out across America. Next up is Wakefield, MA and City of Laurel, MD. Both of those city councils approved the installation of the fiber in order to give their residents more options for television service. Together, the two cities will offer Verizon 61,000 potential new customers.In case you are not familiar with the FiOS service, it sends the television signal across fiber optic lines rather then the standard copper. This allows for a lot more available bandwidth for Internet service and HDTV stations. Think 30Mbs Internet and 30+ HDTV stations on the same line.
