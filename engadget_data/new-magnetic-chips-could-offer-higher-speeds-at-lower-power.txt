We won't bore you with the details of these magnetic microchips,but the upshot of the design is that the chip can be reconfigured on the fly, allowing for specialized applications andspeedier work due to custom configurations. The chip can also double as nonvolatile magnetic storage in much the samevein as MRAM, making it even more versatile, but the overall benefit of the technology seems to be in its complete lackof wires, meaning less heat and less power, which is always fine by us.
