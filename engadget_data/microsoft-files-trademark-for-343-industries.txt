Sure, we knew that 343 Guilty Spark was a character in the Halo franchise, but did you know that voice actor Tim Dabado played the AI in all three games? It's not just true, it's also incredibly exciting.Fascinating non sequiturs aside, Microsoft's recent trademark filing of "343 Industries" has clearly sparked Halo thoughts in our speculative minds. Could this be a studio founded within Microsoft to work on future Halo titles, as per the various job listings in the past? Considering the group has been listed as one that works on "computer programs, namely, game software for use on computers and video," we're gonna say that's a pretty safe bet. We contacted Microsoft for comment, who said, "We have nothing to announce at this time." [Via Superannuation]
