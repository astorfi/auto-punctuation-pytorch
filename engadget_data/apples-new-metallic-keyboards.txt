The new keyboards (one larger wired USB 2.0 edition with two USB 2.0 ports, one smaller Bluetooth 2.0 flavor) are crafted from anodized aluminum, and include dedicated keys for screen dimmer / brighter, expose, media controls, volume controls, and eject for optical drive. Clearly, they're making an obvious play to capture that good will the MacBook has garnered for its interesting spacing and flat keys, but it remains to be seen if such a laptop-ish keyboard can keep up with the more tactile big boys on the desktop frontier. But hey, with that much sexy, we're willing to find out. Click on for a few more glimpses, and just in case you were wondering, it's $49 for the tethered one, or $79 to go cordless.
