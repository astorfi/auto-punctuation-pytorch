Enter Ten One Design's meticulously engineered $24.95 Pogo Stylus, which the firm says functions "like a fingertip" to integrate seamlessly with the finger-friendly UI used throughout the iPhone and iPod touch. Imagine that! What's more, it's manufactured from aluminum alloy in your choice of three stylish colors, which is awesome news since it's prominently featured on your iPhone's side in a custom holster. If only Ten One had put a screw top on this thing so that we could fill it with pixie dust, whiskey, or $25 in shredded US currency, we'd be in.[Via iAnything]
