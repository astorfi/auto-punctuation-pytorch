Their new MP3 catalog (no AAC player limitations here, folks) includes "thousands of albums and songs" from both EMI and Universal Music Group (presumably, as a trial) at $0.94 per track or $9.22 per album. The new MP3s are encoded at 256kbps versus their usual 128kbps WMA "protected" downloads. So what's the matter Sony BMG and Warner Music, don't you like parties?
