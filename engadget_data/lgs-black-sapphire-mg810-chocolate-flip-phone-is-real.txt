It'll apparently have a 1.3 megapixel camera, 176 x 220 internal display (and 96x 96 external), media player that supports MP3 and AAC, Bluetooth, FM radio, 128MB of flash memory, and GRPS. Still, she's ah so beautiful. According to our Brazilian pal who sent this in, they snuck it right out underneath our ever lovin' noses and apparently put it on sale in South America for 999 Brazil Reais (or about $465 US). Steep, for a phone that doesn't appear to have EDGE or expandable media, but you're not paying for features here, remember?[Thanks, Gustavo]
