Twitter is one of the best ways to keep abreast of breaking news, but getting caught up on anything meaningful that happened on a given day can take hours of scrolling. To combat this, the service is now rolling out a push notification-based recommendation system that builds on @MagicRecs, the account that sends tailored content-suggestions based on who you follow. A trip to the Android and iOS settings menu is all it takes to enable (or disable) a buzz when there are favorites and retweets the platform thinks you might dig. If you can't spend all day watching your timeline but still want to stay in the loop, this could be perfect middle ground. Now if you'll excuse us, we just got word that Emergency Puppy tweeted out a new picture.



Thanks for experimenting with us! You helped us introduce a new feature: https://t.co/3Dzd2T7HJP
