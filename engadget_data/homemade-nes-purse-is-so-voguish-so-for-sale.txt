We know, there's a never-ending stream of NES-related doodads flowing from every possible direction, but it's not everyday that you get the opportunity to actually purchase one of these amazingly beautiful creations. Designer inhope has clearly and definitively one-upped that other NES purse with the Nintendo Controller Purse, and you can be the proud owner of one for just $39.99. An irrefutable bargain, we say.[Via technabob]
