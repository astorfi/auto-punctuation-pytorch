Our tipsters have told us it's adding a further 500,000 slots for users on a first come, first served basis for this year's annual refresh -- expected to include Internet Explorer, Pins, and Smartglass amongst others. If you're interested in getting involved, we suggest sprinting on down to the source link to try and beat the rush.
