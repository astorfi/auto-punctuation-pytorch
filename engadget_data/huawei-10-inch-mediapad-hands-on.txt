 Sadly, when this gorgeous slab of glass and silicon was unveiled at MWC, Huawei wouldn't let us put our greasy hands on it -- and with good reason, the spectacular panel on the MediaPad 10 is a bit of a fingerprint magnet. But, we're happy to report that the company trotted out the goods for Pepcom's event at CTIA. We took the device for a pretty thorough spin and, despite being saddled with software still in the development stage, came away thoroughly impressed. The 10-inch 1920 x 1200 IPS display is one of the most gorgeous screens to ever grace a tablet. Sure, it's not quite "new iPad" levels of pixel density, but it certainly puts most of its potential competitors to shame. The primarily aluminum body feels great in the hand, striking a great balance between weight and a premium feel. At only 8.8mm thin it's no surprise that it comes in at just 13 ounces (roughly), all while packing a 6,600 mAh battery.

 The in-house developed 1.5Ghz quad-core K3 Balong CPU inside is given a pretty decent workout by the rough build of Ice Cream Sandwich on board, that was mostly stock but had the sporadic OEM flourish such as different icons and keyboard. Most actions, such as playing back HD video and launching the browser were smooth enough, but we did notice the occasional stutter and pause. We took some time to put it through a few of our standard issue benchmarks, and turned up some mixed results. The 2,696.7ms it took to chug through the SunSpider benchmark left us standing around awkwardly at the Huawei table, while the 2,737 on Quadrant and 30.1 fps in NenaMark 2 were respectable, though not mind-blowing. But, again, we'll stress that this is still running a development version of the OS. Check out the gallery below and the video after the break for a full tour.
