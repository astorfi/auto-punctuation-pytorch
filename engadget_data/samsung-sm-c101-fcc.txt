Well, look what we have here. Just a little over two weeks after we spied the Samsung SM-C101 at the Bluetooth SIG, the handset turns up at the FCC looking for approval. As we mentioned previously, it's what could very well be the rumored Galaxy S 4 Zoom, an S 4 handset with a large camera -- essentially a sequel to the Galaxy Camera, but with phone capabilities. Indeed, the FCC report states the SM-C101 has quad-band GSM, AT&T-compatible HSPA+, NFC, WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 LE. However, there is no mention of LTE, which leads us to doubt this device is destined for the US (though this doesn't guarantee we won't see a US-bound variant down the road). The listing is otherwise light on details, though we do hope that the speculations of a 16-megapixel camera turn out to be true. At least it seems we won't have long to find out.
