 
Helio was determined to show everyone a little love today. So aftermonths of keeping quiet, Helio finally decided to trot out its cutting-edge handsets. Their flagship phone, the Hero(which we had word on beforeregarding their spring launch), promises to deliver all the EV-DO multimedia you're gonna need. Created by Pantech, itsthe first high end device made by the Korean phone firm specifically for the US market. And as a specialpost-Valentine's day gift, Helio also announced an exclusive partnership with MySpace to load up its phones with amobile-focused MySpace application that will let you keep in touch with your peeps no matter where you are. For nowit's look but don't touch, but you should be able to get your mitts on one of these come spring.
