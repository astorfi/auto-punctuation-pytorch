Be it good old lamp-shade-wearin' fun or sweet, sweet revenge — the Sonic Grenade is sure to deliver both. Pull the
pin and toss into the room of any unsuspecting aurally-equipped beast and prepare for the geek pummeling to come. And
since the only way to shut off the "three pitches of skull-shattering sound" is via reinsertion of the pin, this one
trick pony is likely to be returned smashed to bits. But for £10 ($18US), you can afford to pick up a couple, dig.
