Apparently a designer by thename of Issara Willenskomer did a promo video for Microsoft that was set to air during the Gates CES keynote (we don'tknow the year, however; was it 2005, 2006?), but was apparentlypulled last minute -- yet at the time of this writing is still allowed to air online, lucky us / what a coincidence.The subject? Yet another mysterious Microsoft product called "Alexandria" -- "mysterious" becausethey won't show what the product is, just that it's something that apparently runs on handhelds and laptops alike andthat nimbly gathers large crowds of disaffected youth and buttoned-down adults, alike. The video closes with "Thefuture of entertainment / summer 2006," fade to black. Here we go again.[Thanks, Alex]Update: After a closer inspection of a much higher resolution version of the supposed-Origami pic fromyesterday, we happened to notice an icon labeled Alexandria on the device's desktop. Given what's on screen and the"future of entertainment" bit, can we assume this might have something to do with same Windows Media Videosubscription system used in Vongo, perhaps? Thanks, Jakob.
