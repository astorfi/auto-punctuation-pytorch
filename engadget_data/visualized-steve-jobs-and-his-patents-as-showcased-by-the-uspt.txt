The row of iPhone-like monoliths you see above is now in the atrium of the agency's offices in Alexandria, Virginia (also home to the National Inventors Hall of Fame and Museum), and they're being used to display the more than 300 patents that have Steve Jobs' name on them -- something the USPTO's David Kappos says provides a "striking example of the importance intellectual property plays in the global marketplace." Those interested in checking it out first hand can do so anytime between now and January 15th, free of charge.
