 Nokia is blaming softwareproblems for the delays in their N91,N71, N80, E60, E61,and E71 phones. No word on what exactly is at fault, but Nokia does claim they'll be shipping the N91 -- which wasslated for a holiday release last year -- this week. The N71 and N80 are supposed to follow later this month. Nokiaclaims the business-centric E61, E61, and E71 -- which all missed their March launch target -- are still wrapping up insoftware testing, and that the E61 will get priority for release. In other news, Nokia managed to to get a class-actionlawsuit by a New York judge dismissed last Friday. The 77-page opinion thoroughly trounced the opposition, which hadfiled suit in April 2004.
