The $80 e-reader sheath is said to provide for three months of unplugged use as well as 50 hours for its onboard reading light. While the construction seemed solid, the case added an extra bit of heft, with a heavy grey backing and a comfortable black leather detail surrounding the rather large solar panel on the front. The case is now available for the fourth generation Kindle, but we're told a Kindle Touch version is on its way sometime in mid-March, with more iterations in development. Check out a closer view of the case in the gallery after the break.
