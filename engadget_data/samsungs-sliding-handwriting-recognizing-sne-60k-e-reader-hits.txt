Otherwise, you can expect built-in WiFi and Bluetooth, MP3 support (no word on storage) and, judging from the icons on the screen, at least a few other basic applications. Still no indication of a release over here, but this one is now available at Kyobo Bookstores in South Korea for 429,000 won (or about $375).
