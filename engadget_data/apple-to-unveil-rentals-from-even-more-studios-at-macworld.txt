Of course, it wouldn't be an Apple rumor unless it somehow managed to make something as mundane as renting a movie sound like a super-classified state secret, and the NYT says that while it got the info from people "familiar with the negotiations," they weren't "authorized" to name the companies involved. We'd obviously expect Disney to have an interest, since Steve's on the board -- but as with all these rumors, only time will tell.
