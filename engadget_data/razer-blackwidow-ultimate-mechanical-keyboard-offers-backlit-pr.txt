 
There are mechanical keyboards, and then there's Razer's newest duo. For the past three years, the gaming accessory company has been toiling in a back room trying to figure out how to really get mechanical keyboards right; according to it, the vast majority of the options today "feature stiff keys that cause key actuation fatigue," and it has sought to remedy said issue with the BlackWidow and BlackWidow Ultimate. Launched today over at Gamescom, these two keyboards offer key actuation that feels much like a mouse click, with an actuation point that's actually halfway through the full travel distance. The company claims that its power-packin' pair has one of the lightest actuation forces for all keyboards, making it ideal for hardcore gamers who can't be bothered with missing a single keystroke. The standard BlackWidow offers up fully programmable keys with on-the-fly macro recording as well as five additional gaming keys, while the Ultimate edition adds individually backlit keys with five levels of lighting, 3.5mm audio and microphone out jacks as well as an additional USB port. Both 'boards are due out next month for $79.99 / $129.99, respectively, and you can peek the full specs list in the press release just past the break.
