Then it looks like your persistence has finally paid off for once, as Pentax has now rolled out its own Colorware-type service for the camera -- in Japan, that is. That'll let you choose from twenty different colors for the body of the camera and five for the grip (lens colors are apparently "coming soon") and, of course, any combination of the two (like the eye-catching number we whipped up above). Best of all, it seems that the customization options are available at no extra cost, other than the hours you'll spend agonizing over your choice of colors.[Thanks, Rye]
