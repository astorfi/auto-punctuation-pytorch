  Cloud storage provider SugarSync has already rolled out an updated version of its Android app this month, but it's now already back again with a major new release for iPad users. That comes in the form of the SugarSync 3.0 universal app, but the updates here are all on the iPad side of things, including a completely revamped interface, added gesture support, and generally more effective use of the iPad's added screen real estate. As before, the app itself remains free, but you'll have to pay up if you need more storage than the basic 5GB service provides ($5 a month will buy you 30GB, with plans up to 500GB available).
