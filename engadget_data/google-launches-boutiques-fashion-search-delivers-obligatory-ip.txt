Well, here comes Google with the solution in the brand new Boutiques.com website, which gives you curated selections of the latest styles, along with advanced search filters like genre, silhouette, pattern, and color families. There's even an algorithm for suggesting items to complete your dazzling look, and once you find just the right pair of pumps, Google sends you along to the appropriate retailer. So it's sort of like Google's Shopping section, only a few orders of magnitude fancier. Oh, and we weren't being sexist in our opener, Boutiques only has women's fashion for now and it's only available in the US, though there are plans to expand on both fronts.
