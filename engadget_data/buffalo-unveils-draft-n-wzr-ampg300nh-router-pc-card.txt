Part of the ever-growing AirStation NFINITI lineup, this draft-N device purportedly plays nice with 802.11a/b/g as well, boasts throughput of around 153Mbps, and includes MIMO technology to make full use of the trio of antennas. You'll also find the typical WPA2 certification, and if you need a WiFi adapter in order to make use of it, the WLI-CB-AMG300N PCMCIA network card fits the bill perfectly. Look for both devices to land in Japan next month (well, we hope) for ¥40,200 ($328), or pick up the router by its lonesome for ¥31,700 ($258).[Via AkihabaraNews]
