With the huge success seen by Guitar Hero: On Tour and its accompanying peripheral, rumors are already swirling that an Activision title by the name of Tony Hawk's Motion could deliver the next great hand occupier. A recent rating (of "G," obviously) was handed down for the elusive game by Australia's Classification Board, leaving many to wonder (read: hope) if said title will eventually ship with some sort of DS-compatible motion control accessory. Considering just how hot these bundled gizmos are right now, we'd say signs are pointing to "yes."[Via DS Fanboy]
