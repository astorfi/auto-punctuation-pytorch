 A recent scan by Android Police through the latest Google 3.9.16 APK for its Play Store has revealed that wish lists are coming along very well, thank you, and that Mountain View will likely introduce a malware scanner soon too. The latter hasn't appeared on our radar before, and it looks like the search giant will soon be able to scope all the apps you've already installed and also bar the door to any suspicious-looking software before it can sully your smartphone or slate, unless you specifically request otherwise. So, perhaps you'll feel a bit safer once the Google Play portal is being watched from both sides.
