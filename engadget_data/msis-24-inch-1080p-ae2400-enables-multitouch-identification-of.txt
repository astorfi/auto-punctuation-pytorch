MSI's latest is the AE2400, a 24-inch, 1920 x 1080 panel with an integrated Intel Core 2 Duo CPU and NVIDIA GeForce 9400 graphics, doing all it can to make use of the multi-touch support in Windows 7. The machine is set to hit retail sometime in the months contained within the year 2010 at a price of roughly $1,000, which seems like a good enough deal to us, but you may think differently after watching the smudge-riddled video after the break.[Via Cloned in China]
