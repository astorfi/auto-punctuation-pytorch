 
With a name like ioSafe, you know it's hardcore. The company has made a name for itself by concocting products that can outlast minor disasters, and per usual, it's using CES as a springboard for something else that you probably can't destroy. This year, the Rugged Portable is on display, arriving in a pair of enclosure options and offering a bundled data recovery service to boot. The unit is quite literally wrapped in metal -- the aluminum option can withstand up to 2,500 pounds of force, while the titanium shell doubles that up and shrugs its shoulders at up to 5,000 pounds. It's also immune to submersion -- your data remains safe in up to ten feet of salt water for as long as 72 hours, and it'll still come out unscathed when dipped in oil and other toxins. 

Naturally, the HDD or SSD within (your call there) is covered by suspension springs, and the USB 3.0 interface ensures that you won't be waiting around in the jungle for things to transfer. Those who snap one up will get one year of data recovery service included, a one-year 'No Hassle' warranty and up to $5000 for "third party forensic recovery services" if needed. Time Machine owners will be happy to know that this drive is fully compatible with the service, and you'll be able to select HDDs from 250GB to 1TB or SSDs from 256GB to 512GB. As for prices? $149.99 for the stock 250GB HDD aluminum version, $3,899.99 for the 512GB SSD titanium build with an extended warranty, and everywhere in between. It's up for pre-order today and should ship later this month in the US, with global availability details to follow in due time.
