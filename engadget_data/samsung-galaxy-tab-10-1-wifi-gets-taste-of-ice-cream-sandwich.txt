Numerous Galaxy Tab 10.1 WiFi owners in the US have reported receiving an official push to Android 4.0.4 shortly after getting out of bed on Monday. The new TouchWiz, Chrome support and more are all welcome -- just don't anticipate any unique twists from the upgrade. In some respects, we're likely getting a Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 with a Tegra 2 processor. The only real uncertainties are when the rest of the eligible Galaxy Tab line will make the leap as well as the possibility of Jelly Bean; hopefully, it's not the end of the update road for some of Samsung's earliest tablet adopters in the country.
