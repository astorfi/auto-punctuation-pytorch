While ASUS has some way to go before dominating the world with its PadFones, it seems that the company is still very much committed to this eccentric phone-in-tablet idea. What's more interesting is that rather than launching a completely new device, this time we're given a nice spec bump in a near-identical device, meaning existing PadFone Infinity users can keep their tablet docks and swap just the phone. But is it worth the upgrade? Let's take a quick look.





Hardware
As pointed out earlier, the new PadFone Infinity looks pretty much the same as its original counterpart, with the exception of the new diamond cut on the back plus the new color options. The shiny cut certainly made the phone more eye-catching, and it came with the added benefit of making the device a tad more comfortable to hold. Still, the screen bezel is comparatively wider than many other flagship devices these days, so the phone still isn't as single-hand friendly. Here's hoping the next-gen PadFone -- along with that mysterious PadFone mini -- will address this problem.

Software and Performance
On the software side, ASUS has bumped up its effort with UI design. The result is a cleaner, more eye-pleasing look across the system, especially with the simplified icons and menus. Even some built-in apps like Calendar and Gallery have been given a fresh look. During our brief time with the device we didn't experience any hiccup, and in fact, we think the transition time between phone mode and tablet mode has improved slightly -- just enough for us to notice this. The benchmark scores below should also give you a rough idea on the performance boost between Qualcomm's 2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 and 1.7GHz Snapdragon 600 SoCs. To put it simply, this appears to be quite a significant jump.
