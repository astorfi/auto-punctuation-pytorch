Measuring a mere 1.3-mm, the panel is 32% slimmer than the current gen of TFT-LCDs and about 0.2-mm thinner than those ultra-slim OLEDs. The new LCD should allow manufactures to dip below that 6.9-mm crown held by Samsung's SGH-X820 yet up the display brightness from 300 to 400 nits. So let's see, a conservative 0.6 less of 6.9-mm means we're looking at a 6.3-mm (0.25-inch) thick phone. Hear that Sammy, we'll expect nothing less, er, we mean more.
