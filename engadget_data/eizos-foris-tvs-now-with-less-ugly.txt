These new 32/26/20-inch Foris.TV models come slathered in man-colors like black, gray, blue, red, and brown -- the colors of Pabst, dirt, and dare we say, victory. Each TV ships with integrated analog/digital tuners and a front-loading DVD player slotted between the bezel and speaker panel. You also get a 1366x768 resolution, 500cd/m2 brightness, HDMI input, and Ethernet among other in and outs. The 32/26-inchers are fitted with IPS panels throwing a 178-degree viewing angle and 2x HDMIs while the 20-incher delivers a VA panel with a 176-degree angle of visibility and single HDMI. Expect that 32-incher mounted to a remote controlled, moveable base to cost you ¥225,000 (about $1,973) while the 26-incher will demand ¥189,000 (about $1,657), and the 20-incher ¥136,500 (about $1,197) when these all go on sale in Japan on November 15th.[Via Impress]
