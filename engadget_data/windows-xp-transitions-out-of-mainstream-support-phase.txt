 It may only be a footnote in the long history of Windows XP, but Microsoft has confirmed today that, as planned, the venerable OS has finally and officially transitioned from the Mainstream Support phase to the Extended Support phase. This, of course, follows a number of extensions to the Mainstream Support phase (which normally only lasts five years), although most users likely won't notice much of a difference as XP moves into this new, more wistful period of life, as they'll still be getting regular security updates and occasional hotfixes (depending on their support plan) all the way until April 8th, 2014 -- or who knows how much longer if the demand is there.
