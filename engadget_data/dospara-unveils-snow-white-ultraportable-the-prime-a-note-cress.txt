While the company has unveiled a few larger offerings of late, this 12.1-inch gem features a 1.6GHz AMD Turion 64 X2 TL-50 CPU, 512MB to 2GB of DDR2 RAM, 80GB 5400RPM SATA hard drive, dual-layer DVD burner, an option for NVIDIA's GeForce Go 6100 graphics, three hours of battery life, and built-in 802.11b/g -- all in a knapsack-friendly four-pound package. On the sides, you'll find VGA out, a Kensington lock port, 4-pin FireWire, audio in / out, Ethernet, a 56k modem, and a trio of USB 2.0 connectors. Sans an operating system, the basic Prime A Note Cressida NB will run you ¥109,980 ($957), while tossing in Windows XP Home (with a discounted upgrade to Vista, mind you) will cost ¥121,980 ($1,061).[Via Akihabara News]
