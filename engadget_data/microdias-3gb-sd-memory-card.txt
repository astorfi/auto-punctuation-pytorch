All we've got to go on is a scan of an advertisement that was inÂ The Straits Times the other day (thanks to
reader Nic Seow for the hookup on that), but a company called Microdia says they'll have a 3GB SD memory card for sale
soon, as well as a 3GB MMC card, a 2GB miniSD, and a 2GB RS-MMC cards. Sooner or later these things are going to be
cheap enough (2GB SD cards are expected to price out at around $250, we don't even want to think about how inexpensive
these will be in a year) that you'll have to think really hard about whether you still want to carry around a separate
dedicated digital audio player rather than just load up one of these high-capacity cards with MP3s and pop it into your
phone (there isn't a right answer, it just comes down to what's most convenient for you).
Suddenly we understand why Apple is working with
Motorola...
