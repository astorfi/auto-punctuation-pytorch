There was little doubt the company was looking at our neighbors to the north, it always just seemed like a matter of when. No firm dates here, but accounts published by Spotify that have been obtained by The Wall Street Journal seem to confirm those intentions, adding that it's also looking to expand its footprint into "countries in Asia and South America." The service is currently available in 15 countries.
