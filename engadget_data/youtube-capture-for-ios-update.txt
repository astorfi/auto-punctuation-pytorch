Those who like to record their YouTube moments while on the go have just received a handful of useful tools. Thanks to an update for the video streaming site's Capture app for iOS, users can now film and edit together multiple clips in order to create seamless footage before uploading. The ability to trim and rearrange individual clips is also built in now, as is the ability to tack on sounds from both YouTube Audio and personal iTunes Libraries. And to match all of those other iOS 7-clad apps, the software has been dressed in the latest aesthetics. Isn't that nice?
