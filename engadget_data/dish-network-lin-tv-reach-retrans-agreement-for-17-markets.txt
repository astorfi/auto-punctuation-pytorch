 LIN TV has been involved in squabbles over retransmitting of its signal with cable and satellite stations recently, but today its reached an agreement with DISH Network for both the SD and HD signal, as well as marketing and promotions to advertise the availability of HD locals via satellite in areas where they've been yanked from cable (hello, KXAN-TV in Austin). The two will also jointly "educate" customers about the digital transition and push Dish's digital converter box. Check after the break for a list of cities affected, with a deal like this in its pocket, we don't see LIN TV having a reason to reach out to the local cable co any time soon.

Wayne); WOOD-TV and WOTV-TV (Grand Rapids); WLUK-TV (Green Bay); WTNH-TV and WCTX-TV (Hartford-New Haven); WISH-TV and WNDY-TV (Indianapolis); WLFI-TV (Lafayette); WALA-TV and WBPG-TV (Mobile); WAVY-TV and WVBT-TV (Norfolk); WPRI-TV and WNAC-TV (Providence); WWLP-TV (Springfield); WTHI-TV (Terre Haute) and WUPW-TV (Toledo).
