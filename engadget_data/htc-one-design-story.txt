It's a quick tale, under two minutes long, and was actually part of HTC's big reveal in London and New York a few months back, although it's recently been given a re-edit and uploaded. The company keeps the focus on hardware construction and it's taken diamond cutters, "zero-gap construction", electro-chemical etching and, well, plenty more engineering to get the job done. Industrial manufacturing and chamfered edge fans should make the leap beyond the break for the full video.
