       A federal judge ruled yesterday that DirecTV could no longer claim that their service was better than cable in their commercials, in Time Warner markets. We all know that DirecTV has been accused of reducing their own quality in favor of quantity and are even being sued for as much. This made many of us laugh when we saw these commercials with Jessica and William claiming that DirecTV has better HD picture quality than cable, not because they were intended to be funny, but because it is so far from the truth. DirecTV's spokesman still continued to tell the associated press that DirecTV has "better overall pictures quality", whatever that means.
