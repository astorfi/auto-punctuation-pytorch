 We're guessing the past few months haven't been the greatest at Thinkflood, who has been dealing with a nasty recall of RedEye Mini IR dongles. Based on information passed down from the company to us today, each one of the recalled units has been replaced, and now the redesigned / better-than-ever models are on sale for the same price as before. $49 nets you an IR adapter that plugs into your iDevice headphone jack, enabling your iPod touch, iPhone or iPad to control essentially any home entertainment component that understands Infrared. Crisis averted, as they say.
