The nüvi 1690, which recently popped up at the FCC, features GSM, GPRS, and EDGE connectivity. The unit won't support voice calls, although with Bluetooth you should be able to use it as a hands-free unit for your current cellphone. Garmin has thus far been mum on this guy, but as GPS Tracklog points out, the IFA show in Berlin is just around the corner -- certainly the company will have something to say about all this by then.
