  
Zoom has just outed a new little camcorder, the Q3HD Handy Video Recorder. This little guy, in addition to boasting 1080p capabilities (at 30 frames per second) and 720p at 60 frames per second, also packs 4x digital zoom, a 2.4-inch color LCD, NTSC/PAL TV and HDMI outputs, and USB 2.0. Most interestingly, of course, the Q3HD Handy has built-in stereo microphones, so the camera should provide much better audio than your standard affair. There's no word on availability or pricing yet.
