In the next four weeks the members will give it the final blessing, which means there should be plenty of mobile TV devices announced at CES in January. This should also mean that with any luck we'll be able to watch DTV on the go in 2010. At this point it seems that 70 of the almost 1800 full power stations in the US plan to launch mobile service later this year. Now for the bad news; the bandwidth for these mobile broadcasts will come from the existing spectrum, so in other words say hello to just a little more compression from your local HD affiliates.
