 
With nary an AT&T agreement in sight, Nokia has gone out on a limb to launch the unlocked N95-3 today, bringing the all the original N95's goodness back for a second round with a few key changes. Most notably, of course, is the presence of HSDPA on the 850 and 1900MHz bands, but other modifications include a higher-capacity battery, recessed camera lens (sans protective shutter this time around), twice the RAM, and availability in black and "dark sand" (for the rear only -- the front's always silver). Grab it starting today in Nokia's flagship stores in New York and Chicago for $699.
