Ah, welcome to another addition of the Super Secret Apple Rumors Podcast, with your host Stevie J. Jobsie didn't have a ton of new gear to announce -- just the Mac Pro -- but it is, in fact, WWDC. Did we ever get a load of information about Leopard, though, the new version of OS X Apple's making us wait until next year to get. Next freaking year! Well, whatever, there's sure to be a lot more to come with 10.5, but in the mean time take it away, Steve.
