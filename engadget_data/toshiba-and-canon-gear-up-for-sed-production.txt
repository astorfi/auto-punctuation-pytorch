That Canon/Toshiba SED joint venture (SED Inc.) is finally gearing up to start producing displays, and if everything
works as planned, the company will start selling its first
SED TVs (which will start at
50-inches) in Japan in the first half of next year. The companies have already committed Â¥200 billion (US$1.8 billion)
to SED development, and the latest goal is to be able to produce 3,000 panels per month next year, and ramp up to
75,000 per month by the end of 2007. It's not surprising to see the companies gambling so heavily on SED, which
combines the svelte shape of plasma sets with the brightness of a CRT. As plasma and LCD sets become commodities,
prices have plunged, and manufacturers are hunting for the next high-margin product to boost their bottom lines. SED
sets are expected to retail in the if-you-have-to-ask-you-can't-afford-it range.
