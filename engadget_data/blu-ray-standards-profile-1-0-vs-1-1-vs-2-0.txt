 Since we first heard the words "full profile", trying to decipher what Blu-ray players will have which features has been a surprisingly complicated affair. CNet took a minute to break down the differences between Profile 1.0, Profile 1.1 (aka Final Standard Profile or Bonus View) and Profile 2.0 (aka BD-Live). Profile 1.1 players with picture in picture capability (and movies to watch on them) are finally in sight, but we're still waiting to see when internet connectivity is available for the Blu-ray camp.
