We're interrupting your regularly scheduled programming full of cute, service robots to bring you the latest update on Boston Dynamics' terrifying humanoid machine: Atlas. A group of MIT researchers have been working to refine their Atlas unit's capabilities since 2013 for DARPA's Robotics Challenge. The result? They've managed to program the machine to carry objects of different weights in each hand, making it more effective for real-life applications, like construction or clearing debris during times of disaster. You'll see what we're talking about when you watch the video below, showing Atlas lugging an aluminum pillar with one hand.
