One proud owner has even taken the time to host up a handful of unboxing shots as proof, and while nothing here is out of the ordinary for those acquainted with Apple's newest 15-incher, the actual machine just looks a touch longer and wider for some reason. Maybe it's just our eyes.[Thanks, Derek and Michael]
