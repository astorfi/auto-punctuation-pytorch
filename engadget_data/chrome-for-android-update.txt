Google's like the gift that keeps on giving. Following earlier news of a Drive for Android update, the team from Mountain View today rolled out a new version of its Chrome browser for mobile devices. This update brings the same features we saw a little over a month ago in the Beta channel, however Google's now deemed them ready for prime time. That (along with some undisclosed under-the-hood enhancements) includes the pseudo-fullscreen mode that's triggered by scrolling the page and, for tablets, the ability to view the tab history by way of the browser back button. For those who decided to skip the experimental version, you'll find the app in its stable form up for download at the Google Play link below.


Update: Google is back with additional news about its mobile Chrome browser, this time for the iOS version. In the coming days, iPhone and iPad users will find a new version of Chrome that allows users to submit voice queries into the Omnibox. The addition will mimic the functionality of Google Search for iOS, which accepts queries such as "How many miles from San Antonio to Dallas?" and "What's the weather in Rome?" Likewise, the update will introduce the ability to open links in Chrome from other iOS apps, along with quicker reloading of webpages from the browser cache. Hop the break for a quick peek.
