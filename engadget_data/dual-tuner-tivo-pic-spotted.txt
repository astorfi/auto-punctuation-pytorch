Oh, sure,it's got a little more black than usual, but the 180-hour TCD649180 and80-hour TCD649080 aren't going to win any awards for radical (re-)design. Nope, this thing is all about theintegrated Ethernet, four USB ports, and the ability to record as two cable channels or one cable / one digitalsimultaneously -- if it does all that stuff, that is. Frankly we'd just wait it out for the Series 3 (which is due out any year now), but hey, weknow how fiendish some TiVo users are.
