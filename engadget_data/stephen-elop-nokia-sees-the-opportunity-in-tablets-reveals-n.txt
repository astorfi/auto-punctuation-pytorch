 Sometimes a CEO has to be coy. We understand that. So what should we make of Stephen Elop's remarks to Bloomberg Businessweek? Asked about the growing tablet market, the Nokia head replied, "There's a new tablet opportunity coming. We see the opportunity. Unquestionably, that will change the dynamics." So should your start holding your breath for a Nokia tablet? Not necessarily. While he didn't rule out doing so, Elop had no plans to announce, and he's made similarly vague comments before, including, "Our team right now is assessing what's the right tablet strategy for Nokia." Interpreting these quotes is a bit like reading tea leaves, but for now we're willing to believe the Finnish firm is still mulling its options.
