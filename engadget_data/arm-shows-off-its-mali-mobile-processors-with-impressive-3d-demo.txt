Finally we have some videos to go with the hype, two demonstrations showing the phone's admittedly impressive polygon-shuffling tech. The demos feature the lower-end Mali-200 rendering everything at 720p, playing some simple videos and also handling a rather complex 3D contact navigation system that looks both flashy and painful to use. ARM says "play a game of bowling like never before and you'll get hooked by the magic of Mali." Click on through already, and prepare to be hooked.
