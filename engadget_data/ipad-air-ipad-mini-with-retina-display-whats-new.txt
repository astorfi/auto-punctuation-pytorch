Apple took care of the cycled iPhone refresh last month at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, and thus it was logical for the company to move on to the iPad lineup next. As such, Tim Cook and Co. today revealed a new generation of tablets, including a redesigned, thinner and lighter iPad Air and the long-rumored, much-awaited iPad mini with Retina display. Of course, there are more changes under the hood, so join us after the jump, where we'll break down the spec sheets of each and see how they stack up against last year's models.
