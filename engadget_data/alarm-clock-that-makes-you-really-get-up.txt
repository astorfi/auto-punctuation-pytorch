This one falls somewhere in the area of a thesis project, but a couple of students at the Interaction Design
Institute Ivrea have come up with a hanging radio alarm clock called the Sfera that's designed to really get you out of
bed in the morning. The clock itself actually hangs from a string, and automatically raises itself a little bit higher
off the ground every time you hit snooze, in turn forcing you to actually get up out of bed if you want to turn it
off.
