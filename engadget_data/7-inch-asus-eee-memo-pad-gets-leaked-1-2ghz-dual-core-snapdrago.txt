This go 'round, we're looking at what's purportedly the 7-inch Eee Memo Pad, a handy little fellow that we've actually heard about before. We're told that it'll ship with a 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon processor, 16GB to 64GB of internal storage space, built-in 3G, WiFi and a 1,280 x 800 screen resolution, and it's apt to be revisited at CES 2012 before launching as an Asia-only product later in the year. It's hard to say what edition of Android will pop up when this is formally unveiled next week at CES, but we're guessing that it'll stick its tongue out at the long-awaited Padfone as it's introduced, regardless.
