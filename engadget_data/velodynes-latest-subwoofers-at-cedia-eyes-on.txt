It's tough enough to take decent photographs as-is, but when the floor underneath of you is rumbling the entire time, crisp images are even harder to come by. So yeah, you'll have to forgive us if any of the pics of Velodyne's latest families are a tad out of focus, but believe us when we say every single one was fit for a king. Or a rock star. Or you.
