The patent for this was filed over a year and a half ago, but c'mon, is anyone all that surprised that Apple has at
least been experimenting with a wireless iPod, a WiPod, if you will? A patent published on Thursday but that Apple
filed in April of last year talks about a wirelessly-enabled handheld player that can beam music and information to
multiple other media devices, a docking station for communicating with other devices, and something about wirelessly
transmitting "media items" to a handheld device over a network. No mention of what wireless standard might be involved
(maybe Apple is just waiting for 802.11n to get going), but don't be shocked if they roll out a new a wireless iPod
next year that can beam music to an AirPort Express and wirelessly sync up with a computer.
