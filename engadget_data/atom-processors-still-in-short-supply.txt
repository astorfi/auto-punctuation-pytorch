 It's been mostly hugs and cupcakes for Intel's Atom processors lately -- they're apparently selling like hotcakes, and they're the stars of the Intel Developer Conference this week. But although Intel was confidently predicting that supply would meet demand by next month, it sounds like Atoms might still be hard to come by -- PC World quotes an unnamed ASUS exec as saying there's a "serious shortage" of the chips, leading the PC manufacturer to turn to Celeron chips to meet demand. Intel reps are sticking to the party line and saying that the supply issue will be resolved by the end of the third quarter, but we'll see how it goes -- something tells us ASUS isn't helping itself out too much by cranking out an endless string of Atom-based Eee PCs, either.
