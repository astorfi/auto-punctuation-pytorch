Don't be, it's a lot less than a lot of people are willing to pay right now. At the Nintendo event later today in New York (we'll be there) we'll catch a glimpse of the 25 game announcements preparing to be made, as well as more official launch details -- but in the mean time we know it'll ship with Wii Sports (baseball, bowling, golf, and tennis -- all very addictive), Super Mario Galaxy will not ship in 2006 (boo!), it'll have a photo streaming service, news and weather channels (most likely a part of WiiConnect24, but still a bit bizarre), and Opera for browsing the web; new titles will run you $50, while Virtual Console games will cost between $5 and $10 apiece. But really this stuff is all you really needed to know, isn't it? November 19th, $250. November 19th, $250. And yes, they're still apparently on track to meet their four million unit goal for their 2006 launch. Still, stay tuned for more deets, they're inevitable.P.S. -Why are you still here? Shouldn't you be reading Joystiq's live coverage of the Nintendo event going on in Tokyo right now?[Via Wii Fanboy]Update: We've heard from our Japanese correspondent that the Wii will not ship bundled with Wii Sports! Bummer!
