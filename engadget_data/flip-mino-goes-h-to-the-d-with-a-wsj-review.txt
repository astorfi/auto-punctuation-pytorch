But with a retail price of $230, it's best to temper your expectations of the new Flip Mino HD. For that price you get about an hour's worth of fixed zoom, 720p, MPEG-4 video recorded to 4GB of built-in flash memory. Plug the USB cam into your PC or Mac to launch the built-in FlipShare editing software for fine-tuning your videos before sharing (compressed down to 480x270) to MySpace, YouTube or direct over email -- HD sharing via an unnamed partner is coming early next year according to Pure. Walt's buddy, Katie Boehret, over at the Wall Street Journal already put hands to gear and came away duly impressed by the video and improved sound quality. The she-Walt also found the FlipShare software to be much improved over the Flip's previous bundled wares while the camera remained dead-simple to use. All in all, well worth the $50 premium over the previous Flip Mino. Sample video posted after the break.
