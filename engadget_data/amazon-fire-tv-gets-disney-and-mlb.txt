The launch of Flappy Bird Family last week probably wasn't going to make you rush to buy a Fire TV any time soon, but don't worry -- Amazon has a few more aces up its sleeve. The Android-powered media hub is now getting a slew of extra apps, many of which expand the video selection to areas that Amazon simply can't cover. You can now tune into MLB.tv and WWE Network if you need a live sports fix (real or otherwise), and you can entertain your kids with Animal Planet and Watch Disney. If you're the patient type, you'll also be glad to hear that NFL Now, Watch ABC, A&E and Dailymotion are due later this year. These additions likely won't make you chuck your Apple TV or Roku box, but they might get you thinking about a Fire TV if you'd previously ruled it out.
