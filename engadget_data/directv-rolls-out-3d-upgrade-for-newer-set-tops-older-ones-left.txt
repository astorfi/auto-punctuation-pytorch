Today DirecTV started rolling out an update so its H21 and HR21 (and higher) receivers were 3D aware, but left the first generation H.264 HD receivers out. So instead of forcing customers to manually select side by side 3D, they have to upgrade their receiver. We're sure there are other benefits to the upgrade, like a 3D guide or something, and other features the latest hardware offers, but still. The other item of concern is that the set-top does check to make sure your 3DTV is up to the challenge and we've posted the compatible 3DTVs below. Just about every 3D set available today is on the list and even the older Mitsubishi DLPs will work if you have the checkerboard converter.
