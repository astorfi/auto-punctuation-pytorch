Following in the footsteps of SteelSeries, Creative has put together a customized set of high-end headphones catering specifically to the millions of Warcraftsmen (has anyone used that term before, can we copyright it?) out there, who need comfortable cans for lengthy raiding sessions. They'll come in both wired and wireless flavors, and will be the first to feature THX TruStudio PC sound, which we're willing to bet makes as recognizable a difference as a butterfly flapping its wings somewhere in the Amazon. BlizzCon kicks off this Friday, so you shouldn't have to wait long to grab a pair of your own.
