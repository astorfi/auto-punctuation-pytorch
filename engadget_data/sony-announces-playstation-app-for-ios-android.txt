The aptly named PlayStation app promises to expand gameplay to a player's iOS or Android device, propagating in-game maps, social networking tools or simply an easier way to access the PlayStation store. The application's functionality sounds an awful lot like the Wii U GamePad, though Sony hasn't mentioned if off-screen play via tablet will be a possibility. Even if that function doesn't come to your smartphone or tablet, it's definitely available on PlayStation Vita, which fills out the rest of the company's second screen plans with its remote play feature.
