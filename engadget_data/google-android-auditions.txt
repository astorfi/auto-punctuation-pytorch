There's been a bit of speculation as to what moniker version 5.0 of Google's mobile OS would take on when it arrives this fall. In a new promo video, the Android faithful are taunted with possibilities like Lemon Meringue Pie, Lemon Drop, Lady Finger and Lava Cake. Oreo is mentioned as a dark horse candidate, and it could be an option if Google decided to stick with the branded snack theme (and skips a few letters). A couple of rumored names are noticeably absent, too: Lollipop and Licorice. Of course, we'll know soon enough when a new statue is installed in Mountain View.
