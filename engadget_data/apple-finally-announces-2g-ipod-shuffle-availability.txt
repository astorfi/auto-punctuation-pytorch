   
Us and Brad, we were on to Apple's game, since Brad let us know on Sunday that his 2G iPod shuffle pre-order was due for delivery on November 3rd; but now Apple has gone official with the November 3rd date for "worldwide availability." We're sure you know exactly what this new shuffle will be packing when it drops on Friday, but we'll run it down one more time for old time's sake: 1GB of flash, 240 songs, $79, 12 hours of battery life, all packed into half a cubic inch in volume. We suppose we'll know on Friday if Her Matchbook-ness was really worth the wait.
