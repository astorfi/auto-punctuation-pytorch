The OrigenAE S210 features a 12-inch touchscreen LCD, space for 12 hard drives (withheat sinks that will supposedly keep them going without a meltdown), and hidden card readers and DVD drive (they'rebehind the LCD). Yes, if you want this, you'll have to do a lot of the work yourself, but with a foundation like thisto build on, just think of the media monster you'll be able to create.[Via eHomeUpgrade]
