 

We had a great time combing through your Frankengadget mash-ups, and while there were many worthy submissions, we sadly had to narrow it down to just five. Our submission deadline has since passed, but now the real fun begins -- it's time to vote! Scroll through the gallery at the bottom of this post, then make your pick in the poll below, selecting just one winner (you can use the thumbs above as your guide). Your top selection's creator will get to take home their very own copy of Adobe Creative Suite 5.5. Voting closes at 12PM ET on Friday, and the winner will be announced on the Engadget Show later that evening, so stay tuned!%Poll-70022%
