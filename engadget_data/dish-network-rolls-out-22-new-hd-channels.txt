       If you still believe that the fate of AMC-14 was going to get in the way of DISH Network rolling out new HD channels, you have to give up on that one because last night DISH announced the addition of 22 new HD channels including some that only its biggest competitor, DirecTV currently carries. Of the 22 channels, most are stretch-o-vision, but at least hold promise and a few have popped up recently unannounced. The biggest win is for news and movie fans as CNN HD, CNBC HD, ESPNews HD and a few movie channels top the list. The full list after the jump.[Thanks, Scott]
