  As we rub our eyes and squint at the sliver of a label on the FCC report, we can clearly see it reads Toshiba AT300. This, as you may recall, was the model number worn by the Japan-only 10.1 inch Regza tab. But wait! We can also read "Excite 10 AT300" and "Excite 10 305" on the same report, suggesting this is actually one of the new trio of Excites revealed just yesterday. Makes sense, seeing as the new 10-incher needs to have all its paperwork sorted by May 6th.
