 They're back; Google has restored the tethering applications pulled from the Android Market earlier this week. What, can't you see them? That's because you live in the US. In a statement sent to affected developers, Google says:We inadvertently unpublished your application for all mobile providers; if you like, we can restore your app so that all Android Market users outside the T-Mobile US network will have access to your application.Thanks so much T-Mobile US, Google.[Thanks, Chris]
