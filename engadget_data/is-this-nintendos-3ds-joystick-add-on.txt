A page from the magazine (above) shows a rather meaty cradle hugging the sides of the stereoscopic clamshell, reportedly adding an R2 button in addition to a starboard circle pad. The plump peripheral may have been designed specifically for Monster Hunter Tri G, an unannounced (and unconfirmed) game that was leaked in the same issue. Famitsu made no mention of the reported hardware refresh that accompanied the last analog add-on rumor -- and price, release date, and official confirmation from Nintendo are still AWOL, of course.

Update: Kotaku seems to have an official confirmation from Nintendo: "We can confirm that Nintendo plans to release the Circle Pad attachment, but Nintendo's regional subsidiaries will make further announcements about its availability at a later date."
