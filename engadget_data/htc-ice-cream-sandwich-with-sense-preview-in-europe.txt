   HTC's already said it plans on handing out ICS treats in late March, but the Taiwanese mobile sensation wants to give a selected few the chance to join an early taste test. The Ice Cream Sandwich party is a fairly exclusive affair, with HTC restricting admission to those of you living in the EU and rockin' a Sensation or its Beats-sporting XE variant. The outfit's given no further deets as to how it'll spread the goods -- and to how many more handsets -- or if the teaser will ever make its way to US-based folks. Regardless, we're sure you're hoping to be amongst the chosen ones -- and please do hit us up if at any point you're surprised by a tasty 4.0 update.
