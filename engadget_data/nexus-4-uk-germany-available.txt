 Canadians got their crack at it yesterday, and it looks like today's the day that those in the UK and Germany will have another chance to order a Nexus 4. Google has sent out emails informing subscribers that the phone will again be available to order from the Play store in Germany at 5:00PM CET (less than an hour from now), and from the UK store at 5:00PM GMT. Once again, there's no indication of quantities available, but if past history is any indication it's a good bet that they'll sell out fairly quickly.

 [Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
