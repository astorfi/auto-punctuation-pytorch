Then you may want to try to get your hands on this seemingly official Qosmio laptop, which transforms into everyone's favorite cassette-playing Autobot, Blaster. Unfortunately, this particular Blaster can't actually play cassettes, and the laptop isn't actually a laptop either. It is, however, a fully functional four-port USB hub, which makes... sense? Not surprisingly, such wonders are a bit hard to come by 'round here, but folks in Japan (or those willing to go the importing route) will apparently be able to pick one up for Â¥3,980, or about $40.[Via Coolest Gadgets]
