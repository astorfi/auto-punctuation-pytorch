Why the company didn't bundle this announcement with the MWC stuff is unclear -- but with the E55, E75, and N86 all unveiled in Barcelona, maybe they're just looking to give the new gear some spotlight time of its own. Actually, calling this "gear" might be overstepping -- for all we know, Nokia could simply be announcing new Comes With Music markets or something along those lines -- but naturally, our hearts and minds are always pining for new hardware. Look for this to go down at 10:00AM Central European Time on Wednesday the 11th, which works out to a bright 'n early 5AM for you New Yorkers, so bring plenty of coffee with the popcorn. Any good theories?
