Though details are sketchy, the K-m looks to be a lower-cost take on the K10D, with the same 10.2 megapixel Sony sensor and in-body stabilization but a lighter and smaller plastic case and slightly larger 2.7-inch LCD display. Sadly, there's no live view, but if the rumored pricing -- €500 ($725) for the single (18-55m) lens and €600 ($875) for the 2-lens kit (18-55mm and 50-200mm) -- is accurate that might not be a dealbreaker. We'll find out soon.[Via 1001 Noisy Cameras]
