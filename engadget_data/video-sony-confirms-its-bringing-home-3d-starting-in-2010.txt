The initiative is "starting in 2010" and will expand through BRAVIA LCD HDTVs, VAIO machines, PlayStation 3, and Blu-ray discs... and not in the press release, but we clearly see a CyberShot digital camera in the promotional video (look out, Fujifilm). It's hard to say from the wording if all the listed product lines will go 3D next year, but from what we gather there'll at least be BRAVIA sets in time for that Christmas. Curious see the zaniest video this side of the second dimension? Well, we don't have that, but you can giggle your way through Sony's promo after the break.
