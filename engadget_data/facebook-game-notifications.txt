Everyone is friends with that one guy who can't stop playing Facebook games -- and who more importantly, can't stop asking you to join him. Now a request from your BFF can tell you he's in the market for an extra cow in FarmVille without forcing you to load up your own virtual farm up to see what he wants. At GDC Wednesday Facebook announced it's giving developers the option to add a little more detail to notifications. So instead of a generic "request" you'll know specifically what your buddy is hoping for. Facebook is responsible for an astounding 735 million referrals into games every day, and more than 375 million people play Facebook-connected games every month. Detailed notifications are a small change, but one that could make the Facebook gaming experience slightly less annoying for everyone.
