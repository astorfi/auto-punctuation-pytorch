It seems the boys and girls in Mountain View took a quick breather to commission one of the crazier stop-action short films we've seen in a while -- and probably the craziest stop-action unboxing we've ever seen. If you questioned the Nexus One's real ultimate power before watching this, you won't any longer. Follow the break for video!
