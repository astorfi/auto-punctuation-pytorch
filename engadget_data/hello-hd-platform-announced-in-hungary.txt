Middleware developer Osmosys has teamed up with Advanced Digital Broadcast in order to deliver the Hungarian satellite and cable operator Hello HD Platform with an "end-to-end solution" for the nation's "first commercial high-definition offering." Unfortunately, we're not told what kind of HD programming viewers in the area can expect, but considering that the go-live date is set for May 1st, you won't be waiting long to find out.
