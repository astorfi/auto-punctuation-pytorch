Well, just about anything -- but we especially like the name that T-Mobile Netherlands has allegedly chosen for its next Android phone, the simple, elegant "G1 Touch." We don't know what phone this'll be, necessarily -- the G1 trademark is owned by T-Mobile, so technically, we suppose this could even be a non-HTC device -- but odds are this is the local market's version of the HTC Magic that's now been launched on a number of carriers around the world. We can all agree this is a pretty good name, yeah?
