Motorola just sent us this "Tablet Evolution" teaser video for their CES 2011 announcements, and it doesn't mince any words -- it calls the iPad a "giant iPhone" and says the Samsung Galaxy Tab is running Android "for a phone" before closing out with a buzzing bee over that new red Motorola logo. That certainly suggests some Honeycomb action to us -- and it fits perfectly with Andy Rubin demonstrating the next-gen version of Android on a Motorola tablet back at D: Dive Into Mobile. You know, the tablet that's since leaked out with a Verizon logo on it. Yeah, we're ready for this to go down -- and you know we'll be there live as it happens.
