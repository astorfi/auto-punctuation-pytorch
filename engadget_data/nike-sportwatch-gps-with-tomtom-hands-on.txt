That "GPS" part is important, see, because the watch was developed in cooperation with the navigation wizards at TomTom -- in fact, a TomTom logo is prominently featured below the dot matrix LCD. Really, the SportsWatch GPS isn't much different than other high-end GPS fitness watches on the market, it's just got that typical dash of Nike style in the case, the band, and in the hipster lower-case UI. Our second feature might be the "slap" gesture -- slapping the display enables the backlight or indicates a lap while you're in the middle of a run. Our favorite feature, though, might be the PC connectivity: you flip a hinge on one end of the band to reveal a USB plug and you're good to go. As with other Nike+ products, you can store your runs in the system's online community or let the watch collect up to 50 runs offline. Follow the break for the press release and a video demo, which we cordially ask you to avoid watching unless you're on... you know, a StairMaster or something.
