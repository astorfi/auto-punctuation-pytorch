Good-natured Xbox Live gamers sometimes face a tough choice: they either have to isolate themselves in parties or risk playing against griefers and other ne'er-do-wells. Microsoft could avoid that horrible scenario in the Xbox One era with its recently unveiled Reputation system, which the company just explained in detail to OXM. We already know that the system will punish frequently reported players, but it should also reward contributors. Xbox Live Rewards participants may get a higher Reputation score, for example. The system also pressures troublemakers by ranking parties based on the lowest common denominator -- one misfit can spoil the whole bunch. We'll have to wait until November to verify Microsoft's promises, but we're expecting more harassment-free public matches in our future.
