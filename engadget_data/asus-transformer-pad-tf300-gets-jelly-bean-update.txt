ASUS hinted, just this morning, that Jelly Bean might be on its way to some of its devices via the company's Facebook page. Now, we're getting reports from Transformer Pad TF300 owners that the update has landed. ASUS was even kind enough to beat its own estimate (for the TF300, at least) by a significant measure. Could this mean the TF700 update is on its way? Our advice? Keep mashing that "Check now" just to make sure.
