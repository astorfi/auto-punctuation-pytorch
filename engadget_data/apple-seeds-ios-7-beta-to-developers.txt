It seems like Apple just rolled out its iOS 7 beta 4 -- and its bevy of bug fixes -- to developers, but Cupertino is already seeding the next build. The iOS 7 beta 5 is available as an OTA download via Software Update, and we imagine it will bring even more performance tweaks this time around. Registered devs can hit up the source link to learn more, while the rest of us will have to be content with knowing the mobile OS must be getting pretty close to a public release.
