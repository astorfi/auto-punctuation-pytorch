 

Acer's had its day (or two) unveiling back-to-school laptops, and now it's its sister brand Gateway's turn. The outfit just announced the 15.6-inch NV series and the 14-inch ID47, both of which include USB 3.0 and a choice of Sandy Bridge processors. (In the case of that entry-level NV, you can also opt for one of AMD's fresh-off-the-line Llano chips.) But the company did more than just give its notebooks a spec bump -- it also tweaked their designs, adding a chiclet keyboard to the NV series, while the metal-clad ID's trackpad is 20 percent larger and no longer glows like a mood ring. The ID47 also has a 14-inch display crammed into a chassis usually paired with 13.3-inch panels, as well as a non-removable battery that promises up to eight hours of juice. (The NV is rated for up to four hours.) And, in an unusual twist, our friends in Canada will get additional choices, including a 15.6-inch version of the ID, as well as select models with NVIDIA Optimus. Both the ID47 and NV55 / NV57 are available now, with the ID starting at $629.99 and $799 Canadian, and the NV fetching $529.99 and $499 Canadian. Check out the various configurations after the break, with lots 'o photos below.

Update: Lots of you are asking about the screen resolution on these guys. It's not in the press release, but the answer is 1366 x 768, across the board.

Both updated lines feature incredibly stylish designs in the most in-demand sizes, powered by the latest in mobile technology. 			The Gateway ID47 Series breaks new ground by fitting its 14-inch HD widescreen back-lit LED display with full edge-to-edge glass into a chassis typically used for smaller 13.3-inch models. The Gateway NV Series features a new sleek design with a large 15.6-inch display and instant social media connections. Both feature USB 3.0 for fast transfers and device charging.  Gateway ID Series for Creativity, Mobility with an Attitude			The fashionable look and feel of the new Gateway ID Series is the perfect complement for today's on-the-go savvy computer user. The sculpted edges, elegant blend of finishes and sleek form factor of the ID Series will inspire creativity for digital media creation and enjoyment as well as fluid social networking. It comes in two designs – the "Infinity Blue Liquid" design resembles tranquil water; while the "Brushed Platinum" design conveys an industrial modern feel. Both designs come in an aluminum cover with a stainless steel laser-engraved logo. 			The Gateway ID47 Series' ultra slim design and 14-inch HD widescreen LED display with eye- catching sleek edge-to-edge glass delivers maximum enjoyment and usefulness in an ultra-compact design. In addition to the larger display, customers will be able to enjoy an integrated DVD drive. Customer usability was top-of-mind when designing the comfortable keyboard and wrapped edgeless touchpad, which is more than 20 percent larger than the previous generation, giving customers more room to navigate and use multi-gestures. 			In addition, the Gateway ID Series gives quick access to digital media with capacitive touch media keys for easy control of features such as play, forward, pause and volume control. The Gateway ID Series boasts High-Definition audio support with Dolby Home Theater v4 Audio that delivers crisp and clear sound through its full-length mesh speaker bar. All of these capabilities fit into the ID Series' slim chassis that measures only 12.97(W) x 8.95(D) x 0.85-1.13(H) inches, so it is comfortable to carry and fits easily into a briefcase or book bag. The notebooks are powered by second-generation Intel® CoreTM processors. 			"Notebook PCs are a constant companion in today's mobile savvy culture, as we transition through recreation and productivity," said Steve Smith, senior product marketing manager, for Gateway notebooks. "The stylish new Gateway ID and Gateway NV Series deliver very useful extras for entertainment and social networking and a big boost in performance wrapped up in elegant designs. They are ideal for customers who want the latest in chic, modern style and don't want to compromise in performance."  NV Series Elegant Design with Cinematic Entertainment			The Gateway NV Series balances exceptional performance for everyday HD entertainment and seamless social networking with a large gorgeous 15.6-inch HD widescreen LED-backlit display for cinematic widescreen viewing of movies, games, websites and more. 			The new Gateway NV Series models feature an elegant and modern design that is ideal for today's style-conscious mobile PC users. The system features either a subtle geometric pattern or the digital wave pattern on the matte chassis lid. The interior is clean and uncluttered with a comfortable chiclet-style keyboard and corresponding pattern on the palm rest. 			The new NV57 Series provides excellent mobile performance with second-generation Intel® CoreTM processors with Intel HD Graphics 3000 with 128MB of dedicated system memory. The new NV55 Series provides great performance while maximizing battery-life with new AMD A-Series processors.  USB 3.0 for Speedy Transfers and Additional Connections			The new Gateway ID and Gateway NV lines both feature a USB 3.0 port, which works up to 10 times faster than the standard USB 2.0, a 25GB HD movie can be transferred in just over a minute. The USB 3.0 port will even charge USB devices when asleep, in hibernation mode, or when turned off completely. With the notebook acting as a charging station, consumers can leave behind a plethora of consumer electronic power adapters, such as those used to charge phones, MP3 players and digital cameras. In addition to the USB 3.0 port, both feature USB 2.0 ports. 			Both the ID Series and NV Series are ideal for entertainment and productivity, providing all the ports customers need to connect to their devices such as camcorders and digital cameras, printers and more. They feature HDMI 1080p output, so customers can use a convenient single-cable connection to deliver HD video and audio to an external source. The notebooks feature media card readers that accept popular media cards.  Social Networking, Connectivity and Long Battery Life			Both the new Gateway ID and Gateway NV Series deliver instant social networking with quick-use hot keys that gives customers quick access to their social networks on Facebook, YouTube and Flickr. Pushing the button launches an integrated widget that lets customers easily make updates to their own sites by posting information, images and video, while also enjoying updated status feeds of friends, family and colleagues. 			Keeping up on social networks is incredibly easy with the connectivity options in the new Gateway ID and Gateway NV Series. The notebook PCs come with integrated 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi Certified for a fast, reliable connection to hotspots and wireless networks. Plus, the integrated HD 1.3MP webcam provides top-quality audio and video recording for crisp and clear high-resolution images for online chats and capturing video and photos. 			In addition to providing superb performance, PowerSmart Technology provides extra long battery uptime. The Gateway ID Series can provide up to 8 hours of battery life, while the Gateway NV Series provides up to 4 hours of battery life. In addition, customers will enjoy a long battery lifecycle of up to four years.  Back-up with a Single Touch			Since today's mobile-savvy customers want to take their videos, photos and other files with them, the Gateway ID and Gateway NV Series notebooks feature MyBackup functionality. With it, customers can protect, save and migrate data, so they can keep enjoying all their important files.  Select Models in Canada Deliver Enhanced Performance with NVIDIA Optimus Graphics			In Canada, the Gateway ID Series is also available with a large 15.6-inch HD widescreen LED backlit display. In addition, select models of the new Gateway ID Series feature NVIDIA Optimus graphics technology, which intelligently balances the notebook's use of dedicated NVIDIA GeForce GT graphics or integrated Intel HD graphics, depending on the task its performing. The notebooks will use NVIDIA GeForce GT dedicated graphics while running video, games and multimedia applications to ensure visuals are incredibly crisp and clear. Alternately, the notebook will switch to integrated Intel HD graphics when less demanding programs are being used, such as browsing websites, or working on documents and spreadsheets. As a result, the NVIDIA Optimus technology ensures that battery life is extended for longer enjoyment.  Software, Pricing and Availability			The new Gateway ID and Gateway NV Series notebooks are ready to use right out of the box with Windows® Home 7 as well as useful extras including Nook for PC, Adobe Flash Player 10.1, Adobe Reader, WildTangent Demo Games, Skype, Norton Online Backup, and Microsoft® Office 2010 (preloaded for online purchase).
