 Does a theoretical max of 280Mbps (yes, we said two hundred and frickin' eighty megabits per second) downstream to your phone sound good? Yeah? Then get familiar with this name: "Ultra Mobile Broadband." That's the catchphrase the CDMA Development Group has chosen as its go-to-market term for the set of standards supported by EV-DO Revision C, the latest proposed evolution of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO. Of course, we have to wait for EV-DO Revision B -- with its mere theoretical 73.5Mbps down -- to come and go first, meaning that UMB is lining up for 2Q '07 standard finalization and a commercial introduction some time in the wee months of 2009. Not to be a buzzkill or anything, though, Cingular; we're sure we're going to love your 7.2Mbps HSDPA just fine.[Via Geekzone]
