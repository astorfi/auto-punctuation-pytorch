Helping it earn that self-proclaimed distinction is the 13 watt LED at the heart of the bulb, which provides the equivalent output of a 100 watt incandescent bulb, and its EvoDim feature, which will let switch between three different output settings (250, 750, and 950 lumens) without a special dimmer switch. Of course, all those light bulb bragging rights don't come cheap, with each bulb setting you back a hefty $100, although the company promises that'll work out to less than $6 per year by the time the bulb finally gives up. If that's a bit too much for you, you can also get non-dimmable versions $80.
