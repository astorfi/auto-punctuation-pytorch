 
We wereso unbelievably overwhelmed with cakes for our 2nd birthdaycontest that we couldn't very well just let them all go to waste. Obviously we wish we could give everyone a prizeto say thanks for baking us a treat forour birthday, but instead we've got three days' worth of Engadget birthday cake galleries to show 'em all off. Sobust out your toothbrushes everyone, it's time to have your cake and eat it too. Thanks for making this the bestbirthday Engadget ever had, even if it's only one of two.
