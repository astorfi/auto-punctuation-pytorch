 Remember that completely insane crime wave that hit when Sony's hotly anticipated PlayStation 3 finally rushed onto the scene in very limited numbers? Yeah, well that side of humanity is rearing its ugly head again, as an employee perished when legions of crazed Black Friday shoppers blazed through the doors of a Long Island Walmart. The worker was an overnight store clerk who was simply trying to hold back the crowds before the doors officially opened at 5:00AM. According to Jimmy Overby, another employee at the store: "They took the doors off the hinges. He was trampled and killed in front of me." Words to the wise: either do your Black Friday shopping from the safety of your own home, or be careful, cool, calm and collected when you venture out.
