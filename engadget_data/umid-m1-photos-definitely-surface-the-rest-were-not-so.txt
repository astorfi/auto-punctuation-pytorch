At least we've reached a consensus (or so we think) on some of the essentials: weighing in at 0.7 pounds, this guy sports a 4.8-inch (1024 x 600) touchscreen, a 1.1GHz Atom processor, up to 1GB memory, up to 32GB SSD, WiBro / HSDPA / WiMAX / WiFi / Bluetooth, a 1.3 megapixel camera, mini USB 2.0, and an SD/USIM card. The device is shipping with Linux -- which may come as a surprise to whomever ordered its Windows and Internet Explorer keys. CNET states that pre-orders start February 13th for 512MB models, while according to AVING they hit the street on the 20th. This thing will set you back about $500 and is only available in Korea. Maybe. One thing we do know, however -- we got more pics for you after the break.Read - CNETRead - AVING
