You heard right, Intec has unveiled a third-party power brick "to replace your lost or malfunctioning" one, which sports an internal cooling fan "to keep your Xbox 360 cooler during operation." It also boasts three status lights of the green, orange, and red variety, which informs you if the brick is "OK, in stand-by mode, or currently malfunctioning." Aside from having a built-in indicator for telling you just how bad things could get, the 0.85-pound device doesn't even include the wall plug to connect your newfangled power supply to an AC outlet. So even if you had the slightest inclination to save your Xbox 360 from impending overheating via this overpriced accessory, be sure your power cord isn't of the recalled variety before plugging up.[Via Xbox 360 Fanboy]
