The Korea-based company may not have a large smartphone presence in the West, but it throws together some decent devices at home. The latest in its Android lineup is the Vega Racer, the world's first superphone with a 1.5 GHz dual-core chip inside. With plans to go on sale later this month on SK-Telecom, it's got some real power under the hood with Qualcomm's MSM8660 Snapdragon chip, 1GB RAM, and Adreno 220 GPU. On top of these killer specs, the Racer also sports a 4.3-inch Sharp ASV TFT LCD display with 800x480 WVGA resolution, dual cameras at 8MP / 1.3MP, and 1650 mAh battery. Not bad for a phone that weighs 120g (4.23 oz) and is 9mm thin. Apart from the Vega Racer, Pantech is hopping on the tablet bandwagon and development is said to be "in full swing." When those slates will swing into retail, however, remains to be seen.
