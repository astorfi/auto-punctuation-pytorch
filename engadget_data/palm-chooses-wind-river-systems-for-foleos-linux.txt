Reportedly, Wind River Platform for Consumer Devices, Linux Edition has been chosen as the "open standard Linux platform for future Palm Foleo software releases," and Palm seems to think that this will "help speed applications to market while still meeting the requirements for a stable and robust open mobile platform." Palm's Mark Bercow was also quoted as saying that the company hopes that building the Foleo on an open Linux-based platform and publishing the tools developers need will enable "a vibrant developer community to create new applications that extend the mobile companion's built-in capabilities." Regrettably, there's still no mention of a hard release date, but at least you open-sourcers can start dreaming up ways to better this thing as soon as it hits shelves.
