This week, Ben and Steve soldier on without Engadget's consigliere, Nilay. Plenty of streaming news this week involving Hulu disappearing from Boxee, our how-to on automating downloads to a Media Center PC, March Madness coming into your cubicle courtesy Silverlight, and Netflix's plans for a streaming-only option next year. VUDU is selling HD and HDX content, not just renting it; and even though we disagree on the importance of this step, it is a step in the right direction nonetheless. A much bigger step is the more widespread adoption of Blu-ray/DVD combo packs, even if you won't be watching those Blu-ray discs on a Blu-ray recorder unit anytime soon. We then talk about aspect ratios -- HD 101 had a nice feature showing why we opt for leaving black bars on some content as opposed to stretching or cropping, and for those who must have way to watch 2.35:1 features with minimal black bars, we suggest flying to Europe to pick up one of Philips' Cinema 21:9 super-wide screens. We wrap up with some finger-waggling at ION for hopping on the coattails of the bungled DTV transition to hype up its own HD launch.Get the podcast    [iTunes] Subscribe to the Podcast directly in iTunes (MP3).
