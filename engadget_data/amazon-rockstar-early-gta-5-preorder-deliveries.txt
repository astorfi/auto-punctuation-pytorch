Amazon could find itself struck off Rockstar Games' Christmas card list after it delivered Grand Theft Auto V preorders to customers in the UK in advance of its September 17th release. Some customers reported receiving shipping notifications over the weekend, with additional reports suggesting the game had made it to some doorsteps as early as Saturday. Games Industry says that the company is already investigating these early sales, although we wouldn't put it past some silent, rogue type like Claude from GTA 3. Microsoft is reportedly banning Xbox Live accounts belonging to those that shared early footage of the game, so if you did receive an early copy, make sure to refrain from sharing your impressive bank heists on social media and video sites until release day.
