A fact not lost on RIM it would appear, as it's set to released its "most affordable" Curve -- the 9220 -- over there. Naturally, the ubiquitous BBM service takes center stage, even having its own dedicated button. The new handset also comes fully laden with all the usual social networking goodies, and for the launch RIM's kindly throwing in a selection of apps from BlackBerry World worth 2500 rupees (about $50) if you get on board before June 30th. You might want to find a WiFi hotspot to download them though, as there's no 3G, but you can tune into Radio Mumbai via the FM receiver to take your mind off that omission. Camera-wise it's a fairly humble 2-megapixel affair, which combined with the memory card slot, should allow a stack of photos for sharing. Wondering exactly how affordable it is? Lay down 10,990 rupees (about $210,) and it's yours -- as of tomorrow that is.
