Those who signed up for it can see if their applications were accepted now, right back at the official Microsoft Connect page. If you're in, you'll see information and get access to a private Xbox.com forum so you can help sort out any bugs before it officially drops; if not, relax and play some Battlefield 3. Win / win.
