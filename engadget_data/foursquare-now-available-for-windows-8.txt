Foursquare revealed its plans for a Windows 8 app two months ago, and it's making good on its promise by launching the software today. This first tablet-specific version of Foursquare offers the check-in and location discovery features we've seen in the company's mobile apps, but in a very photo-centric interface that takes advantage of the extra screen space. Both the map view and location pages also expose more detail at the top level, such as nearby hotspots and associated lists. If you want to check into sushi bars with your Surface, you can grab Foursquare's app through the source link.
