Beware, Pocket and Instapaper: the folks at Facebook HQ are testing a feature that encroaches upon your "save-for-later" territory. This new function currently appears for some mobile users as an iBook bookmark-esque button next to status updates with links, although it actually saves the content of the link itself. You can access every saved link via a new menu (with a telltale name) under the Apps section. Before you get too excited for the feature, know that this is the second time Facebook's given it a spin -- the first iteration tested last year, however, archived status updates instead. If the save-for-later function does mak e it to everyone's accounts, though, we wouldn't be surprised if Facebook addicts remain even more glued to their screens.
