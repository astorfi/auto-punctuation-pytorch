Without question, the biggest newcomer is the GeForce GTX 280M, which NVIDIA claims is "the fastest laptop GPU on the market, with up to 50 percent more performance than previous generation enthusiast laptop GPUs." The company is also pushing out the somewhat less exciting GeForce GTX 260M, GTS 160M and GTS 150M, all of which feature the company's own CUDA compiling architecture and support PhysX gaming effects. ASUS, Clevo and MSI are all showcasing lappies based on the new GeForce GTX 200M and GeForce GTS 100M Series GPUs here in Hannover, though there's no word on when any of those mysterious machines will ship to drooling consumers.[Via HotHardware]
