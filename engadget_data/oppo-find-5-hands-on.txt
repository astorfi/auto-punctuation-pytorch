 Being our first time at an Oppo launch event, we were truly blown away by the efforts put into the quality show. And luckily, we can say the same for the phone itself. The Find 5 uses the same gorgeous five-inch 1080p screen as HTC's Droid DNA and Butterfly, but what really blew us away was the new phone's solid build quality -- a huge improvement from the older Finder we brought along, though the latter did achieve a 6.65mm thickness, whereas the new one comes in at 8.8mm thick. The Find 5's shape and feel also reminded us of Sony's Xperia S. It'll be about a month before Oppo pushes its new phone into various markets, so it'll be awhile before we get a review unit to test the various features. For now, enjoy our hands-on photos below.

 Update: Check out our hands-on video after the break!
