Sammy has also released more generations of Blu-ray decks than any other manufacturer at four. Sure, Samsung players have had a few problems, and with few exceptions customers have been forced to upgrade their units to get new features, but overall every previous Samsung player has been a solid performer -- thus, we don't expect you to be floored when hearing that the BD-P1500 fits the same mold. Also, like its predecessors, the BD-P1500 braves the way with new features, but unlike the original BD-P1000, there's a lot of competition now. But even so, we're still not sure how many will choose it over a PS3.
