 Wesnagged some details on the Sony Reader we'vebeen spying as well as some precious one-on-one time with the device. We should expect the device to be available inthe U.S. this spring (Europe will have to wait for some licensing issues to be worked out with publishers) with atarget date of April and a retail price between $299 and $399 depending on bundles accessories. The online book storewill launch with about 10,000 titles, with each book available for approximately 20-25% below regular retail price forthe physical copy. The display quality is very nice on the unit -- crisp and clear. The UI is fairly intuitive tonavigate and you've got several options for frequently used functions such as page turning.
      

 

 The unit reads PDF files as well as Sony's proprietary (anyone surprised?) BBeB format (stands for BroadbandElectronic Books). They will be releasing software for reading BBeB format on your computer so you can read booksyou've purchased on your PC as well as on the Reader, but apparently you can only "share" your copy of thebook with up to six other devices. When pressed for details about how this "document DRM" actually works, thePR rep we spoke with had zero information -- we asked whether a Mac version of the BBeB-reading software would bereleased but no word on that either.  There is a bookmark feature onthe Sony Reader such that you can mark multiple passages and pages for later reference, but there's no on-board searchcapability. There is search capability in the PC BBeB reader software, but we were told Sony's researchindicated on-board search wasn't a high priority for users (or at least the focus groups they asked, in any case). Theunit comes with a docking station for connecting to your computer, but there's also a standard USB port on the bottomof the unit in addition to the docking connector, so presumably you don't need to lug the dock around with you totransfer files on the go.
