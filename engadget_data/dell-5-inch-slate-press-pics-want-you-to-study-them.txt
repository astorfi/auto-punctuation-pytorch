 
Fresh from the CES vaults comes these images of Dell's 5-inch slate or, as the presser says, the "5-inch tablet concept." It runs Android, it may be called Streak, and we've got hands-on pics of it here. But you're not here for the ad hoc shots full of arms, hands and dirty fingernails; you're here for the glossy press pics, so we won't keep you any longer. Jump into the gallery and get your ogle on.
