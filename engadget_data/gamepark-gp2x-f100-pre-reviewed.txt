We weren't so sure about the Gamepark
GP2x-F100 at first â€” sure the capabilities are
great (Linux-powered, 3.5-inch QVGA LCD, SD slot, USB 2.0, 64MB flash, 32MB RAM, plays back MPEG, MPEG-4, Dvix, XviD,
WMV, MP3, OGG, and WMA), but the gamer looks and controls seemed slightly misleading. Turns out, though, that Gamepark
wasn't just fooling around about games and they are being very supportive of developers who are already porting
emulators and the ever-present Doom over to the system. GP2x news has a review translated from Korean of the
pre-release version of the device, including some nice pics that should give you a good idea of the menus and how it
stacks up against that other portable gaming
handheld.
