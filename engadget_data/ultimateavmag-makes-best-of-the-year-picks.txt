.com. The highlights include JVC's DLA-HD1 as projector of the year, Sony's 70-inch KDS-70XBR2 as RPTV of the year, Revel's $35K Ultima2 Studio2 System as speaker setup of the year and Onkyo's TX-SR875 as AV receiver of the year. In an interesting move, Sony's PlayStation 3 was chosen as disc player of the year due to its "speed and reliability," and Toshiba's HD-A30 took home budget product of the year honors. The standout victor in all of this was Pioneer's PDP-6010 KURO plasma, which isn't at all surprising considering the reviews. Granted, this isn't the first time a Pioneer PDP has grabbed the gold in similar competition, but this particular model snagged flat-panel of the year and product of the year medals on its way down the red carpet.
