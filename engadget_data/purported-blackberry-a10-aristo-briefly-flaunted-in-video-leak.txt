Hot on the heels of the BlackBerry Z10 getting an update to BB 10.1 and price cuts at various retailers, a future model to come out of Waterloo has apparently been leaked. In a video posted to YouTube, accessory maker Vivix gives a brief look at what's purported to be the A10 "Aristo." According to N4BB, the device sports a five-inch touchscreen, dual-core processor with a quad-core GPU and an eight-megapixel camera -- not to mention it matches up with a previously leaked image. Details are sparse beyond all that, but you can at least grab look for yourself in the video after the break.
