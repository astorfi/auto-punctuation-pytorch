Just connect the CEN-IPOD into one or more iPod Docks and the iPod interface is duplicated on the larger touch screen providing enhanced controls, sorting, and even photo viewing if your iPod supports 'em - everything you can do from the iPod and more. But why bother when you can link your entire digital library into your home entertainment system via a streaming media solution, rather than just ensuring access to those few choice nuggets synced to your iPod?
