For such a relaxing game, people get all sorts of worked up over their golf swing, you know? Well, you can rest
easier at night knowing that the Top Swing robot golf trainer can make you—a former greenskeeper—a Cinderella boy out
of nowhere. The machine guides you on vectors that allow you to feel exactly what the optimal swing is for your game;
if you're pro, it analyzes your swing to show you where you need to improve. Ah, finally, we'll be able to whoop our
boss on the course! Then again, maybe it might be best for your career not to be a pro on the links.
