Most interesting of the lot is the latter, the NV24HD, which is the company's first HD still camera, a 10-megapixel shooter that also does 720p HD, and can send its juicy images via HDMI to your favorite HDTV. The NV40, on the other hand, is a 10-megapixel camera with 3 x zoom, ISO up to 3200, and a 2.5-inch LCD display. The NV30 is a similarly spec'd camera, but drops the resolution to 8-megapixels (though retains the company's ASR and red eye reduction features). The story is largely the same for the NV4, which the company claims is a "practical yet multipurpose" device. The NV24HD will run you £249 (or $491), the NV40 comes in at £199 ($392), £179 for the NV30, and the NV4 will run you £149 ($294). All in all, pretty boring!Read - Samsung NV24HDRead - Samsung NV30Read - Samsung NV40[Via PhotographyBLOG]
