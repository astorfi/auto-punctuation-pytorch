Today, though, it just got a little less attractive thanks to a move by Viacom to block full episodes from streaming on your Logitech Revues and your Sony Internet TVs and the like. We've confirmed with our own Revue that attempting to stream episodes from network sites like MTV, Nickelodeon, and Comedy Central show messages like "this content is not available for your device," which is an unfortunate and frustrating change. Yes, the user agent tweak still works, but wouldn't it be nice if we could all just get along? Surely Google is still working on its content partnership agreements and hopefully things will improve in the future, but given how friendly the company's past dealings with Viacom have been we're not optimistic about this particular front.
