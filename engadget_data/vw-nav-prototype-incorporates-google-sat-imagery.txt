The two services would seem to be a perfect match, but theyneed a little extra help from chipmaker/third-wheel Nvidia in order to handle the intense 3D imagery that results fromtheir courtship. The project is being spearheaded by Volkswagen's Palo Alto-based Electronics Research Laboratory, andaims to provide drivers with Google Earth-like birds-eye views of upcoming terrain. Suits at VW say there are nodefinite plans to commercialize this technology in production vehicles, but we bet that we'll be seeing someuber-cutesy Googlers Wanted commercials sooner rather than later.[Via NaviGadget,thanks Jim]
