 While the tech press was obsessively covering the onslaught of Ultra HD TVs and uncovering unlicensed celebrity headphones at CES 2013, the mainstream media were fawning over a fork. Now HAPIfork, the "smart" utensil with an altruistic mission and a healthy helping of tech baked in, is taking to Kickstarter for funding -- albeit two months later than originally reported. Starting today, the first 2,500 backers can get their hands on the Bluetooth-equipped fork for $89, with subsequent backers pitching in $99 for a device. Those who want to get in even earlier on the action can give $300 for a chance to be part of the beta program. The overall goal -- aside from getting you to masticate at a reasonable clip -- is set for $100,000 with fundraising ending May 31st. Devices are expected to ship to backers in Q3 and hit unspecified retail locations in the US and EU in Q4 this year.

 We got our hands (and mouths) on a prototype that HAPILABS president Andrew Carton referred to as 95 percent final. To find out how our lunch with the vibrating fork (and the Ahi Tuna) went down, check out our impressions after the break.
