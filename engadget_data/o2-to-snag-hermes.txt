Europeans, watch out, your carrier options on this one are broadening. Oh, and for those inquisitive for what the final spec sheet mightl ook like on this thing, T-Mo Germany's got their MDA Vario II product listing live (warning, pdf link!) which has all the stuff we pretty much knew (just made official), like quad-band GSM, HSDPA, 2 megapixel camera, WiFi, Bluetooth, and a scrollÂ  wheel.[Thanks, big fan; sheet via MSMobileNews]
