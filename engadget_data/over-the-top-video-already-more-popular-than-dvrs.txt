That gap isn't exactly closing though either, as the very same firm predicts that DVRs will continue to grow by about 33 percent to 63.1 million over the next four years, which is a little less than over-the-top is expected to grow. The real take away here though is that linear TV is going to die a slow death, but it is on its way out as it gets squeezed in both directions by high tech options.
