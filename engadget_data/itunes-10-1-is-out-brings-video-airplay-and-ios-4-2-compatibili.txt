If your copy of iTunes isn't pushing the update, you can head to Apple's page where it'll be there, waiting for you. In addition to paving way for the new iOS, iTunes 10.1 adds the much anticipated video AirPlay feature (it launched as audio only), so fire up that Apple TV and push yourself some vids!
