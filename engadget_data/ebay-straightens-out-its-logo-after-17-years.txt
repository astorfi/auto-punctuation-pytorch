 A lot has changed on the internet over the last 17 years, but one of the small constants has been eBay's decidedly 90s logo, which has remained colorful and off-kilter as others have shifted with the trends. Now, after all these years, it's finally making a clean break (mostly). The company today took the wraps off a whole new logo, one that retains the old colors but does away with the overlapping, non-conformist letters -- or, as eBay President Devin Wenig puts it, a logo that's "rooted in our proud history and reflects a dynamic future." You can find the company's full explanation of the change at the link below, and look for the logo itself to actually be put into use by eBay in mid-October.
