If you suffer from arachnophobia then your worst nightmare has just come true. Researchers at Osaka University have
developed a nearly two-foot long, six-limbed (ok, so technically not a spider) robot which can walk over uneven terrain
or even move by hanging from net-shaped wires (a web, dig). The robot, intended for disaster rescue and tunnel ceiling
inspection, carries a wireless video camera operated by remote control. That picture gives us the creeps, didn't the
Japanese learn anything in Son of Godzilla!?
