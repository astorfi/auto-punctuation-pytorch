The whole conception is flawed at the top because people don't read anymore." Yes, it's true, the only books Steve thinks we need are MacBooks.Irony: You're reading right now.Further irony: You're probably not reading Engadget on a Kindle (at least not through its regular RSS reader).Is this like geeky Koan or something? Does this mean Engadget doesn't exist? Either way, we get his point. It's a damn shame fewer people aren't reading real books.
