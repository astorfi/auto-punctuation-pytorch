After noticing not two, but three WWAN options on the CTO pages at HP, jkOnTheRun wrote in to figure out what was going on. In sum, those uncomfortable with choosing a dedicated AT&T or Verizon WWAN module can opt for an alternative that handles both networks -- and at no extra cost. HP has confirmed that the $199 option is indeed the two-faced Qualcomm Gobi, which theoretically allows you to use mobile broadband services from AT&T and Verizon if you happen to either relocate or have subscriptions with both. Now, if only the WWAN option wasn't >50% of the purchase price, we might actually consider it.
