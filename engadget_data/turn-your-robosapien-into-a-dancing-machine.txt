John Travolta ain't got nothin' on your bot, thanks to the Robosapien Dance Machine project â€” an open source
software program that turns your autonomous electronic friend into a disco inferno. With this tool you can create your
own command scripts for your robot via a drag-and-drop script editing environment. Make Robosapien do choreographed
moves in time with a chosen tune, do complex stunts, or act out a series of commands of your choosing. Or, program it
up for an audition to be the newest member of the next great boy band and make that robot earn its keep already.
