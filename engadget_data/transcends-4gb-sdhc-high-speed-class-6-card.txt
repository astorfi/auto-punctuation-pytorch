 Transcend is here to tell ya that they've got a special new SDHC card on the market. What's so special, you ask? Well, unlike those 4GB cards we've seen from Toshiba, Panasonic, and even Transcend themselves, this one's rated a class 6 on SDHC's 2/4/6 class scale. That means you're guaranteed a data rate of at least 6MB/sec making it a good choice for digital cameras and camcorders in need of some lickity quick SDHC storage. Oh wait, this just in, SanDisk's 4GB Ultra II SDHC card is also class 6 and was announced last month -- sorry Transcend, another second place. Available November for an undisclosed price. But as least you know who to compare it with now, right? [Via Impress]
