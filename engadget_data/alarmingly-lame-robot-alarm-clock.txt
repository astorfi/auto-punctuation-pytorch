Normally we wouldn't include any kind of robot-inspired alarm clock, but the fact that
this one requires an infrared gun to shoot once for snooze and twice for off, makes this clock just creepy enough to
introduce. We can't imagine anyone waking early for work, reaching for the remote-gun and
coherently hitting the snooze-trigger.
