The "ball" has a strap to keep you from actually throwing it, and in-game trajectories are calculated on the basis of the angle and force of your pseudo-throwing motion. If you're thinking the Wiimote can do all this even without a plush attachment, you'd be right, but then you'd just look silly jumping and juking in front of your TV without a proper accessory in hand.
