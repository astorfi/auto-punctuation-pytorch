It's hardly worthy of any presses being halted, but those interested in minor Google Drive updates should take notice. Google has just updated Docs and Slides to let users select text, click on said text, and have Google search results pop up in addition to users' own Drive documents. The point? Easy hyperlinking for related websites, which ought to be a boon for budding students or digital bookworms who prefer to annotate just about everything. As Google puts it:



"Starting today, the link tool now offers you suggestions based on the text you are hyperlinking just in case you don't have the URL you need offhand. To try it out, select the text you want and click the "Insert link" icon from the menu bar (or use Ctrl K)."
