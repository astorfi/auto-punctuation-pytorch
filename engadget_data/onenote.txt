Skype's not the only Microsoft app that's getting a major mobile redesign this week. The company announced today that the iPhone, iPad and Android versions of its OneNote note-taking software are also getting a ground-up overhaul. At the top of the list of updates is a more consistent rich-editing experience across devices, with formatting like text, tables and layout carrying over, regardless of platform. The redesign also brings syncing across SkyDrive Pro and SharePoint, as well as an end to that 500-note limit imposed by the app. And if you download the new version for the iPad, you'll get access to the Office Ribbon UI. The new OneNote is available now via the App Store and Google Play in the US and other "select" markets. More deets on the updates can be found in the source link below.
