This time it's the Helen -- or, going by the new number scheme, the Nokia 701 -- which bears the identification tag "RM-774." This successor to the C7 is rumored to have a 1GHz CPU and come with Symbian Belle preloaded. While the veil that hides the Helen's secrets remains tightly draped over it, the filing indicates that it includes quadband GSM / EDGE and a pentaband 3G radio, a feature Nokia's opted to include in many of its recent smartphones. Of the four new devices on Espoo's leaked roadmap, we've already checked the Nokia 500 "Fate" and 700 "Zeta" off our FCC watch lists, leaving the 600 "Cindy" to bring up the rear at a future date. It's evident that the phonemaker is continuing to push forward with its Symbian plans at an impressive pace; after all, there's still five more years before the company's ready to wave goodbye to the platform, so why not milk it?
