The Optimus LTE's screen rivals Apple's Retina Display at 326ppi and that high-definition sharpness is slathered on a 4.5-inch AH-IPS display. The sizable 1830mAh battery should be enough to keep the phone ticking over despite these high-end specs, which include a confirmed 1.5GHz dual-core CPU and eight megapixel camera. Will we get to see it on these shores? We're not sure of its travel itinerary after it reaches Korea, but we'd love to see this and Samsung's latest LTE wares tussle for our affections.
