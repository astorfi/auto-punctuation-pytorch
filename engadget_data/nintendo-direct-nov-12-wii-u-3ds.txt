The next Nintendo Direct takes place on November 12th at 2PM PT (10PM GMT), and it promises news and trailers for a slew of Wii U and 3DS games. This is Nintendo's first live-streamed news program since April -- and it's the first since the death of Nintendo President Satoru Iwata. For many viewers, Iwata encapsulated the appeal of Nintendo Direct, as he helped the company have fun in delivering its news (and appeared to have an adorable banana fetish). Former Nintendo of America and Pokémon USA President Tatsumi Kimishima is now the head of Nintendo. For its Thursday show, Nintendo promises updates on coming Wii U and 3DS games, and it says this Nintendo Direct will not feature news about its coming console, the NX, or its mobile endeavors. Catch region-specific streams of Nintendo Direct on Twitch (US, UK).
