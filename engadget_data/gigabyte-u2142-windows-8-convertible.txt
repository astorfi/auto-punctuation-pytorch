 That recent update on Surface Pro give you jitters? Yeah, us too, which is why we fully expect x86 nomads will be looking afresh at the heavier, more established classes of Windows 8 hybrids and convertibles. Gigabyte's latest entry into that crowded arena has just swung by the FCC, raising the likelihood of US availability while also showing off its 11.6-inch, 1,366 x 768 pivoting touchscreen wedded to a 21mm-thick (0.8-inch) chassis with a chiclet keyboard and large touchpad. The U2142 is built to contain a third-gen Intel Core i3 or i5 processor with integrated graphics, alongside up to 256GB of mSATA flash storage and 1TB-worth of HDD -- a double helping that brings its weight to 1.5kg (that's 3.3 pounds, or 50 percent heavier than MSI's 11.6-inch slider). CNET Asia got an early hands-in October and learned that the convertible might retail for around $999, although it's not clear what specs would come for that price, and it's also worth bearing in mind that Gigabyte has yet to garner much of a reputation for build quality -- even if that central hinge does look like something off an anti-aircraft gun.
