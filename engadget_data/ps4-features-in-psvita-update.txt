Sony has been crowing about the PlayStation 4 and PS Vita's love affair since last February, and with the latter's latest software update Hirai and pals are making good on those promises. Perhaps its most important feature is the PS4 Link, which acts as a sort of wireless umbilical cord between the next-gen console and the portable. PS4 Link allows certain PS4 games to be played on the Vita, and it turns the handheld into a second screen for some titles as well. Also tucked into the patch are parental controls that govern playtime and content ratings, changes to messaging, tweaks to the friends list and a panoramic camera option. In further good news, the update also allows you to automatically download future patches (finally!) and send messages between Vita, mobile devices and PS4 users. Now, if you'll excuse us, we're off to hibernate for 11 days so the PS4 Link can make itself useful.
