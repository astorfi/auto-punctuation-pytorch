The 0.6-inch thick quad-band device features EDGE, a 2 megapixel camera, QQVGA display, Bluetooth with A2DP, microSD, and a 2H launch time frame. Again, nothing to turn the head of anyone who's heard about the device over and over online, but still a welcome addition to Moto's staid lineup of RAZRs in an ever-increasing array of colors.
