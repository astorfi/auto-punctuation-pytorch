 Lets file this one under "We sure hope they aren't lying to us." Supposedly, we should start seeing some of Stevies, the other one â€“ Spielberg, mega-blockbusting films on HD DVDs sooner then later. The Promotional Group has Jaws, Jurassic Park, and E.T. on their coming soon page and boy do we hope to see 'em quick. These films are great but we sure hope the special effects transfer well to high def. The last thing we want is some cheesy 80's effect to ruin Elliot and E.T.'s wild adventure. Just as soon as these titles get a release date, that is if they get dated, we'll let you know. [Warning: PDF link]
