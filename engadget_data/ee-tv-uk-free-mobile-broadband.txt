EE is ready to take on the living room. The UK's largest mobile network is now offering its first TV set-top box, EE TV, for free to mobile customers with an EE Broadband plan (existing and new subscribers). The black box is currently only available in EE stores and supports over 70 Freeview channels, as well as video streaming services such as BBC iPlayer, YouTube and Wuaki.tv. Up to four different devices (including your TV) can use the service simultaneously, letting other family members with a smartphone or tablet watch whatever they like in another room.



The EE TV set-top box is equipped with a 1TB hard drive and capable of recording up to 600 hours in standard definition. Four channels can be recorded simultaneously, although a neat 'Replay' feature means you can store everything from six channels over a 24-hour block. You will, however, need to sign-up for EE Broadband at £9.95 per month (plus £15.75 for line rental) to get your hands on the new set-top box. In short, EE wants you to subscribe to both its mobile and broadband packages, and is happy to give away EE TV to boost sign-ups. To sweeten the deal, the company will raise your EE mobile 4G data allowance to 10GB or 20GB (depending on your current contract) if you take up their offer. Not quite sold on the idea? Let us help. We'll be putting EE TV through its paces in our upcoming review.
