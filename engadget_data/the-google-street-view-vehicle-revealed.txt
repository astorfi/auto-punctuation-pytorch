 By now, we're pretty sure you've heard about Google's new Street View feature, right? If you're like us, you've been wondering about the vehicles they're using to create those voyeuristic, 360-degree, street-level images in Manhattan's concrete canyons and beyond. Well, here's a hint: that's Immersive Media's vehicle reflected in the Street View picture captured above. Now, if they could just find ET we'd be all set. Oh right, they have. Oh Google, is there anything you can't do?[Thanks, Aaron B.]Read -- Google's deal with ImmersiveRead -- Link to Street View picture
