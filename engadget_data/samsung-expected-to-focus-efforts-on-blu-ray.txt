If you'll recall, we heard Onkyo make a similar statement earlier this month, and according to an unspecified Samsung official, it's looking to "show more interest in Blu-ray products than rival HD DVD." Unfortunately, that's all the firm would utter on the record, but really, it pretty much says it all. 'Course, it remains to be seen what will happen to the forthcoming BD-UP5500, but don't be shocked to hear that Sammy's next high-definition movie player only understands one of the two formats.
