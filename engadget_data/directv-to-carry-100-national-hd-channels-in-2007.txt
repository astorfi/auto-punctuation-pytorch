       We sure hope this means that the HD programming race is heating up and it's not just vapor ware. After all 2006 was a slow year for new HD channels. DirecTV has been boasting for some time about the number of HD channels they would have and today they have announced specific channels. The interesting part is that almost none only a few of the channels they announced today are currently offering HD programming. The channels announced today include.

A&E
National Geographic
Bravo
NFL Network
Cartoon Network
SciFi Channel
CNN
Speed
Food Network
TBS
FX
The History Channel
HGTV
The Weather Channel
MTV
USA Network

Currently DirecTV only carries 9 national HD channels and even with this list and as many premium channels we can think of there would still only be 30 HD channels. Throw in 20 or so for regional sports channels and is still only 50% of their claim. As much as we want to believe them, we have our reservations.
