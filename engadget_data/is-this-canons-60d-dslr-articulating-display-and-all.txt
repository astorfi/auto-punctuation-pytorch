But now we're back in familiar territory, and this go 'round we've got IFA and Photokina happening next month in Germany. The image above is bruited to be the 60D we've all been waiting for, and while it's usually easy to brush these off as possible fan renders (or worse, Photoshops), that display hinge looks mighty legitimate. Nikon hasn't seen fit to take the articulating LCD on its entry-level D5000 to any higher-end units just yet, but if Canon goes ahead with this one... well, we all know how competition works, now don't we?
