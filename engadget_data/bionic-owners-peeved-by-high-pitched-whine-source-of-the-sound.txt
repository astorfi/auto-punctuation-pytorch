Well, it looks like it's safe to say it's a serious issue. The Motorola support forums are rife with tales of a piercing background tone and loud clicks as the audio hardware fires up and shuts down. In fact, you can find recorded examples of the sounds at the source link. So far it's unclear if the issue is hardware or software related, and Motorola hasn't had much to say about it just yet. We're sure they'll move relatively quickly to address the problem though, before Verizon stores are flooded with returned handsets.
