The 14 day mission had a couple of crew members holed up inside the vehicle for the duration, proving the suitability of the vehicle for such a lengthy jaunt -- and providing for a good amount of Odd Couple-esque hijinks inside, to be sure. The LER also managed to track down "lost" crew members in a trial to test out the navigation systems of the rover, and docked with a habitation module mounted on the ATHLETE vehicle. Sounds like a real party down there! Video is after the break.  [Via AutoblogGreen]
