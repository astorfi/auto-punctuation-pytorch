In dude's latest civil court trial (can't he stay out of trouble?), OJ Simpson was found guiltyâ€¦ of pirating
DirecTV. Yes, the swift wheels of justice have come down upon The Juice after his, um, 2001 bust for the gear. But hey,
25k is a lot easier to swallow than the 35m he had to pay that one time; and yet he announced that he'll
appeal the decision anyway. If he didn't pirate, you must acquit!
