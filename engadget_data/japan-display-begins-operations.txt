  The joint venture that is Japan Display agreed on its formalities back in November, and has now finally started operating. While Sony, Toshiba and Hitachi all have a 10 percent stake in the business, the main investment comes from the government-backed INCJ. The collaboration hopes to champion the middle- and small-sized display sector, and has around 6,200 employees, and Â¥230 billion (about $2.8 billion) of capital to help it on its way. Now that the wheels are finally in motion, an announcement of its operational divisions, which include "Mobile Business" and "Automotive" hint at what we might expect from the business going forward. Assuming no one sells up that is.
