It's been a few years since the Segway Human Transporter was released, and while the nay-sayers predicted
causalities on sidewalks around the world, so far there hasn't been anything more than a handful of uneventful
incidents, and no fatalities. At least not until now: the first Segway-related fatality may have occured last week in
Las Vegas, NV when a 59 year old took a spill in the pit area during the SKUSA SuperNatsÂ  car racing event being
held there. Not too much on details like if he was wearing a helmet, only that he was riding a Segway when he went
down.
