When Facebook said it would buy Oculus VR, many eyes turned to Oculus CTO John Carmack. Would Quake's co-creator be happy with the deal when Facebook sees virtual reality gaming as just the beginning? Thankfully, it looks like he's staying put. In a response to jitters about the acquisition, Carmack says that Facebook appears to "get the Big Picture" -- it understands the impact of VR and will help the technology grow. The executive also isn't worried about the social network's privacy issues. While he believes that privacy is important, he also sees data mining as a valuable tool for successful companies. The statements won't completely assuage fears that the acquisition could lead Oculus astray, but Carmack clearly believes that the company is still headed in the right direction.
