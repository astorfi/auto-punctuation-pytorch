 BBC is smack-dab in the middle of the HDTV trails over in London but that isn't stopping them from adding to their high-def lineup. The plan is to simulcast recently launched programs such as Robin Hood, The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard, and Torchwood along with the SD broadcast. The station is adding additional HD programming later in the year as well but we won't run down the entire long list which should suffice to say there is a bunch of new HD shows coming. Apparently the trial is going well otherwise we don't think the BBC would be dropping more cash for additional programming.
