Since taking on Marissa Mayer as CEO last year, Yahoo's kept itself occupied with purchasing Tumblr, giving Flickr a facelift, redesigning its email service, fine-tuning its fantasy sports solution and much more. Citing a renewed sense of progress, the company's announced it's taking up a new logo that'll evolve "the essence" of the brand accordingly. While the fresh design won't be unveiled until September 5th, Yahoo will show off a unique take on its current logo -- like the one above -- for the next 30 days throughout its homepage and network of sites. Don't expect a radical departure from its roots, however. An exclamation mark, the color purple and the hallmark yodel will all be a part of the new branding.
