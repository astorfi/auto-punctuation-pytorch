We think PC Mag would agree thatthe company's quad-band GSM VK2020 musicphone -- that, like the models, we also spottedat CeBIT -- falls in line with this assessment, as their review highlights the handset's RAZR- and SLVR-killingthinness and "wow factor," but knocks it on nearly every aspect important to people who actually like theirstuff to function properly. Among the laundry list of flaws reported are this model's small, dim screen, barelyacceptable MP3 and call audio quality, lack of even EDGE-speed data, sub-four-hour battery life, limited filetypesupport, and flaky Bluetooth connection. Still, PC Mag's Sascha makes a good point when he compares the VK2020 to a hotdate, in that you're a lot more likely to accept its faults just because it looks so damn good. If you're the type thatrushed out to buy LG's silly Style-i non-hands-free, non-headsetBluetooth headset when it became availablefrom Verizon this week, then you'll probably be just fine with forking over $400 to Dynamism in order to sport oneof today's hotter-looking imports.
