Well, if you already have a Touch Diamond, you're outta luck -- but future buyers have another version to look forward to that packs HSDPA on the all-important 850 and 1900MHz bands. We don't have any word on when this is coming, where it's going, or how much it'll run, but hey, it exists. That's a solid start.
