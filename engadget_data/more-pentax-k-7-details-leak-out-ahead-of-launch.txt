One of those comes in the form of a seemingly authentic ad (pictured after the break) that all but confirms that the K-7 (or K7D) will be a 14.6-megapixel DSLR, and will boast a new Prime II imaging engine, along with the increasingly standard HD video recording that we had heard about earlier. As if that wasn't enough, a whole slew of images of the camera have just surfaced on RiceHigh's Pentax Blog, along with a complete (but not exactly verifiable) spec list, which offers such details as a 3-inch VGA LCD, continuous JPEG shooting at 5.2 frames per second, a viewfinder with 100% image coverage, a new 77-Segment Multi-Pattern metering system, a built-in AF assist light, and an integrated HDR mode, among countless other features. Unfortunately, the one thing still up in the air is the price, although there's still room for one more rumor before Pentax removes all the mystery.Read - RiceHigh's Pentax BlogRead - PentaxForums, K7 ad [Via Electronista]
