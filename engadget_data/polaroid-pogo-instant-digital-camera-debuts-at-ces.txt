 We heard that Polaroid would be punching out a PoGo-infused camera in 2009, and it only took 'em eight days into the new year to do just that. Today at CES, the $199 PoGo Instant Digital Camera is making its grand entrance, utilizing the tried-and-true ZINK printing technology. Sadly (and we do mean sadly), there's not even a mention of how many megapixels this thing boasts, which is a pretty telling sign that you won't be getting SD850IS-type quality out of it. Nevertheless, it'll print out ink-free 2- x 3-inch images right from itself, so maybe the quality isn't that big of a deal after all. Or maybe we're just sympathetic.
