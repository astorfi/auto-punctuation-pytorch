 Sony is the first major studio to announcetheir pricing model for the upcoming release of their Blu-ray Disc titles. BD films fresh from the theaters should hitthe shelves for $23.45 while catalog titles will drop for $17.95, wholesale. Yeah, that's a 15-20% premium over whatnew-release DVDs cost back at their '97 release but, according to Sony, it's meant to "accommodate thesell-through and rental markets" which DVDs initially avoided since the world was beset by video rentals at thetime. But you won't see a Sony MSRP slapped to the back of their BDs. Instead they will allow retailers to set theirown margin of profit (like Amazon who listscatalog BDs for $22.49) allowing for the invisible hand to sort it all out. Sony also plans to bundle DVD and UMDdiscs in a move to boost acceptance of the UMD format. Several titiles will be offered in packages that will sell forabout $29 for both formats, compared to typical prices of about $25 for the DVD and $20 for the UMD. That's somethingthey (and a few notable others) are "stillworking on."
