 
Not a whole lot to go on here, but a user on the Digital Photography Review forums has turned up some shots of what appear to be a Canon 5D Mark II DSLR, shots that are made all the more curious by the fact that Canon has yet to announce such a camera. Of course, given that the regular EOS 5D is now getting on in years, it's certainly not out of the question, though we'd hold out for some firmer info before you start pinching pennies to save up for this sure-to-be-pricey bit of kit. Those looking to give it a closer examination can check out a shot of the camera's backside after the break.
