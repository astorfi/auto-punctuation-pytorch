  Acer's CloudMobile has already broken cover once. Now it's been manhandled in the flesh by members of the media. Sadly, we weren't on hand at Fashion Week in Milan to give it the once over ourselves (we'll have to wait for MWC for that), but the folks at Notebook Italia were. It looks like the 4.3-inch display is, in fact, of the 1280 x 720 variety, and the processor tasked with pushing all those pixels is a dual-core 1.5GHz part. Underneath that award-winning shell is also Dolby Mobile sound, NFC and Ice Cream Sandwich. Interestingly, reports are that the handset is running the unannounced Android 4.1, but we haven't been able to confirm that just yet. Also not quite ready for prime time? It's namesake AcerCloud platform, but the company still has a few more months to work that one out before the anticipated Q3 release. Check out the video after the break and hit up the source link for a few more photos.
