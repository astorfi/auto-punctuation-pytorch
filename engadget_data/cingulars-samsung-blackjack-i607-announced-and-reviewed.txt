It's a little chunky, a little clunky, and the keys and keyboard are not exactly our favorite (think: i320 meets Q), but it's the only GSM phone on the block with EDGE / UMTS / HSDPA. Other notable features include a QVGA display, new Cingular Music support (as well as Cingular Video), Bluetooth 2.0, and a 1.3 megapixel camera. Like its other holiday 2006 QWERTY smartphone competitors (see: Treo 680, Dash, Q), it too will be priced at $200 with a two year contract (and unlimited data plan). And hey, lucky you, both Phone Scoop and LAPTOP have reviews of the device, both of which seem pretty positive about Cingular's latest (even despite that sad lack of WiFi).Read - Phone Scoop's reviewRead - LAPTOP's review
