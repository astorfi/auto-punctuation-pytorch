  Earlier today our brethren over at Engadget Chinese got to hang out with Huawei Device chairman Richard Yu, who was kind enough to inform us that his company will release a HiSilicon K3V3 chipset -- the follow-up to the current quad-core K3V2 -- in the second half of this year. What's more, much like NVIDIA's upcoming Tegra 4, the new platform will be based on the more powerful Cortex-A15 ARM architecture instead of Cortex-A9. Yu also hinted that the K3V3 will be featured in the successors to the Ascend D2 and the Ascend Mate, but our guess is that we won't be seeing those at MWC next month. We shall tickle the man live on stage for more answers this Thursday.
