Of course, we're taking all of this with the proverbial grain of salt, but looks like the X1A (as it's known in North America) might actually hit the shelves on December 7 of this year, with a retail price of $799.99. There is no word on a possible contract price yet, and with all of the other options out there (Touch Pro and G1 come to mind) SE might have a tough time selling this one to consumers whenever it does see the light of day. We'll have to wait and see.
