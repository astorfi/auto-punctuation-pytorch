A Nokia store employee has informed Pocket-lint that the N8 hero device we've all been waiting for will be launching in the Queen's backyard on Wednesday, August 25. That's only a day off from the August 24 tip that we had and definitely seems to narrow down the release window, but let's retain our signature skepticism. Until one of Nokia's higher-ups or their PR team busts out an official release date, we're still dealing with speculative information. Then again, if you wanna book that week of August off from work, we'd totally understand.
