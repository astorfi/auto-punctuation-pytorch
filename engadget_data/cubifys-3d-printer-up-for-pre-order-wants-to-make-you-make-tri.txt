If you've assembled a more typical printer in the last ten years, you should be able to put these associated pieces together. It's a sharp contrast to plenty of 3D printers that more closely resemble an engineer's tantrum. The printer is priced up at $1,299, so it's not the cheapest, but we are promised a pretty concrete May 25th release date. Hit up the source to place your order, alongside some extra color cartridges. How would you make those turtleshell racers without some blue and red?
