 We well knew early this morning that theXP-on-an-Intel-Mac bounty was apparently paid out, so sorry if you had your eye on that $11,000 $12,000 $13,000 bounty. But what we didn't have was the solution. Well, Colin over atwindows.onmac.net still doesn't have anything much to say about it, but we think the file itself should say enough.Grab it below if you want it -- the zip includes a bootloader CD image and a how-to for getting XP on your MacBook Pro,iMac, or mini. Happy Windows-ing.Download (777KB), mirrors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5[Thanks, dueport]
