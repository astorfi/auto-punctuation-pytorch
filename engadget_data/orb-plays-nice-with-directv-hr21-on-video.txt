 Oh sure, DirecTV's Media Share has allowed Viiv-certified machines to network in for a good while now, but what if you just so happen to prefer Orb? The same streaming software that functions with the Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 has been caught playing nice (read: transmitting media from a WiFi-enabled laptop) with an HR21 HD DVR. Judging by the looks of things, the setup procedure isn't all that different from syncing up a traditional Viiv machine, but feel free to peek a step-by-step video posted after the jump if you're looking to give it a go yourself.
