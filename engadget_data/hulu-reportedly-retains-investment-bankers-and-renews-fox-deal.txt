As its owners seek to separate themselves from what is looking more and more like a competitor than a savior, reportedly Guggenheim Partners and Morgan Stanley have been retained and potential bidders have been contacted. One way to make sure anyone is actually interested in buying the site is to strengthen its content licensing deals, and oh-so-coincidentally Variety is reporting Hulu has already reached a new deal to keep the TV shows from Fox flowing. Yesterday we asked for your ideas on who an eventual buyer might be and so far the list includes Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and Pets.com, which should just about cover it.
