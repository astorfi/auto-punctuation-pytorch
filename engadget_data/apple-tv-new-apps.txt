As 9to5Mac points out, Cupertino's tiny box is now giving viewers access to applications including Bloomberg (which will be streaming news 24/7 as well as offer on-demand content), Watch ABC, Crackle (in HD for the first time) and, for Korean speakers, KORTV. These new additions show that Apple is getting increasingly passionate about its hobby, as over the past months we've seen more and more apps and features become available. It's worth mentioning that being able to enjoy some of these in full depends on the country you're in and whether you have the proper cable subscription. So, power on your Apple TV and let us know in the comments how you're liking the fresh content thus far.
