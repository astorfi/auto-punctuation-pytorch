Put simply, the device "enables users to easily network a projector or display monitor," which makes transfers much easier when switching between presenters. Up to 20 users can log in to the machine at one time, and an integrated browser interface "allows control to pass between the users." Notably, the box supports audio and MPEG1/2/4, 802.11g, Ethernet and Windows XP / Vista (sorry, Mac users), and can be thrown on the corporate card now for Â£299 ($608).[Via TechDigest]
