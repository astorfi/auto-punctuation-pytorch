As of today, the initiative is official: a new Mobile Games Publishing page is now live on Facebook's developers site. The pilot program is designed for small and medium-sized gaming developers -- after signing up, Facebook will help developers target consumers who might be interested in playing. Additionally, the site will provide feedback through analytics tools, enabling developers to refine their approach in response to customer interest. The program isn't open to everyone just yet, but if you're a small to mid-sized dev that Facebook identifies as "high-potential," you might just have a shot at joining up.
