Fast forward a few months, and feast your eyes on JVC Victor's not-yet-named 4k x 2k projector, which was on display at this year's CEATEC. The device boasts an incredible 4,096 x 2,400 resolution and can "throw a 200-inch picture from about 7-meters away." Additionally, the unit featured a contrast ratio of 10,000:1, 3,500 lumens, and employed the same 1.27-inch D-ILA microdisplay that we saw in June. No word on price, but start saving those pennies for a "first half of 2008" release.
