I spy with my little eye an Xbox One with 500GB more storage and a controller with a built-in 3.5mm headset port. Amazon has what appears to be a placeholder page for a 1TB Xbox One bundled with the newly designed controller and Halo: The Master Chief Collection, all for $400. It has a release date of June 15th. The listing is tucked away on Amazon and it doesn't include any photos, but it wouldn't be surprising if Microsoft is preparing an announcement for its E3 showcase -- also on June 15th. A Microsoft spokesperson had the following to say about the listing: "We're gearing up for an exciting E3 where we'll showcase more games and experiences. We have nothing further to share at this time."



Microsoft launched a 1TB Call of Duty-branded Xbox One bundle last year, though that one cost $500 and didn't include Kinect. This week's $400 listing doesn't include Kinect either, but the headset port on the controller is a highly anticipated addition. For comparision, a 500GB Xbox One with Kinect normally runs $500, and a Kinectless, 500GB version costs $400.
