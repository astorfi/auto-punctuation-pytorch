Smartphones these days are as much fashion accessories as pure gadgets and Galaxy Note 3 fans will soon have two more ways to mix and match. First off, Samsung went straight for a trendy "rose gold" hue for the handset's metal edge against a black or white body color, giving it a blingy Chanel vibe. Also on tap is a "merlot red" so that exhibitionist types will have something more outr√© to lust after than the current jet black, classic white and blush rose finishes. The new shades will be launched in China later this month, with other regions getting them as per "market preference," according to Samsung. We're not sure what that means exactly, because the market usually prefers things yesterday.
