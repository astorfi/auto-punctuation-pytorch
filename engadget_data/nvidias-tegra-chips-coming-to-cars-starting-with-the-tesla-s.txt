The company just announced that its Tegra 3 chips will power not just tablets, but in-car entertainment systems. For starters, this will include Tesla's model S, though it's also going to find a home in Ferrari Lamborghini and Audi (announcement to come, we're told). That's all we know for now -- nothing on availability, the mix of Tegra 2 / 3 chips or NVIDIA's roadmap -- but given how ubiquitous Tegra is, we think we have a handle on how well it handles multimedia content.
