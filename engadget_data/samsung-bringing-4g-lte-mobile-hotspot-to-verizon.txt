 
Novatel? Yes. Sierra Wireless? Sure. Pantech? Definitely -- but one company we didn't really expect to be launching a pocketable mobile hotspot on an American carrier was Samsung. Sure enough, Sammy is hooking up with Verizon to rock the carrier's very first mobile hotspot product to be announced with LTE compatibility, a crucial feature that should give the Sprint Overdrives and 3G / 4G MiFis of the world a run for their collective money. Though it lacks a creative name, the so-called 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot is precisely as described with a dash of CDMA / EV-DO compatibility thrown in for those rare occasions when you stray outside your local LTE footprint. We don't have a price or date yet, but there's not a lot of rocket science here compared to... say, the Inspiration, so hopefully it won't be long.

Though we didn't have a chance to put it through a live test, we've had our hands on this little device already and we can say it's basically a dead ringer for the CDMA version of the first-generation Novatel MiFi as sold on Verizon, Sprint, and others. The only change, really, is that it feels a bit thicker, a bit more "solid," and a bit heavier, but not nearly enough to make a practical difference -- you'll still gladly throw this thing in your pocket when you need a cloud of steamy hot WiFi in your vicinity. Follow the break for the full press release.
