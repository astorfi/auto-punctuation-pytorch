No time to cook 'cause you spend all your time reading about gadgets? Never fear, Eggadget is here. See, now you can
combine your wanton culinary yearnings with your lust for the hi-tech by cooking an egg with two mobile phones. Really,
at least that's what these kids are boasting â€” hell, they
even provide step-by-step instruction on how it's done. But as usual, there is the cabal of haters who
say you can't. Guess our readers will have to shed the
ever-loving-light of truth over this matter and possibly, just possibly prove once and for all whether
cellphones are
dangerous/not-dangerous.
