The master modder has been the source of some of our favorite tweaks, hacks, and flat-out crazy gadget manipulations over the years. We recently had a chance to take a peek inside his workshop and hear straight from Ben about what drives him to create the madness we've see on our pages. It's a phantasmagoric adventure you won't likely forget -- so sit back, crack a cold one, and enjoy the ride!

Note: Don't forget, our next full length Engadget Show is happening this Thursday, and our guest is Steve Ballmer!

Update: Video is now live! Sorry about that!
