Okay, we've officially crossed over into "gratuitous cashing in" land, here â€” the Vertu Ascent White is apparently
in response to consumer demand for a "classic color" following the sellout success of the
Ascent Pink earlier this year (what, pink doesn't qualify
as "classic"? Molly Ringwald would, like, totally disagree). To "ensure exclusivity," they'll also be engraving the
handset with "Special Edition" on the back of the battery cover, in case your friends ever profess any doubt about how
friggin' special you truly are. Display it on the mantle right next to your
Motorsport Edition for added effect.
