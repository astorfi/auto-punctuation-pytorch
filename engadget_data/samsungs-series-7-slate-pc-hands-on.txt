It sports a 400 nit, 1366 x 768 11.6-inch capacitive panel, Intel's 1.6GHz Core i5 2467M CPU with integrated graphics and 4GB of RAM. On the front there's a 2 megapixel camera and a light sensor, and around the back sits a 3 megapixel shooter. Connectivity comes courtesy of 802.11 b/g/n WiFi, plus there's a USB 2.0 port, micro HDMI, and a SIM slot for surfing waves of 3G (no word on which carrier will send those swells of data, though). Each slate also comes with an capacitive active digitizer pen, but will also have Swype on board plus a custom software layer to make Windows a bit more finger-friendly.

It comes in four versions that differ in storage size and flavor of Windows, but all are .5 inches thin, weigh 2.03 pounds, and are swathed in brushed aluminum. There are 64GB SSD variants packing Home Premium for $1,099 or Pro for $1,199, while the 128GB models come with Home Premium, a dock and keyboard for $1349 or Pro sans the peripherals at the same price. They're all scheduled for a late September release, so it won't be long before you can pick one up. Looking to take the tablet plunge into Windows waters? Read on past the break for our impressions of Sammy's new slate.





  We got to spend some time with Samsung's newest slate, and we found it to be an intriguing device. We were impressed by both the display's brightness and its responsiveness to finger swipes and taps. The stylus also worked quite well, as the screen picked up its movements once the tip was half an inch from the surface. Plus, there was a little diamond indicator that popped up and tracked the pen's movements to aid the accuracy of our taps. We didn't get to delve too deeply into the custom software layer Samsung installed, but we can say that the larger icons and swipe-able screens made for an experience familiar to any iOS or Android user. We also got to see the optional dock and keyboard, and thought both of them to be worthy additions to the tablet experience. The dock, which has HDMI, Ethernet and USB ports, has a solid heft to it, and is coated in the same brushed aluminum as the slate itself. The Bluetooth keyboard is razor thin, and the keys were satisfyingly clicky. Overall, we can see the appeal here -- tablet portability with full Windows functionality. However, at such steep prices, we'll have to wait and see if folks just buy a netbook and a Galaxy Tab 10.1 or an iPad instead.Dante Cesa contributed to this report.
