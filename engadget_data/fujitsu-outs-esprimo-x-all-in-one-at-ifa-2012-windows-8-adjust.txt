So while we may have already seen its Windows 8 Stylistic Q702 and LifeBook T902 in Hong Kong last week, there is still one product the company's trotting out here in Berlin: the Esprimo X. Planned for a late year launch, this All-in-one also runs Redmond's latest OS and packs Intel's third-generation vPro chipset (up to Core i5 configurations) for the enterprise set. The slim PC features an adjustable touch display, which can even be laid out completely flat across any surface, a proximity sensor for power saving management, in addition to face recognition tech for an added layer of security. No other details on this AIO have yet to be disclosed -- the company's retaining those fuller spec bits for its release -- so stay tuned for our first impressions from the showfloor.
