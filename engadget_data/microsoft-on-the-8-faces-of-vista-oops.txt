 Remember that story from a few days ago about Microsoft's plans to release no fewer than eight versions ofWindows Vista (including the Windows Vista Ultimate edition, which we assume comes with or without extra cheese andpepperoni). Well, it turns out someone at Microsoft jumped the gun a little. The company has taken down all referencesto the eight flavors of Vista, saying that the page was posted "prematurely," and included "incompleteinformation about the Windows Vista product line up." Which we assume means that there will be more thaneight versions, and Microsoft's branding experts are even now in the process of coming up with names for the additionalones. Let's see, Windows Vista Extreme? Windows Vista XXL? Microsoft Bob? Oh, wait, they've already done that. Whichmeans, of course, that no matter what they come up with, it won't be worse.
