 Clear might be busy bringing WiMAX to as many places as it can, but it looks like that won't include smartphones -- like that just-rumored HTC device for Sprint -- anytime soon. That word comes from Phone Scoop, who reportedly confirmed directly with Clear that it doesn't expect to see any WiMAX-equipped smartphones until at least the end of 2010. The company did say that it expects to see more WiMAX phones available in 2011, however, and that any "phone-type device" that uses WiMAX would use either VoIP or Sprint's CDMA network for voice calls. Not surprisingly, Clear didn't drop any hints about exactly who those WiMAX phones might come from.
