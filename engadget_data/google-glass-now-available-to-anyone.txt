Google offered Glass to the public as part of a one day sale not long ago. Now it seems that anyone can order one again without an invite. There's been no announcement so far, no fan fair -- a few Redditors just happened to discover that you can head straight to the order page and add one to your cart. We've tried it from multiple accounts that we can confirm did not sign up for the Explorer program, so it appears that Glass is legitimately available to anyone with a Google account. We've reached out to Mountain View for comment and we'll let you know as soon as we hear back. In the meantime you can go order your own Explorer Edition unit now. So long as you're comfortable coughing up the $1,500 asking price, of course.


Update: Well, it appears that Glass is not available to everyone after all. Google just never pulled the URL for the shop down following the April 15th sale. The company told Android Community it would be pulling the site down soon. And, sadly, if it seemed like you successfully put in an order today chances are that won't be honored. According to the statement customers not already "in the pipeline" won't be getting Glass.
