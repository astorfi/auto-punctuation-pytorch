Looks like Sirius beat itself to the punch with
its new Starmate Replay device today, announcing an even
smaller, even more attractive wearable device, the S50. Granted, it only plays back via docked recording of Sirius
content, but it's a mere 1.9 x 3.9 x 0.7-inches—smaller than a 60GB iPod—and includes 50-hour playback buffer, as well
as being able to play back MP3 and WMA files. The $360 pricetag is a little steep, and tacking on another $100 for the
dock, remote, and antenna is a little annoying, but there isn't a whole lot else out there if you want to get Sirius
you can take running with you. Expect to see this out around October.
