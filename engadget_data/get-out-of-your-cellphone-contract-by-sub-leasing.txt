Aside from assuming a new identity or moving out of the country (or both), there are few options for people wanting
to switch cellphone service providers in the middle of a contract other than shelling out around $200. A company called
CellTradeUSA thinks they have the solution to this problem, in the form of a website where people post their remaining
contract obligations to be "leased" by someone else (they will also begin offering advertiser-sponsored contests
wherein they will buyout your contract for you). Usually the person pawning off the contract will throw in a free phone
as well as some accessories to sweeten the deal, although most carriers require a credit check before this type of
switch is allowed, so not all bidders will end up being eligible. Now, while we're on the subject, does anyone know any
other legal ways to avoid that ugly early termination fee?
