Without 850 or 1900, the GSM support is useless in the States, but of course you've got that CDMA / EV-DO radio kicking in when you're on American soil. Look for this thing to drop very shortly, with both the 21st (today) and the 28th being thrown out as possible release dates.[Thanks, Roc a fella]
