They claim the new Dellstrikes the best balance of "features, performance, and connectivity" for the tricked-out price of $1,905.Their review model featured the Intel Core Duo T2400 (1.83GHz) processor, 1GB of RAM, Novatel Wireless' integratedEV-DO, and 80GB disk which explains the premium paid over the $1,149 base config. They found thescreen to be bright and easy to read with the battery pumping a full 4 hours and 25 minutes -- an optional, $99high-capacity battery rated for 7-hours is also available. They liked the quiet feel of the full-sized keyboard,dedicated volume and mute buttons, and handy "WiFi catcher" that indicates via a single LED whether anavailable WiFi network is in range without turning the laptop on. While the EV-DO speed test squeezed out an impressiveaverage of 498.4Kbps, they found that their 802.11a/g WiFi tests delivered a poor 11.63Mbps at 5 feet from their(presumably g-flavored) access point. Still, they give the D620 4.5 out of 5 stars and slapped on the ol' Editor'sChoice badge calling it the best choice for a thin, light, powerful laptop that is always connected.
