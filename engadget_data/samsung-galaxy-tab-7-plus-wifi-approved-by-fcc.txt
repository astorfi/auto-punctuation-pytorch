The version that had its insides prodded with multimeters and suchlike was the 16GB WiFi model, with no talk of any other mobile wireless capability. Still, whilst it may not be able to roam around the country without a MiFi, you know that when it's emerged from the testing bunker, it won't be long before it's available in stores.
