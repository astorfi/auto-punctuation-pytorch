First, the committee plans to look into ways to "foster innovation and investment in the wireless communications market," issues related to "truth-in-billing," and exclusivity agreements between carriers and handset manufacturers, which critics say punish consumers in rural areas that the "big four" (Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile) don't serve. Also in the queue, according to Ars Technica, is the wireless open access docket, which will mostly be given over to Skype's inquiry into Apple's rejection of Google Voice for iPhone and its relationship to a "pending Petition filed by Skype to confirm a consumer's right to use communications software and attach nonharmful devices to wireless networks." And of course, all this goes down a few days after Apple, AT&T, and Google were required to respond to letters from the Commission inquiring about Apple's dissing the Google Voice app. If you've never had the opportunity to sit in one of these sessions, let us tell you -- they're incredibly exciting, fast-paced events. As always, the meeting will be broadcast live over Real Video -- hit the read link for details.
