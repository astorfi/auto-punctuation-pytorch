Some try to regale their friends with tales of burning lungs and fiery quads, but Joseph Tame has another solution. He's created the iRig, a curious contraption containing four iPhones, an Android device of unknown provenance, an iPad, three wireless routers, a weather station, a heart rate monitor, and a silly mock satellite dish up on his head. With all this he plans on livestreaming his entire race using Skype, FaceTime, Runkeeper, and a custom Android app that will send out atmospheric conditions -- according to Joseph doing "all this while looking incredibly cool." We can't argue with that, but we also can't help worrying about the chafing that contraption will induce. See for yourself in the video below.
