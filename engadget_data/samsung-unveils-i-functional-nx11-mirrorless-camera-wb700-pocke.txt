 
Just when you thought it'd be a week devoid of notable announcements -- what, with CES less than a week away -- along comes Samsung with two new cameras. The first one is an upgrade to the mirrorless NX10, naturally called the NX11, that boasts a change in grip design and compatibility with the i-Function lens found on the NX100. The other nitty-gritty details for the 14.6 megapixel shooter: a 3-inch AMOLED LCD screen, VGA viewfinder, 720p 30fps HD recording, and an APS-C sensor. Price and date? $649 with a bundled 18-55mm zoom lens, available in February.

In smaller news -- volumetrically, at least -- the 16 megapixel Samsung WB700 sports a 24x zoom (that's 18x optical and 1.3x smart zoom), a 24mm ultra-wide Schneider Kreuznach lens, CCD sensor, and 1080p 720p HD video. You're gonna have to wait a little bit longer for that one -- April, to be more specific -- for a penny under $300. Press releases are after the break, and we'll get you the pictures as soon as Sammy sends 'em.

Update: We found the pictures!

Update 2: Samsung just informed us of an error in the WB700 press release. It records 720p, not 1080p as first written. Also, it doesn't shoot RAW. First the words giveth, then they taketh away.

The NX11 contains a feature set similar to Samsung's first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, the NX10, however the NX11 is also compatible with the new i-Function lens that was introduced for the NX100. The NX11 will come complete with an 18-55mm i-Function lens, as well as two new i-Function lenses, a 20mm pancake and a 20-50mm zoom silver color lens. The launch reinforces the company's commitment to leading innovation in the compact system camera market.The i-Function lens puts the perfect picture at the fingertips of all photographers by providing an exceptionally easy way of controlling the camera. Since a typical camera user wraps their hand around the lens when holding the camera, the new i-Function system allows photographers to naturally use their left hand to change the camera's advanced settings via a button built into the i-Function lens, without needing to take the camera off the target. Users can toggle between shutter speed, aperture, EV, WB, and ISO quickly and easily by simply using the i-Function button or ring on the lens, meaning easier and quicker configurations while shooting. The NX11 also focuses on usability, with a change in the grip design to make shooting easier and more comfortable for users. Additionally, the NX11 has a lens priority mode dial, simplifying the search for the best mode for each lens. The camera also includes a convenient, one-touch i-Function button that activates common shooting controls like aperture, shutter speed, ISO and white balance, meaning easier and quicker configuration while shooting. The camera makes taking great landscape scenes or pictures of large groups simple by featuring a panorama mode, which allows the user to take panoramic pictures in one press-and-sweep motion. As with the NX10, the NX11 uses the best-in-class APS-C sensor for better image quality. The APS-C sensor is larger than Micro 4/3 and delivers high quality images with ease. "Today's launch is important for Samsung in reinforcing our position as a leading innovator in the digital camera market and for showing our innovation in the compact system camera market," said Mr. Hyunho Chung, Executive Vice President and Head of the Digital Imaging Business, Samsung Electronics. "The NX11, while offering the best features of the NX10, has an upgraded design and the additional i-Function capability with more lenses. The launch of our next offering in the NX range also demonstrates our commitment to our customers, by producing user driven innovation in the form of easy-to-use functions and upgraded customization."Alongside the built-in flash and built-in electronic VGA (640x480) viewfinder, the NX11 has a 3.0" AMOLED LCD screen. The AMOLED screen reduces the glare from sunlight so that consumers can see their images under any lighting conditions. The user can also get a more vivid, clearer image through enhanced color reproduction. The NX11 provides high quality video with 720p HD recording, and its large APS-C sensor allows the videos to be recorded with shallow depth of field, providing effects similar to those in motion picture movies.Specifications Sheet*Specifications are subject to change without prior notice.NX11Image Sensor 23.4×15.6mm CMOS Approx. 14.6 MegapixelsLens Samsung NX MountSamsung Lenses for Samsung NX MountImage Stabilization Lens Shift (depends on Lens)Dimensions and weight 123 x 87 x 39.8mm (excluding the projecting part)353g (without battery and card)Additional features • Super sonic drive• 3.0" AMOLED• EVF VGA (640x480) 921k dots equiv.• Multi : Normal 15points, Close Up 35points• Face Detection : Max. 10faces• Electronically controlled vertical-run focal plane shutter• Metering : Multi, Center-weighted, Spot• TTL Auto Pop-up flash• Smart Flash, Auto, Auto + Red-eye reduction,• 28mm wide-angle coverage (Equivalent to 35mm)• Samsung External Flash available (SEF-42A, SEF-20A, SEF15A : Optional)• Hot Shoe• Smart Auto, Lens Priority, Program, Shutter Priority AE, Aperture Priority AE, Manual, Sound Picture, Panorama, Scene, Movie• Beauty shot, Children, Close Up, Text, Sunset, Dawn, Backlight, Fireworks, Beach & Snow, Night, Portrait, Landscape, Sports• RAW : 14M (4592x3056)• Super fine , Fine, Normal• High Definition Movie Recording with MP4 (H.264)• Frame rate - 30fpsPrice $649 (with bundle zoom lens)Availability February SAMSUNG 20-50mm Black, SilverCategory 　Lens Nme SAMSUNG 20-50mm F3.5-5.6 ED Black/SilverFocal Length 20 - 50mm (equivalent to 30.8-77mm in 35mm format)Elements in Groups 9 elements in 8 groups (1 Aspherical lens, 1 Extra-low Dispersion len) ngle of View 70.2°- 31.4°Aperture F3.5 - 5.6 (Min.

The camera features a 24mm ultra-wide Schneider KREUZNACH® lens to capture the perfect wide shot, as well as an outstanding 24X zoom function, made up of an 18X optical zoom and 1.3X Smart Zoom. The WB700 delivers sharp images with incredible detail, thanks to the camera's 16 Megapixel (MP) CCD sensor. The WB700 is also equipped with full manual control and the ability to record full 1080p high definition video (H.264 format). The flexibility of the WB700's lens and zoom functions allows users to capture a broad landscape in the same 16MP detail as a bubbling brook in the distance. "We understand that many of our customers come to us for the very best and most up-to-date technology available, which is why we have chosen to bring all our innovation together in the WB700 for both the advanced and novice photographer, giving a balance of professional quality imaging and the kind of usability anyone can master," said Mr. Hyunho Chung, Executive Vice President and Head of the Digital Imaging Business, Samsung Electronics.
