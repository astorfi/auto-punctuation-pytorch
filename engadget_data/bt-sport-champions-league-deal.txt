Do you like to spend huge sums on Sky Sports just to catch the big moments in European football? Well, in the biggest thing to happen to UK broadcasting in years, BT Sport has outbid (by a considerable margin) both Sky and ITV for the exclusive rights to show both Champions and Europa League matches between 2015-2018. It's a huge coup for the nascent broadcaster, and a statement of intent that it doesn't want to become the next ITV Digital. What this means for consumers, of course, is that £22-a-month Sky Sports subscription (on top of the £21 you pay for the basic package) just took a big hit in value, and that if you want to see the world's biggest game, you're gonna have to buy a BT Sport subscription.
