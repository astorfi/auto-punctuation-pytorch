As well as some tantalizing hardware shots, we get a sneaky glimpse at that all important "About phone" page. All we can see, though, is that it's running Windows Phone 8 (shock) and has only 335MB of RAM? Though, being a prototype, that's likely to change. Sadly little else of note, but it's at least good to see that while the mock-ups were close, the real thing has a little more going for it.
