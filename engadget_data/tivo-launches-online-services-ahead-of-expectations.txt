Today TiVo officially launched those new online services
we told you about for TiVo Series2 customers. This is a bit early since we expected the beta to run into the new
year, but subscribers can now view their photos and check local weather and traffic via Yahoo, browse movie information
or purchase tickets via Fandango, or check out Live365's Internet radio offerings. And TiVo's even offering up a
service to select and listen to podcasts, which is just fine by us. Head
over to TiVo's online service website to sign-up for the priority list to get
yours while the gettin's good, 'cause it's going to "take a few weeks" to enable your digs, dig?
