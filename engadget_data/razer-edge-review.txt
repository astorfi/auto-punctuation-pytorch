 Portable gaming isn't what it once was. Sure, you can still snag a handheld device from Sony or Nintendo, but today's video game industry is far more diverse. Gamers on the go have no shortage of hardware to pick from: tablets, smartphones, gaming laptops and purpose-built handhelds are redefining what a mobile gaming platform is. Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan must have felt the winds of change blowing his way when he cooked up Project Fiona, now known as the Razer Edge. The company's marketing material frames the curious device as an all-in-one gaming arsenal; it's a tablet, says the product page, as well as a PC and console. Above all, it's modular, a souped-up tablet with a small collection of docks and cradles designed to scratch your gaming itch from all angles. All told, Razer calls it the most powerful tablet in the world. Kitted out with the specs of a mid-range gaming laptop, it may very well be that -- but we couldn't let the proclamation pass without giving it the once-over ourselves.



 Hardware  At first glance, the Edge looks strikingly familiar, with its 10.1-inch screen and thick, generic bezel. With the exception of two indentations centered on the device's north and south edges, Razer took almost no liberties with the dull standard of tablet design. The result is boring, but functional. Thankfully, the Edge's aluminum backside shows a little more personality, borrowing a subtly ridged design profile from the Razer Blade laptop. A pair of tiny humps line the port and starboard sides of the backplate's horizontal expanse, endowing the system with a tactile anchor point and some much-needed visual flare. Decorated with a backlit Razer logo, the plate gently curves into the device's outer frame, smoothly fitting the user's palm without digging in.
