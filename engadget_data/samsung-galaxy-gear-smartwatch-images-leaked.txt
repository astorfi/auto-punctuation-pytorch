Been wondering what Samsung's upcoming smartwatch was going to look like? Take a seat, because VentureBeat sneaked a first look at the upcoming wearable over the weekend. According to the outlet, the prototype device features a three inch display, built-in speakers and a 4-megapixel camera housed in the watch's wrist strap. VentureBeat describes the Samsung Galaxy Gear as lightweight but somewhat dwarfing, with a "clunky" large wristband and quite a bit of bulk. Although VentureBeat wasn't allowed to take pictures of the alleged prototype, it did manage to snag a few screengrabs from an internal promotional video -- showing off the device's camera, screen and touch menu system. The watch also is said to support Samsung S Voice commands as well as an assortment of pre-loaded health apps that include heart-rate and calorie monitors, as well a pedometer. Users can also take pictures of food and categorize it for later review.


Although the prototype seems to suggest that Samsung is marketing the device as a health accessory, those aforementioned features also fill the bill for a standard smartphone companion. VentureBeat also noted social media features, a functional call log and independent internet access via WiFi, meaning you should be use the watch without a smartphone if needed. The watch is also reportedly rated to last for more than ten hours on a single charge -- a little shy in longevity if it's your primary timepiece, but perhaps enough for a fitness-focused accessory. We'll find out more when Samsung officially reveals the wearable on Wednesday, but if you're itching for more info, check out the attached source for more images and VentureBeat's own artistic rendition of the prototype.
