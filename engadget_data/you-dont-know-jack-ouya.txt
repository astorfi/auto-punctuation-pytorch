If you so much as touched a computer in the 1990s, we'd wager that the mere mention of You Don't Know Jack will bring back a flood of memories. Jellyvision's irreverent trivia game has seen a resurgence in popularity over the last few years, with its presence expanding to Facebook, iOS and Android, and the Jack Attack isn't stopping there: beginning June 11th, you can "Screw Your Neighbor" on the OUYA game console. You'll be able to get a trial 11-question episode for free or upgrade to get a full set of 20 games. Cleverly, this version includes a new feature called Party Play which lets up to three additional players compete against you by turning iOS and Android devices into external controllers. Not a bad addition for OUYA users eager to answer questions like the one you see above (and if you're curious, we're pretty sure the answer is "The Keebler Elves").
