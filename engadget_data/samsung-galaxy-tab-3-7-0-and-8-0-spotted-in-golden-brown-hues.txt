Do you wish Samsung would color its newer Android tablets in a shade other than washing machine white? You may be in luck: @evleaks claims to have images of both the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 and 8.0 in what's billed as a "gold-brown" tint. There aren't any details of when these earthier variants could launch, or if other colors would tag along. Knowing Samsung's willingness to offer a rainbow-like selection of devices, though, brown might not arrive alone.
