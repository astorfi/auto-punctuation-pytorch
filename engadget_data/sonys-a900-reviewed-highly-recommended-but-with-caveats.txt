Overall findings are much the same as the site's earlier impressions, with the main knocks being slow (but accurate) focus speed and noticeable noise when shooting at anything greater than ISO 400, making the camera's ISO 6400 mode borderline useless. However, the hefty, 850g magnesium alloy body is "incredibly solid" and its bevy of features, including 5fps burst shooting and HDMI output, make it a solid value, too. Overall the A900 sounds quite good, though far from perfect, so unless you already have a closet full of compatible lenses you might just want to wait a month and see how Canon's EOS 5D Mark II fares when run through the same ringer. If nothing else it'll be $300 cheaper.
