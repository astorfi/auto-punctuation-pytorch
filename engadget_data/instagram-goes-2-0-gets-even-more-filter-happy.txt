At the top of the list is Live Filters, which let you view images through effects in real-time, before taking a photo. Filters have been sped up post-picture taking as well, as has the tilt-shift function. The revamped app also introduces the Amaro, Rise, Hudson and Valencia filters and high-res photos at up to 1936 x 1936 on the iPhone 4. The app is getting a new icon and a few smaller tweaks like the ability to turn off borders. That long-awaited Android app is still conspicuously absent, however.
