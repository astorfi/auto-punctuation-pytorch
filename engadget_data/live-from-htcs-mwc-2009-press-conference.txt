11:57AM That's a wrap!11:56AM Peter just fielded a question about Android devices; he says they're "very focused" on the WinMo news today, and there won't be any Android announcements. So much for the G2.11:55AM "Enjoy the show." That's it! Q&A time.11:54AM Peter just spilled the beans: "Later today, together with Microsoft, we're introducing together with Microsoft Windows Mobile 6.5. Both of these devices are Windows Mobile 6.5 ready. Buyers will get free upgrades to 6.5"11:53AM "These devices will also work with the future of Windows -- we'll be announcing exactly what that's all about at the 3PM press conference." Hmm... don't suppose that could be Windows Mobile 6.5?11:52AM HTC has sold more Windows Mobile devices than any other WinMo partner -- no surprise there.11:52AM "The devices that HTC is launching here today, plus their innovation, is a step forward for our partnership. We're very excited about the work they've been doing."11:51AM "I want to talk about partnership...last year, we have worked so closely with Microsoft to assist us and make these experiences so fantastic." He's introducing Microsoft's Andy Lees to the stage.11:50AM Peter's coming back on stage!11:49AM Both will be launching starting in the second quarter, with the Touch Diamond2 coming first.11:49AM Looks like we're wrapping up the Touch Diamond2 / Touch Pro2 conversation with a summary of the new stuff.11:48AM When you place the Touch Pro2 on a table, it's automatically a speakerphone. And seriously, the back of this phone looks like a speakerphone -- hard to mistake it for something else.11:47AM Straight Talk in action: "It practically shouts to me, John, just press that big green button!"11:46AM Considering the discussions here, it's obvious that HTC's targeting the Touch Pro2 at a squarely business-minded audience -- lots of talk about conference bridge numbers.11:45AM Sometimes, a simple phone call would suffice -- no need to bust out an email on that Chiclet keyboard, right? Just press "Talk" from an email, and Straight Talk does its thing. Pretty slick.5:44AM With a 3.6 inch WVGA, proximity sensor, sliding QWERTY keyboard, 2 speakers, 2 microphones for noise cancellation.5:43AM Introducing the HTC Touch Pro25:41AM HTC's People-Centric Communication enables threaded SMS, all email, phone calls broken down into a per-person view5:39AM Push Internet will enable you to select a couple websites and have the contents automagically delivered on a set schedule.
