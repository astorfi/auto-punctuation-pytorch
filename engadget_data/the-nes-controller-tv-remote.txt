What, you weren't satisfied with your NES controller
optical mouse? You wanted something a little more panache, with a certain je ne sais quoi, oui? Enter the
NES TV remote. Besides, it makes a lot more sense than a mouseâ€”hey, the NES controller belongs in your living room,
buddy. Ah, yes, janky hacks that poignantly remind us of the folly of youth. Ok, so what's next on the list, NES
controller flash audio player, NES controller cellphone, or NES controller laptop?
