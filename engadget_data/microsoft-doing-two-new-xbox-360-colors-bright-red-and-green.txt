 Come September 30th you'll be able to yourself some Microsoft Xbox 360 controllers in limited edition bright red and green colors. The packages will be slightly different, however, with the red including a Play & Charge Kit (i.e. rechargeable battery and USB cable) for $65, while the green (and how -- shown above) comes straight for $55. Unapologetically, Microsoft lists the "SKU role" for each controller as "profit driver." Indeed.
