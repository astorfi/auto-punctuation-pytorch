Google's efforts to improve internet journalism are going far, far beyond a special YouTube feed. The search firm has officially launched the Google News Lab, an initiative that helps reporters collect and publish news online. The Lab shows journalists how to use Google tools like data visualizers, Maps and Trends. It's also partnering with news outlets on data experiments, fostering media startups and supporting citizen journalism. Google hopes that all these tutorials and team-ups will adapt journalists to the direct, data-driven nature of internet reporting -- and, no doubt, show that the company isn't always at odds with publishers.
