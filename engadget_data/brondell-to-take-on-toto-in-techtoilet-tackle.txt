Like so many other imports that just haven't been able
to break America, Toto ever remains on the list of companies we
probably won't ever see selling wellâ€”enter the Swash (400/600) by Brondell, a Toto Washlet workalike (you know the
Washlet, it's kind of like a mini-bidet) with a heated seat and mechanical opening/closing mechanism to handle all your
"posterior & feminine wash[ing]" needs. Did we mention this
toilet accessory was created by ex-Spinner.com
founder David Samuel? (As if that will change your opinion.)
