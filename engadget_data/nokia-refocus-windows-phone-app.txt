Unveiled at its Lumia launch event in Abu Dhabi in October, Nokia has finally made Refocus, its Lytro-like variable depth of field app, available to all PureView Lumia devices. The tool makes use of Scalado's imaging technology to change the focus of a photo using "clever algorithms," while also adding deeper color using a feature found in other Nokia apps called "color pop." Nokia's new app integrates with SkyDrive to host your photo, creating a unique page on Nokia's dedicated Refocus website that can be shared via email, SMS or Facebook. If you own a Nokia Lumia 920, Lumia 925, Lumia 928 or Lumia 1020, you'll need the Amber update installed to enjoy the app. Lumia 1520 owners can grab it when the device goes on sale in the coming days.
