 Oh Lee Kun-hee -- if you keep this up, you're going to make the Enron CEOs look like choir boys. The latest episode in the unending shame-game that is Samsung's corporate improprieties comes in the form of a an actual indictment against the electronic-maker's top man... for fraud. According to a report out of Australia, prosecutors in Korea have formally charged Kun-hee (who has admitted guilt anyhow), but say they won't arrest him because it would cause "enormous disruption" in the company's operations. Authorities said instead they plan to send him to a week-long, all-expenses-paid trip to a luxurious spa, and hope that a deep tissue rub will rid him of his lawbreaking ways.[Thanks, Hussain]
