Yeah, it's just the same cameraphone we fondled back at CeBIT in March of this year but hey, our eyes can't help but well with pride at the site of our pup all growed-up and turned out for use in the mean Seoul streets. All the specs are the same -- DMB mobile TV, MP3 player, business card reader, 3x optical zoom, LED autofocus, MMCmicro expansion, TV-out, and EV-DO -- only the price is new: 900,000 won or about $950 US green. Hey, bragging rights don't come cheap.
