Starting with the big boy, we've got the 65-inch LN52A750 (also available in 40-, 46- and 52-inches), which sports a 1080p resolution with 120Hz Auto Motion Plus technology. Additionally, you'll find an Ethernet connection for accessing customizable RSS feeds, 1GB of internal flash memory that "includes interactive content such as cooking recipes, children's entertainment, HD artwork and more," a four-millisecond response time, four HDMI 1.3 sockets with CEC and a USB 2.0 port for connecting PMPs and the like. Also on the way is a slightly downgraded 6 series sans flash memory and side mounted USB port, due in March in the same sizes.
 

LN40650T:The less impressive LN40A450 (available in 19-, 22-, 26-, 32-, 37- and 40-inch sizes) caps out at 1080i, touts up to three HDMI ports and will be available in pearl white (select models only) or piano black. Unfortunately, Sammy's not doling out any more information than that at the moment, but both lineups are scheduled to land this March at prices unbeknownst to us. The 5-series of LCDs come in 32-, 37-, 40-. 46- and 52-inch sizes, adding touch sensitive buttons, two more HDMI ports and a side mounted USB jack. All are due in March.LN32A550P:
