Better yet, in addition to images that would seem to confirm Android 2.2 and a GT-P1000 model number, the site has also passed along the tipster's own impressions. First off, and this should be no surprise to anyone who's ever owned a Samsung product (eh hem, Galaxy S), the Galaxy Tab is very plasticky and much lighter than the iPad. Ifanr's tipster also confirms a 1,024 x 600 pixel resolution packed into that 7-inch display on a device that's much thicker than the Dell Streak. Other "confirmed" specs are a 3.2 megapixel camera, 3G network, and built-in "ebook" app that's supposedly one of the best the tipster's ever used on an Android device. Of course, while this aligns with specs we heard about earlier, this device looks to be very much a prototype (where's the silver ring around the bezel) so don't take this as the final word on the matter, ok? One more image after the break.
