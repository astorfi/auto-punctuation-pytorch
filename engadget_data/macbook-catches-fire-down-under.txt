Normally we wouldn't even bother posting yet another set of these pics -- after all, recalls have been issued, apologies have been offered, and we've all moved on to complaining about other stuff, right? -- but the fact that this particular Mac's battery was reportedly not on any recall list is just a little bit worrisome. According to MacTalk forum member mattyb, he and his girlfriend were awakened around 3:00 A.M. Sunday night by the smell of smoke, which they quickly traced to a smoldering MacBook and the magazines it had set ablaze.
