Following in the footsteps of Facebook -- which revealed its first Global Government Requests Report just a few weeks ago -- Yahoo is finishing out the week by publishing data of its own. The firm's first "global law enforcement transparency report" covers governmental requests for user data from January 1st through June 30th of this year, and the outfit plans to put out subsequent reports every six months. Of note, Yahoo claims that it's including "national security requests within the scope of [its] aggregate statistics," and for the paranoid in attendance, you may be relieved to know that said requests comprise "less than one one-hundredth of one percent (<.01%)" of Yahoo's global userbase. Feel free to dig in at the links below, but sadly, you won't find anything other than high-level macro figures. (As an aside, that logo.)
