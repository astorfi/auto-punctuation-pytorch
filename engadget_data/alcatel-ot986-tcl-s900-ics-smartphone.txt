Dubbed "OT986," this 4.5-inch device packs a hefty amount of all-around power (unlike that Venture), starting with its 1280 x 720 HD, IPS display, which is paired nicely alongside a dual-core 1.5GHz CPU (TI OMAP 4460), one gig of RAM and 8GB of internal storage -- and, there's also a lower-end model sporting a 1.2GHz processor and a mere 4GB of built-in storage. Furthermore, Alcatel's new Ice Cream Sandwich slab is said to hit the Chinese market under the TCL S900 moniker for 1,999 yuan (about $314), but deets are still cloudy on whether it'll be stuffed with the same juicy specs as the aforementioned OT986. While we wait to hear which other countries the device will make its way into, though, you can hit the source link below to gander at some extra eye candy.
