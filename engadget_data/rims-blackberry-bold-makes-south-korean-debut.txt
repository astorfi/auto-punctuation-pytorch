 It's a good day to be in South Korea. While your evil neighbor to the north has likely been importing BlackBerrys of all flavors for years now, it has remained essentially impossible to own anything other than an LG or Samsung handset in your own nation. Today, that changes. RIM and SK Telecom have finally come together to launch the BlackBerry Bold, with sales expected to begin before the end of the year. There is a catch, however: as of now, "only corporate customers will be allowed to sign up for service." Thankfully, the rule requiring cellular devices to "carry special software adapted to South Korea's wireless internet platform" will be axed on April 1st of next year (no joke!), which should open things up quite nicely for mere mortals. Dare we say it's party time?
