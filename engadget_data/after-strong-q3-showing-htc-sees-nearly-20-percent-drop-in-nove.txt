Since then, however, things have apparently gone downhill in a pretty drastic way, as evidenced by an unaudited revenue report for the month of November. In an announcement issued today, the manufacturer confirmed that it saw about 31 billion Taiwanese dollars ($1.03 billion) in consolidated revenue last month, down 19.6 percent from November 2010, when it raked in some 38.5 billion Taiwanese dollars (about $1.27 billion). HTC didn't offer an explanation for the drop, though an earlier Q4 earnings forecast predicted that the company's impressive streak of robust earnings reports would soon come to an end. It remains to be seen whether December treats the company more gently, but for now, you can check out the full financial breakdown at the source link, below.
