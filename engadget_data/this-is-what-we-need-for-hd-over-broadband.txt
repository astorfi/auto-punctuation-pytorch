"Information Autobahn!" Our sister-blog, Cinematical, just posted about a 1 terabit
per second transfer mechanism that can move a two hour movie in the
blink of an eye; or a half-a-second, if you're a slow blinker!

The technology is expected to be mainstream in about five years, so
don't throw out your Windows Media Center just. The Kansei Electric
Power Company in Japan figures 2010 at the earliest for this type of
Internet speed. I could do the math for the transfer time of a single
hour of high-def, but then you wouldn't have anything to do tonight. Go
get your calculator and share with the group! Hmm....will "bit-torrent"
be renamed "tera-bit-torrent?"
