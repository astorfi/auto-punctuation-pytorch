YouTube-loving Windows Phone fans just got some good news... sort of. Microsoft has pushed out an update to its self-developed YouTube app that restores playback. Unfortunately, it's a crude solution -- Microsoft has simply reverted its app to the web shortcut that Windows Phone users have known for years. Viewers can still track their subscriptions, but they won't get file transfers or notifications like they can through other apps and platforms. We've reached out to Microsoft for an explanation, but the regression suggests that company doesn't expect to resolve its dispute with Google any time soon.
