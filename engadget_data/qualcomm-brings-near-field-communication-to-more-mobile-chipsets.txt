 As stellar as things like contactless payments are, short-range communications applications have generally struggled to gain adoption (Bluetooth notwithstanding). Qualcomm's hoping to change all that with its announcement that certain new products in its portfolio will arrive with NFC capabilities baked right in. The outfit's goal here is to "accelerate the commercial availability of mobile handsets featuring the short-range technology," but unfortunately, it has yet to publicly gloat about signing any partner deals with its Mobile Station Modem (MSM) chipsets. We'll be keeping a close eye out at Mobile World Congress for any NFC inclusions, but honestly, we don't have a great deal of hope that any North American handsets will be in the bunch -- if there's a bunch at all.
