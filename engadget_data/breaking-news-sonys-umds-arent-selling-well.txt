 Sony, youthink just because you (half) invented the CD you're entitled to foist upon the world format after crappy format, buthow long until you listen up? MiniDisc, and Memory Stick (Pro, Duo, Pro Duo, M2, etc.), there's a good reason theydidn't stick like you'd hoped and still arouse the ire of consumers everywhere. But please, just don't act allsurprised that the UMD isn't taking, and that studio after studiois cutting back UMD releases, according to Variety; Warner's nixing six future UMD titles, stating they're"disappointed with consumer demand [in UMD] at this time." Virgin, UMD's biggest buyer to date, isn't makingmore roomÂ  for new UMDs, either, stating "the overall impact of the format has still been nominal." Youguys want to know why though? Here's some free market advice: UMD only plays in one device (the PSP), and the format isso closed consumers can't even buy recordable UMDs (and never will be able to), let alone play them in other devices.Where's the "universal" in this media disc?P.S. Variety mentioned a couple of time's SCEA's plansto move more UMDs: a Sony TV adapter for the PSP. Sounds like a natural fit (after some especially unnatural hacks), but we have a feeling perhapsVariety might just be confusing this with the PSP's newfound ability to play LocationFree TV streams.
