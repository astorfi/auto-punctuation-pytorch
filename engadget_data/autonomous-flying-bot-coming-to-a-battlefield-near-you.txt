 Defense Contractor BAE Systemshas demonstrated an unmanned flying robot that can take off and land vertically, fly for more than an hour, and drop apayload in a specified location without any human intervention. The bot was tested as a system for deploying acommunications array dubbed WolfPack, which is used to jam enemy battlefield transmissions and block jamming oftransmissions from friendly forces. The unmanned bot can reach speeds of up to 30 knots, and is able to drop itspayload within one meter of a predefined target location.[Via Robot Gossip]
