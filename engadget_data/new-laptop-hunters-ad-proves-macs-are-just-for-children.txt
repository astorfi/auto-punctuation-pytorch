We learn during the commercial that the two need a computer which is "fast" because they need to "look up stuff" before they "get to baseball." Luckily for them, there are plenty of great PC options for their under-$1500 budget. Sure, they veer off in the middle there, almost buying a Mac -- which Lisa notes are "popular at this age" (we guess what she meant to say is that they're for children). Regardless, they're both so turned off by the cute-but-small computers that they hurry back to the affordable VAIO section and make off with a sweet 16-incher. But hey, don't take our word for it -- check out the really real mother and son for yourself in the full video after the break.
