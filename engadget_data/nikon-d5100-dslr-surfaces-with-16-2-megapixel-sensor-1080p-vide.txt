Then we've got some good news for you, as Digital Home Thoughts has now let slip some official details and pictures of Nikon's new prosumer D5100 model. This one steps things up to a D7000-matching 16.2 megapixels from the 12 megapixel D5000, and boasts a 3-inch articulated display (side-mounted this time), 1080p video recording at both 30 and 24 fps (with autofocus!), ISO settings from 100 to 6,400, and an 18-105mm lens included in the kit (no body-only option available just yet, it seems). What's more, Nikon's also releasing a new ME-1 microphone alongside the camera to let you take full advantage of those video recording capabilities -- check it out after the break. Look for this one to set you back $899.95 for the kit, with the mic running $159.95. Those are Canadian prices according to Digital Home Thoughts, though we'd expect US pricing to be the same.
