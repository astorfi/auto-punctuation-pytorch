Sony has now finally shed some light on the problems it's been having with PSN and, to nobody's surprise, the culprit for its troubles has been identified as "an external intrusion."

Sony now intends to keep both PSN and its Qriocity music streaming service offline until it can pinpoint the vulnerability that has been exploited and put a stop to it. Skip past the break for the company's full statement.

Update: The PlayStation Blog has added an update to its US portal this evening that suggests the service disruption may continue for a good while longer -- according to Sony's Patrick Seybold, the company is "rebuilding our system to further strengthen our network infrastructure," and working non-stop to do so.
