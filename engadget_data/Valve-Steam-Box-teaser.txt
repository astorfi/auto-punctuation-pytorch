There's only so much we can read into Valve's vague plans to "connect the dots for customers who want Steam in the living room," but the safe bet is on the Steambox. The company's just-launched teaser site shows a countdown clock leading up to Monday's announcement, as well as an image of a controller leading into darkness (oh, and there's the profile of a cat, too). Valve's planned entry into the hardware space has already been well-documented, so a dedicated console for PC-gaming in the living room should come as no surprise. What's more intriguing, however, is Valve's desire to connect users to its "design process." Could that mean the launch of a beta testing program? We'll know for sure come early next week.
