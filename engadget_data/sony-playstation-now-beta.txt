While its E3 presser has mostly been about specific games like Little Big Planet 3 and Destiny, Sony has just given us a bit of good news about its game streaming service, PlayStation Now. Starting July 31st, all gamers in the US and Canada (excluding Hawaii and Alaska) will be able to join a full public beta of PS Now, assuming they have a PS4. PlayStation 3, Vita and "select" Sony TV owners (meaning you need the right TV model and a DualShock 3 controller to pair with it) will also be getting beta access shortly thereafter.


Update: Sony has pushed out a press release with pricing information for some of the service's games. There will be over 100 titles available, all for rent at prices between $2.99 and $19.99 available for varying periods of time. Subscription-style access is still off in the future, as is a "pilot service" for compatible Bravia TVs, or access in Asia and Europe.



What sorts of games can you look forward to streaming? Now's library boasts over 100 PS3 games, including: Dead Space 3, Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes, Ultra Street Fighter 4 and Ratchet and Clank: Into the Nexus. The open beta follows the invitation-only private testing that launched back in January, and it means that the service is inching ever closer towards its official release. Let's hope we don't have much longer to wait.
