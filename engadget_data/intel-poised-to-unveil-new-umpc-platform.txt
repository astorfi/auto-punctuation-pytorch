Known only by its codename "McCaslin," the chipset will reportedly occupy a space of 975 square millimeters (as opposed to the relatively enormous 2915 square millimeters of today's models) and feature power-sipping 600MHz and 800MHz processors known as "Stealey" that are targeting four to five hours of run time. Also sporting additional comm ports for devices such as GPS, 3G, and DTV, McCaslin is said to be Intel's response to Via's small form factor C7M, which has been adopted into models like Samsung's Q1 and continues to provide advantages over offerings from Santa Clara. Hit the Read link for a few more deets and another slide, and obviously stay tuned, as this rumor should be validated or debunked within a matter of days.[Via The Inquirer]
