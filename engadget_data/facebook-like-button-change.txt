Facebook's iconic "Like" button is changing today, and the thumbs up symbol we've long associated with it is no more. The company's Share button is also changing, though we're gonna guess you're not quite as interested.


Both buttons are seen -- daily -- around 22 billion times, so you have to imagine changing the design is a bit more suspenseful than the relatively rote change it seems to be. It also has a pretty serious impact on the virality of web content and the way that businesses promote their products -- Facebook's Ray C. He says on Facebook's dev blog that, "We're already seeing a favorable increase in Likes and Shares with the new design and will be rolling these buttons out to everyone in the coming weeks." Hilariously, Facebook's own post still has the original 2010 Like button design embedded.


Should you wish to pour one out for the little digital hand that got your virtual social life off the ground, might we suggest marathoning Happy Days episodes?
