We all knew it was only a matter of time before decked out handhelds disguised as
high-end remotes took over
(Harmony and
Nevo, anyone?), and you know you're not
using the mother of all universal remotes when it's Philips' new RC9800i, a device with a 3.5-inch 65k color QVGA TFT
touchscreen interface, 600 pre-programmed IR codes and IR "learning" capabilities, 802.11b/g WiFi (for UPnP device
control and even streaming audio through the device), integrated li-polymer battery, speaker, USB connector, dock, 32MB
of RAM, and 32MB flash memory. Funny, this is like the freaking Hummer of remote controls, and all we want to do is
hack it to make world's most expensive (try $600 US on for size, friend)
TV-B-Gone.
