 It's been over a year since we first spotted Metalink's draft-802.11n components designed for networked home theater gear, and now it seems that the company has finally found a partner willing to include the technology in a slew of next-generation products. Known as WLANPlus, the chipset family is poised for integration into TVs, DVRs, and DVD players from Chinese manufacturing giant Haier -- perhaps best know around here for the pen-like P7 cellphone -- which will allow consumers to broadcast multiple high definition streams around the house thanks to draft-n transfer speeds in excess of 200Mbps. The two companies revealed their partnership at this year's SINOCES, where Haier had several WiFi-equipped TVs on display in a multi-room setup meant to simulate simultaneous streaming in a household environment. GigaOM points out, however, that it may be awhile before we see actual products stemming from this deal hit the marketplace -- if we ever see them at all -- as Metalink doesn't seem to be in the best financial shape, having already lost $4.1 million in the first quarter of this year alone.[Via GigaOM]
