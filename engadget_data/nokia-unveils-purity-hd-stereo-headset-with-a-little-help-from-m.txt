The line includes headphones and earbuds (Purity In-Ear Stereo Headset), whichever tickles your fancy, and with that trademark M on the side, you can bet they'll bear a healthy price tag when they hit shelves. Naturally, there's also a couple of YouTube videos showing it off in the traditional Nokia strongholds of rock music and dancing, check those out after the break.
