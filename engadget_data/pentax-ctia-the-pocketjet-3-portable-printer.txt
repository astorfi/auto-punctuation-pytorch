It's the last day of the CTIA wireless trade show, and we're scrambling to get together all the odds and ends that
we didn't get to during the big news days of Monday, including Pentax's new-ish PocketJet 3 ultraportable printer (it
was actually announced a couple of months ago). Probably not gonna want to print out the senior thesis on this one
(you'll be lucky to get three pages per minute, tops), but the PocketJet 3 is small enough and light enough to toss in
your laptop bag (or attach to your body so you can become some sort of human/peripheral hybrid). Works with Macs, PCs,
and Linux, as well as Palm, Windows Mobile, and Symbian-powered smartphones and PDAs and use direct thermal printing
instead of ink, so you don't have to worry about scoring a refill while you're on the road. Click for another action
shot.
