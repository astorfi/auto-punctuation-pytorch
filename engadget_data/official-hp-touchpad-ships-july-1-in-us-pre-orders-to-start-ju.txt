The outfit itself just affirmed that the long-awaited TouchPad will go on sale to eager Americans on July 1st, with the UK, Ireland, France and Germany a few days later (and Canada in mid-July). Following that, a phased rollout will take it to Australia, Hong Kong, Italy, New Zealand, Singapore and Spain "later this year." It'll be on sale pretty much everywhere for $499.99 (16GB) / $599.99 (32GB) -- or £399 / £479 across the pond -- with pre-orders starting at your favorite e-tailer just ten days from today. For those looking for a highly connected version HP also made clear that it'll be partnering with AT&T for a 3G (or will it be "4G?") edition later in the summer. Head on past the break for a look at the full retail partner list, and yeah, yesterday would be a great time to start saving up.
