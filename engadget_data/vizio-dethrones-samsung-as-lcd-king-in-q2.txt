Whoa, where did Vizio come from and what the heck is happening to Sony? We've heard of the Circuit City/Aldi/Walmart/ brand for sometime now, but didn't have any idea they were such a major US LCD player. TGDaily is reporting that the budget brand shipped 130k more LCDs than the former leader, Samsung, during '07's second quarter. Vizio's shipment increased an impressive 76% over last year and now surpasses not only Samsung, but also Sony, Philips and Sharp. Keep in mind that these are simply units shipped and not units sold, however, the two stats do share a bed. The same report indicates that while Vizio is increasing at a neck breaking speed, Sony just might be breaking their neck. Their quarter two shipments dropped a whopping 43% over last year. There seems to be a major shift in the LCD market and with the holiday season right around the corner, yeah - it's that time again, we can't wait to see the Q4 shipment and sales numbers.
