  The Blu-ray camp is moving the hype machine to 11 now that HD-DVD is in stores. The latest is Sony's own BDP-S1 showing up on their website for pre-orders, ready to take the $999.95 that has been burning a hole in your pocket. Of course if you start financing it at $29 a month, you'll have it paid off by the time HVD comes out.Continue on for the feature list, is all that 1080p, uncompressed multi channel audio goodness worth it to you? Frankly I'm unimpressed, you'd think that for $1000 you could at least get the twin HDMI outs they claim will be on the Playstation 3. And a "blue glass front"? Call me back when it's chrome plated and spinning. "On or about August 15", update your calendars children.[Via engadget]
