While we're waiting (and rather impatiently, we might add) for Motorola to officially take the wraps off the Droid Ultra and Moto X, a pair of mystery devices from the company have popped up at the FCC. We can't say for sure what the Motorola XT1030 and XT1080 are, but we can tell you these unannounced devices are likely headed for Verizon here in the US. Inside both handsets you'll find support for LTE bands 4 and 13, along with EVDO Rev. A and WCDMA on 850/900/1900/2100. There's even room for NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 and 802.11ac radios as well.


The combination of practically every available wireless technology in a single handset has us pretty excited, but we're also pretty confident that inside beats a beefy Qualcomm heart. The filings reveal little else, besides the fact that the XT1080 appears to be quite a bit larger than the XT1030. Is the 1030 the briefly leaked Droid Ultra? Could the XT1080 be Big Red's variant of the Moto X? Who knows? Heck, the RAZR family is just about due for an update too. You know the drill: hit up the source if you like highly technical filings, or just sit and play the waiting game.
