  For a company so focused on secrecy, Apple never really did all that good of a job keeping its connection with Corning under wraps. We've always suspected that the company enlisted the Gorilla Glass maker for the iPhone, though it didn't really go out of its way to admit it -- even going so far as omitting the New York-based company from its 2011 suppliers list. Cupertino offered it a little love today, however, giving Corning a nod in its chipper job creation report. While it didn't actually mention Gorilla Glass by name on the page, Apple was happy to talk up the "Corning employees in Kentucky and New York who create the majority of the glass for iPhone."
