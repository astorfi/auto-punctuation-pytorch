As a part of the deal, future SanDisk video products will include interoperability with the DivX Stage6 video website, and while it wasn't directly stated that firmware would be pushed out to upgrade existing units, we've got our collective fingers crossed. Unfortunately, SanDisk apparently isn't quite ready to divulge exactly what products (if not all of the video-playing varieties) will indeed be stickered with a DivX-certified logo, but it did say that it would relieve that tension and let us all know "later this year."[Via TGDaily]
