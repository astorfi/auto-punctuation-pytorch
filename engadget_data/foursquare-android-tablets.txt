While iOS has continued to tout its lead in native tablet apps over other platforms, there are a few cases where it lags and now Foursquare is one of them. A new update to the Android app features a new map browsing experience for tablets and large screen phones, plus improvements to the Explore feature. On the other hand, iPad users still have to deal with a stretched out version of the iPhone app for their check ins and discovery, although a fresh update there tweaks search suggestions and spellcheck in Explore. This isn't the first go round for a tablet optimized Foursquare experience on Android as the Sony Tablet S had its own app, although that was built by a third party and not fully featured.
