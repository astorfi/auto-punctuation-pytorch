 Why go through the hassle (and lines of fire) to get your palms on a shiny next generation system when game developers are still popping out fresh hits for your Sega Dreamcast? You heard right, Sega's last flailing attempt in the console market still has a dream burning somewhere in Japan, as recent reports claim that "Warashi will be porting its arcade shooter Trigger Heart Exelica to the system." The game itself is a "side scrolling shooter" that utilizes a "three button system" (Genesis, anyone?) to take out your enemies. So if you're still hanging on to that (previously) antiquated console, and you don't mind games coming out some eight years after its release, then dust off the Shenmue and let it hold you over 'til the next big (and final -- right?) title lands on February 22, 2007.
