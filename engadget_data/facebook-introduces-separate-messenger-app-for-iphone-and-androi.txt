You're also able to share your location if you choose, and attach photos to your messages, but the app is otherwise streamlined and barebones -- which Facebook says is just the point. You can grab it from the App Store or Android Market now via the links below.

Update: As pointed out by Mark Levin in comments, it turns out the Beluga team did indeed have a hand in the development of the app.
