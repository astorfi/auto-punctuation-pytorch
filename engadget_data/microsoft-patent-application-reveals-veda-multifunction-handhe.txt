According to the application, "in device mode, the computing system truly assumes the look and feel of a less intimidating multi-media device, rather than that of a sometimes more intimidating computer." Similarly, the keypad lets you simply start dialing to use the phone -- all very well and good, but we've got a feeling most people would rather figure out how to use a smaller handheld than cart this monster around.[Via Unwired View, thanks Staska]
