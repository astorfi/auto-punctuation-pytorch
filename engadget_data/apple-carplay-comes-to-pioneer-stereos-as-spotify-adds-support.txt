Apple's fledgling CarPlay infotainment system just got a little more useful thanks to updates from Pioneer and Spotify. The former has updated some of its stereos to include support from today, while the latest version of the popular music streaming app adds CarPlay functions for the first time. This means users can control the app through supported systems. Spotify was listed as one of very few app launch partners for CarPlay, and was included in a demo we checked out back in March. Similar services like Beats Music, iHeartRadio and Stitcher have also pledged to support the system. Virtually every major manufacturer has promised to include CarPlay in their vehicles at some point, although at the moment your only options are to buy a Ferrari FF or an aftermarket unit from Pioneer.
