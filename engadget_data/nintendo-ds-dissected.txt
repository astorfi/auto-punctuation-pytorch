The people at Lik-Sang were kind enough to take apart a Nintendo DS for us, revealing not too many surprises. 
Of note was confirmation that the DS uses the same battery as the GBA SP.  Also confirmed is the fact that the GBA
Movie Player works with the DS, and the better TFT screen on the DS makes the videos look even better.  The DS can
be taken apart using the same tool used for the SP.  We recommend enjoying your DS for at least a few hours before
ripping it open, however.
