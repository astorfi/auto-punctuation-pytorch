Sony's Xperia Z2 is already available in a few corners of the world, but North America has so far been left high and dry. That drought will soon come to an end, though, as Bell says that it's bringing the waterproof Android flagship to Canada this May. While the carrier isn't divulging pricing at this stage, we'd expect the Z2 to cost $200 Canadian or more on a two-year plan, like most high-end smartphones. As for the good ol' US of A? Unfortunately, there's no word on an American launch -- for now, you'll have to make do with the Xperia Z1S if you live stateside.
