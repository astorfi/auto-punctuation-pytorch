Promising to transform our devices and our lives, Jonny Shih revealed the Transformer Pad Infinity to a packed press room here at Computex 2013. Its 10.1-inch screen packs a potent 2,560 x 1,600 resolution, alongside a quad-core Tegra 4 chip clocked at 1.9GHz, USB 3.0 port, Bluetooth 3.0 and, whoa, 4K output via HDMI. There's 32GB of internal storage, residing inside a spun metallic-finished that's very similar to the current Zenbook series and last-generation Infinity tablets, while you'll get an SD slot through its companion dock too. We're waiting on more specifics (namely something closer to a date and pricing) and we'll let you know here when we hear 'em. For now, a quick hands-on video and some impressions are right after the break. 





In short, that display is pin-sharp. Obviously. According to one Engadget Editor, it was hard to differentiate from that resolution and 4K, but that may have been due to the distance between us and the tablet. Yep, we weren't allowed to touch it, although it's looking pretty similar the Transformer tablets we've seen before, albeit with some heavy-duty specification upgrades. We're looking forward to testing its performance (and that aforementioned UHD output) when it eventually makes it to our review inbox.
