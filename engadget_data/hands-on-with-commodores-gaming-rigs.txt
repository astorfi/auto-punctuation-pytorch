But we'll have to wait for some hard working reviews before passing judgment on something so potentially life consuming as a gaming PC. Still, they had a flood of skinned rigs to ogle and even provided us with a peek at their new "C-kin" personalization (aka, painting) software. Check all the action in the gallery below including a freshly skinned laptop which, according to Commodore, is "a hint at things to come."
