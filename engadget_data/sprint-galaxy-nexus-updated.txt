The HSPA+ plus model already scored its antidote, now its time for Sprint's LTE model to get some love. Over the next couple of days a software update (FD02) will be rolling out to the ICS flagships that should solve a rather bothersome bug that kept the devices from connecting to Sprint's data network after activation... at all. Obviously, you'll need to connect to a WiFi network to download the update if you're one of the afflicted, but you get a nice Google Wallet update for your troubles. Now lets get our Big Red Nexii patched up too and we'll all be happy campers.
