Welcome to IRL, an ongoing feature where we talk about the gadgets, apps and toys we're using in real life and take a second look at products that already got the formal review treatment.

Like every good sitcom family, we've got friendly neighbors who sometimes drop in to say hello. This week, at least, that neighbor is none other than SlashGear Editor-in-chief Vincent Nguyen, who played wingman to Darren Murph as he attempted to use Google Glass to film a first-person test drive in the 2014 Lexus IS. Also after the break, Andy Bowen makes a case for why the 4G iPad mini makes a better hotspot than a run-of-the-mill MiFi device.




Racing the 2014 Lexus IS, as captured by GlassI'll confess: I have an open invitation to spend $1,500 on Google Glass due to my presence at I/O 2012. After using the set that Mr. Tim Stevens purchased, however, I decided to hold off. Recently, I had the chance to race Lexus' redesigned 2014 IS at the famed Rockingham Speedway in North Carolina, and SlashGear's own Vincent Nguyen rode shotgun in order to capture my lap via Glass. (P.S. -- His take is here.)
You see, the new IS is a beast unto itself. The acceleration, handling and overall seating comfort have been markedly improved compared to the 2013 edition (which I also drove), and the technology used to help the vehicle corner better is immediately apparent once turning into The Rock's interior road track. But aside from strapping a bunch of GoPro cameras around, how's a guy to get a video of such an event? Glass was made for situations like this. Vincent could interact with me and enjoy the turns without worrying over his job as a videographer, and the camera itself did a satisfactory job of capturing what was going on. In fact, it was probably a bit too good -- the smoothness of the capture downplays the pressure I was feeling when pressing through turns at nearly 60MPH.
