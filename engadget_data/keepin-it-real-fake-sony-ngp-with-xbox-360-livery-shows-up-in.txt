Known as the iReadyGo RG on Chinese forum CNGBA, this shameless rip-off is set to be a near-carbon copy of Sony's upcoming console with the same 5-inch touchscreen, though it isn't clear whether this will also be of OLED nature or of identical resolution. Other differences include the missing touchpad on the back, as well as the buttons' color scheme that's no doubt "inspired" by the Xbox 360 controller. The rest of the rumored specs include a 1GHz Cortex-A8 CPU, 720p camera, HDMI-out, and video playback compatibility for MP4, WMV, AVI, and many more. But what's most interesting is that apparently we'll be seeing some Android love here, and indeed, iReadyGo is currently recruiting six senior Android developers. No word on pricing or availability yet, but we'll probably wait for Sony's quad-core offering, thank you very much. Head past the break for a shot of the RG's glossy back.
