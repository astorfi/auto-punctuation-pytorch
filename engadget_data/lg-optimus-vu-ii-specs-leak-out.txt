 Having put the phat back in phablet with its original 4:3 aspect ratio, 5-inch Optimus Vu, LG seems bent on releasing a successor already, the Optimus Vu II, according to a leak from Korean blog Bad IT Tong. The new Galaxy Note II challenger would carry the same form factor and 1,024 x 768 IPS screen as the current Vu model, while doubling the RAM to 2GB, bumping the Qualcomm processor to an 8960 1.5GHz dual-core model (not the international quad-core version) and keeping the LTE radio from its US Intuition variant. It would come out of the box with Android 4.0, an 8-megapixel rear shooter, up to 32GB of microSD storage and a 2,150 mAh battery, judging by the leaked image above -- all specs we've seen before. There's no word yet on US pricing, availability, a stylus or an intriguing universal remote app teased by LG, but recent purchasers of the original Optimus Vu might be feeling left in a technology wake.
