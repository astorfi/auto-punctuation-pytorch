The company is also taking pre-orders for the monstrous NEX-7, which costs $1,350 -- slightly more than we'd expected. This camera has a 24.3-megapixel sensor, can shoot AVCHD video and stills up to 10 fps and can probably see the turn of the universe, or something. This one will make its way to homesteads in November, giving you just enough time to learn how to record everyone's disappointed faces -- come Christmas morning -- in eye watering detail.
