Compare that to the 3,000:1 contrast ratio of the current (on the right) 1080p PRO-FHD1 / PDP-5000EX ,and you can see how that is kind of a big deal. Despite the distinct lack of pricing or other information, Pioneer hopes to have its next big thing in PDP on shelves in time for the Beijing Olympics in 2008.
