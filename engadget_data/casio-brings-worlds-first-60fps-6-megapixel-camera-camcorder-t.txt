Right, bursting sixty 6 megapixel frames per second for what should be a resolution in the ballpark of 2921 x 2184. It'll even go 300fps if you want to scale things back to VGA video. The prototype features a 12x optical zoom and 2.8-inch LCD in a beefy piece of kit measuring in at 127.5 x 79.5 x 130.0-mm / 650-grams. What's also notable is what's missing from the specs: the storage utilized by this cam. A pretty serious omission when you think about the transfer speeds required to move (and store) that much data.
