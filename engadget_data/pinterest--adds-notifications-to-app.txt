Today Pinterest announced an update to its Android and iOS apps, bringing some key features from the desktop site to your smartphone or tablet. First up is the addition of notifications: now you can view all your comments and mentions via push notifications or within the app. You'll also be able to mention friends -- using the ever-popular @ symbol -- on your mobile device. Finally, Pinterest has added suggested search terms to help speed up your queries, and it will reflect searches done on your PC as well as on your handset. Nab the download for your OS of choice via the links below.
