 You might've hoped that after years of PS3 strife -- coupled with a couple of weeks in line, of course -- that once you'd forked over your $600 + games + accessories + HDMI, you could finally plop down on the couch and start washing away all the grief with MotoStorm / Genji / Ridge Racer / Resistance, smug in your next-gen digs. Well, you can... after you run a quick firmware update. See, Sony saved its PlayStation Network online service functionality for a version 1.1 update, which can be accessed from a menu item on the PS3 on launch day. Sony says it's also prepping a 3.0 PSP update for late November that will also add PlayStation Network support, along with the ability to access PS3 content via WiFi.
