Except now it comes bundled with five arcade style games (Pac-Man, Boom Boom Rocket, Feeding Frenzy, Luxor 2, and Uno), a wireless controller, HDMI, and a 256MB memory card for $280. (But like the Core, there's still no hard drive.) We so had no clue this was coming, Microsoft just completely, totally blindsided us. Damn you, Redmond, for being so very clever.
