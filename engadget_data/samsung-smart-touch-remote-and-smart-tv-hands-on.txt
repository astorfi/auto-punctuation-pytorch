(It also works with the 7000 series, but you have to buy it separately.) Unfortunately, things weren't working so well -- tons of WiFi interference in the area made control hard to do, and the system itself was a confusing UI nightmare made worse by the remote's slow resistive touchscreen. Oh, and did we mention that the remote itself is a straight-up iPhone 3G KIRF? Because yeah -- it is. Things were slightly improved when we loaded up the soon-to-be-released Android control app on a nearby Fascinate, but that didn't fix the essential issues with the UI -- it's very much just a picture of a regular remote drawn on the screen, which rarely works well on a touchscreen device. Don't just take our word for it -- check the video after the break.
