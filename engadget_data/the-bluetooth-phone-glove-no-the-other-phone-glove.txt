Inspector Gadget bewareâ€”Jason Bradbury's got your number, or at least your ticket on the hand-headset phone (you
know what we mean, where the thumb is the speaker and the pinky is the mic). That's right, the cellphone glove (no, not
that cellphone glove) is a dismantled Bluetooth headset
wired into a glove; too bad the the thumb lacks the classic telescoping antenna. Best watch out for this guy, something
tells us the next time we see him he'll be biting Maxwell Smart with a Bluetooth headset shoe.


[Thanks, rlarue]
