That's the word direct from Mark Thompson, director general of the grand old corporation, who also assures us that the global launch is definitely coming in 2011. iPad and Android apps for the iPlayer were recently launched in the BBC's homeland, so the technical requirements have already been fulfilled -- now it's probably just a matter of dotting some Is, crossing some Ts, and making sure Jeremy Clarkson doesn't score you a lawsuit with his outspoken bravado.
