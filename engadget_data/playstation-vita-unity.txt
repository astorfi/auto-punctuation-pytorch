With PlayStation Vita getting Unity game engine support in today's update, one of gaming's most widely used game engines is heading to Sony's latest handheld. And that means it's all the easier for the dozens of great Unity engine games to head to the Vita as well, to say nothing of future developments. It also means that, when games are ported, they'll have access to the full suite of PlayStation Network features (matchmaking, trophies, etc.); previously, many developers took the PS Mobile publishing route, leaving out rich features many other Vita games enjoyed.


As content is the lifeblood of any game console, we're thrilled to see what today's update means for 2014 with PlayStation Vita. Unity's also promising PlayStation 4 support in the near future, which hopefully means that applicable Unity engine games will also have crossbuy support. We can dream, can't we?
