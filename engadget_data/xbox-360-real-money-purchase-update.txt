Remember when Microsoft said that you could soon buy Xbox Live content using real money? Well, check your Xbox 360: following an update to one of our consoles, we're now seeing content available in local currency. It's unclear at this stage how many gamers are seeing the change, although Microsoft has already mentioned that the next update will flip the switch. We've reached out to the company for confirmation of the rollout. If you get the update as well, don't worry about your account balance -- as Microsoft mentioned before, any existing points will be converted to their cash equivalent.


Update: Microsoft says that real money purchases are still limited to beta program participants, and you'll have to wait until the fall to see the currency change -- false alarm, folks.
