Tim Schafer Is Happier Now
by Stephen Totilo, Kotaku


Pocket


Kotaku's Stephen Totilo caught up with Tim Schafer of Double Fine (formerly of LucasArts) to chat about his nearly 25 years of making video games, Broken Age and what's on tap for the immediate future.

   Jon's Basketball Game: Creating a Sports Video Game Has Proven to be Rather Difficult			by Jon Bois, SB Nation
 Jon Bois (of Breaking Madden fame) decided that he'd take a crack at making a basketball video game. Inspired by NBA 2K14 and the like, Bois bypassed forming the team he needed: a coder, code checker, "assistant for random things," and a boss -- along with the requisite $1,000 budget. Instead, he opted for the $10 Garry's Mod from the Steam store. As you might expect, awesomeness ensued.

     The Blood Harvest by Alexis C. Madrigal, The Atlantic
 Horsehoe crabs are ancient animals. Every year though, around half a million of the creatures are rounded up and bled alive. Why? Well, their sky blue-hued blood cells' coagulogen is used in a test by pharmaceutical companies to detect contamination.

   Sex! Drugs! Apps! SXSW Interactive at 20 by David Peisner, Fast Company
 2014 marks the 20th anniversary of South by Southwest in Austin. From modest beginnings back in '94, the event has bloomed into one of the year's most popular gatherings that combines "nerds, rock-and-roll hippie freaks, and business suits." After interviewing over 100 people, Fast Company has compiled its e-book SXSWi Uncensored: The Complete Oral History as Told by the Entrepreneurs, Geeks, and Dreamers Who Remade the Web. This entry is an excerpt from that book that's available March 3rd.
