Still, the urge to make announcements on 9-9-2009 at 9:00AM ET has gotta be too hard to pass up, and possibly not topped until 10:00AM on October 10th of next year. Video teaser after the break; no idea what we're expecting to see from Leica (M8 successor, perhaps?), but we can all but guarantee it won't be priced for mass consumption.
