 Sling Media VP of Market DevelopmentJeremy Toeman has weighed in on the vague wording in certain carrier service agreements (most notably Verizon's) whichseem to stipulate that multimedia streaming services -- like Sling's upcoming SlingPlayer Mobile -- violate the termsof service for allowable uses of 3G. Toeman posits that the wording of some service agreements could be interpreted"as meaning that viewing anything other than plain hypertext is against the terms of service," adding that"it appears to be set up so the carriers can deem things appropriate as they see fit." If carriers do decideto play hardball in limiting certain broadband activities, this could mean that the mobile Sling service mightconceivably be restricted to WiFi-only use by WM5 device owners. While we don't really agree with Toeman's assertionthat "SlingPlayer Mobile is a complementary product" to the carriers' proprietary video offerings, heconvincingly argues that Sling- and Orb-like services, combined with Windows Mobile's newfound push-emailfunctionality, could help lure RIM-devotees away from their precious Crackberries. And despite what has been labeled asinitial resistance bythe major wireless players, Toeman feels that "it's certainly conceivable that we will have an offering inconjunction with a mobile carrier down the road."
