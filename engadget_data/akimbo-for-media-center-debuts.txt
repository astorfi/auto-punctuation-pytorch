Akimbo just did exactly what we asked them to do back in
June: they're ditching the box and offering their IP video-on-demand service as a plug-in for Windows Media Center
PCs. Yeah, you can still get the standalone box, but they've just announced Akimbo for Media Center, which should be
available beginning October 25th. Sounds like it'll be more or less the same deal as the regular Akimbo IPTV service,
for $9.99 a month you'll have on-demand access to all their Free For All programming, with premium content costing
more. Exactly what they needed to do to stick around, since the last thing anyone wants is yet another box in their
living room. Now all they need to do is offer a wider selection of shows.
