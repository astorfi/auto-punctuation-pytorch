On July 3rd, the Cupertino giant filed suit in the federal district court of northern California alleging violations against its shrink wrap license, trademarks, and copyright infringement.

Which is none.Read - Confirmed: Apple files suit against PsystarRead - Apple goes after clone maker Psystar[Thanks, ginger.al]
