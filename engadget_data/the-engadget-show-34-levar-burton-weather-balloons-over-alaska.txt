But first, we're kicking things off with a quick detour to Los Angeles to check out all of the explosive sights and sounds at E3 and heading over to the gadget tables to show off the Samsung Galaxy S III on AT&T, the new MacBook Pro with Retina Display and the taking the new Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 for a spin around the studio.

 Next up, Tim heads to Alaska to work with a team of researchers studying the northern lights with high-tech balloons and helmet cameras. We've also got class visits to Northeastern University, where students are creating technology for the betterment of mankind and NYU's ITP school, where art and technology meet. ITP's Danne Woo and Matt Richardson will be showing of some of the school's projects, including the kinetically-powered Circuit Board, the Descriptive Camera and the condiment-extruding Burritob0t.

 Then we'll close things out with an interview from none other than LeVar Burton, who tells us about the rebirth of Reading Rainbow and how Project Glass and the iPad are making the real world a little bit more like Star Trek. Check out the full episode after the break!
