Ten One Design aims to remedy this legitimate complaint with its Fling joystick add-ons for the iPad. The product is simple enough, a twisted piece of plastic with capacitive contact points in the center and suction cups to stick it to the screen. They feel quite like the joysticks on a PSP, and make gaming on the device seriously more enjoyable -- not to mention natural feeling -- and other than that there's not much else to say. Oh wait, did we mention they cost $25... each? Yeah, total buzzkill.
