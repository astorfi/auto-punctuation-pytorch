Some of our peeps remember the iPod Town Hall meeting (at which Steve offered up $200 iPods -- nothing to snub your nose at its 2001 introduction) -- so if it wasn't already totally completely driven home by this point, his Steveness seriously considers this week's big launch to be a turning point for Apple, and possibly the gadget industry in general. And whether or not the iPhone's even at all successful, we'd tend to agree. Memo published after the break.
