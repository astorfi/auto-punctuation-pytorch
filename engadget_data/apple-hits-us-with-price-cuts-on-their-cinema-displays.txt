Yo Apple, your stuff is still a little overpriced, but this latest price cut on your Cinema Displays is rreeaall
sweetâ€”they're trimming $300 off their 20 and 30-inch displays, and $200 off their 23-inch (making the prices $999,
$2,999, and $1,799, respectively). That 20-inch price point is very sweet though; we're kind of wondering if this
doesn't have anything to do with the headless horseman
budget Mac we've been hearing about, but we're not
jumping to any conclusions. Except maybe that you're getting a little itchy to get rid of your stock on these things,
but we'll be happier to oblige now more than ever.
