Withthe kind of speed that makes our current cable connection look like a dial-up modem in comparison, the 200Mbpsnetworking technology that Coaxsys will be demoing at CES may soon bring to fruition the HD Engadget vodcasts that somany of you have been clamoring for. TVnet 2X, as it’s known, uses standard coax cable to achieve its blazingtransfer rates, which makes it easy to integrate into most current wiring systems, and is being touted as a perfectsolution for HD IPTV and whole-home networking, allowing multiple data-rich streams to be delivered at once.We’ll be at the Coaxsys booth at CES with stopwatch in hand, ready to report our real-world findings, as well asany deets we can dig up concerning when these fat pipes will be available to the public.
