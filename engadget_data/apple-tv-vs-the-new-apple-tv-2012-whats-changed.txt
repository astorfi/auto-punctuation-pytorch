   The Apple TV might still be a hobby, and thus not the main event at Tim Cook's Apple presentation today, but Apple's participation in the living room has had its fair share of rumors, speculation and dreams. The fact that the user experience has been streamlined is the big news today, but there is also a modest spec bump that includes the ability to play and output 1080p. Other than that you can easily see after the break how well the new Apple TV matches up with its predecessor.
