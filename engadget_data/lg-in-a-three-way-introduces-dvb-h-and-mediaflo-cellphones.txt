To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first FLO handset announcement in support ofQualcomm's proprietary technology and second major DVB-H phone on the heels of Nokia's N92. Remember, LG is SouthKorea-based and part and parcel to the global promotion of DMB as the international standard for digitalbroadcast television to mobile devices. This kind of standards promiscuity by a major handset manufacturer is a goodindicator that the fight for a world-dominating mobile TV standard is anybody's ballgame. We expect to see thesehandsets on display at CES this week so we'll bring you more deets later, mkay?
