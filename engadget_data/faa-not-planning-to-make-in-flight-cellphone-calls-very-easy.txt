For once all that crazy government red tape might be working in our favor: sure, the FAA might ease up a bit on the
rules banning cellphones from use during flights, but in order to get a waiver airlines would have to go through and
test each handset that might be used by passengers to make sure that it doesn't pose a threat to aircraft navigation or
communications systems. And we all know that ain't gonna happen. The FCC has been a little more receptive to people
using their cellies in the air, but it's like launching a missile from a submarine: both the FCC and the FAA need to
sign off on this before it can become a reality.
