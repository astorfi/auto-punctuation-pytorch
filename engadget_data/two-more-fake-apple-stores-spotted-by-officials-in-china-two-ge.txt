In fact, after American expat BirdAbroad made her local stores famous last week, local officials have since been combing through the city's 300-plus gadget shops on behalf of Apple China, and managed to dig up two more "Apple" stores. It's not exactly clear if these new offenders are at the same severity as the ones spotted by BirdAbroad, but the authorities have confirmed that none of the five stores are Apple Authorised Resellers, let alone having its permission to use its logo on their store front.

Additionally, two out of the five stores have since been shut down due to unlicensed retail operation. The fate of the remaining three is still unknown -- the officials have only concluded that no KIRF products have been found in the stores, though details such as the decor and staff uniform are certainly very similar to those of the real deal. Well, we're glad they agree, but this is only just the beginning -- BirdAbroad has since gathered photos of more sketchy Apple stores across the world, so go take a gander. Oh, and for those who have been out of the loop, there's a hands-on video of one of the Kunming stores after the break.
