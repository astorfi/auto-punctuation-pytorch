Break out the champagne, everyone, because it's finally happened: for the very first time laptops have outsold
desktops! According to research firm Current Analysis, sales of laptops accounted for 53 percent of the total PC market
last month, up from 46 percent a year earlier. Oh yeah, there's only one problem: this is almost exactly the same news
that was reported in May of 2003, when the
New
York Times (among others) wrote about how for the first time, "Laptops accounted for more than 54 percent of the
nearly $500 million in [US] retail computer sales." Ah, the amnesia of tech journalism.
