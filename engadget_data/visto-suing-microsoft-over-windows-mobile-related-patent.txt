We don't have a lot of information since the news just hit the wires, but apparently
Visto, compatriot to
NTP (as of, um, yesterday) and patent licensor to
Vodafone, Cingular, and Sprint Nextel, is gonna try suing the pants off Microsoft over patent infringement related to
PDA, cellphone, and data syncing-related technologies as found in Windows Mobile 5.0, especially with regard to their
push email strategy with Exchange Server. Apparently the patents in question were developed almost ten years ago, so if
Microsoft really is at fault here they have some serious 'splaining to do. Visto is expected to hold a press conference
regarding the lawsuit later today, so we'll keep you updated with the vitals on this one.
