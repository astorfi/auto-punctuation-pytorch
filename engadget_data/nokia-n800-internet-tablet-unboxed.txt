Oh, and did we mention it's been unboxed? Yeah, that's right, the new Internet Tablet hasn't gotten even as much as a release date yet, but it's already been party to that most geeky of rituals. So head on past the break and see this shiny wonder for yourself, there's even some live webcam action to be had -- what's there to lose?
