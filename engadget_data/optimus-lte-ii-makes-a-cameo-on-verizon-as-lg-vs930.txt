 Oh hello there, LG VS930. This handset -- which was caught in the wild by Mr. Blurrycam's cousin, Ms. Quickiecam -- looks an awful lot like an Optimus LTE II for Verizon. This makes even more sense when you consider that its predecessor, the VS920 aka. Spectrum, recently received end-of-life status. According to the anonymous tipster who sent us these pictures, the phone will ship with the following features:

  Android 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich)  1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 MSM8960 SoC  4.7-inch "True HD IPS" display (1280 x 720 pixels)  16GB of built-in storage  Global radio support (GSM/UMTS/CDMA/LTE)  NFC (it comes with programmable tags) There's no word on whether the VS930 will inherit the Optimus LTE II's 2GB of RAM [see update below] or the VS920's branding -- Spectrum 2 perhaps? We'll keep you posted when we find out more, like pricing and availability. In the meantime, take a look at the gallery below for some closer shots.
