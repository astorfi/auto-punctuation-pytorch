 ASUS already struck a chord with portable gamers when it introduced the imposing W90, and now it's looking to do the same with LAN party goers who need something just a wee bit less gargantuan. Details are light on the forthcoming G51, but we do know that it'll arrive in a few form factors (15.6- and 16-inch models) and will give buyers the choice between a Core 2 Quad and Core 2 Duo processor. There's also room for up to 4GB of DDR2 RAM as well as a 1GB GeForce GTX 260M graphics card; furthermore, you'll find an optional Blu-ray drive, 2 megapixel camera, dual 500GB hard drives and a white glossy shell. Mum's the word on pricing, but we expect to hear more on this July-bound beauty at Computex next month.[Via PCWorld]
