We've known the Pentagon has been on a quest to find autonomous replacements to tried and true human soldiers, and it looks like help is on the way from our favorite floor-cleaning supplier, iRobot. Holding true to prior expectations, the company's products were out in full force at the Association of the United States Army show, as a myriad of self-directed 'bots induced frightening thoughts of mutiny and widespread anarchy. The "armed and dangerous" bevy of creations boasted automatic shotguns, bomb launchers, precision sniper rifles, infrared cameras, and even a 30-caliber chaingun. The machines were touted as "lifesavers," insinuating that their presence on the battlefield would allow soldiers to hang back out of harm's way -- but we aren't exactly certain how these deadly automatons actually distinguish between friendlies and foes. Nevertheless, we're working under the assumption that unlike more "chore-friendly  versions," these iRobots won't be seeing any shelf time outside of maximum security armories -- but it's for our own good, anyway.[Via MobileMag]
