 Sounds like it's not much of a delay -- but be that as it may, if you were hoping to pick up your colorful N8 in the tail end of this month... well, we don't quite know how to say this, but you're going to want to make other plans. Backing up rumors that have been going around the past couple days, locales that had expected to get the N8 in September have now been pushed back to October while Nokia makes "some final amends." On the upside, some rumors had the delay pegged for November, so this doesn't seem to be as bad as it could've been. For what it's worth, Nokia mentioned during Nokia World last week (and again today) that the N8 is seeing strong pre-order demand -- the strongest ever for a Nokia device, allegedly -- so this is likely to bum out a lot of folks, and for a few, it might even be just the impetus they needed to hold out for the upcoming E7. Here's the full statement:

"The amount of preorders has exceeded our expectations and we are working hard to deliver the Nokia N8 to the market. In some markets, we had planned to start delivering the Nokia N8s to our pre-order customers by the end of September. To ensure a great user experience, we have decided to hold the shipments for a few weeks to do some final amends. We're thrilled with the response that we've had to the Nokia N8 and assure everyone who've pre-ordered it already that it'll be worth the wait! We expect consumers to get their Nokia N8s during October."
