Featuring a casing "forged" from solid titanium, a "floodlit" keypad, 4GB of internal storage -- and with the 3 megapixel autofocus cam, you'll need that space -- UMTS in the 2100Mhz range, and a design strikingly similar to all other Vertu handsets, so if you're in the market for Vertu love, now's the time to strike. We dig these handsets only because of the untouchable status the pricing scheme puts them in. Oh, and as per usual, no dollar details are listed, but they should be in the shops any day now.[Thanks, Egor L]
