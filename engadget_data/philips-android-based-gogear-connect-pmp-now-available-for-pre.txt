It'll run you $170 for the 8GB model and an even $200 for 16GB (both a slight discount off the list price), each of which come equipped with a 3.2-inch display, WiFi connectivity, built-in speakers, a microSD card slot for additional storage, and Android 2.3 with access to Android Market. Unfortunately, there's still no indication of an exact ship date, but we're guessing you won't have to wait too much longer if you decide to take the plunge.

[Thanks, Peter]
