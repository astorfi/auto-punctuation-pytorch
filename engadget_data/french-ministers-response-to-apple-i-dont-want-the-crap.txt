 French Trade Minister Christine Lagarde hashit back at Apple -- and critics of France -- in defending the country's proposed law on digital audio interoperability. In comments to reporterswhile visiting San Francisco, Lagarde declared that when "a companyrestricts competition ... it gets the attention of regulating agencies. We have to play by the rules of the game."Of course, it can be argued that Apple hasn't restricted competition, given the fact that there are a number of othercompanies operating online music stores and making digital audio players -- and that France is attempting to change therules mid-game. Lagarde also had a message for those who have criticized French policies on the Apple issue and otherrecent developments: "I don't want the crap," she said."It annoys me when France is portrayed as an awkward, backward country. It is not." Touch√©.
