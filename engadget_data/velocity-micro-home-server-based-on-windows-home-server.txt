 
Velocity Micro -- the crew that brought you many a tricked out rig and the first CableCARD Vista boxes sold -- is working on a product tentatively titled the Home Server based on, you guessed it, Windows Home Server. What we know is the Home Server can be oriented horizontally or vertically, use an Intel Conroe-like processor with DDR2 RAM, have SATA II (with NCQ), gigabit Ethernet, eSATA, and will launch at an "extremely competitive price". More as we get it.Update: Our bad, the Home Server's drive expansion box will launch Q108, but the server itself will launch when Windows Home Server is released. Also, zoomed-in pic after the break.
