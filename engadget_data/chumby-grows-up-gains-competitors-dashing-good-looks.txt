Gizmodo says the T-shaped unit's working codename is "Chumby Opus," and we wonder if that might actually refer to song; If that grille on the left's also duplicated on the right, perhaps we'll get some stereo speakers this time around. Wouldn't that be nice? Either way, it looks like black, slightly leaning flat-panel displays are still in style.
