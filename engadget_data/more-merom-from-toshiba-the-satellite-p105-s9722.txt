 You know what they say: if you've seen one "onyx blue metallic" laptop, you've seen them all, but we thought we'd run this new P105-S9722 by you just in case that's not entirely accurate. The new 17-inch laptop is mainly a Core 2 Duo bump from its Core Duo P105 predecessors, but that's not the only spec getting some love here. The laptop's "media port" can now be configured with S/PDIF or DVI-D output, along with the existing options of a 5-in-1 card reader or instant play button. Otherwise, things remain the same, though a 2.0GHz T7200 processor is nothing to scoff at. You should be able to pick up one of these now for around $2,000 with all the trimmings, including Bluetooth 2.0, 2GB of RAM, 256MB GeForce Go 7900 GS graphics and Windows XP Professional. Not bad at all.[Via Laptoping]
