We were only just getting used to the notion that those 50GB Blu-ray discs and recorders were totally beyond our
reach when the news comes that Sony is prepping an even more capacious 8-layer version of the Blu-ray disc that can
hold up to 200GB of data. No word on when it'll hit, but a 4-layer version with storage capacity of 100GB is expected
in 2007, so it'll be sometime after that.
