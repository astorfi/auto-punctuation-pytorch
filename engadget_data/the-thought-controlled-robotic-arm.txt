We were aware of otherwise primitive systems that had been interfaced with the human nervous system, but a freaking
thought-controlled robot arm? Apparently researchers at the U of Pittsburgh were able to create a full
shoulder-elbow-gripper type arm that can be jacked into a system of neural probesâ€”the machine filters out all but the
most important arm-movement neural signaling, and uses that to approximate mechanical motion with what they call a
"population vector." So basically a monkey with its limbs restrained was able to pick up, hold food, and feed itself
when its brain started firing arm movement commands. This is some seriously unbelievable freaky
awesome advanced stuff, man.
