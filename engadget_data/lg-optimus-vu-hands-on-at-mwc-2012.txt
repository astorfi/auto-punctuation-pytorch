  Yes it's the LG Optimus Vu, and we got a chance to play with it! The verdict? It's quite lovely. The design is simple but attractive, and the build quality / materials are excellent. There's no doubt this is a thin and wide device -- just like the Samsung Galaxy Note, two hands are the name of the game here. Is it a phone or a tablet? Take a look at our gallery below and judge for yourself. Hands-on video after the break.
