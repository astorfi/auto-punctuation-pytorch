The 50-inch plasma purportedly produced "highly accurate colors and deep black levels," and the "excellent uniformity, in-depth calibration, handsome styling," stellar port selection and effective anti-reflective screen didn't hurt matters. The only real digs came from the lofty price tag, less-than-perfect black levels and ho hum 24p mode -- all of which were apparently not enough to keep critics from falling at least mildly in love. Overall, the set was deemed "one of the best-performing HDTVs available," and that alone speaks volumes. Tap the read link for the full spill if you're still in disbelief.
