   Angry Birds has spawned countless ports and two sorta-sequels, but Rovio has now announced what it's describing as its biggest launch since the original game. Angry Birds Space will be released on March 22nd, and the company has enlisted NASA and National Geographic as launch partners for the game (exactly what that entails is still unclear, though). As you can probably guess, the hook this time around will be some new physics to deal with, including zero gravity and a new "lightspeed destruction" feature, but details on the game itself otherwise remain a bit light, including any specific word on supported platforms. Rovio is apparently planning a big push at launch though, with a simultaneous rollout planned across "mobile gaming, animation, retail, and publishing." It's also promising to reveal more details ahead of that in early March.
