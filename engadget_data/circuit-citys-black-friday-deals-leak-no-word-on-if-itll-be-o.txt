All that aside, five pages of mildly delectable Black Friday deals have leaked for the company, giving you a full fortnight to think things over and handpick the bargains that you'll be hunting for. Of course, savvy online shoppers like yourself aren't apt to find anything here too fantastic, but we'd wager that even a $7.99 laptop sleeve is a far better value than a $12 Guns N' Roses CD.
