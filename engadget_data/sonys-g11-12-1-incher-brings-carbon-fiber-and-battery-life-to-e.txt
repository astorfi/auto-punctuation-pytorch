It was one thing for Japan to get the Vaio G before everyone else, it is Sony's home turf after all, so how can we begrudge them launching this skinny little number there first? But now that Europe is getting its very own version of the Vaio G, the G11, we're starting to think Sony doesn't love us anymore. All the same, undeserving as Europe might be, there's some fancy new stuff in the G11, so we'll try not to get too caught up in the unfairness of it all. The most notable aesthetic difference is that new black lid color, but there's more to this case than meets the eye: there's a 90cm drop rating (Europe's elitist way of saying 35-inches) thanks to the carbon fiber casing, which is pretty dang good for a laptop with no visible signs of toughening. Sony gives this laptop an "on-the-road" battery rating of 9 hours -- as if Europe has roads -- but Japan was rating its own at 6 and 12.5 hours, so we're not sure what's changed. Improvements under the hood include a speedier Intel ULV Core Solo U1500 1.33GHz processor and a 100GB HDD. There's also a super-multi DVD burner, 12.1-inch XGA LCD with LED backlight technology, and Windows Vista Business preloaded. The standard VGN-G11XN/B model comes with 1GB of RAM, while the VGN-G11VN/T boasts of 2GB and swaps the gray lid for brown one. No specifics on price, but with specs like these and a business-oriented target market, it ain't going to be cheap.[Via Core Duo News]
