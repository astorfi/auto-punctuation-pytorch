 Sino Weibo is like Twitter, it's often said, but there are some key differences: the service is mainly used within China, it's heavily censored, and it's never been particularly well integrated into the major mobile ecosystems. That final issue is starting to change, however, as Liveside is reporting that Microsoft accounts now permit Sina Weibo connectivity. This allows crosstalk between a Chinese user's microblogging world and their Windows Phone, Windows 8 device and SkyDrive storage -- for example, allowing them to see Weibo contacts in WP's People hub or share direct links to cloud-stored files. It's not known exactly how many of the service's estimated 400 million users have adopted Windows Phone, but this update potentially gives them one more reason to hop aboard.
