Microsoft's Surface 2 is just two weeks away from hitting retail, so in the lead up to that Windows 8.1 tab's launch, the company's released a 'Making of...' video to whet consumers' appetites. As spotted by The Verge, this latest Surface 2 video focuses mainly on the innovations made to the new Touch Cover. Aside from increasing the number of colorful hues it'll be made available in (i.e., green and orange), Microsoft's revealed that this new Touch Cover will be able to support gestures. That's thanks to the new sensor array used which favors a high-resolution matrix over the pressure-sensitive sensors on last-gen's model. Just what exactly those gestures may be, we can't say for sure, as Microsoft hasn't detailed them. But if current reports are any indication, you should be able to trigger that Charm menu by swiping from the right on your Touch Cover's keyboard. Is any of this enough to sway your (credit card holding) hand and get you sign up for Surface 2? Let us know in the comments below and be sure to check out the promo video after the break.
