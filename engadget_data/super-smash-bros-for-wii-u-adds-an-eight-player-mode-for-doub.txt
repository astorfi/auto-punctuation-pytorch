Think you know everything there is to about Super Smash Bros for Wii U? Think again: during today's Smash-centric Nintendo Direct event, the gaming giant announced an eight-player mode for absolutely bananas action. How will you even keep track of all that madness on the Wii U? We're willing to find out. There are sure to be some more announcements from the broadcast, and we've embedded the video just after the break.


Update: Remember the create-a-stage feature from Super Smash Bros. Brawl? Well it's back in the Wii U version and it's gotten a pretty big upgrade thanks to the console's touchscreen-based Gamepad. You can now draw out your custom levels using the stylus (sorta like Mario Maker) and even share them online with others. Pretty neat!
