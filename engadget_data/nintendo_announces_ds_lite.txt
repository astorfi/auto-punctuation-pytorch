Anywho, their new Nintendo DS Lite skimps onthe size and weight by shaving off 1/3rd of the bulk and 20-percent of the weight, and will apparently be released inJapan on March 2nd for Â¥16,800 (about $145). It's important to remember, however, that the DS Lite we see here maynot be the device that you actually buy, being that these are still considered to be design mock-ups. See ya soon, DSLite, can't wait!
