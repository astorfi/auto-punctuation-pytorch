Version 2.59.3352 went out earlier today and also enables a beta version of its plugin system, that should allow interested providers to put their feeds into the PlayOn browser starting right now with Revision3. What's next? ABC.com on the content side and the Nintendo Wii on the hardware end. Of course, we could've just mentioned the (still working) Hulu to your TV access which is at least enough reason to give it a trial run.
