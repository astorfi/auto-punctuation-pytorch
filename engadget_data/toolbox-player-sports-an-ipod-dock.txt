In fact, it was only a bite from a radioactive Aibo that endowed us with our super powers ofgadget recall and grating snarkiness. Before this life-changing encounter with the rabid robodog, we were only meremortals making ends meet in construction, plumbing, painting, and the like. The point of this rambling intro is that wegot pretty sick of carrying both a toolbox and a boombox to the job site everyday, and longed for the day when somevisionary manufacturer would ease the burden of our heavy load. Well even though it's several years too late for us,our dream of a combination toolbox-boombox has come to fruition, in the form of product we're pretty sure is called theToolbox Player. While seemingly still in the prototype stage, this handyman's best friend sports not only an AM/FM tunerbut an iPod dock as well, although it's price and availability are still up in the air. Three cheers for convergence.
