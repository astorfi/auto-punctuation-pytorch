	Not so long ago, we were ready to believe that this plastic EV might stand a fighting chance thanks to its local charm and initial $28,000 price tag. But then the price soared, sales failed to pick up, and now it appears the Norwegian maker of the Think City couldn't cling on any longer. Think Global has filed for bankruptcy and will be liquidated in an attempt to pay off its creditors, including US battery producer and investor Ener1, which is making a $33 million charge on the company's assets. It's sad to see any such enterprise fail, but Think Global might one day be seen as a victim of the success of the EV industry, which is beginning to see better competition and lower prices.
