 
In case you hadn't noticed, rumors of an imminent Android launch on Verizon -- the carrier's first -- have been at a fever pitch the past few weeks, and like clockwork, the States' largest wireless network has gone ahead and scheduled a conference call with Google for 7AM Pacific Time / 10AM Eastern Time today. To be fair, it's not a guarantee this is Android-related, and it is interesting that Motorola isn't listed as a participant on the call considering that its Sholes / Tao / Droid had been rumored as Verizon's first Android device -- but none other than Eric Schmidt and Verizon chief Lowell McAdam will be in attendance, so we expect it to be something big. Stay tuned.
