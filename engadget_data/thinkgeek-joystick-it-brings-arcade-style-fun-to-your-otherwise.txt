The ThinkGeek Joystick-It attaches to your tablet's screen in a position of your choosing so that you can game on your shiny new slate in a decidedly retro way. The joystick is all-aluminum, works with any game that has an on-screen control pad, and does its thing without the use of batteries. We don't know how the device actually attaches to the display, but we do know that it is more aesthetically pleasing than other tactile control solutions we've seen at CES this year. The Joystick-It will cost $24.95 and be available by the end of January, so if old-school gaming is your thing, check out the demo video after the break.
