Social networks love emoji. And those better-than-real-words icons love social networks right back. Emojli is possibly the next step in that blossoming relationship: a social network with "no words, no spam, just emoji." It hasn't launched yet, but the iOS-bound network already polices a rigorous picture-only username system. (Apologies, "Monkey Train", "Fireball" and "Kitty Penguin Space Invader" have already been taken.) According to its Twitter feed, registrations passed 10,000 earlier today -- and for folks worried about the service running out of emoji, over 250,000 two-icon combinations are available, as are even longer usernames. Pointless time-waster, a nonsensical joke, or the future of this connected life? Almost certainly one of the former, but if you want that single emoji that truly sums you up, you'd best rush along to that registration page immediately.



As one of the founders, Tom Scott, put it:

"Matt and I both came up with the idea and figured if we didn't build it someone else would. We weren't sold on it until we came up with the idea that even the usernames should be emoji - at which point we both burst out laughing and decided to build it."
