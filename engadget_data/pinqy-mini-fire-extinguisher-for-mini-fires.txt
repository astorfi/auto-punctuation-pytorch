Nothing says "I love you" like a safety-minded gift that's shaped like a hand grenade, which must be why
Luxembourg-based Flanders Product is promoting their Pinqy mini-fire extinguisher as "a perfect present for your
children, friends and family."Â  While the Pinqy website hints that it's not meant for real fires ("Pinqy, the
discreet tool for putting out the beginnings of a fire," it reads), they could definately be more clear about the fact
that this product has only a 4-second discharge, making it inappropriate as a household's only extinguisher. Thanks,
but we'll be sticking to our habit of giving out regular-sized fire extinguishers to people we want to impress.
