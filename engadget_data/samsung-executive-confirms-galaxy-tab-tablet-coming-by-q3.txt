 We had more than a hunch that Samsung was toiling away on a tablet of some sort, and while we'd been loosely referring to its as the S-Pad and Tab, it looks as if the latter moniker is the one that'll stick. J.K. Shin, president of Samsung's mobile communications division, recently affirmed as much during a sit-down with the Wall Street Journal, stating the following:

 "I can also say that we are planning to launch a tablet computer, named Galaxy Tab, no later than in the third quarter of this year." 
 He didn't elaborate beyond that, so we're still on pins and needles waiting to find out if it'll run Windows 7, Bada or BeOS, but we ought to know much, much more in just a few months. An IFA debut, perhaps?
