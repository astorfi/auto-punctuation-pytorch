In addition to comfortably sitting six people, it's able to provide up to 150 watts of power and recharge fully in just three hours of direct sunlight. To make use of all that juice, the table also comes with an inverter to let you plug in a laptop or other device and, naturally, it includes some LEDs to inform you of its status. As you might have guessed, however, that convenience comes at quite a cost ($3,600), and you'll have to act fast, as there's only fifty of the tables up for grabs, with 'em set to start shipping on March 15th.[Via Slash Gear]
