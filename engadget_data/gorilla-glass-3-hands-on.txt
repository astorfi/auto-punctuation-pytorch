 We've just spent some time with Corning, which is showing off the strength of its third-generation Gorilla Glass. The company has tweaked the chemical and atomic composition of the raw materials of the glass, which in turn has increased its density -- making it much more scratch and dent resistant than last years model. Interested in seeing just how much stronger it is? Head on past the break for the video.



 In the same way the company crushed panes of competitors glass with a press last year, it's now dropping a 130 gram ball from a height to see what damage and havoc it can wreak. Once the pane had survived gravity's examination, we took it out and started bending it, and while no-company would let anyone play with something it wasn't sure would hold up, this model did appear to be hardier by a small margin. The company has also said that production of the glass will ramp up at the end of Q1 this year, and we should expect to see it appearing in mobile devices in the second half of 2013.
