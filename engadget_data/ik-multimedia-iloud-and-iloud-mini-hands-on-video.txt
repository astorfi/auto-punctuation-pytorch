 IK Multimedia got a jump start on NAMM with the announcement of its iLoud speaker duo just before the proper start of the show. Today, we swung by the company's booth to take a closer look and spend a few minutes with the Bluetooth-wielding wireless duo. The first thing that we noticed was the build quality. Both the iLoud and iLoud Mini sport a soft-touch rubber-esque coating on the top and bottom that we've seen in other Bluetooth audio units. The pair also has an adequate amount of heft without being overbearing when added to the weight of an already packed rucksack. In terms of the Mini, a single volume control rests on the right side, both USB port (for charging) and aux inputs reside around to the left and the power button is at home up top.

 For us, the real star of the show here is the regular iLoud. In addition to the same wireless capabilities as the smaller sibling, this unit packs a 1/4-inch input that houses the outfit's iRig circuitry. Essentially, one of IK Mulitmedia's adapters is crammed right into the speaker. Said jack along with controls for power, gain and Bluetooth pairing hit the backside in addition to an auxiliary port for connecting a handset or tablet via cable. The volume knob is around front on this beefier model, encircled in a glowing red light. One of the main selling points is the advertised studio-grade sound quality -- especially in the 40W iLoud -- which we were unfortunately unable to confirm due to the overly noisy show floor here in Anaheim. Jump down through the gallery to take a gander at the pair that is set to arrive in Q2 for $300 and $200 respectively.
