 While the US wireless industry seems far away from finding a universal mobile payment system, T-Mobile's new BFF MetroPCS appears to have made its choice. Taking to its official Facebook page, the carrier announced on Monday that the Samsung Galaxy S III is its first handset to support Google Wallet. In choosing Google's mobile payment platform, MetroPCS joins two of its biggest competitors, Sprint and US Cellular. It should be noted that T-Mobile is deeply committed to Google's wireless payment competitor Isis, which recently became ready for public consumption. Once the two carriers exchange nuptials next year, it's possible that we could be looking at the wireless industry's first mobile payment Brady Bunch. However, looking back at T-Mobile's previous attempts at mobile matrimony, we won't be holding our breath waiting for this union to become official.
