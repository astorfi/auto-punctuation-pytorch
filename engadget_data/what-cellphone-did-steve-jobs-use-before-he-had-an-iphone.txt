We know that Gates has carried a Windows Mobile device for years -- at one point he had an HTC Typhoon and then later switched to a Treo 700w -- but does anyone know what cellphone Jobs used to use? Did he even HAVE a cellphone before Jonathan Ive built him the handset of his dreams? We've actually heard from a couple of reliable sources that he didn't -- and you have to admit that it would be so like Steve Jobs to not even own a cellphone until he could build his own.Anyone out there know for sure?
