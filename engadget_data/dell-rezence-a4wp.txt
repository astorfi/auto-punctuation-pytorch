The Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP) has just added a major player to its membership roster: Dell. This marks the first time a big PC maker has come forward to support a wireless charging standard, which A4WP has branded as Rezence. As a part of this announcement, A4WP is also introducing a new high-power specification that would be able to charge devices from 20 to 50 watts, such as, of course, Ultrabooks. In fact, an A4WP spokesperson told us that ideally, a laptop charging with Rezence could also be used to give power to a smaller device, say a smartphone, simply by putting it on top of the former. While such products don't exist just yet, the alliance is hopeful for the first few consumer products with Rezence -- perhaps even a laptop or two -- to debut sometime this year.
