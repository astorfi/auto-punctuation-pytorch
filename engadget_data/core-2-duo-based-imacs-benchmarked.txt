 It's been barely a few days since Apple released the new Core 2 Duo iMacs, but already the benchmarks are coming out. As usual, Macworld is among the first to spar with the new hardware. The lab concluded that compared to the previous iMac Core Duo models, the new models hit a 10 percent improvement over previous models in Macworld Lab's comprehensive Speedmark Test over the previous models. As he explains, part of the advantage is also likely to come via the doubling of the iMacs' L2 Cache to 4MB, which is, of course, contained within the new processor. We feel for the thousands of people who've already bought their Core Duo iMacs -- only to have been surpassed by a 10 percent increase. Really.
