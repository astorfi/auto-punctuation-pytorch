       Apple and Samsung have a long history of locking up large-scale flash memory deals, and it looks like these two lovebirds are at it again -- word is that Cupertino's bought up all of Sammy's output until April of this year. That's an awful lot of memory -- Samsung manufactures some 40 percent of the world's flash -- so if we were the betting sort we'd say Apple's planning on making a bunch of new flash-based devices around that timeframe, potentially in preparation for a June launch. Hm, what could those possibly be?[Via All Things Digital]
