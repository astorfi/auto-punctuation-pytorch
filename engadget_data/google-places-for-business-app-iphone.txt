 When you run your own business, time is money and sometimes you don't have the excess minutes to return to your PC and tweak your Google Place Google+ Local listing, right? Fortunately, if you're carrying an iPhone in your pocket and have Google's new Places for Business app, you can adjust those opening times, verify your establishment (and more) on the go. Other features include web traffic tracking, plus the ability to beautify your Google+ listing with fresh images and handle multiple branches from one place. Google's latest business-facing software is available to US-based business owners on iTunes -- it's Apple-only for now.
