It's also a nicely thin five-inch Android device with a dialer, but other than that we weren't getting any answers on the record, so the mystery continues. We will say that we saw a presentation sheet with the name "Streak" on it, and that it looked to have a removable battery door on the back, but apart from that all we really know is that we desperately want to get this thing alone for longer than a minute and a half. Pics in the gallery!

P.S.- Our friend Stuart Miles from Pocket-lint learned that it does indeed have a SIM slot. AT&T, here we come?
