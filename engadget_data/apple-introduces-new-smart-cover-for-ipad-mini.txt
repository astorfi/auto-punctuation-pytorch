While mostly identical in appearance to its larger counterpart, this smaller version does do away with the metal hinge in favor of a new design that Apple's Jony Ive says essentially wraps the device in a single piece of material. The cover also expectedly comes in a variety colors -- six, to be specific, including a (Product) RED model, each of which will set you back $39.
