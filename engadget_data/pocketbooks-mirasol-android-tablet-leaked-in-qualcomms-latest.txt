Spotted in a new promotion video from Qualcomm, this slate sports a front-facing camera, four soft keys below the outdoor-friendly color display (likely to be of the bog-standard 5.7-inch size), and presumably a volume rocker plus a mute switch on the left. Other than that, there's not much else to see here, but we'll let you guys know right away when we spot the real thing here at CES. Videos after the break.

Update: Qualcomm's confirmed to us that this isn't a real product. Boo!
