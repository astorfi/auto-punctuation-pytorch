The third time's the charm for Verizon customers, however, because a new model dubbed SCH-i815 has made its way to the FCC bearing CDMA and LTE radios built to surf Big Red's network. So, it looks like the Galaxy Tab 7.7 will be making its way to American store shelves sometime soon. The question is, did Sammy have to beef up the Tab's profile to cram in the LTE gear like its Nexus cousin?
