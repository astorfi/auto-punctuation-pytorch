A gentleman in Spain who calls himself Pocket Lucho has been building Neo Geo mini-consoles for a while now, and has recently demonstrated his latest creation on "the YouTubes" for our viewing pleasure. With the sort of attention to detail that makes these things as attractive as they are playable (including a coin slot and light-up marquee) the devices feature a video out and a second controller input for bringing a friend in on the action. Hit that read link for the detailed step-by-step, but not before peeping those videos after the break.
