 Everybody calm... we know, we're excited too. We're just dying to see the latest in spreadsheet and presentation technology. But, for now, you'll just have to wait as the technical preview for Microsoft's next version of Office is all filled up. What exactly Redmond has in store for us it wont say but, it's not shying away from hyperbole, declaring it "the most ambitious undertaking yet for the Office Division." Primarily we assume that's because every arrow in the Office quiver is being updated simultaneously, including desktop, mobile and web apps, Visio, Lync and its countless other peripheral programs. Don't draw a warm bath and grab a straight razor, though -- you'll get a chance to play with all the updated products when they enter public beta this summer.
