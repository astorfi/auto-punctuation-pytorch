             We actually did it, we actually recorded a podcast. We know you can't believe it either, but believe us when we say that we can't wait for the next one. In fact we're going to do everything in our power to crank one out on weekly basis -- just like old times. We know our promises aren't worth much at this point, but just wait and you'll see. This week we introduce the latest member of the Engadget team Steve Kim and then cover the big format news this week as well as some old favorites like LCD Vs Plasma and component Vs HDMI. So if you can't get enough HD news, go ahead and start the download and please let us know what you think.
