Ah, we remember those halcyon days as though they were only last week, when even small plasmas cost about $10,000
US, and a faint hope of the HDTV dream lingered o'erhead as we slept. But Panasonic's announced they're to sell a sub
Â¥1,000,000 ($9,000) 65-inch 3000:1 contrast ratio 1080p beast of a monster of an HDTV, the VIERA TH-65PX500. Funny how
in this market now ten grand'll get you low-end high-end.
