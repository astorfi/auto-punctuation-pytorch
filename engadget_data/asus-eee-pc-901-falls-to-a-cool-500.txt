Following in Acer's footsteps, ASUS has evidently lowered the entry price for its Fine Ebony / Pearl White Eee PC 901 to $499.99. Yep, that's the one with an 8.9-inch display, 1.6GHz Intel Atom CPU, 1GB of RAM, a 12GB SSD and a 6-cell battery. So, is that low enough for you, or are you waiting for the Buy 1 Get 1 offer that may never come?[Thanks, Nathanael]
