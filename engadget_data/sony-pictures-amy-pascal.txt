The hacking of Sony Pictures may not have stopped The Interview from being released, but now the Deadline reports the studio has announced co-chairman Amy Pascal will step down. Pascal has been with the company since the 80s when it was just Columbia Pictures, and her profile notes Sony had 95 movies hit #1 since 2000 under her leadership. In November news broke that Sony Pictures had suffered a crippling hack, disabling computers and locking employees out of the network for days, and what followed got even worse as information leaked out in bunches. 



A group calling itself the 'Guardians of Peace' doled out the personal information of current and former employees (including famous actors and directors), private email conversations between Pascal and other execs with embarrassing and racist comments concerning the likes of President Obama, Kevin Hart and Denzel Washington, salary information that revealed pay discrepancies between male and female stars, and copies of then-unreleased movies like Annie. Now? The Interview is on Netflix, North Korea and the US government are trading barbs about who is responsible for the whole mess, Pascal is moving on to launch a new production venture at the studio and there's a new trailer for Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. Seriously.
