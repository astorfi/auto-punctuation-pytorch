There have been plenty of other attempts at cellphones for
the elderly before, but Japanese wireless carrier TU-KA is carrying a new barebones phone from Kyocera that gets
rid of pretty much everything superfluous and just has a keypad with big, easy to read numbers on it. There's no LCD
screen with potentially confusing menus (to dial, just press the green button and then enter the number), and you can't
do email, send text messages, take a picture, listen to MP3s, watch TV, or do any of the other stuff that is becoming
more or less standard in cellphones in Japan (and elsewhere). The stand-by battery life is a staggering 840 hours, so
you won't have to recharge it very often.
