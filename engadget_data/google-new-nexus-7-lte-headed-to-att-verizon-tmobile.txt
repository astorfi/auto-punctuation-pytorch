Coming as no surprise at all, Google's just unveiled its newest Nexus 7 tablet at a breakfast meeting in San Francisco this morning. What has caught us off guard, however, is news that the Android 4.3 tablet will bow on three of the US' top wireless carriers -- that's AT&T, Verizon* and T-Mobile -- as a single SKU and with support for LTE. No release date or pricing has yet been announced for the 7-incher, but when it does launch, it'll be the premier device to ship with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean.


Update: Google's just released pricing and availability for the new Nexus 7, pegging the WiFi version for a July 30th bow in-store and online. There'll be two configurations -- a 16GB and 32GB -- that'll retail for $229 and $269, respectively. Users that prefer to wait for the LTE-enabled version will have to fork over $349 for a 32GB model, although this variant still doesn't have a solid street date; Google's saying it'll hit retail in the "coming weeks."
