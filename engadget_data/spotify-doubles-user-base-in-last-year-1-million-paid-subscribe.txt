 At an event today, way out on Manhattan's west side, Spotify held a bit of a get together with a few of its closest business associates and members of the press. CEO Daniel Ek took the opportunity to do a quick victory lap, touting its growth as a service. In the last year the number of active users has doubled to 20 million, five million of which are paying subscribers. One million of those coughing up a monthly fee are right here in the US, which Ek claims makes the company the largest streaming platform in the country. Almost as impressive, all those users have created over one billion playlists, though, 4.7 million of those are simply named "love." Nobody being creative was an qualification for being a customer.
