 Sirius's Stiletto, the do-it-all portable satellite radio, is available for pre-order from Crutchfield as of yesterday afternoon (9/1). Although there's no information on when the player will ship, the new higher-resolution shots of the device should keep Sirius fans' appetites for pics sated for now. The model over at Crutchfield appears to be the WiFi-enabled version -- It has a $349.99 pricetag, the non-WiFi version is $100 less -- so if you'd rather take the hundred bucks over the ability to listen to internet radio stations, keep that finger off the pre-order button.[Via Orbitcast; thanks, zatz]
