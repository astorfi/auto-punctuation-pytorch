 
 After getting our hands on more than three dozen Ultrabooks, tablets and plenty of other miscellany over an intense gadget-fueled week in Taipei, Computex is finally winding down, and we're packing our bags for the 24-hour journey back to New York. There's no question that Windows 8 stole the show, with hundreds of devices making an appearance both at flashy press events and on the exhibit floor -- Release Preview in tow. We happened upon quite a few surprises on that front, including a touchscreen-based ASUS Zenbook UX21A and Intel's prediction that the majority of next year's Ultrabooks will be touch-enabled, along with the unique (and perhaps even slightly bizarre) TAICHI, which will change the way we interact with at least two clamshell models. We've barely scratched the surface here, however -- you'll find direct links to all of our Computex coverage just after the break.
