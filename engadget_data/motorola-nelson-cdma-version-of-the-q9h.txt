 Seeing how the original Q came to CDMA first, it'd only make sense that the updated version of the now-ubiquitous QWERTY smartphone -- currently announced only in GSM / HSDPA form as the Q9h -- would return to its roots. Morning Paper (the folks that brought us the Palm Gandolf) is reporting that the Motorola "Nelson" is getting prepped as we speak, offering up Windows Mobile 6, a 2 megapixel cam, miniSD expansion, Bluetooth, and EV-DO data in an "ultra thin" package. As you might recall, the Q9h originally got passed around as the "Norman," so "Nelson" would be a totally appropriate name for a CDMA counterpart. Sprint's getting passed around as a potential carrier for this one (seems logical enough to us) but we'll have to wait this one out for a little more detail before calling it a done deal.
