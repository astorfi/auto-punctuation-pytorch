Anyone on the grandfathered unlimited data plans or traditional tiered offerings will only be able to rely on the good 'ol WiFi whenever they feel the urge to use Apple's video chat service. From the looks of it, it seems that AT&T is hoping to conserve the amount of network bandwidth that would be chewed up by unlimited customers, while also having it function as a value-added feature for its newest shared data plans. In terms of usage, this FaceTime capability will use up part of your data allotment (instead of minutes). So, the good news is that the feature is free -- the bad news is that it won't make unlimited users any happier. Find AT&T's official statement below.



  AT&T will offer FaceTime over Cellular as an added benefit of our new Mobile Share data plans, which were created to meet customers' growing data needs at a great value. With Mobile Share, the more data you use, the more you save. FaceTime will continue to be available over Wi-Fi for all our customers.
