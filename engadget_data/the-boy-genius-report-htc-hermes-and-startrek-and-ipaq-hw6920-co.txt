Field report tidbits from Engadget's mobile insider, the Boy Genius.If this latest Boy Genius scoop is correct, then Cingular's also launching a slew of Windows Mobile phones this summer, some less surprising than others. The HP iPAQ hw6920/25 was more or less expected any time now, and should have WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth, EDGE data, and MSFP / AKU2, as expected (you probably already knew the rest). The HSDPA-equipped HTC Hermes is also making its way to these shores, not exactly to the surprise of anyone at Engadget who've been expecting this phone on Cingular for quite some time -- but all the same it's pleasant knowing we'll finally wrap our mitts on a Hermes of our own some time in the September / October range. But what we weren't expecting (at least not so soon) was Cingular to launch the HTC StarTrek in August / September, which will quickly shame all you early adopters and RAZR-haters who wanted to get their hands on an import as quickly as possible. Keep an eye out for further details as we snag 'em.
