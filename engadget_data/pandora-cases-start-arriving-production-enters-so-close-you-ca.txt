Thankfully, there's one critical difference, and that's the fact that the dutiful souls behind what's sure to become the world's next favorite pocket gizmo actually have some proof that mass production is tantalizingly near. The latest update has quite a few images of the final mold, and we're also told that mass production has begun on the mainboards. All that's left to do is add a touch of paint, snap a few things together and yell "Hello World!" for all the world to hear.
