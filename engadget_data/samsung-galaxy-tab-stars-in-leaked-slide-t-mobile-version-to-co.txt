That'd be a bit of a disappointment if true, as that's the most we were told to expect and twice the Galaxy S's price despite lacking telephone functionality. Still, it's the first legitimately impressive Android tablet, and being on the bleeding edge isn't cheap. We just wonder if Sammy can truly sell ten million on two-year contracts -- or worse, going head to head at an unsubsidized $649 with the iPad 3G. Say it ain't so, Sammy.
