 A full-frame sensor inside a compact camera sounds like lunacy, but Sony's managed it (at least, in principle) with its new Cyber-shot RX1. While only at the engineering sample stage, we're already deeply in love with its retro body and the potential that lurks inside that 24.3-megapixel sensor. The question, of course, is how did they manage to squeeze that whopping hardware into such a small body? Take a gander through the gallery from our brothers at Engadget Chinese to see how it achieved such a feat.
