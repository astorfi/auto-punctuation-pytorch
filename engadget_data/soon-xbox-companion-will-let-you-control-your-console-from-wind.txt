The Windows Phone Team says nay; it spoke up this morning about an upcoming app called Xbox Companion, which will access the Xbox Live Marketplace and also act as a remote, allowing you to navigate your console or control video playback directly from your handset. You can call it laziness or convenience -- or both -- but either way, it's still going to be a clever new addition to the Marketplace. The app's currently in beta and will be available as a free download "soon." For a peek, check out the video below at around the one-minute mark.
