Spotted this week at IFA, the technology requires a pair of snazzy all-right / all-left passive specs and a compatible 3D Xbox game to get two different 2D perspectives on one TV. Compared to Sony's $499, 24-inch active-shutter offering, the 47-inch and 55-inch passive 'tubes are significantly larger and more expensive, rumored to retail for £1799 (or $2915) and £2499 (or $4050), respectively. According to sources, this feature will join LG's lineup of Cinema 3D displays sometime in September -- offering gaming as well as LG's SmartTV and 3D movie support. Hey gamers, since we're not splitting up anymore, is it safe to say we can stay "in a relationship" on Facebook?
