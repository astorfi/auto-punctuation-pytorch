Joining ASUS' MeMo Pad family today are a couple of self-explanatory models: the MeMo Pad HD 7 and the MeMo Pad FHD 10. While we've already gotten to test out the 10-inch model, this is the first we've seen of the 7-incher. Like the current Nexus 7, which this is going to replace, it has a 1,280 x 800 screen. With this new generation, though, it adds 5-megapixel and 1.2-megapixel cameras, SonicMaster audio and an ARM Cortex A7 quad-core CPU. Oh, and it adds a microSD slot and a micro-USB socket, two things the Nexus 7 doesn't have. Unlike a Nexus product, the OS is the slightly older Android 4.0. (Update: ASUS has confirmed that the tablet will launch with up-to-date Android 4.2. Apologies for any confusion.)


The big news here, however, is the price. As Chairman Jonney Shih said during its reveal, we needed our cameras, because it'll arrive priced at a pretty incredible $149 for 16GB and $129 for 8GB. In addition, he clarified that the super-low-cost $129 version is aimed at emerging markets for now, though the $149 model is headed to the US and elsewhere. We're not sure when that'll be, but for now, with these prices and specs, consider us tempted. In the meantime, head past the break for the full hands-on treatment.




In our brief hands-on, we quickly noticed the Memo Pad HD 7 has a glossy finish, which is a stark departure from the rubbery texture of the Nexus 7. It'll be available in four colors: black (naturally), white, pink and yellow. Even under the glare of the spotlights here at ASUS' press event, the 7-inch, 1,280 x 800 IPS screen remained easy to read, even at off angles. The quad-core A7 CPU also seemed up to the task of launching apps and keeping up with brisk OS navigation, though a true apples-to-apples comparison won't be possible until we actually get one in to review. For now, glean what you will from our hands-on video below, and enjoy our hands-on shots too.
