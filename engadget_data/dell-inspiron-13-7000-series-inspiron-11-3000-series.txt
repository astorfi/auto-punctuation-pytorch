Here's the thing about Computex, the big computer show going on in Taiwan this week: Though lots of PC makers are announcing products here, they're almost all focusing on the low end. It's almost as if computer companies realize PC sales are on the decline, and have to slash prices! Take Dell, for instance: The company is here in Taipei showing off two Windows convertibles, which run the gamut from budget-friendly to solidly mid-range. Both devices -- the Inspiron 11 3000 series and the Inspiron 13 7000 series -- have a Lenovo Yoga-like design, with a screen that flips back 360 degrees into tablet mode (and Tent mode, and Stand mode -- you know the drill).
