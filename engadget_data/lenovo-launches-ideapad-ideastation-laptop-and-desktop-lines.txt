Say hello to Lenovo's new global portable and desktop computing brands: IdeaPad and IdeaStation, respectively. While details on the IdeaStation desktop lineup are still pretty sparse, the laptop lineup has three machines running the gamut of sizes -- the Y710 (17-inch gaming rig), Y510 (15-inch workhorse), and U110 (11-inch ultraportable) -- all featuring VeriFace (facial recognition software), media keys, textured lids, and flush bezels, and available in April. Too bad none have WWAN -- that really would have made our day. Check out the specs:Y710 (above)
