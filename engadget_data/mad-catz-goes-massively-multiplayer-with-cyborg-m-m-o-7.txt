As you've likely already gathered, this rather intense gaming peripheral is all about the MMO world, featuring a staggering 78 definable commands thanks to 13 programmable buttons, a two-position MMO shift button and a three-position MMO mode switch. It's also one size fits all, thanks to adjustable palm and thumb rests. World of Warcraft fans will likely find a lot to like in the ability to assign spells to the mouse's buttons by dragging and dropping. The Cyborg M.M.O.7 is coming next month -- no word on pricing just yet.
