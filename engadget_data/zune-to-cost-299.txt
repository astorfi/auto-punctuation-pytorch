 We already knew the Zune was going to come in a triad of colors, but we didn't have much of any idea as to the price they were going to stick you for. Common sense would dictate it would be at or slightly below what the iPod is asking for their device -- but not above -- and if TWiCE is correct with their information, the Zune will run for an on-par $299. They're also reporting the Zune won't allow for music purchases on the go, which kind of flies in the face of that whole "connected entertainment" thing, as well as the idea of putting WiFi in a portable, so we're looking at it somewhat skeptically for the time being.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
