He decided to risk life and limb (well, just a job at Verizon) and send in more pics of the soon to be released black Motorola Q. Now there isn't too much of a difference here between the Verizon version and Sprint's Q. Sadly, the device still has the same specs from its silver brother, only adding a soft touch rubberized coating. They tell us that the device is near release, with units already in stock in the warehouse and some stores are getting their dummy units. As we sit back and wait for launch, we learn what all the Verizon employees are reading while they're at work!
