Large volume shipments are on schedule for the rest-of-world beginning mid-February according to the DigiTimes' typically reliable Acer sources. And after watching the 8.9-inch Aspire One steal the crown of world's best selling netbook away from ASUS, we thought you'd like to know that Acer's version of the 1.6GHz Atom N270 netbook with 1GB of RAM, SDHC card slot, 3x USB, and optional 3G was nearly here. Still no pricing unless "aggresive" means something specific to you.Update: Acer just announced a February 20th launch in Japan and the first 10-inch Aspire One was spotted by HKEPC on a shelf in Hong Kong.
