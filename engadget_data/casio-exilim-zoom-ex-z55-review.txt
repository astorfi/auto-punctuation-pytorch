PC Magazine checks out the Exilim Zoom EX-Z55, Casio's 5 megapixel ultracompact (roughly the size of a credit card
in length and width) digital camera which has a large 2.5-inch LCD, good startup time, a 3x optical zoom, uses SD
memory cards and a features a decent set of manual controls. The pictures produced are of a good quality and quite
sharp, though PC Mag finds that it just falls short overall of Canon's 4 megapixel ultracompactÂ SD300.
