According to an invite making the rounds, the Samsung Mobile team is planning to hold a Mobile Unpacked event at CTIA in Orlando, and as the graphic suggests, the focus will be a new sized Tab. We're assuming it will be an 8.9-inch version, since the invite shows an 8 and 9 flanked by a 7 and 10. That sure lines up with what we've heard before, but we have to admit, it does seems like a lot of tablet offerings for one company. For some odd reason, we haven't received this invitation yet, but we're assuming we're invited (obviously, it's not a party without Engadget!) and thus will be there covering all the action live. Stay tuned.
