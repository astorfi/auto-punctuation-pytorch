According to AT&T's own listing of the handset, this svelte slider will (obviously) tout a two-megapixel camera, video recording / playback, Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP, a built-in pedometer, Memory Stick Micro support, quad-band connectivity, and even PacMan / Ms. PacMan games (huzzah!). You can snap it up right now for $269.99 sans a contract, or $79.99 after inking your name to a two-year agreement and waiting for a pesky rebate to return.[Thanks, Bernard]
