 Our buds over at Engadget Chinese are just reporting back from a sitdown it had with LG Mobile in Hong Kong at a Chinese New Year event. The most tantalizing bit of truth is confirmation of that September launch date rumor for its first Windows Phone 7 Series device. However, this time LG padded the date a bit and said it would launch sometime between September and November. Of course, the only official word so far, has Windows Phone 7 launching before the "holidays," so we'll take what we can get. Maybe Mr. Ballmer meant Halloween?
