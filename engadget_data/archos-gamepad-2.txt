That was fast -- just days after a retailer's leak, Archos has announced the GamePad 2. As hinted earlier, the second-generation gaming tablet is a big improvement over the original. The 7-inch slate is now better-suited to modern games through its sharper 1,280 x 800 IPS display, a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 chip and 2GB of RAM. Archos has also improved the control responsiveness, upgraded to Android 4.2 and stuffed in a bigger battery for extended play sessions. The GamePad 2 reaches Europe by the end of October for €180 ($243), and will be available in the US sometime during the fourth quarter for $200.

The ARCHOS GamePad 2 includes complete versions of Asphalt 8: Airborne and Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour by Gameloft both revisited for physical controls. "With a tablet that's as innovative as the ARCHOS GamePad 2, it was an easy decision to optimise our games for the platform," said Cyril Guilleminot, Gameloft Director for France & Benelux. "Users will be able to take part in a brand new gaming experience with its integrated physical control system."
