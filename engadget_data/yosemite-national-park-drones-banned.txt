In fact, it never was. Flying a drone was already illegal according to the Code of Federal Regulations governing the park, which says that "delivering or retrieving a person or object by parachute, helicopter or other airborne means" is prohibited for regular visitors. But a growing number of hobbyists have been ignoring this rule, forcing the Yosemite Park Service to reiterate the ban and explain why it's necessary. In a statement, it says that drones "can be extremely noisy, and can impact the natural soundscape." More generally, drones also "impact the wilderness experience," because there's nothing less nature-y than a hovering quadrocopter filming in full HD. It's not just the resident fauna that can be put in peril, either: Drones can apparently also interfere with emergency rescue operations.
