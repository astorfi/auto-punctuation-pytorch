Samsung's just officially announced the Galaxy Note 3 at its big IFA event, and its not so surprisingly spent a lot of time talking about the phone's brand new S Pen. In addition to bringing with it slightly new design, the pen also enables a number of new features on the phone. The biggest of those is the new Air Command functionality, which is a small pop-up window that's brought up automatically by the S Pen and offers quick access to features like Action Memo (which can link memos to actions), a scrapbook, the S Finder search option, and the updated S Note, which can sync content with your PC and tablet through Evernote. Fans of the Note's flip covers will also be glad to know that they can now also use the S Pen with the cover closed. Check out our full Galaxy Note 3 preview for a closer look at the S Pen's new features and, of course, the phone itself.
