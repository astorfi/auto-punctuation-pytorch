Intel has faced a tough quarter or two as of late, but it's seeing a bit of sunshine today. The chip maker just posted third quarter earnings that largely match happier results from a year ago, generating $3 billion in net profit based on revenue of $13.5 billion. The performance is also a noticeable improvement over the second quarter, with revenue and profit respectively growing by five and 48 percent. There are problems when you break down the earnings by division, however. While Intel's Data Center Group is thriving with a 12.2 percent year-to-year revenue increase, its core PC Client and Other Intel architecture groups both saw annual drops of 3.5 percent and 9.3 percent. Haswell processors have provided only limited help to a computer market that's still struggling, Intel says. The short-term future isn't going to be much brighter, for that matter -- the crew in Santa Clara predicts just a slight increase in revenue for the next quarter, to $13.7 billion. It's a good thing that Intel is exploring new technology, then.
