Nokia's range of extra-large Windows Phones may not be limited to flagships like the Lumia 1520. Frequent tipster @evleaks has just posted a press image of what's reported to be the Lumia 1320, better known by its unofficial "Batman" nickname. There aren't many clues to the specs, although it's clear that the phone would take advantage of Windows Phone GDR3's support for large displays. The side trim also supports theories that this is a Lumia 625-style budget handset, not a flagship. Given that Nokia's "innovation reinvented" event is tomorrow, there's a good chance that we'll know the full story behind the 1320 within a matter of hours.


Update: Just for good measure, @evleaks has also posted an image of the Lumia 1320's back. You'll find it after the break.
