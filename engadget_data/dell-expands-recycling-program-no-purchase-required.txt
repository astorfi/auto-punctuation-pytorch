Dell, Apple and others offer programs which allow free recycling of product with the purchase of new, presumably, replacement gear. Now Dell has one-upped the industry by allowing Dell owners to arrange for free-pickup of any Dell-branded product, anytime -- no purchase required. After Dell customers enter their asset tag(s) on Dell's recycling website, they simply print out the pre-paid air bill and follow the instructions to pack and schedule the collection of their equipment. Yeah, ok, there's still effort involved and there's always the risk of your Ditty ending up in the digital dump, but until toll-booth operators or other robotic life forms can be dispatched, it's about as close to effortless as your gonna get.[Via CNET]
