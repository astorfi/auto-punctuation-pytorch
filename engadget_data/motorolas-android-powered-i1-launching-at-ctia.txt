With CTIA still a day away, we're stoked to have already seen a giant billboard near the convention center confirming the rumored Motorola i1. Of course, billboards rarely offer much insight into the device's specifics, but there is a pretty decent view of the UI and its slogan: "Grab Life by the Calls." As you'd expect, we'll be all over this set just as soon as we can get at one, but in the interim follow on for one more pic after the break that features the i1's poster boy, Mike Rowe of Discovery's Dirty Jobs.
