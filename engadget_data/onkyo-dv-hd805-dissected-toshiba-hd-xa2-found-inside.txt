There has been quite a bit of speculation around the "heritage" of this player, so the results of the teardown aren't too surprising. Still, we would like to know what specific tweaks were made to the HD-XA2 to justify the $899 MSRP. At least Onkyo didn't do anything harmful to the player design; our rusty German leads us to believe the AreaDVD gang liked what they saw and heard from the unit despite the finish of the cabinet being "not quite as opulent as" as the HD-XA2. All this makes the HD-XA2 look like a relative bargain among the high-spec HD DVD players.[Via FormatWarCentral]
