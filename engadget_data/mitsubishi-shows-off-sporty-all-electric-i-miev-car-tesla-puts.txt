Shown recently at the Tokyo Motor Show, the compact i-MiEV will reportedly be powered by a pack of Li-ions that can enable drivers to scoot about 100 miles before needing a recharge. After it's out of juice, it'll take around 7-hours at 200V or 14-hours at 100V to charge it back up. Most notable about this ride, however, is the proposed release date: 2009. This figure was recently moved up a year from the original 2010 projection, but unfortunately, no details surrounding a price or specific launch markets have been disclosed.
