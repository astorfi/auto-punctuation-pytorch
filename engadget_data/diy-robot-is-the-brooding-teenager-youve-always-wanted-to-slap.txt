That's the question we were asking ourselves after stumbling upon this DIY machine, which may have just seized the crown for World's Bitchiest Bot. Every time you flip the on switch, this little gremlin will partially emerge from its box to turn itself off with a vicious, whip-like gesture normally reserved for snooze buttons. Continue to rub it the wrong way and the petulant ingrate will eventually scurry away from you and start spinning around frantically, before completely withdrawing the switch and shutting itself off. After that, it'll probably spend a few hours sulking and listening to Elliott Smith in its room, but don't worry -- it's just a phase. Video after the break.
