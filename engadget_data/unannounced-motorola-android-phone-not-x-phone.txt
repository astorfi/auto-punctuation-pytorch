The fine folks at Tinhte have gotten their mitts on a Motorola-made Android phone that hasn't made its official debut. Right out of the gate, the outlet notes that it's not the rumored "X phone" since it's missing a large, stunning screen that would rival other flagship gear, but the specs still give it a fair amount of horsepower. Behind the device's roughly 4-inch 720p screen hide a Snapdragon S4 Pro (or better), an Adreno 320 GPU, 2GB of RAM and a 2,000mAh battery. On the outside, the smartphone sports a curved back reminiscent of the HTC One, a black finish and a thin bezel framing its display. Tinhte reports that the handset carries a XT912A model number, so we reckon it could be a cousin of the Droid RAZR, which is labeled as the XT912.
