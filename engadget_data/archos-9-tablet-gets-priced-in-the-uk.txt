Apparently, it'll be offering both 80GB and 160GB versions of the tablet in the UK, which will run £449.99 and £499.99, respectively, or roughly $735 and $816. Stuff.tv is also reporting that the tablet will be available in September, although that conflicts a bit with the October 22nd launch date for Windows 7 -- which would be a bit of a problem for a Windows 7-based tablet. So, still a few details to sort out, not the least of which is word of availability 'round these parts.
