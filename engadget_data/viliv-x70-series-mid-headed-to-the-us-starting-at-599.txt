That, as jkOnTheRun points out, is the same price as the S5, which packs a smaller 5-inch screen compared to the X70's 7-incher (though both are WSVGA). Otherwise, the two are fairly similar, with each sporting the usual Atom processor, Windows XP for an OS, built-in GPS, optional 3G, and 1GB of RAM. The X70 also mixes things up a bit with your choice of 32GB or 64GB SSD drives, while the S5 packs a standard 60GB hard drive. Still no word on a release date, but Dynamism will gladly take your email now and your order later.[Via jkOnTheRun]
