       Anyone worried that AT&T might actually manage to get the LG CU575 "Trax" out the door today can probably put those fears to rest now; it seems a software issue has cropped up on test units that is preventing DRM-enabled music from playing under certain circumstances. Wasn't a similar issue rumored to have held up the Nokia N75 for a while? Sheesh. Anyhoo, no word yet on when this thing might get fixed and relaunched, but we'll have our ear to the ground.[Thanks, anonymous tipster]
