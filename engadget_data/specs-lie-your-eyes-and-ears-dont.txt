Rather than complain about one's devout faith in specifications, Joshua from HiDefDigest makes his case in the old 'specs vs reality' argument and we have to say, we couldn't have said it better ourselves. Click through for the full explanation, but here are the highlights. Higher bit-rate and a newer codec don't always look better, lossless audio doesn't always sound better, and -- we'd like to add -- 1080p isn't always better than 720p. So for your own sake, don't sell yourself short by relaying on specs to tell you what looks and sounds good.
