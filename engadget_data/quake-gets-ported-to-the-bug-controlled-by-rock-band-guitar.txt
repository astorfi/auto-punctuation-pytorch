If you can't quite make it out, that's Quake running (rather well, we might add) on the BUG and, yes, it is indeed being controlled by a Rock Band guitar thanks to the newly developed Xpad driver, which should work equally well with a standard Xbox 360 controller if you're a little less ambitious. Head on past the break to check it out in action, and hit up the link below for all the necessary details.
