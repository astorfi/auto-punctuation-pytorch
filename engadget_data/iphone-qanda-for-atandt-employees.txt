       Not a lot here, but for those clammoring for any possible news about the iPhone, we got our hands on an internal AT&T iPhone Q&A document. The highlights:

With an iPhone you'll have access to Cingular's MyAccount via the device as well as via iTunes.
Sorry, no pre-orders (yet).
If one wants to read tea leaves, it's still probable there will be iPhone specific service plans.
"... no subsidies are being offered on the phone at this time." You heard 'em!
They will "allow" out of contract customers to sign up for two more years to get an iPhone. Sui generis!

Full document after the break.
