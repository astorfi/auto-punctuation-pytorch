 You'd think that wearable displays could've come a long way since the days of the Virtual Boy, but you'd be (mostly) wrong. Churning out yet another eyesore of a head mounted display is 22Moo -- the same Aussies who brought us the equally awkward VG-SD goggles -- whose $199 HMD800 touts the ability to provide a "30-inch virtual theater-like image with clear and exquisite pictures." The contraption also boasts a "2.1 Dolby surround sound experience," and compatibility with iPods, PMPs, gaming consoles, and practically anything with standard AV outputs. The device supports both NTSC and PAL, sports an 800 x 225 resolution, contrast / brightness controls, eight-hour Li-ion cell, and a comical "eye patch" in case you prefer a more one-sided viewpoint. Although the company claims it was designed by "renowned ergonomicists," we question its ability to remain comfortable (or leave our retinas unscathed) after enduring the Lord of the Rings trilogy (or bevy of Engadget commercials).[Via MobileWhack]
