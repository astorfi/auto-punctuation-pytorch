First off, the Samsung Suede -- while only a feature phone -- seems to be a fairly capable device, wandering between the many sub menus within the app was slick, smooth, without major hiccups, and general usability was snappy. The Muve service rings in at $55 and brings all kinds of unlimited together: nationwide calling, text -- including unlimited global text -- picture / video messaging, 3G mobile web, unlimited full track downloads, ringtones, and ringback tones. The service will launch in Las Vegas this month -- so we'll expect some of you'll need to polish your patience skills -- and roll out to other markets during Q1 and early Q2. The intro music lineup includes some one million tracks with a major bump to two and a half million in a month or two. The show was about as loud as a jet taking off. So, as to sonic fidelity, that remains a question, but a trip to your local brick and mortal can definitely satisfy your curiosity -- that is if you're pondering taking the plunge.
