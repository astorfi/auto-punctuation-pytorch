As soon as it was known that Minecraft creator Markus "Notch" Persson had bought a $70 million mega-mansion in LA, it was only a matter of time before someone recreated it in blocky form. One dedicated player took up the challenge immediately and, in less than 24 hours, had a video up on YouTube comparing his digital incarnation shot-for-shot with a slick real-estate highlight reel. It's an accurate portrayal of the luxurious Beverly Hills pad, even if it doesn't quite match the ingenuity of some other Minecraft creations we've seen depicting Denmark, works from London's Tate gallery, and the first level from Super Mario Land.



Nevertheless, it's great fun to peek inside a pixellated version of Notch's new home, and the way the video has been cut together is sure to make you chuckle. The famous developer might be living a life of luxury right now, but we'll soon be able to share in some of his success through the game that made him all that dough in the first place. The blocky mansion's creator says he'll be making the build available to download on Planet Minecraft in the near future, so keep your eyes peeled if you want to explore the crib for yourself.
