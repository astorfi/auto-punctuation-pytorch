There's another variant now confirmed, however, with Samsung's co-chief exec, JK Shin, telling Reuters today that a modified Galaxy S 4 will be the first smartphone to commercially launch on LTE-Advanced, the next step up from existing LTE. (Not forgetting that the new tech is already live in parts of Russia.) On the new radio technology, data speeds could theoretically double what you currently experience on a 4G signal. For Samsung's new smartphone, this will involve using Qualcomm chips compatible with the next-gen networks, notably sidestepping its homemade Exynos silicon. "As operators seek to provide more data-centric mobile services, I think this will become mainstream 4G technology globally in the coming years," Shin said, though he refused to name any specific networks that the new GS4 would eventually launch on.
