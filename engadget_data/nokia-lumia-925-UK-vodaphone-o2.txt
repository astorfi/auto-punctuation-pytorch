O2 is proud to announce the Nokia Lumia 925, Nokia's brand new flagship device, is coming to O2 on Thursday 13 June. Available to pre-order from Thursday 30 May, O2 will be the only place at launch to get the Lumia 925 in white. The Lumia 925 will go on sale on O2's new O2 Refresh tariffs and is the first Nokia phone without a charger as part of O2's 'Chargers out of the Box' environmental initiative.

Smart Camera
The Nokia Lumia 925 runs Windows Phone 8 and features the most advanced lens technology and next generation imaging software to capture clearer, sharper pictures and video, including the best low light images. The Nokia Lumia 925 also introduces the new Nokia Smart Camera mode, coming as an update to all Lumia Windows Phone 8 smartphones. Nokia Smart Camera offers an easy way to capture ten images at once and edit the pictures with options like Best Shot, Action Shot, and Motion Focus for creating the perfect high quality image.

Coming to O2 Refresh
The Nokia Lumia 925 will go on sale on O2's revolutionary Pay Monthly tariff O2 Refresh with full pricing being made available closer to launch. O2 Refresh, which gives customers the freedom to change phones as often as phones change, went on sale in O2 stores in April and has already been a huge success: 90% of customers buying an O2 Refresh-eligible phone in O2 stores have bought it on O2 Refresh. The 925 is Nokia's third phone to be part of O2's new tariff with the Lumia 920 and 820 already available on O2 Refresh.

"Nokia has been going from strength to strength with Lumia and the 925 is the best Nokia Windows Phone 8 device yet," said David Johnson, O2's General Manager Devices. "We've been big supporters of Windows Phone and it's great to generate even more excitement around it with the new flagship Nokia Lumia 925."

Love the phone, leave the plug
The 925 is Nokia's first phone to be included in O2's 'Charger out of the Box' environmental initiative and will be sold with a micro-USB to USB charging cable but without a plug, demonstrating O2 and Nokia's commitment to minimising waste created by unnecessary chargers.
