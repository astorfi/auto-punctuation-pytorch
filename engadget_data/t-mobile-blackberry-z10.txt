 The BlackBerry Z10 is finally ready to ship out to customers in the US, as T-Mobile has officially announced that it is selling Canada's pride and joy starting Monday for $250, but only to business customers initially. Deliveries of the device will arrive on doorsteps (or in office mailrooms, perhaps) by the end of the week. As for the rest of the T-Mobile customers anxious to get their hands on the first BB10 handset, we still haven't received any word. News of the launch date was reported by Reuters, and we reached out to T-Mobile to confirm pricing and availability and received the following statement (update: T-Mo sent an updated statement confirming a pre-order date):

  The BlackBerry Z10 will be available for pre-order for business customers starting on March 11 for $249.99 on a two-year Classic plan. Please note that pricing can be impacted by volume discounts and other factors, making the device even more cost effective. The consumer retail availability date and pricing will be shared at a later date.
