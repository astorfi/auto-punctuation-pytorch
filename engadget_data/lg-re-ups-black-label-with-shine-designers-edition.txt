This phone is decorated in a special font that was designed by renowned Korean designer Li Sang Bong and has an poem inscribed on the back of the phone by Yoon Dong Joo, a popular poet from Korea. With no other changes being made to this sleek handset other than the exterior, we wonder just how much it will cost. Guesses anyone?
