Named after the Spanish word for "sun," the phone gained the title for a distinct reason: it's using a 3.8-inch WVGA "Ultra AMOLED" display, which is supposed to make the screen easier to read in direct sunlight and also offers less image quality degradation. It's powered by a 1GHz CPU, runs on Gingerbread, features a 5MP camera, and measures out at a thickness of 9.8mm. LG also uses the Sol to introduce a new power management technique it's referring to as "Dark UI" -- by utilizing less white light as the phone is idle, the company hopes to extend battery life by 20 to 30 percent. If you're interested in picking up what LG is putting down here, you'll be able to do so in parts of Europe around mid-September, followed by a release to Central and South America afterward. It'll also be available in black, titan and white color options. Want to know more? Take a look at the full press release after the break.
