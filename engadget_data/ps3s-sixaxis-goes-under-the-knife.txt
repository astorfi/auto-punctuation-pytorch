From the sheer number of naked gadget photo spreads we've featured on these pages, it's pretty clear that we fall into this latter group, which is why our heart started beating a little faster when we came across a thorough gallery of the PS3's SIXAXIS controller cracked open and splayed out for all of us silicon pr0n fiends to ogle. Thanks to a ChinaGBA forum contributor named Panpp, we not only have close-up shots of the SIXAXIS's every nook and cranny, but a layer-by-layer dissection of all its motion-sensing, rumble-free, non-replaceable battery goodness. So keep reading for a few more pics, and then hit the Read link for even more controller carnage (spoiler: we went over every photo with a magnifying glass, and unlike those sneaky engineers over at Apple, it seems that Sony isn't in the business of hiding highly-desirable, crippled components in its hardware).[Thanks, ChronoZaga]
