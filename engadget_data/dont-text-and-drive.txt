You know how you're not supposed to talk on your cellphone and drive at the same time? Same thing goes for texting,
too. Tennessee state troopers say that Lucas Rolin was killed while trying to send a text message on his cellphone when
he lost control of his pickup truck and flipped over onto an embankment. Not sure how they can prove for sure that it
was text messaging that's to blame, since it sounds like he was alone at the time of the accident, but they did recover
his phone and apparently they believe he must have been in the middle of tapping something out at the time of the
accident.
