For the most part, Dell's using this week at Computex to talk up its various XPS products, though its Alienware division is also getting a little love. The company just announced that the pint-size X51 desktop has been refreshed with Haswell processors (up to a quad-core Core i7-4770) and an optional 2GB NVIDIA GTX 670 GPU. The design hasn't changed at all, as you can see, but the price has: it now starts at $900 with Haswell. If you're on a budget, though, and willing to settle for last year's chips, the Ivy Bridge models will still be available for $699 and up. Now all we need are some fresh gaming laptops. How 'bout it, Dell?
