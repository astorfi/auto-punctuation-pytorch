You can officially stop worrying about brain cancer and start worrying about third-degree burnsâ€”the Associated Press
has just done a story about exploding cellphones and how the Consumer Product Safety Commission keeps getting more and
more complaints about cellphone batteries exploding or causing fires (they've received 83 such complaints over the past
two years). There's even the obligatory quote from the head of the Wireless Consumers Alliance (which we've never heard
of, but sounds very impressive) about how basically making cellphone smaller and smaller is turning them into little
bombs. Little bombs that we use to make phone calls, that is. The biggest source of the problem: sketchy third-party
batteries.
