 Taking Google's maps and Street View imagery, design firm Teehan+Lax Labs has moulded them into an unofficial time-lapse animation site. While there's some predetermined (and beautiful) routes offered up on the maker's site, you can also plug in your own favorite journeys from A to B -- perfect for reliving that milk run. If you're looking for something a little more aspirational, however, we've added a video of one of the lab's examples after the break.
