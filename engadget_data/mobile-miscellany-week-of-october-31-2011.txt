		If you have a Verizon tablet and a strong aversion for Google Maps, try UpNext HD Maps. Released by the carrier this week, it's interactive and offers 3D, and uses quick tabs to help you find restaurants, nightlife, businesses and so on. [Droid-Life]

		Motorola Droid RAZR release rumor: how does November 11th, 2011 at 11:11AM sound? [AndroidCentral]

		Apparently it's Verizon week, because here's another one from Big Red. This rumor's about the LG Spectrum, which is being regarded as the Revolution 2. It's apparently showing up in some Verizon database, according to screenshots; the images don't really give away a whole lot, other than the fact it appears to have LTE -- not really a shocker for the sequel to the Revolution.

		The BlackBerry 9790 Bellagio got a bit of hands-on time, and has a bunch of images to prove it. [N4BB]

		Let's face it -- not everyone is enamored by the look of the Motorola RAZR. Y'know, the new one. This week, a version of the device with a different design, dubbed the MT917, was spotted en route to China. It has a lot of similar specs inside, but it has rounded corners and includes a TD-SCDMA radio. [Unwired View]

		The Google Reader and Google Docs apps on Android have been given refreshes, both of which having been inspired by Ice Cream Sandwich. Head to the Market and check them out. [Droid-Life]
