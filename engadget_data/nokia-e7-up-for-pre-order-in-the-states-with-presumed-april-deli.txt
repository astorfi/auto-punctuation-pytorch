Set to ship in the beginning of April, this bad boy has been kicking around Amazon since late last year, and much to our surprise the price hasn't changed one penny since then. Of course, if you'd gone through Amazon Prime you'd have saved $4 on shipping (which you probably need after spending the better half of a grand on a handset). Get out your credit card and hit the source link!
