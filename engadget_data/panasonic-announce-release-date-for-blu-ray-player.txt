 Panasonic announced today that their DMP-BD10 Blu-Ray player will be release in September tocoincide with the release of their first 1080p Plasma. The price has not been set yet, but I would guess it will be themagic number of $999, Panasonic will only state that it will cost under $1500. Things are really starting toget interesting as HD-DVD's reasoning for not supporting 1080p seem more silly with the timed releases of 1080p displaysand Blu-Ray players. I really don't see why any would buy HD-DVD over Blu-Ray, well other than because it is cheap thatis.
