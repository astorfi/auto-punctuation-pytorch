We just knew that some official pics were the real deal when we spotted this M610i (aka "Elena") sporting a purple dress. No Photoshop hound would dare do that, right? Anyway, with the Elena apparently out in the wild, we have a feeling it won't be long now before proper units start flooding the streets. Rumored deets: a 3.2 megapixel camera with autofocus, WiFi, and -- we hope -- HSDPA. Oh yeah -- we're almost positive this baby will have the newest version of UIQ as well. While we're not sure if the "Elena" is the sister phone to the "Lizzy," we're waiting with baited breath for both.[Via Just Another Mobile Phone Blog, thanks David]
