 It looks like Hitachi is continuing to follow the go-big mantra revived by the 1TB 7K1000, as the firm is reportedly looking to crank out quite a few 85-inch plasma HDTVs over the next few years. Of course, this forthcoming beauty won't take the crown for the largest PDP out there, but it could very well achieve the metrics the sales crew is hoping for. Hitachi is looking to hit the 50-inch and over category hard, increasing overall PDP marketshare to 20-percent, and boosting its stake in the aforementioned subset to over 30-percent. Still, the company probably has a fairly good backup plan if plasma sales continue to sag, but we reckon a respectably priced behemoth such as this could definitely make up the slack if it's bringing the goods.
