According to two anonymous sources "with knowledge of the matter," an unnamed Korean manufacturer has already begun producing parts for a cheaper, 8GB version of the smartphone, slated to launch within the next few weeks. As for that next-gen handset, the insiders went on to say that the iPhone 4S / iPhone 5 will feature a more spacious touchscreen, better antenna and eight megapixel shooter, and that Apple is indeed aiming for a late September launch, after having already asked manufacturers Hon Hai and Pegatron to prep their facilities for the production of 45 million units, altogether. Details, as usual, are still scarce at this point, but we'll let you know as soon as we get more information.
