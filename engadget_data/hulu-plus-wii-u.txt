 The Nintendo Wii U shipped without some of the services we'd heard it would feature, but now Hulu Plus has joined Netflix on the console. Although it's late arriving, it does feature second screen navigation on the GamePad with several playback control options, or the ability to watch video on the touchscreen. We're still waiting to see the TVii app next month and Amazon's Instant Video, but early adopters should be able to take advantage, assuming they're a subscriber or sign up for a trial membership. Check after the break for a quick demo video to see how it all works.  [Thanks, Quazie]
