The service would apparently require a $9.99 "Netflix Instant Streaming Disc," which users could pop into the system when they wanted to watch -- far be it from Nintendo to offer a firmware update. While many of the folks we know are already getting Netflix on their Xboxen, the Wii would obviously let Netflix hit a lot more households with those Instant Watch goodies, if this ever comes to pass. As for Sony, it's still denying any plans for Netflix on the PS3, but perhaps this would help change its mind (and won't involve another $10 DVD -- we only have so many Hamiltons to go around).
