Granted, we've seen these dates slip around a bit, so hopefully it'll slide to "sooner" if anything. Interestingly enough, the Advent 4211 rebadge is shipping this very moment to customers in the UK for Â£279.99, though that currency conversion is apt to be a real thorn in your side when looking to import.Read - MSI Wind availability, via ComputerMonger, thanks IvanaRead - Advent 4211, thanks zeesh
