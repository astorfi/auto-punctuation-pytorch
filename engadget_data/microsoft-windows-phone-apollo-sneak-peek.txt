Fortunately, we expect the answers to our many questions won't be left unanswered for much longer, as the folks in Redmond are flying down to San Francisco to offer us a sneak peak of "the future of Windows Phone." Certainly, we're hoping this brief look at the next OS will be more expansive than, say, the BlackBerry 10 reveal last month. Either way, we'll be at the event to cover every single detail, so mark your calendar!
