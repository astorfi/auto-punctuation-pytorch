According to the hapless owner and photographer, however, it's stuck in software update mode and the company's support line refuses to acknowledge its existence. Major bummer, but when it does work, here's what we've gleaned from the side of the box: a 4.3-inch 24-bit color LCD with capacitive touch, 802.11b/g WiFI, Ethernet, USB drive and SD card support, a variety of audio out including digital optical, and an infrared proximity sensor. Audio streaming support is still there, naturally, so you'll have access to Pandora, Sirius, Last.Fm, and pretty much every major provider. Hit up the read links to see the pictures and express your sympathy.
