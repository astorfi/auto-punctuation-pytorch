 At the end of this month, Sony Japan will no longer carry the 20GB and 60GB Playstation 3 SKUs. Instead, they will focus their energies on promoting the relatively hot selling 40GB model -- the only model available after January. That means no more backward compatibility for PS2 games in Japan. No mention of a shake-up globally but it's pretty clear that the 40GB PS3 is Stringer's new love child.
