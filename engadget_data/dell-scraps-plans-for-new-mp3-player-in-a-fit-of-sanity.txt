This, according to the Wall Street Journal -- the very source of the original DJ Ditty rebirthing rumor. Dell will shelve the MP3 prototypes it was preparing for a possible fall launch and focus instead on building out its Zing software to organize the music and movies downloaded to Dell PCs. So no DJ Ditty 2, imagine our sense of loss. A spokesman did say that Dell plans to launch another "half-dozen laptops and desktops between now and the end of the calendar year." Would that list include the Studio XPS 13 and 16 by any chance Dell? [Via Electronista]
