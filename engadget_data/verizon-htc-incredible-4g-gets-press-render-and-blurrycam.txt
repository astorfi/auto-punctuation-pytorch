  Promise not to laugh, folks, because this one appears a bit camera shy: meet the HTC Incredible 4G for Verizon Wireless. As you can see, the designers have kept the same industrial, funky and yet austere style as before, and like the original, the famous red accents are back in the mix. The camera pod continues to exist as part of a larger protrusion on the back, which now sports a significant amount of texture. The number of capacitive buttons on the front has been reduced to three, with search now absent. The Incredible 4G is is most certainly an Ice Cream Sandwich device, complete with a Sense 4 overlay.A quick peek at the hardware information reveals a dual-core 1.2GHz CPU, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of built-in storage, an 8MP primary camera and a front-facing VGA counterpart, along with 802.11a/b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0 -- as well as support for LTE, NFC and WiFi Direct. The display is estimated at 4-inches and is said to offer qHD resolution. In highly welcome bit of news, the camera is said to capture a rapid burst of images, which gives us hope that this is the same option found on the One X and One S. Nonetheless, it appears to be a mainstream, middle-of-the-road handset that will likely be priced between $100 and $150 on-contract.
