No sooner didwe get word that Samsung was boasting that their new Q35 is the"world's smallest" Core Duo laptop than we were reminded of Lenovo's X60, whichweighs in at just 2.7 pounds, compared to the Q35's 4.1. Like the Samsung, the X60 has a 12-inch display, and alsoincludes an 80GB drive. The main reason for its more slim profile: no optical drive; you need either a USB drive or anoptical docking station. Ars Technica took a look at the X60, and found some differences between the X60 and earlierIBM-designed ThinkPads, including a redesigned keyboard (which now actually includes a Windows key) and a new dockconnector. In the end, Ars found that the new model benefits from the Core Duo's speed and battery life, and still hasmany of the ThinkPad qualities, such as an ergonomic keyboard and sturdy design, that the model was known for underIBM, making it one of the "best ultraportable machines on the market." And it looks like Samsung may beforced to start referring to its offering as the "world's smallestÂ  Core Duo laptop with an internal opticaldrive."
