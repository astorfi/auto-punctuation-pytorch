An admittedly dodgy image has emerged today showcasing what appears to be a gently massaged HTC Titan, but if rumors are to be believed, this guy will actually be called Radiant. It's bruited that this AT&T-bound model will offer the latest build of Windows Phone 7 and ship with an LTE radio within, and if the name's ringing a bell -- you aren't entirely crazy. Radiant was trademarked back in April of 2011, and if we had to guess, we'd say you'll be hearing more at CES (or worst-case, Mobile World Congress in February). Hopefully we'll get something a bit more exciting than a relocated dual-LED flash and another device name we'll never remember.
