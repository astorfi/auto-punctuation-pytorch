 Welcome to Engadget's Back to School guide! We know that this time of year can be pretty annoying and stressful for everyone, so we're here to help out with the heartbreaking process of gadget buying for the school-aged crowd. Today, we're walking around with new bags in tow -- and you can head to the Back to School hub to see the rest of the product guides as they're added throughout the month. Be sure to keep checking back -- at the end of the month we'll be giving away a ton of the gear featured in our guides -- and hit up the hub page right here!
   Cutting a bag free from an oversized cardboard container isn't nearly as exciting as unboxing the latest, well, anything else -- but you're probably gonna need one, unless you don't mind biking around campus with a laptop under your arm. We've rounded up some of our perennial favorites that are sure to keep your gadgets safe on any budget. And see that messenger bag up above? It's stuffed full of some of this season's hottest gadgets -- and we're giving one away to 15 of you. Simply leave a comment below and at each of our other back to school guides to be entered to win, and check out our giveaway page for more details.
