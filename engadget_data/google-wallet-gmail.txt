"Over the coming months," the company will roll out a new payments feature within Gmail, letting you attach money just as you would an image or document. After clicking the new "$" symbol within the composer, you'll type in an amount and select the source of your funds. Then hit Attach, click send, and say goodbye to your Greenbacks. It's that simple. You can probably get a solid feel for how this works just from looking at the image above, but given the onslaught of announcements today, we'll forgive you for needing a more comprehensive explanation. Goog's got your back, too -- there's a demo video waiting just past the break.
