The imaging company just sent us word of a presumably star-studded SoCal event on November 3rd, giving its cameras a chance to walk the red carpet in a rather surprising Hollywood role reversal. We're not sure exactly what Canon plans to unveil that night -- a new mirrorless camera, or perhaps some fancy pants camcorder, destined for Hollywood's elite? But assuming the company isn't crying wolf, we'll be there with a live report from the red carpet.
