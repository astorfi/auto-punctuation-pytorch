Currently doing victory laps at Toshiba Direct are the Qosmio F45, gamer-targeted Satellite X205, and the Satellite A215 -- the cheapskate of the crew. Some notable specs:

Qosmio F45-AV412 - 15.4-inch XGA TruBrite display, 1.8GHz Core 2 Duo, HD DVD drive, HDMI out, 802.11a/b/g/n, Intel Mobile GMA X3100, fingerprint reader, built-in webcam
Satellite X205-S9359 / S9349 - 17-inch XGA TruBrite display (up to 1680 x 1050), Core 2 Duo at 1.8Ghz or 2.0Ghz, NVIDIA GeForce 8600M, 802.11a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR, Harmon-Kardon speakers w/ subwoofer
Satellite A215-S4767 / S4757 - 15.4-inch XGA TruBrite display, AMD Turion 64 X2 CPU, DVD-R, Mobility Radeon X1200, 802.11b/g

All in all, truly three of the most middle of the road crowd-pleasers we've ever seen. Check out some hands-on pics in the gallery below.
