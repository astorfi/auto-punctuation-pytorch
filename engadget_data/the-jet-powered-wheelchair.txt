Proving that people can always find brand new ways to accidentally kill themselves, some guy in England decided that
it was a good idea to strap a jet engine to the back of his mother-in-law's wheelchair. He's been able to rocket the
thing up to sixty miles per hour, but we have this sinking feeling that sooner or later he might find himself in need
of a wheelchair of his own.
