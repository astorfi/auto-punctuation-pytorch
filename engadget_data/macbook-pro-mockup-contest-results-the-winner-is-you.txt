In terms of true-to-reality, the jury's still out until Apple hits us with the truth, but when it comes to "imagination" and "rainbows," you guys win in a landslide. Up top we have the MacBook Pro touch from Alex W, who slapped an exterior touchscreen onto the MacBook Pro's lid for maximum optimism. Check out the gallery below for the rest of the entries so far, with descriptions if they sent 'em. Thanks so much to everybody who participated, and be sure to check in next time when we prototype new facial hair configurations for the Engadget staff -- sure to be a riot.
