 If you live in California, don't even think of tossing that obsolete cellphone, dead laptop or archaic printerinto the trash. New state laws that go into effect next month require that all electronic waste be recycled, ratherthan dumped in the trash and shipped to landfills. (Of course, you can always do what we do, and preserve every gadgetyou've ever owned in a personal museum in the basement.) In 2003, according to the state, 515,000 tons of electronicswere dumped into California landfills; 44% of the waste (by volume) consisted of CRTs and TV sets; the rest, we assume,consisted of first generation iPods with dead batteries. California's laws are designed to stem the spread of mercuryand other toxins; the environmental rules have been in effect for businesses for four years, but are now being extendedto consumers as well.
