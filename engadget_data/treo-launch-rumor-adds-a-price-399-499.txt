 Last we heard from ourinsider in the biz, Palm was going to be launching their PalmOS-powered Treo 700p sometimearound or on Monday, May 15th. Now it would seem Gadgets on the Go's gotten word from a source they deem reliablethat the 700p's got a price: $399 for a new 2 year contract, $499with a 1 year contract.Â  (Oh, they also confirmed the same release time frame we had -- mid May ideally, earlyJune at latest.) That sounds about right if you ask us, but there's only one way to find out: wait for the launch. Ok,well, two ways: we'll keep on inquiring, ourselves. Stay tuned, Treo nuts.
