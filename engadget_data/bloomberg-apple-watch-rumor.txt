 Apple's wearable computing project might not just be the fever-dream of analysts, if Bloomberg is to be believed. The news agency is claiming that Apple's watch project is commanding considerable resources within Cupertino's shadowy prototype labs. Two people who claim to be familiar with the company's plans are saying that engineering chief James Foster and program manager Achim Pantfoerder are heading up a team of around 100 designers, programmers and engineers. Bloomberg goes on to say that the watch will tie in to the iPhone and iPad, but, understandably, received a terse no comment when it approached Apple directly.
