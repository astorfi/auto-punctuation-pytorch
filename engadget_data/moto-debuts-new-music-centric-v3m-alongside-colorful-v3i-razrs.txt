Today Moto is busting out a brand new musicphone RAZR titled the V3m, whichsounds to be merely a V3i plus stereoBluetooth, with a microSD slot for up to 1GB of storage, and a 1.3 megapixel camera. We're not sure if the phonefeatures iTunes playback or not, but we can't say we'd miss it anyways. The CDMA phone is accompanied by another in theW315, which sounds to be a no-frills clamshell, though we're low on deets and without a pic. Motorola is also bringingout some new spring colors for the RAZR V3i (pictured), including dark blue, maroon and violet. We'll have hands-onshots of these before long, so just sit tight.Read: V3m and W315Read: V3i colors
