The YouTube video claims that by using a compatibility layer, the Android runtime can play Flash content natively in Safari, but only on iPad so far -- iPhone 3GS support is planned soon, as is iOS 4, and there's a call for developers to move the project forward at GitHub. We've no way of determining its legitimacy at this moment, but it sure seems like Comex (he of the iPad "Spirit" jailbreak) has outdone himself this time, and hey, where there's smoke, there's fire, right? See Strongbad answer emails on iOS, right after the break.

Update: It appears Comex has indeed been working on this project for some time; a second blurry video after the break (running on iPhone) shows us what it used to look like.
