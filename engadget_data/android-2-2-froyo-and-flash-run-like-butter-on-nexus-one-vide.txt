Can you blame us? It's not like we're alone with waning interest in Flash, especially for video playback. Anyway, from the looks of the homescreen in the grab above, we'll be treated to an updated launcher, Android tutorial, and global search box when the OS is revealed (presumably) at Google I/O starting May 19. And with the giant Froyo statue apparently already delivered to the GooglePlex's confectionary art show, well, the stage is set for 2.2 to be launched in time for Adobe's planned June release of Flash 10.1. Get your glimpse into the future of Flash and Android in the video after the break.

Update: How much faster is a Nexus One running Froyo? 450 percent faster, according to the Android Police. They claim to have a device running the as-yet-unreleased firmware that can perform over 37 million floating-point operations per second in the Linpack benchmark... compared to about 7 megaflops without. Oh yeeaaah.
