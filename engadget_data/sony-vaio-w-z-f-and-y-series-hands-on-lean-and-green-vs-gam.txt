 
Sony's unleashed quartet of Scrabble-friendly VAIOs this week -- Z, F, Y, and W -- and while they all have their merits, the two that really caught our eye were the the bulkier, gamer-friendly VAIO F, and the environmentally-conscious VAIO W Eco Edition. The green hue's gonna be a deal-breaker for some, but the packaging is a welcome touch and from cursory glance it is a sturdy and competent netbook. There's never enough time to test the internals, but for now, at least take solace in a bevy of pictures below (VAIO Y and Z after the break).
