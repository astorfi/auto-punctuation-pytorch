       It's June 27th, but instead of a 10-inch MSI Wind NB unboxing we're hearing that at least one pre-order customer is being greeted with another delay. Reason? An "industry wide battery shortage." Come now MSI, we guess you missed that giant fireball-of-a-signal to look elsewhere for your inventory back in March? At least MSI is tossing in free overnight delivery with the new July 7th ship date. Hoozah, drinks are on Fred! Full MSI notification posted after the break.P.S. The MSI Wind NB retail page is currently blank. Time will tell if this is a deeper issue or just a temporary administration error.[Thanks, Fred H.]
