 It's been a little while since we last heard from Larry Page, talking up Google Plus's adoption rate over the summer and, most recently, supposedly chatting with Tim Cook about the patent war that looms over both companies. Now he's letting his voice be heard again, sitting down with Miguel Helft from Fortune about a variety of topics, including the company's recent dealings with Cupertino. He calls Apple's "island-like approach" to its platform "somewhat a shame for users." He continues:

  What I was trying to say was I think it would be nice if everybody would get along better and the users didn't suffer as a result of other people's activities. I try to model that. We try pretty hard to make our products be available as widely as we can. That's our philosophy. I think sometimes we're allowed to do that. Sometimes we're not.

 Availability and sharing, he says, is key to the success of Android, and Google Plus is a big part of that. "We had 18 different ways of sharing stuff before we did Plus. Now we have one way that works well, and we're improving." And when will they make some actual revenue from Android? "I think we're in the early stages of monetization. The fact that a phone has a location is really helpful for monetization."

 Finally, on the question of why Google hasn't launched a Nexus device from Motorola yet, Page says quite simply "we haven't owned the company long enough." While he stops well short of pledging such a device is coming, he does say that Google is continuing to develop "amazing innovative devices" with multiple partners, and that the company will do everything it can to keep those partners, both old and new, happy.
