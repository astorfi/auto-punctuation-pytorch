The Dell Latitude E6410 is currently listed with a base price of Â£749 ($1,128) and features a 14.1-inch display (WXGA and WXGA+ options), a Core i5 or Core i7 processor, Windows Vista or 7, a pair of DDR3 RAM slots, NVIDIA's NVS 3100M (512MB) graphics, a variety of storage options, a Blu-ray or DVD drive, optional mobile broadband and all the expected ports around the edges. The E6510 steps up to a 15.6-inch panel (with a 1080p version selectable) and offers up a few extra CPU options, but otherwise it's identical. There's no word on when these kind fellows will make their way stateside, but if we were the betting type, we'd put our pounds and / or greenbacks on "real soon."
