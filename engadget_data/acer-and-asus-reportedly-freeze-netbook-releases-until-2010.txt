What's more, Acer's also apparently postponing that dual-boot Android / XP machine since it's found demand to be low -- we could have told you that months ago, but whatever. Still, turning off the netbook spigot will be a big step for the two companies most responsible for the segment's overheated product cycle, but don't you worry about them -- they'll have plenty of CULV thin-and-light machines to obsessively iterate in the meantime.[Via SlashGear]
