Engadget editors have flown in from as far as Hong Kong to attend tonight's NYC Engadget Reader Meetup. The event is free and open to you all, and we've got lots of awesome stuff planned.

For starters, AT&T, Samsung, HTC, RIM and Motorola will be on hand, showing off their latest and greatest. And as you can see above, there's also a sweet electric Mini Cooper parked outside. Toss in lots of cool free stuff, a live podcast, live art and food and drink, and you've got a pretty sweet party.

The all ages event kicks off tonight at 6:30PM at Guastavino's, located at 59th Street in Manhattan. Space is limited to 1,000, and things are first-come, first served, so showing up a little early certainly couldn't hurt. Oh, and a Facebook event? We've got your Facebook invite right here.
