Connections include the usual SD composite jacks, as well as optical audio, DVI-D, Ethernet, and built-in 801.11g wireless, and codec support is pretty spectacular, including H.264, XviD, DivX HD, MPEG4, WMV, and VOB. The Nseries integration is the big feature here, however -- not only does the EZFetch stream content from any WiFi-capable Nseries device, you can also use the Nseries as a remote to control the entire EZFetch system. No word on pricing or availability, sadly, but RF spectrum test geeks can check out all the test results at the read link.  Read -- EZ 4 Media website Read -- EZFetch FCC listing
