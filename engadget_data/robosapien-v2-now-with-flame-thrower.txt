Some firestarter, twisted firestarter has hacked a "flame thrower" onto the unsuspecting bot who seems a tad perplexed by his new powers of destruction. No deets yet on how to apply the hack, but you can check the sneak peak video for the results. Hey Flameosapien, why not use your powers for good (like, say, plumbing) instead of acting on your nature to oppress our kind, hmm?[Via MAKE]
