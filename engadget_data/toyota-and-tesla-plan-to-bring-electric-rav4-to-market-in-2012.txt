What's more, Telsa says that it's already produced one prototype vehicle and plans to deliver a fleet of them to Toyota for evaluation "within this year," and that Toyota plans to bring the vehicle to market sometime in 2012. Details are still a bit light beyond that (including any word of a price), but it certainly sounds like this is just the beginning of more vehicles to result from the partnership -- check out the praise the companies heap on each other in the press release after the break.
