Danish website Recordere has managed to get a cheeky glimpse of the new BeoPlay V1 TV from Bang & Olufsen. Pegged as the new "affordable" model from the Scandinavian manufacturer, it'll come in two flavors: the BeoPlay V1-32 and V1-40 (the numbers representing screen size,) which include DLNA functionality, five HDMI ports, one USB, and integrated 5.1 surround sound, as well as a few other treats. The official launch is the 5th of May, with pricing set at €2,399 and €2,899 (about $3,170 and $3,831 respectively) depending how big the space in your front room is.
