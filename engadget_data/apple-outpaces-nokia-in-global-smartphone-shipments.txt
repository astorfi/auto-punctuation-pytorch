As touched on during an earnings call this morning, the Finnish handset manufacturer's smartphone shipments took a 34 percent dip down from the same quarter last year, to 16.7 million units -- that's markedly fewer than the 20.3 million that Apple shipped during that same time period, as announced in its far more celebratory earnings report. Despite his stated disappointment, however, Nokia chief Stephen Elop insists that the company is on the right track, making "better than expected progress." Really, it's important in times like these for a company to focus on the more positive side of things.
