   Jonesing for some more of Samsung's 17-inchers? Jones no more, because the Korean manufacturer has just put its NP700G7C gaming laptop up for pre-order. Packing 16GB of memory, this new Series 7 lappy made a brief appearance on Best Buy's website last month, but was quickly pulled. This time, though, it looks like it's for real, with Samsung touting its new "Gaming PC" on its very own website, alongside a $1,700 price tag. For that money, you'll get a 17.3-inch display with 1920 x 1080 resolution and, most compelling, a taste of Ivy Bridge, courtesy of the laptop's third-generation Intel Core i7-3610QM quad-core processor, which clocks in at 2.3GHz. It's available now, at the source link below.
