Asked by Walt Mossberg whether Apple would be less secretive going forward, Cook replied that "we're going to double down on secrecy on products." That was said with a bit of a smile on his face, it should be noted, but he was clear that it's something he's serious about. On that same note, however, Cook said that Apple would be "super transparent" when it comes to other things, like its work with suppliers and environmental issues -- something that he hopes will be an area where other companies copy Apple. Later during the interview, Cook noted that acquisitions were one part of the doubling-down on secrecy. "We buy companies," Cook said, "we don't like to make it public. It depends on the amount -- if I don't have to, I won't."
