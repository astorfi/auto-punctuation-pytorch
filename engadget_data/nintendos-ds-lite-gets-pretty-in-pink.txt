 We're all well beyond the point where there's any kind of surprise when a device gets made over in yet another color -- especially pink -- so save that aghast look for something a little more unusual. Nope, sorry, that won't be the price either; the "Noble Pink" DS Lites will weigh in at an almost-average Â¥16,800 ($144 US), and will see release July 20th overseas. Which means if nothing else we'll get them around or before the Wii drops in Q4, though hopefully not before the elusive, highly desireable black market black Lite.[Via Joystiq]
