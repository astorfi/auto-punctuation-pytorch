It may not be an Everio, but
we're pretty sure it's no DN-HDDV8000 either, but
Panasonic's new SDR-S100 is the first SD-based pocket camcorder we've seen to use 3 CCDs. And this is definitely a
pocket camcorder with 2 x 3.8 x 3.2-inch dimensions and a weight of just 8.5 ounces. The SDR-100 also includes 10x
optical zoom and image stabilization, and can capture up to 25 minutes of MPEG-2 video to its included 2GB SD card—but
that SD card is the real issue with this. While Panasonic's price on this is about $1,200—about $400 less than the 3CCD
Everio GZ-MC500—the JVC model has a 4GB
removable microdrive. Do the math on adding storage to either unit, and it may seem like a wash since bumping this up
to 4GB still keeps the price at under $1,400. But you can add microdrives in larger capacities, with 6GB versions going
for under $300, while for now SD cards top out at 2GB, meaning you'll be doing a lot of card-swapping if you need to
shoot anything longer than a half hour.
