       One of our readers was in perusing around a local Blockbuster when she noticed an end-cap advertising Blu-ray and HD DVD rentals. Kristina did indicate that these stores were not corporate-owned though, so this might not be company wide just yet. We really do see this becoming the norm. It simply has to be. Both Blu-ray and HD DVD are now marketing giants and they must get into consumer's view. If they don't hit the everyday consumers, like Blockbuster, nether of the formats will go anywhere.
