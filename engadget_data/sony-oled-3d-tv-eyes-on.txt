Sony is showing off its 24.5-inch OLED television here at CES, and we have to admit to being blown away once more by the sheer vibrancy and clarity of the output. The jump from the 15-inch panels that are still very sparsely available in retail channels is most welcome. We can totally envision spending our happily ever after with one of these screens serving all of our visual needs, 3D or otherwise. Sony's reps couldn't tell us when these will make it to market, but the pics below should whet appetites appropriately.
