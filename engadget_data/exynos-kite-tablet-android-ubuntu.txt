 Italian electronics firm DaVinci Mobile Technology is now accepting pre-orders for its Kite Full-HD tablet. This European slab features a 10.1-inch 1,920 x 1,200 IPS display, a Samsung Exynos 4412 quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, a front-facing VGA camera and a rear-facing 2-megapixel shooter. In addition to packing some decent specs, the device also dual-boots Ubuntu 12.04 for ARM and Android 4.0. While there's no telling if this switch hitter will ever officially make its way to US soil, our friends abroad can fly this Kite for â‚¬309 (around $413 USD).
