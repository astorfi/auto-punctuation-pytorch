 A hot, hot summer isn't keeping The Weinstein Company from staying busy, as just weeks after announcing its intentions to finally join the herd and go Blu-ray exclusive comes word that it has inked a long-term deal with Showtime Networks. The two have entered into an "exclusive seven-year film distribution arrangement" which will be effective with Weinstein's 2009 release schedule. Showtime viewers can expect to see Nine, Inglorious Bastards and other highly acclaimed pictures from the outfit, and for those interested, you may be stoked to find that the output deal "also includes releases from Dimension Films." So, is this enough incentive to keep this premium around?
