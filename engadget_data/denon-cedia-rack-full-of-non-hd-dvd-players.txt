       This scene is all of the '06 CEDIA EXPO show: rack full of high-end DVD players and not a signal high-def media player in the mix. A Denon minion reaffirmed what we already figured that these higher-end boys are waiting till the dust settles before choosing sides. Just too much at stake to pick the wrong side, plus, they want to be able to provide the user with the best possible experience that cannot be done at this point in the game. Give 'em a few years and there will be one out.
