The USB-powered device is apparently geared towards laptops (well, ones without ExpressCard slots) itching for surround sound, and aside from the unicorn-like 24-bit Crystalizer and CMSS-3D technologies, you'll find RCA outputs, an optical digital audio output, headphone out / microphone in jacks and all those X-Fi enhancements you're sure to end up overlooking. It's available now for the halfway respectable price of $59.99.[Via CNET]
