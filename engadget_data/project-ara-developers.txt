Google's modular smartphones have come a long way since that kooky Phonebloks concept video went viral last year, and now the company's digging deeper than it ever has before at its first Ara Developer Conference. Couldn't jump on a flight to Mountain View? Never fear -- Google is streaming it, and you can watch the whole thing right here. Here's the rub, though: as the name implies, the event is meant to get would-be module developers familiar with the process of designing and making physical bits that pop into a phone that seems yanked from the pages of a pulp sci-fi novel. That means it'll be a perhaps a little heavier on the technical detail than one might like, but we'll be keeping out eyes and ears open for all the spiffy details you should know about.
