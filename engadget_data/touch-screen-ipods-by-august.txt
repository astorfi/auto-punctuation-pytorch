  Now that the iPhone is out, the Apple rumor mongers have shifted their attention to the next generation iPod. Well, some of them anyway. Specifically, will it or won't it feature a device-wide touch-screen running OS X -- a stripped down iPhone if you will. Enter DigiTimes, with their hit-or-miss record of Taiwanese sources, who are calling for a touch-screen iPod to launch in August. Sources at "upstream suppliers" claim that WinTek -- a former iPod panel supplier back in the black-and-white iPod days -- won the order for the capacitive touch screen panels. With Jobs himself calling the iPhone the "best iPod yet," we certainly don't doubt that Apple's working on a touch-screen iPod (possibly with WiFi). Our only question is will it arrive before January's MacWorld or not. [Thanks, Ben]
