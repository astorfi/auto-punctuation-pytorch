The mouse is adjustable in almost every dimension and angle, thanks to certain sliding aspects, some hex key-adjustable mechanisms and buttons galore (including a very useful aiming button for slowing down the cursor in those heated sniper moments). The real winner is the Rat 9, which is wireless and has a nifty little "home base" that continuously charges a hot-swappable replacement AA battery and keeps some extra weights warm as well, though with a $130 pricetag it's not for the faint of heart.
