 While we wait for Google's latest to hit the virtual shelves in our neck of the woods, Australian buyers have already seen the Nexus 4 and Nexus 10 go on sale, appearing around noon locally. AusDroid reports the 16GB Nexus 4 went out of stock in just 22 minutes, followed by the 8GB version and 32GB Nexus 10. additionally, Android Central reports that official bumpers for the Nexus 4 have appeared in the Google Play store. We didn't have problems with our review units but since the LG-built handset is rocking glass front and back they may be the difference between a close call and a sob story -- friends who've smashed an iPhone 4 (or more than one) likely have relevant tales to share. Readers have emailed saying Google Play customer service reps indicated new Nexus sales will start at noon ET here as well, but without official word we'd probably just keep an eye on our inbox / clicking that refresh key to be safe.

 Update: Sales appear to have gone live for customers in Europe, specifically UK and Spain, right about...now (3AM ET), those that can actually pull up the site at the moment may be able to get a purchase through.

 Update 2: Google has confirmed that UK stock of the Nexus 4 has already been exhausted just hours after going on sale.  [Thanks, Jeffrey Powell]
