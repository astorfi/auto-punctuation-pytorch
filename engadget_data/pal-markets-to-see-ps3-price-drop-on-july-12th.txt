According to a blurb at SmartHouse News, Michael Ephraim has apparently stated that a "PAL market announcement will be made on July 12th regarding price cuts to the PAL market PS3." More specifically, consoles sold in Australia "could be cut by as much as 17-percent," which would purportedly lower that model to AUD$829, and gamers in the UK could see the PS3 lowered to a much more respectable Â£350 if the percentage discount carries over. Only time will tell, eh?[Via PS3Fanboy]
