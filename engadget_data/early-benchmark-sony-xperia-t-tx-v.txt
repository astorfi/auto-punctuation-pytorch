We ran mobile benchmarks on Sony's new flagship Xperia T, the Xperia TX (the US version of the T) and the LTE-enabled Xperia V. All three devices pack dual-core Snapdragon S4 Krait processors clocked at 1.5GHz, and they're currently running Ice Cream Sandwich -- though a Jelly Bean update is reportedly on the way. Meet us past the break for a first look at how these smartphones stack up.



 
        Xperia V
    (1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm MSM8960, 1GB RAM)

    Xperia T
    (1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm MSM8260A, 1GB RAM)

    Xperia TX
    (1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm MSM8260A, 1GB RAM)

        AnTuTu     7,369     8,013     8,056       Quadrant     5,808     5,373     5,466       Linpack (single-thread)     130     97     101       Linpack (multi-thread)     268     189     198       NenaMark 2 (fps)     59.2     60     60       Vellamo     2,471     2,430     2,417       SunSpider 0.9.1 (ms, lower is better)     1,909     1,652     1,838       CF-Bench     7,915     9,120     9,475    Simply put, these results are none too shabby. In Quadrant particularly, Sony's handsets score several hundred points higher than most dual-core phones we've tested recently. The Xperia V logged a very respectable score of 5,808, while the TX and T trailed by a few hundred points. The Sony Xperia S, which runs an older dual-core Snapdragon S3 processor, notched significantly lower numbers when we reviewed it back in March: 2,033 in Quadrant, for example. We weren't able to download GLBenchmark on these phones (confounded trade-show units!), but we'll be running these tests anew once we get final models in our hands.
