Using a passthrough and some homebrew demos,
someone has Linux running on Nintendo's new dual-screen portable gaming unit.  It appears to use some external
hardware, which makes the whole thing currently not-so-portable, but the idea is that all the hardware could be put on
a single cartridge.  Once in there, a portable dual-screen Linux system with touch-screen input and WiFi could be
pretty darn useful.  And fun.  And only $149.

[Correction: That's not Linux running on there, actually.  Just a software demo.]
