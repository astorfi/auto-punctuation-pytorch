The company announced a reorganization around four specific pillars: products, future techology, marketing, and customer relations. The restructuring also marks the end of Randy Allen's tenure, as the SVP of the Computing Solutions Group has decided to leave for unspecified reasons. ATI holdover Rick Bergman, who had also be head of the subsidiary known internally as the Graphics Product Group, will head up the products division with the goal of unifying the GPU and CPU teams (not necessarily the products). We highly doubt this means ATI branding is going anywhere -- it's far too valuable for AMD. Will Bergman's lead help the company reclaim its position among the top ten chip makers? Give Fusion the kick in the pants it needs? Only time will tell.
