Target Mobile looks to have exclusive rights on a plum-colored version of the Verizon handset, previously seen in white and green. The leak also adds some early details on the rumored charm notifier, which lights up to announce incoming calls and messages. It appears to connect to the headphone jack and will apparently work "outside of clothing." In-ear buds appear to be included and, while it's still unclear whether these will also be Beats Audio offerings, it certainly would be name-appropriate. Handset details sound pretty concrete, seemingly confirmed by another leak at Unwired View, with a 3.7-inch WVGA Super LCD screen (matching that on the HTC Desire S), Android Gingerbread and a rear-facing five megapixel camera. According to the leaks -- and even the official-looking renders -- it will be one of the first phones to arrive with HTC's refreshed Sense 3.5 UI. The smart money is on an appearance at HTC's soiree later today, and we'll be there to find out for sure.

Update: We just got word from Target's PR team that the Rhyme will go up for pre-order tomorrow, September 21st, instead of the 22nd. The rep also confirmed that the retailer will be accepting pre-orders at 1,492 Target Mobile locations through the 26th (the Rhyme goes on sale on the 29th).
