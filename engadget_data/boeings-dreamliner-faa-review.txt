 A fire onboard a super-spec 787 Dreamliner last week has led the FAA to order a review of the aircraft's critical systems and assembly. The Dreamliner has had its share of teething problems, not least because it does things differently -- including using space-saving lithium ion batteries that have since been implicated in the fire on the All Nippon Airways jet. Qatar Airways also temporarily grounded one of its planes last month due to electrical problems and a United Airlines flight had to make an emergency landing for much the same reason. No one has been hurt and the FAA hasn't shown any intention to stop the 787 from flying while it investigates. Meanwhile, Boeing insists that none of these "introductory issues" give it cause to "doubt the capabilities of the airplane."
