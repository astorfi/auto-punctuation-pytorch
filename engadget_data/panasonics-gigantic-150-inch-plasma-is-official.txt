The gigantic HDTV was unveiled at Panasonic's keynote today, with at least one surprise, this sucker is 4k! That's right, it is 4x 1080p, which we're sure looks awesome, but oh my, where the content will come from? Regardless, we have no doubt this thing will look sensational upconverting your 1080p HD movies.
