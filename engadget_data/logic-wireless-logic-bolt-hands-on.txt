It is a large handset -- but we wonder how they could make the thing smaller without making the projector element modular, or something -- well put together, with a huge speaker on the back but is otherwise an unremarkable candybar. We projected the OS' menu and a short video on a small whiteboard setup at the booth and even with pretty tough lighting conditions, it worked. Of course, what remains to be seen is real shipping product, a carrier deal to sweeten the pricing, and perhaps a battery life tweak. Good first effort folks, we'll definitely be keeping an eye on this device.
