There's a good chance that some of your smartphone-toting friends use emoji to express themselves on Twitter -- wouldn't it be nice to see those icons while you're surfing the web? As of today, you can. Twitter has updated its web client to display emoji, giving you all the colorful characters that you'd expect while browsing mobile apps (and some desktop apps, too). The update won't make it any easier to decipher the meaning of an emoji-laden tweet, but you'll have at least some semblance of what's going on.
