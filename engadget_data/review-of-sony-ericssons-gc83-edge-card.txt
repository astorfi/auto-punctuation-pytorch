   connected to the internet at every possible second and don't mind paying $80 a month for it, then this one's for
   you. What we have here is a picture-rich review of the Sony Ericsson GC83 PC Card, which'll hook you at a decently
   fast speed (the reviewer got 176-192 kbps, average is 100-130), sports quite the appealing interface and, best of
   all, is free (after a rebate which you'll probably either lose or forget to send in). Plus it comes with an
   aluminum case you could put use to put stuff into.
