If you've been anticipating the arrival of Beats music-streaming service since it was first teased, it looks like wait is finally up next month. CEO Ian Rogers took to his personal blog to announce the January 2014 launch of Beats Music in the States. The software in currently in an internal private beta and is gathering feedback from artists so that the necessary improvements can be made before going live. To tide you over for another month, you can head over to the Beats Music site and stake your claim on a username starting today. You know, so you won't have to worry about not swiping up that go-to handle when the time launch-day rush comes. Hopefully we'll find out soon just what the outfit has done with its MOG acquisition.
