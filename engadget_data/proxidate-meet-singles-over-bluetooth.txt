You'd have to seriously believe in love against all odds and possibilities to think your future significant other
has a cellphone with Bluetooth, knows how to operate said phone and Bluetooth, has ProxiDating installed, and
happens to be within range of you at that moment. True, we're sure stranger things have happened than two people
picking one another up with Bluetooth, but we might go out on
a limb and tell you to save yourself the heartache, since you may wind up feeling much lonelier checking ProxiDate
every 3 minutes on the subway than when you started. May we suggest you just get on myspace or friendster?
