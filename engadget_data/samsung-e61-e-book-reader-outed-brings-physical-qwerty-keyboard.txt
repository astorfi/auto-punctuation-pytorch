What sets this guy apart from the rest is a physical QWERTY keyboard, but otherwise boasts a 6-inch, 600 x 800 resolution screen and all other amenities found in the E6, including a removable battery should you find yourself thousands of pages into a book and no charger in sight. PC Professionale was on hand to get hands on with the device, and we also spotted a touchscreen keyboard on the E101 -- nothing to write about, but it's good seeing just how we'll be navigating the dictionary when needed. No word on its release date, so for now we're gonna assume it falls under the same "early 2010" timeframe we heard with the other two.
