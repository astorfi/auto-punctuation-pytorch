       The HD DVD camp's recent price reductions have been great for PR, but we wonder how they'll equate to sales. As great as a $99 HD DVD player is, it doesn't do you much good if they're all out of stock. So we want to know, were you able to take advantage of the deals, or are you so sure Blu-ray will win soon, you don't want to waste $99 just to see some of your favorite HD DVD exclusives in the meantime? Ohh, and please don't be lame and vote just to pump up the numbers.%Poll-5244%
