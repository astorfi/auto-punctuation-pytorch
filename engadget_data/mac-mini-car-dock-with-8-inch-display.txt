This Mac mini docking system from Japan is both one of the most enticing and most
inelegant mini car systems
we've seen. Enticing because it includes an 8-inch touchscreen â€” perfect for accessing iTunes and causing accidents.
Inelegant because the mini sticks out of your dash like an old 8-track tape, and that big touchscreen sort of hovers in
limbo next to your steering wheel. For $1,600 (not including the mini or installation), we'd like to see a bit more
integration, but we guess we'll sacrifice elegance for that big juicy display.
