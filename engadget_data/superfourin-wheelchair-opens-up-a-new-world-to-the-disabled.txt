TheSuperfourin chair, as it's known, is basically a modified ATV with a hybrid engine, on-board computer, and embeddedsensors to monitor both vital signs and vehicle status, and was developed by Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Information and Data Processing IITB inconjunction with Otto Bock HealthCare GmbH. Designed mostly fordeployment in fleets for group outings into Mother Nature'sthoughtlessly unpaved terrain, the Superfourin was also given highmarks for solo use from its multiple sclerosis-afflicted test driver, who was able to enjoy the Th√ºringer Forest alone with his family for the first time inyears.[Via Gizmag]
