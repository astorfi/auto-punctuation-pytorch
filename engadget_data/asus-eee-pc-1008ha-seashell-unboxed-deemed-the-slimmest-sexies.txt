If the details have already slipped your mind, recall that the Seashell boasts a 1.6GHz processor, a 160GB hard disk, and GMA graphics. The glossy, tapered edges of the 10-incher are looking pretty fine if you ask us, furthering our opinion that the 1008HA is a stylish piece of work. The newest addition to the Eee PC family will be available as of May 15th in the UK for Â£379 (about $565). One more shot after the break, and hit the read link for the whole, glorious set.
