HumanWare is a new company whose first product is a GPS orientation tool for the blind. They're combining the
Maestro, the first off-the-shelf accessible PocketPC,
with Trekker, a standalone GPS solution for the blind. Now available in one integrated device, the new Trekker/Maestro
package (no name yet? Their website doesn't appear to be actually launched.) aims to provide a complete solution for
blind users. Current users of both Trekker and Maestro will be offered upgrade paths for the new integrated solution,
which looks to be available in May of this year.
