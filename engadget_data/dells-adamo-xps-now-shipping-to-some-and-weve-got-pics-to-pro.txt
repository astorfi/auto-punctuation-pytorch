In fact, those ordering one of these slimsters today won't see it until mid-January, but if you got in early, there just might be hope for you yet. Oh, and if you're pretty certain that your order will simply be delayed indefinitely as Old Man Winter holds you down, feel free to cheer yourself up by perusing the gallery below. Or slip into an infinite loop of depression -- your call.

[Thanks, Adam]
