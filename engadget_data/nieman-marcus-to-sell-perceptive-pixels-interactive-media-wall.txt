Well, the wait is apparently over, and for once it's Neiman Marcus we've got to thank. While you're shopping for the latest must-have fall fashions, be sure to stop by the newly anointed Futuristic Displays That Don't Belong at Neiman Marcus Shop to pick up your 8 x 3-foot multi-touch display for a cool $100,000 US, only ten times the price of Microsoft's forthcoming Surface. Don't worry, your family will appreciate your investment; trust us, we really think they'd far prefer it to, say, Christmas presents, a home to live in, or dinner at some point in 2008.[Via thegadgetsite]
