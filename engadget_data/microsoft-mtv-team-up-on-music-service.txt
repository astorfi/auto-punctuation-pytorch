Bill Gates wants his MTV. Microsoft announced today that
it will be teaming up with the music channel to create a new online music service, which will be integrated into an
upcoming version of the Windows Media Player. Rather than leverage any equity that the MTV (or even MSN) brand might
offer, the new service will also mark the launch of a new brand, undoubtedly created to prove how hip and happening
Microsoft and the M really are: Urge. (Hey, at least it beats "the iTunes Music Store.") We're not sure what this means
for Microsoft's deal with Real Networks to promote Real's Rhapsody service, though we suspect that the fact that
Microsoft paid Real $300 million as part of that deal might help soften any blow Real might feel from being urged, er,
edged aside.
