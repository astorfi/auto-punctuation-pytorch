Seagate may have been the first to announce theirs,
but the winner of the race to get the first perpendicular
recording hard drive (can we just call them perpendiskulars?) to market goes to
Toshiba. The MK4007GAL does 40GB on a single platter,
which means thinner portable audio players with fewer read/write heads (and thus fewer points of failure). Their new
Gigabeat F41 will apparently use the new perpdrive, and they've plans to release an 80GB version, the MK8007GAH, later
this year.
