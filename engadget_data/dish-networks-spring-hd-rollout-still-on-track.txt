 Surely by now you've heard about DISH Network's satellite launch issues, but don't worry, the channels planned to roll out over the next few months are still on track. Thanks to the Satelliteguys.us, we've got a list of markets still getting local HD in April and May, while the rest of the planned 100 HD channels / 100 markets strategy should be taken care of by the end of the year, thanks to the remaining two satellites still going up this year. Exactly who is -- and will be -- the "top HD provider" is still murky as ever, but despite recent SEC filings, don't count DISH out just yet.[Thanks, Scott]
