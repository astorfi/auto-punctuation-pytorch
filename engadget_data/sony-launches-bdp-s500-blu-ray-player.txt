Before we start in, and it's neither here or there, but didn't Sony notice that "S500" is the most common consumer electronics model name around? It's the John Smith of tech, if you will. (See: Sony's other S500 and S500, Nikon's S500, Samsung's S500, Canon's S500, Casio's S500, etc.). That aside, we can find little about this new player that differs from the BDP-S300: both feature HDMI (duh), 24p, and x.v.Color, and Dolby Digital Plus -- only the S500 has Dolby True HD and DTS-HD1, and HDMI 1.3. Is that worth £200 (about $400) more to you? If so, both will be out overseas by the end of October and run you £400 and £600 ($800 and $1200 US), and even come bundled with the Spider-man trilogy in the UK.
