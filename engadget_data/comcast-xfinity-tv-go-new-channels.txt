Just in time for the official start of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday, Comcast has added a load of new channels to its Xfinity TV offering, including options for watching the first second round upsets. Alongside March Madness viewing with access to TNT, TBS and truTV, key additions to the live-streaming library include A&E, Bravo, Cooking Channel, E!, Food Network, HGTV, History, Syfy, USA and more. Of course, this is on top of the more than 25,000 on-demand options for watching at your leisure. All of the new channels are available via either Xfinity TV on the web or Xfinity TV Go for iOS and Android.
