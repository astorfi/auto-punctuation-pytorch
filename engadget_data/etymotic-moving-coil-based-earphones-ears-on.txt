The mc-series consists of the hf2, hf3, and hf5, and employs the moving-coil sound tech instead of more expensive balanced armiture hardware. As Etymotic explained, it's the extra air chamber that makes the moving coil acoustics better than they would normally be. We're not crazy audiophiles, and we can't really make a realistic judgment in the middle of the Las Vegas Convention Center, but the sound quality was definitely passable. They've got a couple of models sporting in-line remote controls for iPhone / iPod touch, and you can score 'em in any color to match your iPod nano. Check the neon 'buds out in our gallery below.
