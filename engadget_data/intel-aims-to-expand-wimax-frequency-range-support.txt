 While much of the world rallies around LTE, Intel's still doing its thang with WiMAX. According to Garth Collier, general manager of WiMax at Intel Asia-Pacific, the outfit is gearing up to "start supporting other markets outside of the US at 2.5GHz and in other spectrum profiles." As it stands, the Centrino 2 chip package supports a version of the technology that uses the 2.5GHz spectrum, and while Mr. Collier didn't specify which WiMAX profile would be added in 2009, deductive reasoning leads us to believe that 2.3GHz (used in South Korea) and 3.5GHz (used in Pakistan) are in the cards. Beyond that, details are few and far between, but we'd expect to hear something a bit more solid at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco.[Via InfoWorld, image courtesy of CNET]
