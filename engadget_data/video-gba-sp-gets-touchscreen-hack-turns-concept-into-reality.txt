We've tracked down video of an Arduino-powered touchscreen hack for the Game Boy Advance SP that brings to life one of Nintendo's own concepts and -- while not quite on par with the GamePack -- comes with all the exposed hardware and blinking lights you'd expect from a quality mod. Though there's no interface or game compatibility to speak of, the coolness factor alone should be enough for you to check out the video after the break.
