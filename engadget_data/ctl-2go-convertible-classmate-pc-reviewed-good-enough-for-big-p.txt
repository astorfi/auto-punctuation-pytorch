They found the little convertible tablet -- which has an 8.9-inch resistive touchscreen (with 1024 x 600 resolution) -- to be a more grown up version of its predecessor, heavier than other, similarly-sized netbooks, and they love the overall aesthetics of it. It falls a little short in a few categories: they found the 60GB hard drive to be "sluggish" and the keyboard to be "cramped," but overall, they're pretty into the Classmate, even going so far as to suggest that adults might just be covetous of the netbook. Hit the read link to check out the full review which, incidentally, is written entirely in crayon. (Note: totally kidding. We write in crayon, though. Sometimes).
