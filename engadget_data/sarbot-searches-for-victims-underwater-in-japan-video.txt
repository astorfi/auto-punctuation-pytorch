Like some of the other bots, this guy can shoot video as it swims under houses and other crippled structures, but it also sports a "limb grasping mechanism," designed to retrieve drowning victims and assist in other search and rescue operations. As of yet the machine's searches have come up empty, but the bot has kept the camera rolling during it's underwater adventures, so head past the break to check out a clip of its footage.
