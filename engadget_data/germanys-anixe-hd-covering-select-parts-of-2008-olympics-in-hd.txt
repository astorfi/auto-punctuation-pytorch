Reportedly, Anixe HD will be airing select events in HD to German viewers, although the Opening Ceremony will not be included. Thus far, it has vowed to show cycling, sailing, archery and a few others, although it could secure more before the Games begin in August. Locals are also holding out for a potential German version of the Eurosport HD coverage, but even if that falls through, at least Germany won't have to watch the entire thing in SD, right?[Thanks, Chris]
