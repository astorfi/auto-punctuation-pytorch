Not even 24 hours after Sony's BDP-S300 fell to under $200 at Amazon, Samsung's respectable BD-P1500 has now done the same over at RadioShack. The $299.99 player becomes $199.99 instantly when added to one's cart, and according to the promotional fine print, the additional $100 off will be valid until September 27th. The real question is: will the "sale" be extended?[Thanks, Shawn]Update: The player has vanished from the website. Sold out, possibly?
