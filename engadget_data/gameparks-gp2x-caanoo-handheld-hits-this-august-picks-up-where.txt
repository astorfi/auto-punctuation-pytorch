Though it's got the same 533MHz ARM9 processor as its wizardly predecessor, GamePark's doubled the memory to 128MB, and added a dedicated 3D GPU to power the larger 3.5-inch touchscreen. Throwback Sega-like buttons and a joystick take the place of those touchy D-pads, and there's new accelerometer and vibration functions for a modicum of enhanced control. When you're not loading open-source games, the system supports the usual array of photos and music as well as DivX, XviD and MPEG4 videos, and the company claims an official SDK and app store are on the way if you want to roll additional software yourself. Shame you'll have to use a WiFi dongle to download anything. The company expects to ship August 15 for $150 to importers like Play-Asia, making it viable competition for the lumbering Pandora. Find videos of the Caanoo in action after the break, and more at GamePark's official Facebook page.
