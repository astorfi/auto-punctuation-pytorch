As we saw with MSI's upgrading of the Wind U100, the nicely refreshed NC10 checks in with most of the same specs -- a 10.2 WSVGA display, 1.6GHz Atom N270 CPU, 160GB HDD, 1GB of DDR2 RAM, WiFi and Bluetooth 2.0+EDR -- but it does add a few delectable extras for just $50 over the "other" NC10. Most notable is the 5,900mAh 6-cell high capacity battery, which extends the already respectable battery life to a staggering 9.4 hours. Furthermore, the enlarged touchpad should make mousing around a bit easier, and there's also an anti-reflection gloss coating display that may or may not float your boat. Obviously, there's no word on a ship date just yet, but we'd put our money on "sooner," not "later."[Via PortableMonkey]
