The Series 6 ranges from 19- to 55-inches, while the Series 7 is comprised of just a 40-, 46- and 52-inch model, and the latter three (along with '09 Series 6 650 40-inch and above) sets feature the Yahoo!-driven Internet@TV functionality. Furthermore, the Series 7 is Sammy's first ever 240Hz CCFL-backlit display, while all Series 6 sets 32-inches and up tout the 120Hz Auto Motion Plus technology. All the nitty-gritty details (save for pricing and availability) are tucked away in the read link.
