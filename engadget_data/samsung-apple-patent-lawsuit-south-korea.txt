While it decided that Apple had infringed on two Samsung patents, it also found that Samsung had returned the favor on Apple's "bounceback" design patent, but not on another regarding icon design resulting in damages of about $22,000 Samsung. That's according to WSJ's Evan Ramstad, who also reports that other than the light financial slap on the wrist, the ruling means that the infringing products can no longer be sold in South Korea. The list of affected hardware includes mostly previous gen products like the iPhone 4 and iPad 2, as well as the Galaxy Tab 10.1, Galaxy S II and Galaxy Nexus. Asia Economic indicates the two patents Apple was found to have infringed are of the much-disputed standards-essential type relating to the transmission of data. This action doesn't appear to significantly tilt the battlefield in any particular direction, so we'll continue to keep an eye on the jury deliberating in California.
