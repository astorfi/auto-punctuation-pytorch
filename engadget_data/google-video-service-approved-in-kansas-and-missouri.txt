Missouri's Public Service Commission gave Big G the thumbs up on March 1st, and Kansas' Corporation Commission followed suit last Friday, meaning Google now has the green light to provide video services to residents on either side of the state line. Of course, the folks in Mountain View haven't committed to taking down the cable companies just yet, but these approvals put the necessary franchise licensing in place for them to do so if they choose. Comcast, Cox, Time Warner... your newest competitor has arrived.
