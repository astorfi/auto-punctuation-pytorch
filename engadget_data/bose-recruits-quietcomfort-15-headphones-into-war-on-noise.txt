The Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling (still with us?) cans are out today, accompanied by an official press release loaded with an impressive array of vague improvements. There's a new "proprietary acoustic design" for passive noise cancellation, "more sophisticated proprietary electronics" for the active stuff and a "new proprietary ear cushion." Clearly, Bose wants you to know its stuff is uniquely awesome, but of course the one way to know for sure is to go test them out for yourself. Your nearest purveyor of audiophile equipment should have them already, and he should let you have a pair for $299.
