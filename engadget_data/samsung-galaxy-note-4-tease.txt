It's that time of year again: smartphone-reveal-event season, and Samsung is holding one next month, in three cities, simultaneously. A recent invite sent to the press, embedded after the break, asked us to "note the date" of September 3rd on our calendars for a product unveiling in New York. It's the latest in the Korean outfit's series of Unpacked events, and it's happening just a few days before Apple's supposed product reveal. Given the cheeky wording of the email, we'd suspect it's pertaining to the Galaxy Note 4 (it's almost assuredly about the Note 4). Whatever it may or may not end up being, though, you can rest assured that we'll be there covering it live just for you.
