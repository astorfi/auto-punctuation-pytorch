All of the devices will be shipping with Android 2.1 out of the gate, so considering that Froyo's already launched, we're sure there'll be no shortage of pressure to get the updates fast-tracked. Sprint says it won't be a long wait on the Epic, but otherwise, we don't have any time frames at this point.
