 In today'smarket you can just give the fine people at LoudEye a ring andhave them whip you up a nice PlaysForSure online musicstore branded with your logo and copy, filled with all the latest chartbusters. And we're not sure if that's whatAmazon's actually up to, but according to the Wall Street Journal they're apparently in "advanced talks" withfour global music companies about setting up shop with their own iTunes Music Store competitor -- one supposedly to bebuilt to be used with originally designed Amazon-branded audio players that would come preloaded with tracks and havediscounted bundle packages for Amazon's music subscription service (yes, it's fair to say this is going to be YAPFSS --yet another PlaysForSure service). But being Amazon, they could also be liable to take advantage of their more brickand mortar than Napster online storefront and offer discounted CD prices to subscribers of their service, which theWSJ notes could all be launched as early as summer.
