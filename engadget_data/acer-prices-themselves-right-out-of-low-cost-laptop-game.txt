 Acer's little low-cost laptop plans just emerged from the rumor closet. Chairman J.T. Wang says they'll launch a cheap-o, 7- to 9-inch laptop in Q2 or Q3 of 2008. That puts the world's number 3 computer maker in direct competition with the Eee PC and CloudBook in the burgeoning low-end laptop market. However, Acer should really re-think their expected price point of "around $470." After all, Dell's full, 15.4-inch laptops start at just $499.
