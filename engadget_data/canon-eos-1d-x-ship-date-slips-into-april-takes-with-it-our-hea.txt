  Bad news camera aficionados, Canon's confirmed its mother of all cameras, the EOS-1D X, won't ship until the "end of April." Depending on how one counts, that's a lag of a month or two from its previously estimated "March" arrival. Unfortunate, as we were looking forward to it going tête-à-tête with its equally impressive crosstown rival from Nikon, which will nonchalantly make its March due date. On the bright side, though, now you've got ever more time to scrounge up the necessary $6,800 to purchase Canon's offering, in addition to re-reading our hands-on ad nauseum. Go on, you supply the clicks and we'll bring the tissues.
