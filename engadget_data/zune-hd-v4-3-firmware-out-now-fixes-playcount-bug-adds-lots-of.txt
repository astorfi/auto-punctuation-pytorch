Just days after countless owners went berserk over a playcount syncing issue, Microsoft has released a new firmware update that not only solves that very quandary but also adds a gaggle of fantastic new and / or improved features. The v4.3 update is available now by selecting "Player Update" from within the device itself, and with it will come "support for upcoming 3d games and applications, as well as an auto-suggest feature for better text input, and other minor improvements." We're hearing that those "minor improvements" include a snappier browser, so it's pretty safe to say you're only harming yourself if you don't get this download going right now. (Psst... there's a vid of the new software running after the break.)
