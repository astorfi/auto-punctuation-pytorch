Check out the intro above for a recap of the basics -- it ran during the last Engadget Show as part of our interview with Columbia law professor and noted net neutrality advocate Tim Wu. Then, head after the break for both cuts of the interview -- the edited piece that aired with the show and the uncut half-hour version. If you've got the time we highly recommend the full-flavor edition -- it's seriously interesting stuff, and Tim's not afraid to speak his mind on one of the most important tech issues of our time.

Update: And here's a downloadable copy, for those who were asking.
