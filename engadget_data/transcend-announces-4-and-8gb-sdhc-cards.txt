 Sure, it's not the first first 8GB SDHC card, but Transcend's is the, uh, second. Really, that's about all we can tell you about this class 2 card which, like their 4GB SDHC card also announced, means you'll get a guaranteed minimum data transfer rate of just 2MB/sec compared to Pretec's 8GB SDHC which touts access speeds up to 20MB/sec. Sorry no ship date or pricing information at this time but the Pretec is shipping this quarter for $299 if that's any consolation. [Via Impress]
