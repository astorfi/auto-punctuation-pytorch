Well, looks like Philips is hitting up the busybody's audio player scene once more with
Nike-less sports players; they also threw in
PlaysForSure WMA, an integrated stopwatch, FM tuner, and even voice-feedback through the phones for good measure.
Expect 'em shortly with a $199 pricetag on the 4GB MicroDrive-based player, and $120 on the 512MB flash PSA232.
