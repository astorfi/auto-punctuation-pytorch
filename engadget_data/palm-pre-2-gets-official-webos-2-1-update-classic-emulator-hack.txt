The new update's been posted with support for the Touchstone's Exhibition mode, Voice Dial, and a plethora of updates to existing apps throughout the system (interestingly, the unlocked Pre 2 seems to have the Rogers model's update information, but we're pretty sure it makes no difference).

On a related note, remember Classic? The old-school Palm OS emulator for webOS was so neat back during the Pre's introduction that Palm worked closely with the developer to get it supported and available -- but when webOS 2.0 happened, Palm dropped the emulator like a hot potato by removing critical stuff from the platform's updated libraries. Well, with some sweat, blood, and a whole lot of elbow grease, it appears that PreCentral forum members have somehow managed to get Classic working on webOS 2.1 once again -- and you can, too, with a ten-step procedure. It feels like Palm OS is becoming more of a vintage novelty than a mission-critical platform by the day, but hey, we can understand the sentimental value.
