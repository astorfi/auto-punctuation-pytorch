 DISH Network's Q1 wasn't anything to be proud of, and unfortunately for the satcaster, it seems that Q2 isn't much better. After suffering a 90% drop in subscriber growth during the first of the year, DISH's Q2 earnings report highlights an approximate loss of 25,000 net subscribers during the quarter ended June 30, 2008. Granted, it still has just south of 14 million customers hanging tight, so don't go crying over its misfortunes or anything. Furthermore, it still managed to increase total revenue by 5.6% (from $2.76 billion to $2.91 billion) year-over-year. The real question is what will happen in the second half of the year now that both it and DirecTV are clearly aiming to one-up each other at every possible turn. Ah, satellite drama.
