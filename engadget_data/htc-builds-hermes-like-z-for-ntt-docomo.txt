HTC and NTT DoCoMo have teamed up to put together the "HTC Z," a Windows Mobile 5 Pocket PC with rather obvious Hermes roots. The FOMA-compliant handset shares all of the Hermes' critical stats -- right down to the secondary cam for video calling -- and sports a Japanese cut of Windows Mobile to make things easy on the home crowd. Okay, so maybe you're thinking "at least we get our Hermes first." Not even: the Z allegedly drops in late July, so unless you're one of the lucky few, it looks like NTT's got you beat every which way. Typical.
