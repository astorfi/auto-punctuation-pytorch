 It certainly took a little longer than Photosynth fanatics had hoped, but Microsoft's highly-rated application is available on Windows Phone 8 at long last. Just as we'd heard, Photosynth will seamlessly integrate with the WP8 Lens, allowing users to easily launch the panorama features without having to leave the main shooting interface. In addition, Microsoft gave the app a couple more boosts, including the ability to quickly adjust to different lighting scenarios thanks to more white balance and exposure locking controls, as well as making it easier to view Photosynths your dear friends would like you to see via Twitter, Facebook or email. Eager to give it a go? Then look no further than the source link to see what the Mango crowd has been enjoying for months.
