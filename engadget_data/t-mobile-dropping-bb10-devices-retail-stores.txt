The bad news for BlackBerry just keeps on coming; two days after the company entered a buyout agreement, it's confirmed that T-Mobile will no longer sell BlackBerry devices in its brick-and-mortar stores. We'd heard as much earlier this month when rumblings hit the Crackberry forums, but additional confirmation came today, with one T-Mobile employee reporting: "My manager told me...that all BlackBerry 10 devices will now only be available via direct ship."


It's hardly a surprise that the carrier would be pulling the plug -- lackluster sales of BB10 devices contributed to an expected net operating loss of more than $950 million in Q2. Still, one additional nail in the coffin's gotta hurt for the (former) Canadian phone maker.
