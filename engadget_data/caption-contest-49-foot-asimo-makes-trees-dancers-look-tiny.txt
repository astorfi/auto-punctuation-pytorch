Thomas: "Dance I said! Dance!"Chris: "Hey, did we remember to fix that bug where he falls down stairs?"Joe: "Where's Arthur Murray when we need him the most?"Darren: "Wait, Dancing With The Stars said what? No pimp canes? That's a deal-breaker."Paul: "In his musical debut, 'ASIMO Takes the Stairs,' the eponymous star provides a surprisingly self-deprecating reenactment of the moments leading up to his infamous tumble. Music by Elton John."Nilay: "Not to be outdone, iRobot later sucked the entire city of Pasadena into a football field-sized Roomba."Don: "After years of toiling away at two-bit trade shows, ASIMO finally realized his dream project: Mr. Peanut: The Musical."Ross: "Having been turned down by both Ultrazoid and Voltron, the giant ASIMO checked his RAM for a dance number he could do solo."Josh T.: "Moments later, running ASIMO's 'Jazz Hands' script sent dancers flying hundreds of feet to their grizzly deaths."Josh F.: "I'm crushing your head! I'm crushing your head!"Cesar (from Zune): "I for one welcome our inflatable robot overlords. With a dance!"
