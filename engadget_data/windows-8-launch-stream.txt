You may not be able to join in on the fun in person, but we've got this handy stream beyond the break should you wish to play along virtually, and it's starting any minute.

 Update: Some folks are having issues with the primary stream, and if you're one of those folks, you may wanna redirect your browser here for an alternative feed.

 Update 2: The stream is back, this time with a focus on the Surface RT. Follow along below!
