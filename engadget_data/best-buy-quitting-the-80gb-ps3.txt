If the report is true, this means Best Buy will only have the 40GB PS3 on offer, and zero PS3s with any sort of PS2 backwards compatibility -- just like all of Japan. There's obviously no indication at this point if this has anything to do with the upcoming white PS3, or the vague -- and Sony discounted -- rumors of a $299 PS3 model, but we'll be keeping our eyes open.
