 We already had a hunch that ESPN's 24-hour news channel wouldn't be making the leap to HD until next year, but any hopes of it launching sooner have apparently been dashed. Reportedly, ESPN has "already signed carriage deals for ESPNews HD with DirecTV, Comcast and Time Warner Cable (partly owned by Time Warner, parent company of AOL, which owns Engadget), according to network executives." When it finally goes live at the "beginning in March 2008," it will become the third ESPN network to be available in an HD flavor. It's stated that the channel will feature "an innovative HD sideline graphic which will wrap around the top left and bottom of the HD screen" to offer up news and statistics in a format tailored for high-definition displays. March can't come soon enough.
