 They're not exactly telling us anything more about Dell's 2407WFP than we expected would be coming from the 2405FPW's successor (usual 24-incher specs: 1920 x 1200, additionof HDCP, 500 cd/m2 brightness, 1000:1 contrast ratio, 6ms response time, 4-in-1 card reader, etc.), but we're gonna bea little less than enthused if this thing goes in America for what they're asking in Japan: ¥157,500 -- about$1,400 US. Of course, domestic product prices gone foreign typically get inflated, we know, but it's a kind ofinauspicious way to first hear about a products we've been looking forward to, ourselves. Oh, and sorry about that thumbnail, it's really the best we could dig up from Dell Japan's site. Just envision that 2007WFP, just a little taller and wider,aight?[Thanks, Anders]
