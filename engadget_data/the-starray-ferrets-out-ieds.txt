TheSTARRAY, which apparently underwent extensive military testing with live ordnance late last year, is capable ofdetecting explosives between 40 seconds and 5 minutes (depending on quantity and distance) all the while handling harshterrain, crossing ditches, or climbing stairs. We don't think the STARRAY is autonomous (though we wish it were) sincethey mention it being a system mounted on a Northrop Grumman Andros Mark V rover. So how much does the bot withHiEnergy Atometer cost? $450,000, that's how much. If only they had one in Ravenna, Ohio.[Via Robot Gossip]
