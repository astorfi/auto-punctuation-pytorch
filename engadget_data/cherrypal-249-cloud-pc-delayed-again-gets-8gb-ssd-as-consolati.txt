In an apparent attempt to prevent a wave of cancellations, the company has also announced that the previous 4GB C100 model is being replaced with a new 8GB C114 model, and that all previous orders would be automatically upgraded to the new model free of charge. If you're ready to take the chance, you can get your order in at the link below.[Thanks, Simon K]
