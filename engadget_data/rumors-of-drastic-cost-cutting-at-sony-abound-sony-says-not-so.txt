Any details beyond that are a bit light, it seems, but Sony is denying that any such plan exists, with a spokesperson saying simply that the company does "not plan to announce additional restructuring measures at this time." Not exactly a flat out denial, to be sure, and it certainly wouldn't be the first time that a company revised their layoff estimates this season.
