This week Xbox 360 owners have been able to download trailers and demos of some of the same games that they will be showing in LA. Yesterday I was able to download the demo for Test Drive Unlimited (which is not so unlimited, the demo has a 15 minute timer boooo!) and Lost Planet, as well as the trailers for a lot of other games, movies and apparently there will also be video straight from the E3 floor. If you don't have a 360, you can also get a hold of the high definition trailers from Xboxyde. To find out exactly what and when things are available, check out the Marketplace section of MajorNelson's website.We'll get back to you after Microsoft's pre-E3 showcase, in the meantime, check out live coverage at Joystiq.Today's XBLM releases:Game Trailers:Call Of DutyCuldcept SAGAHitman: Blood MoneyLost Planet Extreme Condition Marvel: Ultimate AllianceNBA 2K7Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis Tony Hawk's Project 8Demo:Lost PlanetAs just announced during Microsoft's presentation THE HALO 3 TRAILER IS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD ON XBOX LIVE.
