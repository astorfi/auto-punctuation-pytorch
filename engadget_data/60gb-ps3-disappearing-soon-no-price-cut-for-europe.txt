That's according to SCEE President David Reeves, who told GamesIndustry.biz that Sony would no longer be offering the 60GB PS3 in the US once the existing stock runs out -- something he expects to happen "by the end of July." What's more, Sony also revealed that the 60GB PS3 would not be getting a price cut in Europe, but would be getting a new bundle with two games and two controllers for no added cost -- still no word on an 80GB PS3 for Europe though.Update: Turns out it was all a misunderstanding, and Sony is indeed going to keep the $499 60 gigger going in the US.Read - GamesIndustry.biz, "No more 60GB PlayStation 3 in US after July, says Reeves"Read - BBC News, "No price cut for Europe"
