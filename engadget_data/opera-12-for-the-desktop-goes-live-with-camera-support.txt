 Version 12 of Opera's desktop browser has been in beta for some time, but today it's making the step up to a full release for Macs and PCs. Along with hardware acceleration, speed improvements and an overhauled security badge, the update includes new browser skins (some 100 themes are available). One of the biggest tweaks, however, is the addition of camera support -- Opera 12 lets your webcam work with web applications, including an Asteroids-style game called FaceKat and Photo Booth.
