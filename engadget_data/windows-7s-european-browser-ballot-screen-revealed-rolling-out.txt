Users who have Internet Explorer as their default browser (meaning none of the savvy Engadget readers) will be alerted that there is "an important choice to make" and directed to the above decision making assistant. We actually think the randomized order of the top five browsers makes a ton of sense, and would express some cautious optimism that the ballot screen could really do its job of informing people of the alternatives out there. Users in the UK, Belgium and France will get to try it out next week, and a phased rollout will begin across Europe on March 1.
