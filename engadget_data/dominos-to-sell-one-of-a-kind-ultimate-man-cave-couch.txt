"The Ultimate Man Cave Couch" is something we'd imagine seeing in Hammacher Schlemmer or Neiman Marcus around the
holidays, but instead the one-of-a-kind, $30,000 shrine to sloth is available exclusively from Domino's Pizza.
Apparently 500 people (read: lazy pizza addicts) were surveyed about what features they would include in the "ultimate"
couch, and instead of incorporating only the best ideas, the designers seem to have slapped on each and every
suggestion. Case in point: the beyond-tacky paper towel rolls that double as headrests, because we all know that the
best way to remove pizza sauce from your muscle-shirt is with hair gel-coated towels. Other outlandish features of this
Domino's, NASCAR, and Coke-branded monstrosity include two swiveling LCD screens, DVD player, Xbox (OG, not 360), MP3
player, XM radio with one year of service, Nextel cellphone, mini-fridge, and two embedded Domino's HeatWave bags. Also
part of the package are a Kodak camera for time-lapse capturing the inevitable weight gain of the owner, and a year's
supply of Old Spice products to save those annoying and strenuous trips to the shower. The first idiot lucky
caller who gets through to the toll-free number between 12PM and 2PM on December 14th not only gets to sully their
living room and reputation with this beast, but also gets to shell out at least $5000 more for the privilege of having
it delivered.
