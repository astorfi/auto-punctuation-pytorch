Acer and ZTE both have models on tap, as does Fujitsu -- which slathered its mobile in pink and gave it a waterproof seal. The biggest news though was Samsung. Microsoft pulled out what is believed to be the SGH-i937, a version of the Galaxy S II that sports the Redmond mobile OS instead of Android. From the screen cap above it appears as if the phone is sporting a front-facing camera, something that has been missing from WP7 handset until now and is rumored to be supported in Mango. It's only a brief glimpse but you can catch it in the video after the break.
