When we told you all about the new Panasonic 152-inch 4k 3D plasma we were totally guessing about just how big it would look in real life. So of course we all had to head over to the Panasonic booth and pose for shots (there's a few more shots after the break) to get an idea of just how big it is. As you can see the thing is just massive and while we'd love to have one of these, even if we could afford to buy it, it is very unlikely it'd fit in our living room. We're sure you agree when we say that those silly little details won't get in the way of our dreams.
