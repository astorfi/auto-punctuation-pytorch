Welcome to the drama, the dilemmas, the sheer disbelief involved in picking accessories to go with your new iPhone. (Yes, an official 30-pin to Lightning adapter really costs that much). We can't promise to make the choices easy, but we can at least give you a glimpse of some of the bumpers and functional extras that Apple has revealed today, and link you up to the relevant pages on Apple's store (see the Source links below).


Starting with the iPhone 5c, it's "unapologetically" plastic to start with, of course, but you can give it extra protection with an additional, colorful mesh-style plastic case. This costs $29 and comes in the same five colors as the phone itself, so you can either match the phone or mix it up with a secondary color. There's also a black option if you want to tone things down a bit. One more thing: the iPhone 5c gets it's own Lightning dock, which comes in plain white and costs $29.


Next up: the iPhone 5s, which comes in very different color options -- silver, grey or gold -- and therefore gets a different set of bumper colors. These cost $49 $39 (correction: $49 is solely for the special (RED) charity case, regular cases are $39), they're made of leather on the outside and protective microfiber on the inside, and come in softer colors that are a bit tricky to describe (not least because this writer is red-green color blind): some kinda yellow, some kinda peach, some kinda... or just look at the image after the break. Lastly, Apple's website lists a $29 iPhone 5s dock too, which is cross-compatible with the regular iPhone 5.
