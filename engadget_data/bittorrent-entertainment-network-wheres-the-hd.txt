       The BitTorrent Entertainment Network just launched, and while the press release touts content form an impressive number of content partners, it only notes 40 hours of HD programming currently available. A quick look at the BitTorrent page shows our friends mariposaHD and a few documentaries from Voom. Meanwhile Superman Returns, Beerfest and Crank are only available in standard definition formats. Many of these titles are already available in HDTV formats via the Xbox Live Video Marketplace or other -- less legitimate -- torrent sources. The technology would seem to lend itself to moving large HD-quality files around easily, despite the movies being limited to DRM-restricted rentals, but so far they seem to be missing the kind of content we're looking for.
