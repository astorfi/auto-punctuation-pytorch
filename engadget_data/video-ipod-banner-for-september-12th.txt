But this banner, supposedly taken at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater in San Francisco for the event intended this Tuesday the 12th, pretty clearly depicts what appears to be the touchscreen (true) video iPod -- that is, if it's real. Of course, we can confirm nor deny anything, but obviously the churning machine that is the Apple rumor mill right now should not be discounted, friends. Two days until we all find out!
