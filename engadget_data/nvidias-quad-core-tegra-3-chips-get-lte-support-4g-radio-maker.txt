  After yesterday's clarification that Tegra 3's architecture will now be known as 4-PLUS-1, NVIDIA's got something a little meatier to share. The outfit just announced that its quad-core chips are getting LTE support, with modem makers GCT and Renesas pledging support right off the bat. In a way, it's hard to believe Tegra 3 didn't already support 4G officially, given that the chip was detailed a whole five months ago. In any case, these partnerships feel somewhat transitional, given that NVIDIA's "Project Grey" Tegra chips will get integrated, NVIDIA-made modems in 2013, though it might be an exaggeration to say these current partnerships will be moot then. In the meantime, we'd love to get our hands on some quad-core, LTE handsets, but something tells us we'll get our fill in Barcelona.
