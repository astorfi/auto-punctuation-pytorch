At last, that cute puppy video you saw on Facebook won't have to stay on Facebook. The internet giant has announced an embeddable player that lets you put that adorable clip on other websites. There's not much magic to it -- all you do is copy and paste code and drop it into your blog or forum post. It's a simple addition, but it'll help a lot if you'd rather not track down a video on other services (or re-upload it yourself) just to share it with the rest of the world.




Now that Facebook's juicing up its video offerings, should YouTube be worried?
