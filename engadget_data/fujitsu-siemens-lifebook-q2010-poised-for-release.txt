That's right, the $5,000 Fujitsu-Siemens Lifebook Q2010 -- yes, the one with HSDPA and that snazzy piano black finish -- is a little over two weeks from seeing the light of day, according to a rather uninspired "teaser" site recently posted by the company. Besides the inclusion of wireless 3.5G networking and a fashionable exterior, however, it's still not clear what makes this machine so desirable; for our five grand, we're hoping to see something like AMD's "4 x 4" platform packing four GPUs and two dual-core processors into this hot little 2.2-pound ultraportable -- is that really asking too much?[Thanks, wolwol]
