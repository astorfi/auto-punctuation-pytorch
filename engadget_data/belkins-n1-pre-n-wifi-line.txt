Say hello to their N1 line of gear based on Atheros XSPANchipsets, which come in the form of a $99.99 PC card (sorry, no ExpressCard yet), $119.99 PCI card with antennae(F5D8001), USB adapter (F5D8051) later this year, and pleasantly affordable $149.99 router (F5D8231-4). Of course,we're making no claims whatsoever that you should run out and grab these if it's 300Mbps wireless you're after; but ifyou're ready to take the plunge these could be as good as any, and seem to stand an equal chance of actually beingcompliant with 802.11n when it's approved by the IEEE some time in 2015.
