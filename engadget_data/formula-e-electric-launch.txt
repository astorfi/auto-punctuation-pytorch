Sure, we've already heard about Formula E's car being tested and detailed as it progresses towards its inaugural season, we haven't yet had opportunity to get cozy-like. The fledgling race series chose Las Vegas and CES 2014 to give the public its first proper demo and peek at the car and we simply couldn't miss the chance. As a primer, if you've missed the other announcements, the SRT_01E is an all-electric car producing 200kW -- that's roughly 270 HP -- with the motor, gearbox and electrics designed by McLaren, batteries and management systems by Williams, tires by Michelin, monocoque chassis by Dallara and all integrated by Renault.


So what do we think? Well, with the shopping list of F1 teams above how could it not be fantastic? Of course, the proof will be in the sport's uptake as it starts its maiden season next fall. In the interim, have a listen as the car does donuts in Lucas di Grassi's -- wearing a helmet with a very similar design to his Formula 1 days -- capable hands in a parking lot in beautiful Las Vegas.
