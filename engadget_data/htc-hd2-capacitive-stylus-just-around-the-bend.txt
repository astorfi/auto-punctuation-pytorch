If UK e-tailer Clove is to be believed, one of those very devices will soon be shipping for the wide-faced HD2, though little else about the product is known. In fact, we're told that "price, specification and availability" are still being confirmed, although a preliminary asking price of Â£15 ($25) is posted. So, anyone already getting hot and bothered just waiting for this, or what?
