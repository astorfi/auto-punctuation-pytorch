 We've been hearing that Matsushita was jonesing to become Panasonic for months now, but at long last, the company (companies?) has finally pulled the trigger. As of October 2008, Matsushita Electric Industrial Company has become Panasonic Corporation, and its stock ticker symbol on the NYSE has been changed from MC to PC. Additionally, Panny is working on "brand changeover from National to Panasonic within Japan," which probably won't be completed until March of 2010. So yeah, Matsushita's logo actually isn't going anywhere just yet, but we appreciate the effort, guys.
