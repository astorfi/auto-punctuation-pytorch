The 10-inch machine ain't too different than the other alternatives out there -- save for the N280 processor, which will never show its true potential without a GN40 chipset riding shotgun. At any rate, early impressions of the machine have been rather positive, with onlookers digging the design and the chiclet-style keyboard. Personally, we're a bit bored from afar, but hit the read link to have a look and make a judgment of your own.
