Anyway, you're looking at what's scheduled to be the world's first projector phone from ChinaKing (aka, CKing). The bits of information we scraped off the machine translated text reveals an LCoS-based projector that relies upon a LED light source and manual focus adjustment. This brick (and we mean brick) is supposedly capable of projecting a 30-inch, 640 x 480 pixel image for up to 2-hours at a time. 2-hours you say, not possible! Perhaps you forgot about the 666 day battery. Nah. A couple more pics after the break.
