According to some extracts obtained by Pocketables, a silver WiFi-only Tab will be available for $499.99 (a buck more than its WiFi-only iPad rival). Best Buy will also be selling a black 3G model (Verizon) and silver 3G model (Sprint) with contract or month-to-month plans. The "and up" verbiage is probably a hat tip to the $599.99 on-contract price that Verizon announced for the 3G Galaxy Tab it will begin selling on November 11th. Unfortunately, no date was revealed for the Best Buy offerings but a second rumor sourced from an inventory spreadsheet (pictured after the break) by the cats over at AndroidCentral has the Verizon Tab coming to Sprint on November 14th. In other words, it's safe to expect Best Buy to start selling Samsung's 7-inch Android tablet in November in the run-up to the holidays. See a screengrab of that after the break.

Update: As noted in the comments, the Galaxy Tab doesn't ship with a 7-inch Super AMOLED display -- it's Super TFT LCD. We suspect that's a printing error and not a hint of things to come.

Update 2: Sprint confirms
