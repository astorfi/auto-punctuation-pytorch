Let's say you're excited about the Xbox One... so excited, in fact, that you're okay with spending $499 on it before you've even touched the gamepad. Microsoft wants to accommodate you: buy a system quickly enough and you'll get the limited Day One Edition. While the core system won't change, you'll get to flaunt your early adopter status through both a slightly customized controller and a special Xbox Live achievement. Microsoft is also offering a matching (though separate) Xbox Live 12-month Gold pass that bundles an exclusive Killer Instinct character. If those rarities are enough to encourage an early purchase, you can reserve one through Microsoft and other retailers. Let's just hope that there aren't too many launch day quirks.
