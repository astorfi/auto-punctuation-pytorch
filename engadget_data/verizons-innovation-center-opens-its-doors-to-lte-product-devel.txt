Despite rival AT&T's February launch of a similar R&D space in Texas, Verizon's cutting its first big red bow on the two years in the making Innovation Center. Located just outside Boston, the Waltham, Massachusetts-based labs began churning out LTE-friendly products in October of 2009, developing 30+ products to date. While most of these may never ride along the borderline blazing speeds of real-world LTE, the environment does give small startups a leg-up in a collaborative, deep-pocketed space (insert emphasis here). The research center also does double duty for the operator's bottom line, offering its Verizon Ventures group first dibs on investment opportunities -- like it did with Nomad Innovation's LiveEdge TV product. Construction on a second mobile applications-focused facility is already underway in San Francisco with its very own opening ceremony slated for late summer. We're glad to see Verizon spreading the bills to spur tech forward, but there's one major thing the carrier forgot -- an emergency room wing for all its crapware-bloated products. Official PR after the break.

The 1.5 pound unit attaches to cameras and provides real-time, high-definition video and audio for broadcast, cable or the Web. LiveEdge offers broadcasters, the military or emergency personnel a two-way audio/video/data connection between personnel in the field and a studio or command center. Live events can be covered without deploying expensive microwave, satellite or production units. The technology company is based in Louisville, Ky., and will have its products commercially available later this year.

Andrej Todosic, vice president technology at TouchTunes, spoke at opening day.		VGo: VGo has been working with the innovation center to provide the convenience of 4G LTE to its robotic telepresence product line. Tim Root, chief technology officer and founder, spoke about how people can establish their presence in a distant location such that they can interact and perform their job in ways not previously possible. VGo allows an individual to see, hear, interact and independently move around in any remote site-enabling anyone to be anywhere. VGo's industry-leading solution reduces costs while improving productivity for remote workers, health care providers and homebound students. With 4G LTE technology, VGo's telepresence robots will benefit from a wider operational range, no longer relying on established Wi-Fi networks, thus enabling deployment to a greater variety of businesses and locations while simplifying connectivity and setup considerations. 		The products discussed are among the more than 30 that have been developed and demonstrated in the new building as well as at industry trade shows, customer meetings and other venues. 		Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson are founding participants in the Innovation Center. Engineers and other subject matter experts work side by side with Verizon engineers on projects generated within the Innovation Center's labs, and each company has a permanent display highlighting 4G LTE technology and solutions for visitors to experience on the main floor of the building.
