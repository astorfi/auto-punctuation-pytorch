Welcome to IRL, an ongoing feature where we talk about the gadgets, apps and toys we're using in real life and take a second look at products that already got the formal review treatment.


Can't bring yourself to spend $300-plus on a leather camera bag? Get a $130 one made out of Neoprene, says Darren. (And he should know: he's tested just about all of them by now.) As for Edgar, he's not recommending you buy anything, per se; he just wants you to know how much he loves FIFA 13.




UNDFIND One camera bagGiven that a) I'm on the road a lot and b) my wife is the world's greatest photographer, I tend to end up testing a staggering amount of bags. For photographers with an enviable budget, there's really no match for one of Ona Bags' offerings. But for those looking for something a touch smaller (and more affordable), I think I've stumbled onto a new favorite: UNDFIND.

These bags are built by a photographer, for photographers. In fact, it's the same guy behind the formidable SLRLounge, a site that produces excellent how-to videos and tutorials. The latest in the bunch, the One Bag, is a real standout. I tested the $110 10-inch model (great for an iPad, two to three lenses and a few accessories) as well as the $130 13-inch model (which works excellently with a MacBook Air, as it turns out). Both are made of a stretchy Neoprene material, with the larger of the two being my favorite. It's capable of holding a laptop, three to five lenses and a mid-range DSLR body, but it's the details that have made the greatest impression.
