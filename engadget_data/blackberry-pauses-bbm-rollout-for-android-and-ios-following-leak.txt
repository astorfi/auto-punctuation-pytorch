We hope you weren't scheduling your weekend around the launch of BBM for Android and iOS, as BlackBerry has paused the rollout following a leak of the Android version. There were too many simultaneous users, the company says; with over 1.1 million active clients in the first eight hours, the messaging service just wasn't ready to handle the load. There's no mention of when the BBM deployment will continue, although BlackBerry is disabling the unofficial Android build to prevent future problems. Unless you grabbed BBM's iOS version in the first several hours, you'll just have to be patient.
