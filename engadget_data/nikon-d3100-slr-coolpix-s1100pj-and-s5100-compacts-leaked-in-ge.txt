The D3100 is obviously the main attraction -- it has a 14 megapixel sensor with up to ISO 12800 sensitivity, a new 1080p video mode, and an improved processor and autofocus system, for a body-only price of â‚¬650 ($831). Not bad -- although we don't know if it has that rumored continuous autofocus mode for video yet. We don't know nearly as much about the new Coolpix S1100pj, except that it'll retain the projector from the S1000pj, come in colors and add a touchscreen and remote control the mix; the Coolpix S5100 is less of a mystery, with a 12 megapixel sensor and a 28-140mm zoom lens pegged in the magazine. Of course, none of this is officially official yet, but we'd imagine we'll be hearing more real soon -- stay tuned.
