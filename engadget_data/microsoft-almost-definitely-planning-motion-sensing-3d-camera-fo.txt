A breaking report has confirmed that Microsoft is indeed "developing a new videocamera for its Xbox 360 videogame console that will allow players to control games with the movement of their bodies," or at least that's the good word from the all-too-supposing "people familiar with the matter." It's noted that unlike Nintendo's Wii, the Microsoft camera won't require gamers to "hold any hardware in their hands to control in-game action," but in the same vein as The Big N, it seems as if the device will debut at E3 only to sit around in a lab for a year before shipping to consumers. Boo.[Thanks, Chuck]
