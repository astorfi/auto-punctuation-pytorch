 So you've put down an order for a new still or video camera with SDHC slot, eh, now what? Do you pick up a regular ol' 4GB SDHC card from Toshiba, Panasonic, or SanDisk or maybe splurge on a fat Pretec for 8GB or 16GB of storage? Well SanDisk is here to tell ya (and we'll agree) that their new Ultra II SDHC Card is the ideal choice to record smooth video or capture multiple still photographs in rapid succession from that new cam with write speeds of 9 megabytes (MB) per second and read speeds of 10MB/sec. Yeah, it'll cost you $220 for those speeds, but hey, you get a "free" MicroMate SDHC/SD card reader in the kit when these drop next month. So what's it gonna be boy -- performance, capacity or the el-cheapo? Decisions, decisions.
