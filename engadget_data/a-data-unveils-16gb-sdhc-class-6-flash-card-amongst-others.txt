Additionally, the firm is introducing an 8GB Super SDHC Duo (saywha?) card of the Class 4 variety, and for those still scouting a new CompactFlash card, it's cranking out a 32GB version for you. Regrettably, we've no idea how soon A-DATA plans to get these on the market (nor how much it plans to charge), but it shouldn't be long before we all find out.[Via ITNewsOnline]
