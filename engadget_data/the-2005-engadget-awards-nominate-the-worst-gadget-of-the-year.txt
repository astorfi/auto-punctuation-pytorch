 
It’s time for the 2005 Engadget Awards, and we’re askingfor your nominations for the Worst Gadget of the Year. Nominating is easy. Just leave a comment as younormally would with what you're nominating for this category (remember, comments must be validated!). You don’thave to include your reasons for nominating it or any of that stuff, just leaving the name is fine. Limityour nominations only to devices that were introduced and sold for the first time in 2005 (which means no conceptdevices or prototypes, though we will allow updated versions of previous products). Also, products onlyneed to be nominated once to be in the running, so if you’re planning on suggesting something, please make aquick scan to see if someone’s already beat you to it (i.e., please don't nominate anything more thanonce!). Thanks!
