 Oh Nintendo, did you really have to go and crush the dreams of so many homebrew faithful? Seems a Wii System Update released last night blocks new installations (existing installs are unaffected) of anything fakesigned like the Homebrew Channel. Perhaps the increased corporate vigilance comes in direct response to the very real threat posed by the Wii Backup Loader to run pirated Wii games. Regardless, this isn't the first time that homebrew developers have had to work around Nintendo's meddling. We'll let you know what they come up with -- until then, however, you might want to hold off on the IOS51 update if you're thinking of going homebrew anytime soon.[Thanks, Matthew P.]
