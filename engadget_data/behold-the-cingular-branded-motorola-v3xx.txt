With phones like the Samsung SYNC in Cingular's 3G arsenal, the V3xx won't be unique by the time it launches -- and it certainly won't be the first bearing HSDPA -- but hey, broadband data is still broadband data; we'll take what we can get and eat it up with grins on our faces. To be fair, with its meager 1.3 megapixel cam, the V3xx is a great choice for folks that want little more than a basic stylish (by 2004 standards) clamshell that can double as a rip-roarin' modem. Just keep it cheap, Cingular, and we can put our support behind this one. Follow the break to see 'er in the upright and locked position (hint: it looks pretty much like any other RAZR closed).
