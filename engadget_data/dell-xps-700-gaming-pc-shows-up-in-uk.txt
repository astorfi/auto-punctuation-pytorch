 If you've been hankering to get your hands on one of Dell's next-gen gaming boxes, but can't bring yourself to fork over $10,000 for one of the company's limited edition deals, you can now order a production model XPS 700 (which looks an awful lot like the "XPS Next Generation Gaming Desktop" that the company showed off at E3) from Dell's web site -- at least in the UK. The production XPS doesn't have quite the same specs as the limited edition models (sorry, no standard quad SLI on this one), but it does have dual-core Pentium processors at speeds of up to 3.8GHz, up to 2GB RAM, dual SLI, optional Aegia PhysX acceleration and up to 2TB storage. A base configuration with a Pentium D 930 at 3GHz, 1GB RAM, dual 256MB SLI graphics and a 250GB drive runs about Â£1,375, including VAT ($2,581). We assume that it will go for a bit less in the US, though we still expect Dell to charge a premium for those shiny blue LEDs.[Thanks, Gaurav]
