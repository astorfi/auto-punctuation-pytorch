The BDP4600 is sure to kick off an all new battle of "thin for thin's sake" amongst CE manufacturers, but honestly, given the emphasis on design or complete lack thereof on most Blu-ray hardware so far, this can't come a moment too soon. What does it do? Your guess is as good as ours, until Samsung decides to let loose with the specifications.
