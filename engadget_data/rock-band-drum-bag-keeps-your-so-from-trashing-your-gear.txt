Yes, it probably seemed like a splendid idea at the time, but as the days pass, chances are that other occupants (roommates, SOs, parents, androids, etc.) will grow increasingly frustrated with having to bypass it order to flip on the gas logs. Enter the Rock Band drum bag, which enables you to disassemble your kit, neatly tuck it within the bag's confines and slip it under the couch until your next "gig." Of course, we can easily think of solutions about $50 less expensive, but just how sweet is that official Rock Band logo to you? Click on through for a shot of the inside.[Via Joystiq]
