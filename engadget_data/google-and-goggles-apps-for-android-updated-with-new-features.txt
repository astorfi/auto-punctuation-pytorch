 It's time to stop ignoring that "updates available" notification and start enjoying some refreshed Google goodies on Android. You'll now be able to search posts and people from within the Google+ app, as well as add your +1 to photos and comments, see the 'online' and 'typing' status of your Messenger buddies, and upload videos and full-res photos. Meanwhile, Goggles now has a 'continuous mode' that can log multiple items without you having to fiddle with the shutter button, the ability to link straight to any online versions of hard-copy text, and also better crowdsourcing so users can add less well-known objects like toothpaste squeezers and Off the Hook shower heads to Google's ever-expanding database.
