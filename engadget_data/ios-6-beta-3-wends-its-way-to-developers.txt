As always, the attention is on mending bugs and bringing the code closer to what an everyday iPad, iPhone or iPod touch owner will see when all is said and done. Those of us regular users pining for Passbook will still have a number of reasons to wait awhile before we can get our own direct taste in the fall -- not the least of which is Apple's recent clampdown on bootleg access.

 Update: As MacRumors notes, this update also marks the beginning of the transition to iCloud.com email addresses.
