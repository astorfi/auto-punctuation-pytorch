Aside from the 1,920 x 1,080 resolution and 50,000:1 contrast ratio, this unit also features a 3LCD optical engine, 1,600 ANSI lumens, 12-bit video processing, a pair of HDMI 1.3 inputs, the firm's exclusive OptiCinema lens system / E-TORL lamp and a pearlescent finish nice enough to stare at. Best of all, this beast is not only available now, it's available for $2,799 after a $200 rebate. Yeah, we're diggin' the trend.
