Sure, a 105-inch curved, ultra-widescreen TV is LG's pride and joy at CES 2014, but it's also brought a handful of flat Ultra HD televisions along for the ride. We've just laid eyes on the 84-inch variant of the 4K (3,840 x 2,160) set and came away fairly satisfied. Sure, the LCD panel isn't nearly as vivid as an OLED one, but it still manages to handle itself adequately while keeping a thin profile. Hidden from sight is the "Tru-ULTRA HD Engine Pro" chip, which handles upscaling any SD, HD and "True HD" (read: 1080p) content. Around the back you'll find HDMI 2.0, USB and LAN inputs that will help pipe UHD content to the TV, which even supports h.264 and the fresh HEVC format. The set itself doesn't have an extravagant stand or frame as is often the case with UHD sets, but its sleek body and pair of thin, side-mounted speaker bars would look right at home in any (exceptionally large) entertainment center. Both a price tag and release date are MIA, so you'll have to wait a while before bringing this behemoth home. To lay eyes on the panel for yourself, check out the gallery below.
