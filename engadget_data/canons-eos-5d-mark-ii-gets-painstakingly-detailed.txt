Make no mistake, this bad boy is bringing all sorts of new and revamped technology to the game, and thanks to the good folks over at DPReview, you don't have to waste your day trying to piece it all together. Linked below is a 13-page "preview" that dishes out more details on the specs, changes, operation, design, menus and favorite date spots than you could ever fathom. Being the DSLR freak that you are, however, we know you've already ventured off and are onto page 2. No hard feelings, though.
