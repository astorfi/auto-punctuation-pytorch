We asked, and you delivered... a ton of nominations for your favorite products. We narrowed down your picks across 12 categories to the most popular choices, and they're now finalists for the Readers' Choice part of the 2013 Engadget Awards. Head past the break to weigh in -- you don't need to answer every question, but you're only allowed one pick per category. Voting will stay open until 11:59PM ET on Wednesday, March 19th. We'll give you a reminder or two before then, but why not just get to it now?
