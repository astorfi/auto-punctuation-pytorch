That brings with it an updated version of the Unity interface that includes features like a new alt + tab switcher and "Lenses" with some expanded functionality instead of the previous "Places" feature -- not to mention full support for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other script languages. Did we mention it also now has its own soundtrack? Head on past the break for a taste, and hit the source link below for a nifty web-based preview of the OS before you download.
