Abuse Pleo
Get Pleo wet
Throw, drop, or violently shake Pleo
Sit on Pleo
Place Pleo near heat or flames
Place Pleo in sand, soil, or mud
Leave Pleo with other pets or animals capable of biting or damaging him
Risk overheating Pleo by covering him with a blanket during play
Allow small children to play with Pleo unsupervised

So naturally we had to whip up our own supplemental list. We think you should never, EVER:

Let Pleo know where you keep the cash
Taunt happy fun Pleo
Let Pleo have more than two drinks
Divulge to Pleo Bush's famous secret family recipe for baked beans
Pretend that Pleo will love you back
Feed Pleo after midnight; get it wet
Attempt to housetrain Pleo by rubbing its nose in own e-xcrement
Call the cops, man, Pleo just needs a place to crash for the night
Punch Pleo, especially in the gut -- Pleo knows where you live
Let Pleo continuously check in and out of rehab
Remove skin, for this is the stuff of nightmares
Have Pleo spayed or neutered; Despite Bob Barker's incessant recommendations this will not stop the impending robot revolution

Leave your own below. Fear Pleo.
