 RIM products tend to have ultra-predictable launch cycles -- when Waterloo announces a new BlackBerry, odds are pretty great that your carrier's going to pick it up at some point, no matter what carrier that may be. So it goes with the Curve 3G and Pearl 3G; neither product is new, of course, but they're new to AT&T, which has just revealed that it'll be getting both this year. The Pearl seems like it'll probably be coming first, launching on October 17 for $149.99 on contract (in its 20-key flavor) with no rebate required; the Curve, meanwhile, slips in on a to-be-determined date "in time for the holidays" for $99.99 on contract, also sans rebate. Though no mention is made of upgradeability on the Pearl, the Curve is called out as being BlackBerry 6-ready -- RIM needs carrier buy-in to deploy these upgrades, so the fact that AT&T is saying it is notable. The Pearl's price seems way out of whack, but needless to say, we're sure some of the third-party resellers will be getting 'em out the door for a penny on contract within a few weeks. Follow the break for the press release.
