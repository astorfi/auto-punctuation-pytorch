During an analyst call today the outspoken head of HP's Personal System Group confirmed that it's sent more than 200 employees to work at Palm.... and then casually mentioned that HP will have "a webOS-powered PalmPad that will be set for release early in 2011." If you'll recall, HP filed for a trademark on PalmPad back in July, and it's been talking about tablets since it bought Palm in May, so we're thinking ol' Todd just let one slip. Now let's just hope all this "early 2011" talk means really early... like, say, CES.
