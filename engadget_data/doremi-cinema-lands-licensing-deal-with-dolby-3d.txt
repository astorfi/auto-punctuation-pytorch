 The all-too-cleverly named Doremi Cinema has reason to celebrate today after landing a swank licensing agreement with Dolby 3D. The outfit's DCP-2000 JPEG2000 Digital Cinema Server has been "approved as a licensee of Dolby 3D Digital Cinema, giving exhibitors even more options when screening 3D content." As it stands, Doremi's DCP-2000 servers are already installed in over 5,500 screens across the globe, and thanks to its interoperability, it ought to have no qualms with the third-dimension.
