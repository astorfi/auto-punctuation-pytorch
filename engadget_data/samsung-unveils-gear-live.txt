So the rumors were true: Samsung has revealed its first Android Wear-powered smartwatch, the Gear Live. The device mates a familiar, squared-off design (much like the Tizen-powered Gear 2) with Google's wrist-worn interface. It includes the Gear 2's 1.63-inch Super AMOLED screen, 300mAh battery and 4GB of storage; fitness gurus will be glad to hear that the heart rate monitor has also carried over. You'll get to pre-order both Gear Live and its LG-made counterpart, the G Watch, later today (update: you can pre-order here); Samsung's hardware will sell for $200 and ship on July 7th through Amazon, Best Buy and Google Play.
