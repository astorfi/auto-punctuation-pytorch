  Nah, 8,180MHz can't hold a candle to 500GHz, but on the long road of overclocking Intel's Pentium 4 where there is an increasingly brief amount of time available to brag before being trumped, the zany Italians have crowned themselves champs once more. Not content with just hitting 8GHz with a "Cedar Mill" Pentium 4 631, OC Team Italy managed to push that very model an additional 179MHz by tweaking the FSB. The final results yielded a 173-percent overclock, and while this here setup may run stable for a continued period if placed at the depths of Antarctica, we can't imagine this being too feasible for the common man to replicate and actually utilize.
