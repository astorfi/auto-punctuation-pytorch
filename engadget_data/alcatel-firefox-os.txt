It's been a year since we first got a glimpse of Firefox OS at MWC 2013, and unsurprisingly we're already seeing some more models show up once again in Barcelona. This time around, Alcatel is making a strong statement to Mozilla about its commitment level; the company's showing off a grand total of four devices, including a tablet concept. All still under the Fire brand, the trio of smartphones range from a budget-minded 3.5-inch device to a nicer quad-core model with 4.5-inch qHD display and LTE.


First, let's tackle the latter. The Fire S (which stands for 'speed') is the company's first Firefox device with LTE built-in, and while we're not looking at top-of-the-line specs here, they're certainly better than most we've seen on a smartphone bearing Mozilla's B2G project. The handset features OS 1.3, a 4.5-inch qHD display, 8MP rear camera with a 2MP front-facing cam, a quad-core 1.2GHz CPU and even NFC.


The other two in the trio aren't especially drool-worthy, but they're still notable for potential users in emerging markets -- obviously a rather large demographic for Mozilla. The Fire E (which stands for 'elegant') has the same 4.5-inch qHD display as the S, but it uses a dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 5MP rear camera and VGA front-facing cam. It also doesn't feature LTE, as the S does. The C (which stands for 'cost-conscious') has a 3.5-inch HVGA display, dual-core 1.2GHz processor, VGA camera and other basic goodies.





          
 
 
 Let's not forget the tablet. The model we looked at was merely a dummy concept, but reps wanted to show it off to emphasize that it's working on some sort of collaboration with Mozilla to put together a special tablet version of the OS. In its current state, it lists a 7-inch qHD display, dual-core 1.2GHz, VGA back and front cameras among its specs. If we do see something like this the market, it likely won't be until later this fall.
