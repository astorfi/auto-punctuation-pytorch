"An update to improve the Samsung Captivate's GPS performance is now available. Captivate customers will receive a notification on their device that an update is available and will simply need to download the file to update their phone. The updates will be pushed to customers' devices over the next few weeks.

The update for the Captivate will also improve additional device functions, such as media scanning time, add the full version of Quickoffice and address Microsoft Exchange 2003 policy support."
Awesome, right? Of course, the proof is in the pudding -- we'll need to wait and see how "fixed" the GPS really is after this gets installed, but it's a start. Notably, this doesn't seem to include Froyo, so we don't know whether these guys are going to be going the British or Spanish routes in getting that deployed.

Update: We've independently confirmed with AT&T that this update does include GPS improvements.
