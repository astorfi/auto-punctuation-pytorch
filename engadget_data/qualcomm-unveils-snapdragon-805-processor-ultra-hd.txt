If you're still enjoying that fresh Snapdragon 800 CPU, guess what? Qualcomm's just trumped it with a new model: the Snapdragon 805 'Ultra HD' quad-core processor. The most headline-grabbing feature is UltraHD video playback on your tablet, smartphone or Smart TV -- so you can finally watch that 4K video you recorded. To do that, it's packing the latest Adreno 420 GPU, which Qualcomm claims has as much as 40 percent more graphics horsepower than previous models. On top of that, the Krait 450 CPU's four cores will each run at up to 2.5GHz and communicate with memory at 25.6 GB/second max, to make all apps run faster.


The new processor will also come with the 28nm Gobi MDM9x25 modem announced earlier this year, in order to support LTE carrier aggregation (and the resulting higher speeds) and 150Mbps LTE 4. Another option will be a new LTE modem, the 20nm Gobi MDM9x35, which pairs with the WTR3925 chip to bring up to 300Mbps download speeds via LTE advanced. Qualcomm said that both chips support "all carrier aggregation band combinations approved by 3GPP" while enabling manufacturers to bring LTE devices to market faster. Finally, there's a new mobile camera processor that supports gigapixel throughput and gyro-based image stabilization, for smoother video recording and faster image processing. All of that will come in a package that consumes less power, according to Qualcomm, who added that owning a Snapdragon 805-equipped device will be like "having an UltraHD theater in your pocket." Don't sell that Galaxy Note 3 just yet, though -- Qualcomm said manufacturer sampling won't start until next year, meaning actual devices are still a ways off.
