 Remember back in May when we told you about the latest data transmission record of 2.56 terabits per second? Well, consider that yesterday's technology, because Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) just decimated it by announcing a successful new bandwidth record of 14 terabits per second over 160 kilometers (nearly 100 miles) of fiber optic cable. We still think that someone needs to do some research on why Japan always gets the coolest stuff fastest -- not to mention how they get the fastest stuff first.
