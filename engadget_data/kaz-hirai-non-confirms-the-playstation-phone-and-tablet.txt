In discussing Sony's future strategy for offering a coherent and extremely expansive consumer offering, he used the words "tablets," "smartphones" and "PlayStation" in the same sentence, whetting appetites but never taking the leap to confirm what we all pretty much know his company is working on:

Strategy encompasses driving the development of a variety of new strategic products and services including tablets currently in development as well as smartphones, all the while of course integrating the knowhow and the assets that we've accumulated from our PlaySation business.
Oh Kaz, just admit it.
