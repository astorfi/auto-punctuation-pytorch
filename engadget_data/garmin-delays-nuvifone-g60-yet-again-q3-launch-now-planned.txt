Well according to a recent report, plans to launch the device in the first half of 2009 have stalled, with the company stating that it will be pushing the window back towards something closer to Q3. President and COO Cliff Pemble expounded on the difficulties of building a smartphone from scratch during a conference call with analysts, noting "Smartphones are complicated and bringing one to market that's built totally from the ground up on a custom Linux platform is not an easy task." If you'll recall, the original announcement of the Nuvifone was way back in January of 2008, with a planned release in Q3 of that year -- placing this new launch a full 12 months out from the intended street date. We're all for competitors in this market, but it seems like maybe the folks at Garmin jumped the gun with all these dates they've been dropping on us -- missed launches don't exactly promote confidence.[Via PMP Today]
