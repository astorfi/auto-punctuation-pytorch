Apparently, the deal with Sharp would allow it to "secure enough panels to meet fast-growing LCD TV demand without heavy capital investments," and considering that Sharp is already planning to construct the world's largest LCD factory by 2010, we'd say this works out quite nicely for it, too. Needless to say, the global demand for all things LCD seems to be going nowhere but up, but here's to hoping those prices continue to head in the opposite direction for the consumers' sake.
