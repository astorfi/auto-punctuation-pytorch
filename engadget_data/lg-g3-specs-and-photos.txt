LG hasn't been particularly guarded about its G3 smartphone, but the latest leak, coming from an official company site, really lets it all hang out. We've already seen plenty of the phone, slated for launch tomorrow, but this is by far the most detailed and official glimpse we've seen thus far. As previously reported, the phone will contain a 5.5-inch QuadHD display. According to the leaked product page, the phone will also contain a 12MP rear camera with optical image stabilization, a removable 3,000mAh battery and wireless charging support, and what appears to be an intuitive new software program called "Smart Notice."





          
 
 
 While the full spec sheet is not available, the site does show a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor on board, though the specifics there are not clear. However, Droid Life reports the previously available spec sheet showed a Snapdragon 801 with 2GB or RAM. A spec sheet from LG UK, meanwhile, reveals the G3 will contain 16GB of on-board storage and support for up to 2TB of external storage via microSD cards. We'll have whatever details there are left to unveil tomorrow, but in the meantime, check out our source links and gallery for more.
