 You've had ample time to scope out the vastness that is RoboCup 2007, but the fourth day of competition brought a little something extra in the form of an uber-talented soccer bot. The machines, which look an awful lot like those entered by Team Osaka, took to the pitch in order to give onlookers something to cheer about, and the videoed matchup between the forward and fullback captured the midfield goal perfectly. Interestingly enough, it seems that the defender either lost his footing or fell victim to a vicious headbutt to the chest, but his demise allowed the calculating shooter to line up an exquisite shot to the corner of the net. Enough color commentary, hit the read link to catch it for yourself.[Thanks, Danish K.]
