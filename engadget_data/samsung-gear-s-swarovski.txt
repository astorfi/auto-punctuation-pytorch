Not far behind, Samsung now has the Gear S Strap, an accessory ready to pair to its just-announced (and again, just after LG) wearable. If you're a fan of Swarovski, you'll be glad to hear it uses the company's newest Crystal Fine Mesh which, according to Samsung, is apparently already being sprinkled upon "top brands in the fashion industry." And if you're not a fan, well, you're probably not remotely interested or even reading this. It'll be available in Samsung's flagship stores next month.
