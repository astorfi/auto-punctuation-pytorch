Nevertheless, Popcorn Hour's (apparently hard-to-get) Networked Media Tank / A-100 has been utilized for a month over at Networking Audio / Video's labs, and the take away is that it pretty much is just as impressive as expected. Aside from the lackluster interface and ho hum music playback, the unit appeared to perform admirably. BitTorrent integration was top shelf, video playback was impeccable and fetching content from nearly anywhere was a breeze. 'Course, we'd recommend poring over the review in its entirety before plunking down your $179, but things are certainly looking good from up top.
