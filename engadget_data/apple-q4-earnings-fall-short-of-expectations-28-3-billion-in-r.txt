It still managed to rake in $28.27 billion in revenue during the quarter -- up from $20.3 billion in Q4 2010 -- but that's quite a bit shy of the $29.6 billion or so analysts were counting on. Net profits came in at $6.62 billion, up considerably from the $4.3 billion seen in the same quarter last year, and Apple notes that it is indeed still a record quarter. In terms of products, the company announced that 17.07 million iPhones were sold in Q4 (a 21 percent jump from a year ago), along with 11.12 million iPads (a whopping 166 percent increase year-over-year), 4.89 million Macs (a 26 percent jump), and 6.62 million iPods (once again the one area that continues to decline, now down 27 percent from a year ago). Apple's cash pile on hand also continued to swell during the quarter, and now stands at around $84 billion. Press release is after the break.
