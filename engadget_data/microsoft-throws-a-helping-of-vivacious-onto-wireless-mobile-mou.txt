Microsoft's Wireless Mobile Mose 3500 family -- announced earlier this year as some of the most portable BlueTrack mice this planet has ever seen -- just gained three new vivid members, and each of 'em are on sale now at Best Buy for a penny under $30. If we had to guess, we'd say these are perfect for the KIN demographic. Hey, stereotypes don't just form from thin air, you know...
