 The rumors are true, instead of simply offering old content from others, Netflix is jumping back into the content business by licensing David Fincher's upcoming drama House of Cards for Watch Instantly streaming in the US and Canada before it airs anywhere else, or has even been produced. In a blog post and interview with AllThingsD, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos justifies signing up for the series sight unseen by pointing out the popularity of the earlier BBC miniseries on which it is based among Netflix members and the collective skills of both the director and lead actor Kevin Spacey. However, if you're waiting around for fresh content to pop up on Watch Instantly don't hold your breath, the 26 episode run produced by (interestingly, Netflix will neither produce nor own the show) Media Rights Capital isn't due to arrive until late 2012.
