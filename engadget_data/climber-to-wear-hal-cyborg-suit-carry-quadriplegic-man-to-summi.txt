Ornot so little things, in this case. The "hybrid assistive limb" suits are going to be used by two mountaineersto ascend the peak of a Swiss mountain while carrying a 43-year old quadriplegic man and a 16-year old student withmuscular dystrophy. The two climbers will start 930 feet below the summit, with one carrying the 43-year old SeijiUchida on his back, and the other dragging the 16-year old Kyoga Ide in a sled. Sounds like quite the task, even with amuscle aiding cyborg suit, but we're sure the climbers could totally p0wn any ninjas that might come in between them andthe summit.[Via The RawFeed]
