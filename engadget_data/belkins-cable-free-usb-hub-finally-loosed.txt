And yet here we are, rapidly approaching Christmas, and the kit and dongle are finally ready to go for $200 for a "mid-December" release (meaning retail rollout ASAP). They're claiming up to 480mbps as far as 30 feet away is how it'll perform (we'll see about that), with just PC support out of the gate.
