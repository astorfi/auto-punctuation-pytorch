       The DISH Network press event isn't until 1pm EST on Thursday but Scott over at Satellite Guys managed to get a list of the up and coming HD channels in 2009 -- some of which are not available anywhere. The most notable is Comedy Central, but there are other welcome additions like CMT, Nickelodeon, FX, and Spike. Unfortunately there is no word on exactly when any of these will go live, but sometime in the next 365 days is about as good of a guess as we can give you.

BET
Comedy Central
CMT
Crime & Investigation
Fashion TV
FX
MTV
Nickelodeon
SHOTO
Showtime Extreme
Showtime (West) HD
SPEED
Spike TV
VH1
