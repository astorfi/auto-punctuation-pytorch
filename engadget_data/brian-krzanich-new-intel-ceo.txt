Today's the day, trivia fans, when "Paul Otellini" stops being the answer to the question "Who is the CEO of Intel?" A fortnight ago, after a prolonged bout of speculation, current COO Brian Krzanich was anointed as the Silicon Valley giant's sixth leader -- giving him a mere two weeks to order a new desk and buy a fancier sports car. He'll be joined by Ren√©e James, who is assuming the mantle of company president today. The pair is taking control of a company that is top of the PC food chain, but which has yet to mount a credible challenge to ARM's mobile dominance -- but the strategic stuff can wait until tomorrow, once they've settled in.


Update: Krzanich spoke with Reuters today and pledged to get Intel more competitive on the mobile front, going so far as to say that Intel "missed it" and that he will "make adjustments in [Intel's] architecture and our product choices."
