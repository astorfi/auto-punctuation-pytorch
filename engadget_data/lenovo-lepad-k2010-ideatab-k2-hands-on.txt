  Remember our lovely leak of Lenovo's Tegra 3 tablet from last November? Well, it showed up here at CES under the LePad K2010 moniker for China, while elsewhere it'll likely be known as the IdeaTab K2. We won't comment much on the unfinished software (so no luck with controlling the cursor using the fingerprint scanner on the back), but build quality wise we enjoyed the faux brushed metal cover on the back, and similarly, the sharp 1,920 x 1,200 IPS display between the speakers was very impressive (yes, we double-checked with Lenovo on these numbers).We also received confirmation that the camera on the back has an eight-megapixel resolution, but obviously we'll wait and see if the picture quality lives up to expectation. Alas, there's still no word on availability, but regardless, China will get first dibs on this juicy quad-core slate. On the bright side, this should give ample time for potential buyers to save up -- the K2010 is aimed at high-end business users, after all. Hands-on video after the break.Update: Fresh info straight from Beijing tells us that the K2010's clock speed's been given a gentle bump from 1.6GHz to 1.7GHz. And those speakers sandwiching the display? Those are what Lenovo calls "Super Surround Speaker (3S)" that consists of four drivers. We're also told to expect a charging station.
