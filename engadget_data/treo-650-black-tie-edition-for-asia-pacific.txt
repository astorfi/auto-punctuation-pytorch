 We're having an awful time confirming whether this is legit, but word is spreading across Palm's Asia-Pacific community that the Treo 650 is going to get one last hurrah as the "Black Tie Edition." Yes, this is just a Treo 650 that's gone through the paint shop; nothing new to report in the way of specs, but Palm will reportedly be throwing in a special "multifunction" stylus and hard case to sweeten the deal. We know our American readers are rearing to list their 700p on eBay and get in on this, but sadly, it doesn't look like we'll be getting any stock in these parts.[Thanks, Cullen]
