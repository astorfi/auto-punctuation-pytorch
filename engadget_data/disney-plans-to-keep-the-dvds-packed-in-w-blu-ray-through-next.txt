 Blu-ray buyers of Disney movies can expect to keep finding DVD copies packed in, at least through 2010. According to a statement from the company received by Video Business, president Bob Chapek claims customers have shown "tremendous interest" in packages that can also play in their existing DVD players. Especially for the market of Disney titles, we can see how that would be, since you probably haven't upgraded the television in the kids room, or in the backseat of the car just yet. Hopefully this deeper commitment to including an additional disc doesn't lead to the rumored raised prices, but hopefully the threat of Redbox keeps that at bay.
