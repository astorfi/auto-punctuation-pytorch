The boys from Redmond sent a massive, massive package our way, including a giant, custom army bag, custom dog tags, two army meal rations, a first aid kit, the Xbox itself, two Halo 3 controllers and a headset, plus some other stuff hidden in the nooks and crannies. But -- there's one thing in the box we weren't expecting... and that's the crazy Legendary Edition packaging for the game itself, housed in a full size, manically detailed Master Chief helmet. Hit the gallery and feast your eyes on all the (presumably) rare goodness in our Engadget-style unboxing of the bag and system. We can honestly say we're a bit stoked on this.
