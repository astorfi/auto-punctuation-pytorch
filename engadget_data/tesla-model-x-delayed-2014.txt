Tesla subtly announced in its recent annual report that its Model X won't be arriving any time this year. Our sister site, AutoBlog Green, confirmed that the SUV model has been pushed back to a late 2014 release, citing a focus on its S model for now. The company reckons it won't affect profits though, adding that it sees "increased sales volume potential" in its Model S series. Well, there's certainly plenty of interest.
