And while we can't 100 percent certain that Sprint doesn't have a few hidden away in some of the less traversed pockets of this great land, the fact that they're selling out shouldn't come as a huge shocker. The phone overtook the Palm Pre to become Sprint's best-selling launch day ever, though we don't have an actual number of units moved. Be sure to let us know in comments if your local store has any left -- we'll be sure to stampede over there.
