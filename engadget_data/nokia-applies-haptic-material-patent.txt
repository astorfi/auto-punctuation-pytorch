  If US patent application 20120062371 is to be correctly understood, Nokia has at least thought about a topical haptic notification system. The first claim covers "An apparatus comprising: a material attachable to skin, the material capable of detecting a magnetic field and transferring a perceivable stimulus to the skin, wherein the perceivable stimulus relates to the magnetic field." It then goes on to clarify its relation to telecommunications messages and communications indications. Based on ferromagnetic powder, the material would respond to magnetic fields and vibrate in response. Our guess is that this could be used as a notifier that could be "painted" onto the skin, and although there is mention of the word tattoo, we're hoping that's just part of the required legalese. But alas, until it's granted, it's just a subject of our curious imaginations. Those curious, can read more at the source.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
