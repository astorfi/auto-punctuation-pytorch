Our friend Tyler from Format War Central decided to pick up an HD-A2 from Best Buy yesterday -- why not at $99? -- and noticed that in addition to getting two free movies, the receipt said he bought an HD-A3. So he figured he'd take Circuit City up on their "Low Price Guarantee" and upon displaying his Best Buy receipt they happily sold him a $300 HD-A3 for $87 (out the door) -- which also had two free HD DVDs in the box to boot.
