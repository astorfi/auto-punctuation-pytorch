This here is allegedly some sort of promotional material for the upcoming real US-spec N95, showing a few interesting changes over its older, European sibling. Though we knew US 3G was in the cards, it turns out the devil may be in the details: contrary to other evidence, it looks like the handset will support HSDPA 850 / 1900 -- AT&T's 3G bands, not T-Mobile's. The battery grows from 950mAh to a healthy 1200mAh, but to accomodate the added load, the camera's protective shutter has seemingly been removed. Growing along with the battery is the in-box microSD card, going from 512MB for the initial launch to a full 1GB. Finally, you can forget purple and beige; the US variant will apparently stick with a decidedly safer choice of black to adorn its rear. All decent changes, we figure, as long as our glorious 5 megapixel cams don't break.
