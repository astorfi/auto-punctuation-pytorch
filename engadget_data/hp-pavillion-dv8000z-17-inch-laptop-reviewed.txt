The verdictis mostly good, with the laptop getting high-marks for its desktop-like keyboard and all the extra stuff that HP wasable to fit in thanks to all that extra space (even a remote control hidden in the PC Card slot). The dv8000z alsoincludes two 2.5-inch hard drives, although they only run at 4,200 rpm. It loses a few a marks, however, for theunderpowered ATI Radeon Xpress integrated graphics, and the lack of one of the only things it ought to have: anintegrated TV tuner. Prices start at around $1000 direct from HP.
