Surprise! After months of speculation and leaks, HTC is finally ready to show the world its latest flagship, the One M9. Sorry to disappoint, but those leaks were, for the most part, spot on. As they suggested, there's no major change in terms of industrial design here; the M9 looks a lot like the M8, which in turn looked a look like the original One. That means you're getting an aluminium unibody design with a 5-inch 1080p display framed at the top and bottom by HTC's trademark BoomSound speakers. Sure, it's a bit narrower, a little shorter, and a shade thicker than the M8 it replaces, but you'd be hard-pressed to tell the handsets apart at first glance.
