It's just signed off on the Release to Manufacturing (or RTM) build of the operating system, which now leaves things in the hands of the handset makers and carriers, while Microsoft says that it will turn its focus to the update process. Still unsure what the update has in store? Our extensive preview is just as handy as ever.
