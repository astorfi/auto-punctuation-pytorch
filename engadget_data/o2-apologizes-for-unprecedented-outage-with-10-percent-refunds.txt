The UK operator noted in a blog post today that it has identified all those users who were impacted by the "unprecedented" downtime and will be offering up 10-percent off of their July subscriptions, to be applied to their bills in September, the monetary equivalent of three lost days. Pay & Go members, meanwhile, will also be getting something back in September: a 10 percent bonus on their first top-up that month. The company's also offering up customers a Â£10 O2 in-store voucher, available during the month of September. More info and apologies in the source link below.
