That's what these handful of User Agent profiles purport to show us. The model numbers GT-P3200, GT-P5200 and the GT-P8200 suggest that they'll join the Galaxy Tab family, although these profiles only give us a little detail to work on. The GT-P3200 appears to be the entry-level slab, with a 1,024 x 600 resolution more suited to tablets of yesteryear. This is cranked up to 1,280 x 800 for the P5200, while the GT-P8200 will apparently match the Nexus 10's pin-sharp 2,560 x 1,600 display.

 Unfortunately, there's nothing here to confirm screen-size, processing punch or much else, although we managed to sniff out an AnTuTu benchmark for the GT-P8200 that reckons it'll house a (presumably multicore) 1.7GHz processor and Android 4.2. However, like these User Agent Profiles, we're looking at these results with a suspicious glare until something more official surfaces. Between the trio, there's likely to be a division between two different sizes of tablet -- possibly either side of that Galaxy Note 8 that's set to make an appearance next month. Check out the GT-P8200's short-but-sweet benchmark listing after the break.
