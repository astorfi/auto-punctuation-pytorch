Powered by a 1.83GHz Intel Core Duo T2400processor, the 3.8 pound laptop has plenty of horsepower, and even manages to best Gateway's 6.3 pound Dual Core M465-Ein benchmark tests. The processor also runs surprisingly cool, which is always a good thing with a laptop that is actualsmall enough to sit on your lap. At 1.2-inches thick, the notebook still manages a 13.3-inch 1280x800 widescreendisplay, and also includes a DVDÂ±RW optical drive, an EDGE radio for Cingular service, and a VGA webcam to fillup its carbon fiber body. Perhaps the most interesting feature, the SZ's ability to switch between NVIDIA and Intelintegrated graphics for the sake of battery life, happens to be a bit of a letdown, since at 4 hours 15 minutes it onlyoffered a 42 minute improvement over the all out NVIDIA usage. PC Mag recommends a larger battery if you really want totry and compete with Lenovo's 7 hour strong X60.
