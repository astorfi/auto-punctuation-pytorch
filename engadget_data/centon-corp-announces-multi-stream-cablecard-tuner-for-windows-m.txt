       Watch out ATI, because you're exclusivity on digital cable tuners for Windows Media Center is about to run up. You see Ceton Corp announced that during 2009 their multi-channel digital cable tuner will ship, and for the first time ever a single device will somehow allow you to record up to six channels at once. We're not exactly sure how this is going to work, and we're kinda curious to know if a single PCI card will be able to do this all on its own, but regardless, competition is good. Of course the bad news is that you still can't build your own Windows Media Center and get this to work, but you knew that already didn't you?[Via Chris Lanier]
