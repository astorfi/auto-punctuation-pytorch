However, fans of the full Minecraft experience can jump for joy because Mojang's title has officially left its beta days behind and has turned the big 1.0. The announcement was made by none other than Mr. Minecraft himself, Markus "Notch" Persson, at the first ever MineCon event, and the update is available now. Well, what are you waiting for? Your digital utopia won't build itself.
