The silence on the processor front makes sense, but we were hungry for more details all the same. Lucky for us, we spotted both models on the show floor this morning at CES.

 The new 15-inch T15 is the largest VAIO Ultrabook to date, and it doesn't depart from the silver, brushed-metal aesthetic we've seen on Sony's ultraportables dating back to the T13. It's considerably heftier than the 13- and 14-inch models, but it does squeeze in an optical drive. Overall, its port selection is quite generous: USB 3.0, an Ethernet jack, VGA, HDMI and a headphone connection line the left side, while the right edge is home to that disc drive along with two USB 2.0 ports. The 10-point capacitive touchscreen seems quite responsive, and the 1080p resolution is a nice step up from the more standard 1,366 x 768 configuration on the T14. As mentioned previously, additional specs and pricing / availability info are TBA, but it's safe to bet that the VAIO T15 will be available with both SSD and standard hard drive options when it hits the market.

 As it happens, the 14-inch T14 was also on hand. The main difference here is the added touch display. Otherwise, it's the 3.77-pounder we've known about since October. As with the T15, we're waiting on more concrete info. For now, you can get a taste of the two machines in our hands-on video and galleries.
