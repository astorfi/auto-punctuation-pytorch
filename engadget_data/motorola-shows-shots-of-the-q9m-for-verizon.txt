Moto dropped a handful of press shots of its CDMA-ified Q9 the other day, including this one of the Windows Mobile 6 Standard -- that's "Smartphone" in WM5 nomenclature, if you recall -- handset in some sort of protective case (at least, we hope that's what it is). Thinking back to the amount of time that elapsed between the RAZR MAXX Ve's press shot release and its eventual launch, we could still be in for a bit of a wait -- but at least it's real, yeah?
