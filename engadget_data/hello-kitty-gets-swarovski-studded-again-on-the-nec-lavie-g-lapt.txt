If you know what we mean, you may want to check into the latest high-end entry in the canon: the NEC LaVie G Hello Kitty edition -- a follow-up to this Summer's LaVie -- once again featuring images of the ubiquitous cat studded in breathtaking Swarovski crystals. Underneath the glitz you'll find a 15.4-inch WXGA display, an AMD Turion CPU, 2GB of RAM, a 120GB hard drive, plus a DVD+RW and a handful of USB ports which will allow you to plug in your Hello Kitty flash drives and the like. Right now this sweet puppy kitty is only available in Japan, and will run you around Â¥210,000 ($1,840) -- but we don't think that will stop you.
