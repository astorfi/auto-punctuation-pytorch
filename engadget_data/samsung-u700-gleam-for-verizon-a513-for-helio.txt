The MVNO has tended to stray from form factor convention -- think Kickflip and Ocean -- but to satisfy traditionalists, a good, clean clamshell is probably a solid addition to any carrier's lineup. PhoneArena has scored a shot of what will allegedly become the Samsung SCH-A513 for Helio (though we imagine they'll come up with a much snappier name for launch), sporting an m610-ish profile but upping the cam to 3 megapixels. Meanwhile, Verizon will apparently be sourcing the U700 "Gleam" from the manufacturer, offering EV-DO and external music controls in what appears to be a refined, midrange shell. No word on release dates or prices for either of these just yet.
