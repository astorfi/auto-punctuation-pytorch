Twitter fans on Android just got a pair of small features that could go a long way toward streamlining conversations.

The refresh also permits sharing tweets through direct messages -- you won't have to broadcast your intentions to the world. If time or privacy is of the essence, Twitter's Android upgrade is already live at the source link.
