       Wouldn't you know it? Just weeks after AT&T announced an expansion of its U-verse service in sunny San Diego, along comes Time Warner Cable to keep things marginally competitive. According to a local, the cable company is sending out informational cards which inform users of an impending switched digital video (SDV) rollout, and while it does mention that tuning adapters may be offered for free to TiVo owners, we suspect we'll have to wait and hear about all the details. As for new high-definition channels, you can look forward to seeing Universal HD, MOJO HD, HDNet, HDNet Movies and NBA TV HD, all of which should go live on July 28th.
