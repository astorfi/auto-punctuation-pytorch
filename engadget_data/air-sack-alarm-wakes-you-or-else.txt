If you're into extreme sleeping and
don't want to lose your job for showing up late every day, you may just find the ¥98,000 ($800) air sack alarm to be a
worthwhile purchase. The device uses a compressor, hose and inflatable cushion to make your bed so uncomfortable that
you won't have any choice but to get up. Once the alarm is triggered, the cushion inflates and deflates at seven-second
intervals. The alarm is sold by Japan's JR East train line, which claims this setup is actually used to keep conductors
from oversleeping, which may help to explain why Japanese trains are always on time — and why you'll never get one of
those dudes to crack a smile.
