The device boasts a 6-inch e-ink touchscreen with 16 shades of gray, 512MB storage, WiFi, support for various formats (including EPUB / PDF / HTML / TXT / CHM / MOBI / JPG / BMP / PNG / GIF / TIFF / MP3), and text to speech (but sadly, no Tom). We don't have a price yet, so we're not entirely sure how threatened you should feel, but if we had to wager we'd probably bet on "not very."
