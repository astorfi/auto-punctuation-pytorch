From here on out, it's either the 13- or 15-inch models if you want Apple's conventional form factor. The next-generation MacBook Pro is now your best option if you want more than a 1680 x 1050 resolution in a portable Mac, and there's no internal recourse for an ExpressCard slot if you lived on it. That said, we imagine Apple is counting on two pairs each of USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt on the new system to take care of ExpressCard's former duties. We'd add that it's also the end of an era: Apple was one of the first with a 17-inch widescreen laptop, and it's now one of the first to bow out.
