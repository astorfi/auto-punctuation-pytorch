Some cat over on PPCGeeks seems to have leaked a pretty believable '09 roadmap for HTC, showing tons of glorious hardware that appears -- at least on the surface -- to go toe-to-toe with the best Palm, Apple, and the rest of the gang can bring to the table. AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint all have dedicated stuff in here, including a "Jasper" that looks to combine the Touch HD with the Touch Pro, a successor to the monster Athena called "Ihoth," and this little guy, a garishly pink Android handset dubbed "Hero." We'd expect at least some of these to be announced at MWC next month, so we don't have long to wait -- assuming they're real, of course.[Via wmpoweruser.com]
