NVIDIA's GeForce Experience may not be tremendously popular with PC gamers, but it's about to get more traction now that its Twitch streaming is finally available in beta. An updated app lets any player with a Kepler-based GeForce card both livestream their sessions and record clips through ShadowPlay. If you're worried about missing special moments, there's a PlayStation 4-like Shadow Mode to automatically capture the last 20 minutes of game time; performance shouldn't be an issue, since dedicated hardware handles all the video encoding. NVIDIA can't promise that everything will be smooth in the beta, but it's already planning to add both a desktop capture mode and new microphone controls. Head to the source links if you're eager to share your virtual escapades with the world.
