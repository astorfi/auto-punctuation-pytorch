The New York Times takes focus on a report published today titled "The Digital Dump: Exporting Reuse and Abuse to
Africa." The report, written by Seattle's Basel Action Network, says that "much" of the used computer equipment sent
from the U.S. to developing countries for reuse in schools and such is "often" neither usable nor repairable creating
some serious environmental issues in the world's poorest places. The report goes so far as to claim that U.S.
recycling businesses purposely use a cloak of
humanitarianism as a means of dodging proper recycling expenses. The report found that as much as 75 percent of the
estimated 400,000 used computers received into Nigeria each month…are junk! And without the means to repair or recycle
the equipment locally it ends up in landfills (like that pictured above) wreaking all kinds of toxic havoc. The EPA
concedes that "inappropriate practices" have occurred and is working on a program to provide greater assurance that
exports are environmentally sound. Fortunately, our interns handle all Engadget's recycling needs as part of the hazing
process — eat a plasma, get a feature!
