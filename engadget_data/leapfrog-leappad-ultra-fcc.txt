If you've got kids, or just like pretending you still are one on weekends, then you're probably familiar with LeapFrog's infant-friendly LeapPad. We might suggest that you hold off buying one for the next few weeks, thanks to a listing for a LeapPad Ultra that meandered through the FCC today. Given that the LeapPad 2 hit stores last August, we'll expect to learn a lot more about this unit over the next couple of weeks. That said, if you can't wait, or are just curious about what lurks beneath its green plastic shell, check out the teardown gallery below.
