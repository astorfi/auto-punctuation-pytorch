Hulu has just revealed a movement to get Hulu Plus stocked with more content and onto more devices, STAT. Making sure those words aren't empty, we're learning that all 2010 Sony BRAVIA HDTVs will today have access to the subscription programming service, with it bleeding over to Sony's various Blu-ray players, home theater systems, network media players and even the Dash -- yeah, that Dash -- in due time. In related news, Hulu will be soon yanking the invite requirement to get Hulu Plus on the PlayStation 3, and as of next week, any ole PlayStation Network member (as opposed to PlayStation Plus, as it stands today) will be able to grab it. 'Course, even those freeloaders will be forced to pony up $9.99 per month if they're interested in using it, but hey, it's not like Raising Hope is financed with pixie dust, right?

[Thanks, Brian]
