 Noted Blackmagic Design shooter John Brawley has released the first footage from the company's upcoming $995 Pocket Cinema Camera that might leave your DSLR green with envy. Though it's always tough to judge compressed web footage, to our eyes it looks completely untouched by the moire, aliasing and compression artifacts that tends to plague other digital cameras. While not specifying whether he used the compressed RAW setting or not, Brawley said he shot it using a Panasonic 12-35mm f/2.8 Micro Four Thirds lens with image stabilization turned on, meaning that feature's likely to be enabled on the camera when it arrives in late July. He also said he was "literally grabbing shots whilst I was shopping," which bodes well for serious filmmakers with a bit more time to spare. Head past the break to admire the video.
