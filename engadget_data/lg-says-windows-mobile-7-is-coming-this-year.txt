This would be the most official recent affirmation we've seen from any top-tier company of the 2010 date -- but no, they're not showing any hardware running it here, so it remains more of a magical, world peace-creating concept than an actual product. The wait, it seems, continues -- but at least we're feeling a little better about setting the countdown clock.
