But now Mr. Mmcheacher had to go and ruin it for everyone by faking a disaster of his own, and expecting people to fork over PayPal dollars to buy him a brand new laptop. Mmcheacher put up a cute little blog with that picture up above, along with a sad story of Wiimote strap-breaking woe, hoping to win some pity dollars with that "cracked LCD" of his, him being a student and all. Next, (for those potential pranksters out there taking notes), Mmcheacher tipped us about the blog, and had a friend tip us 16 minutes later, completing this marvelous deception. Unfortunately for him, that screensaver he's using has been around the internet a time or two, and he's not fooling anyone. Sorry to ruin the party, Mmcheacher -- if that's even your real name -- but perhaps you can try a little harder next time around?UPDATE: Sorry to ruin the fun, but after this post went up, the aforementioned Mmcheacher (whose real name is Michael Parker McEachern, we've discovered) swapped his tale of woe for a NSFW page of hate, so we pulled the link. Now you'll just have to use your imagination. Or you can email him at mmceachern@gmail.com or michaelparker@gmail.com -- maybe he'll send you a screencap.
