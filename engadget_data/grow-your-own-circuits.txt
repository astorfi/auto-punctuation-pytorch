 A new eco-friendly method of manufacturing metal for antennas or
circuits uses a special ink and electroless solution to actually grow the metal right on the surface. The solution
contains metals that are drawn (forgive the pun) to the ink. This process cuts costs in half and makes it much more
environmentally friendly (always a good thing). Privacy advocates might not be so happy, since the main use of this
technology is going to be RFID tags and cost reductions will mean more widespread use. Other uses include WiFi-blocking
wallpaper and antennas embedded in cellphone casings.
