Be forewarnedthat neither of these builds is for the inexperienced hax0r- you'll need to be pretty handy with a soldering iron,multimeter, and circuit board if you expect to finish successfully. Luckily both mods use the same software, so afteryou've mastered the tethered connection you can cut up your serial cable and repurpose it for some sweet cellphonecontrol. Props be to SXSW nominee and Engadget main man Phil Torrone for putting this Flickr-annotated projecttogether, and also to iRobot for allowing creative folks to tinker with and improve their products- no doubt we'll beseeing some absolutely sick Roomba-based creations in the near future. Keep on clickin' for a pic of the Bluetoothversion...Read: Wired ControlRead: Wireless Control
