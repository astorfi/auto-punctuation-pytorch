The New York Philharmonic's musical director Alan Gilbert heard the disturbance and after a few aggressive looks, stopped his orchestra partway through the final movement until the phone was silenced. Hopefully that person learned a very valuable lesson, and everyone else will remember that there's a special circle of hell reserved for those who don't mute their phone at the theater.
