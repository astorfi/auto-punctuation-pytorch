 Don't you hate it when the biggest wars can be started over the smallest things? This time around, we're referring to this in a very literal sense, as Apple has been putting the heat on (no, not that kind of heat) against an alliance formed by Nokia, Motorola and RIM regarding nano-SIM standards. With the ETSI gearing up for a vote on various proposals next week, the two sides are locking horns, determined to prove theirs is the best. Last we heard, concerns were flying left and right that Apple was planning to move ahead with its nano-SIM unilaterally, snatch up a smorgasbord of patents along its path and seize control of the governing body by registering six subsidiaries to vote. Considering Nokia is the current vote leader and claims its design has "significant technical advantages," we can understand why the Finnish giant would be worried. But how, exactly, is its design any better off?A Nokia representative gave some more clarity to The Verge about the perks its version offers. The company claims Apple's standard doesn't meet the ETSI-approved requirements, which if true would make it incredibly difficult -- in theory, anyway -- to win over votes. Also, unlike Cupertino's version, Nokia's card doesn't require a tray or drawer, which equates to more space, allows for more design innovations and decreases the cost of manufacturing in comparison. Lastly, Espoo also argues that its competitor's proposal wouldn't be backwards-compatible with micro-SIM slots. Sounds legit, but we'd love to hear the opposing team offer its rebuttal before next week's vote. As it stands, we doubt this is the last round in the war of words before everything is settled. For now, head over to the source to see the explanation in its entirety.
