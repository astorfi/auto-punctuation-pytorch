Then listen up, because the company that bills itself as "quietly brilliant" wants to flood your auto and home with all your favorite media. Via two YouTube clips, HTC has shed some additional light on its revamped Media Link HD product and its Car offering announced around Mobile World Congress earlier this year. Through the use of two specially designed dongles, and a snazzy on-phone interface, the software/hardware combo streams audio and/or video to your output medium of choice. The company lists both systems as being available "this April" on its website, so for now it looks like you'll have to settle for the two videos awaiting your scrutiny after the break.
