It is, however, a very interesting video rig for shooting flicks on a budget with its Micro Four Thirds sensor and collection of micro 4/3 lenses, filters, and adapters. The AF100 records native 1080/24p using the AVC/ H.264 Hi Profile AVCHD codec to a pair of SD slots supporting both SDHC and newer SDXC removable media. The AVCCAM HD camcorder features a pair of XLR inputs, 48-kHz/16-bit two-channel digital audio recording, and supports LPCM/Dolby-AC3; it also packs USB 2.0, HD-SDI out, HDMI, a built-in stereo mic, and time code recording. So yeah, it won't record the next Hollywood blockbuster but it'll probably do fine by indie filmmakers without breaking the film school budget. Perhaps we'll better understand all this professional talk when Panny reveals its price in time for a year-end launch.
