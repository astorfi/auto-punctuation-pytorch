   Consumer Reports splashed out $107,850 to buy its own Fisker Karma, but before the car had traveled 200 miles, it had broken down. Partway through calibration testing on the CR Track, the car's dashboard began issuing warnings, but when tester Tom Mutchler pulled over to identify the issue, it wouldn't get going again. Mutchler was forced to call the dealership, located 100 miles away, to collect it on a flatbed for repair. It's the first time in memory that the testing organization can recall a vehicle breaking down partway through testing, but when it comes to the Karma, you can only be sure that nothing's too calamitous.
