This 3G (WCDMA of unspecified band) clamshell goes quadband GSM with microSD expansion (30MB on-boad) and 240 x 320 QVGA display touting 16 million colors. If thin is your thing and 3G Nokia your game then this is about as good as it gets. Available next month for about â‚¬200 pre-tax and pre-subsidy. Unfortunately, Nokia doesn't say where, but its forward-facing profile certainly matches up nicely with Nokia's FCC approved RM-276 handset operating in the 850 and 1900MHz bands (read: AT&T).
