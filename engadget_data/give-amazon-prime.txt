If you're still looking for gift ideas for that special someone, Amazon is looking to lend a hand. The online retailer has announced that customers can now give a $79 one-year membership to Prime. Recipients will get an email on the day of the giver's choosing with instructions on how to get started. For folks in the US, this means unlimited streaming of certain titles from Prime Instant Video on top of a Kindle book each month from the Owners' Lending Library, Kindle First and free two-day shipping that also come with the annual dues. In a giving mood? Jump down to that first source link below to add 12 months of access to your shopping cart.
