We're not expecting to find out all about LG's "G Watch" smartwatch (and new top of the line G3 phone) until the end of this month, but if you needed another teaser then here it goes. A short promo video for the device doesn't introduce much in the way of details, but if you want to see its Android Wear software in motion or a few 360-degree rotations of its "timeless" metal body, this will suffice. LG is still promising to the "define the smartwatch" with all-day comfort and readiness for anything on a single charge despite an always-on screen, all in a water- and dust-resistant shell.
