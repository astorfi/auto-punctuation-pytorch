 Malaysian manufacturer AXIA is claiming to have the "worldâ€™ssmallest PDA Phone on Microsoft Windows Mobile 5 featuring WiFi connectivity," in their new A308 device. At0.8x1.9x4.5-inch the phone is a tad larger than the HTC Tornado Smartphone, but the A308 goes for full PDAfunctionality with its 2.2-inch QVGA LCD. Along with the WiFi, AXIA has crammed in Bluetooth, EDGE, miniSD, a 1.3megapixel camera, and a pleasantly fast 416MHz Intel CPU. Looks good to us, world's smallest or not.
