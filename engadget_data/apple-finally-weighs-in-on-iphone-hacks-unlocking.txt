 Merely three days after hearing of one user's run-in with Apple over his unlocked iPhone, the company has released an official statement warning users that "unauthorized iPhone unlocking programs" could cause "irreparable damage to the iPhone's software." Furthermore, the firm stated that these apps could result in the handset becoming "permanently inoperable when a future Apple-supplied iPhone software update is installed" -- you know, like the one coming "later this week" that includes the iTunes WiFi Music Store. As if that wasn't bad enough, the release also notes that "unauthorized modifications to the iPhone's software" violates the iPhone software license agreement and "voids the warranty."
