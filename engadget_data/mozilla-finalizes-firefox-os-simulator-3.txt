If you've yet to dabble around with Firefox OS, today would be a good opportunity to remedy that, because Mozilla has released the final version of Firefox OS Simulator 3.0. Building off of the preview release from mid-March, this version has been slimmed down with a smaller download size, faster startup time and plenty of bug fixes. The finalized release also contains newer versions of Firefox OS and the Gaia UI, and best of all, it's really easy to install -- merely add the extension within Firefox and you're off to the races. As a hint, you can switch between the four primary home screens by clicking and dragging, and from there, you'll realize there's plenty to play with. Think of it as the poor man's version of buying a new phone.
