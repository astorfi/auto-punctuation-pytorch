Sprint's had a handful of GPS-enabled cellphones on the market for a while now, but for the most part you couldn't
use them to replace a proper GPS nav unit. At least not until today, that is. Garmin just introduced Garmin Mobile, a
new navigation app based on their StreetPilot c-series software that'll let you get maps, turn-by-turn directions, and
point-of-interest info right on your
Sanyo MM-5600,
MM-7400, or
MM-8300 cellphone. Costs $9.99 a month and is available
now.
