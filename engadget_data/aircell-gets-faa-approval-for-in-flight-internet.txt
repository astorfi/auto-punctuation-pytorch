 So Aircell just nabbed itself the first and only approval from the FAA for air-to-ground mobile broadband for US domestic flights, meaning we're that much closer to in-flight internet. So far the approval just covers the Boeing 767-200, which means Aircell can start prepping equipment to cover the 767-200 fleet of American Airlines this year, but they're also prepping to cover the Airbus A320 fleet of Virgin America. Routes between LA, SF, NY and Miami are going to get priority treatment. Aircell's Joe Cruz was also quick to point out that this approval paves the way for future aircraft approvals, which certainly can't come soon enough.  [Via Phone Scoop]
