The BBC might be a stalwart bastion of television broadcasting, but that's not stopping it from expanding its ventures into the wonderful world of online programming. Today, BBC Three announced that it would try its hand at digital-first content starting with the second series of Jack Whitehall's Bad Education. As more and more viewers turn to the internet for their TV-watching needs, the BBC has proven itself eager to keep up with demand, first by unveiling its plan to debut certain programs online in addition to producing iPlayer-exclusive dramas. iPlayer has long been one of the best ways to catch up on your favorite shows when you miss them on the air, but with this new development, the BBC seems interested in shifting the paradigm -- at least when it comes to a few select programs -- to favor online viewership.
