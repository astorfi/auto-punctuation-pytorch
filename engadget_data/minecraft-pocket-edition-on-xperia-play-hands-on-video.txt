Minecraft was among the 20 odd games on display at the booth, and the version we had a chance to play with happens to look remarkably similar to that demo we saw pop up a couple weeks ago. The game will be exclusive to the Play when it hits online stores in Q3, but there's no word on pricing just let -- though here's to hoping it'll be free. In the demo we played, you select your blocks on the touchscreen -- or you can just cycle through them with the circle and square buttons. You won't find Creepers, crafting, or night mode in this version, but we're still a few months away from the launch, so there's a chance we'll see those features when it's fully baked. You'll need to wait a bit longer before playing on your own device, but check out our hands-on video after the break for a taste of Mojang's pocket-sized Minecraft.
