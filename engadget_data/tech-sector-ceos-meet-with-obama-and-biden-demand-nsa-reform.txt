It's not been a particularly good year for the National Security Agency, what with Edward Snowden revealing how pervasive its domestic surveillance is, and the outrage and concern those revelations engendered in US citizens. Naturally, many tech companies were also upset, upon learning that the NSA was snooping their systems too. Today, many of the tech industry's heavy hitters had a two and a half hour sit-down with President Obama and VP Biden, and used that time to demand that the White House take steps to reform the NSA's policies (Read: limit its power and provide independent oversight and greater transparency about its actions).


Among the scheduled attendees were Apple's Tim Cook, Twitter's Dick Costolo, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, and AT&T CEO and Chairman Randall Stephenson. The contents of the discussion remain a mystery, though the Guardian did acquire a statement issued by the group regarding the meeting: "We appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the president our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urge him to move aggressively on reform." The ball's in your court, Mr.President. Lets see if you give the people and the tech center what they really want for Christmas: freedom from Uncle Sam's prying eyes.
