 While robots capable of kinda sorta dancing along with music are hardly anything new, few can match the moves this recently developed "Keepon" robot is capable of busting out -- without arms or legs, no less. Developed by Carnegie Mellon's Marek Michalowski and Hideki Kozima of Japan's National Institute of Communications Technology, the little yellow bot uses a gimbal-based system to move through about as full a range of motions as two spheres are capable of, and is able to react to visual stimulation in addition to music thanks to some built-in cameras. Sadly, this dancing machine remains confined to the lab for the time being, although you can check out a couple of videos of it in action by clicking on the read link below.[Via New Scientist]
