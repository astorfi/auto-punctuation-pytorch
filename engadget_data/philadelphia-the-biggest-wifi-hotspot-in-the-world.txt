The City of Brotherly Love is currently considering a $10 million proposal that would blanket the 135 square mile
metropolis in thousands of WiFi transmitters. While it would be congruous to the fundamental principles of the Internet
to offer this service for free, which they are considering, we still feel obligated to ask the hard questions: wouldn't
this money be better suited, as usual, being dumped into schools and social programs? And, ever heard of
WiMax? And, when can we move in?
