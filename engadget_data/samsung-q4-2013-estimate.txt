Samsung may have had a record-setting summer, but it wasn't able to repeat that achievement in the fall. The Korean tech giant estimates that its operating profit dropped to about 8.3 trillion won ($7.8 billion) in the fourth quarter, or lower than both the 8.84 trillion won ($8.3 billion) from one year ago and the 10.16 trillion won ($9.6 billion) from Q3. Samsung didn't say what triggered the dip, but the forecast isn't helping concerns that the company's red-hot growth in smartphones may be cooling down. It's not exactly crisis time at Samsung -- the company generates more operating profit in a quarter than many of its mobile rivals do in total revenue. Still, we suspect that it's happy to be launching a slew of new gadgets that could make up for the underwhelming earnings.
