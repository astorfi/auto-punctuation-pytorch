All you people who bought Beta back in the day can feel better now — VHS is dead now, too. Ok, well maybe it's not
quite dead yet, but Wal-Mart, the most powerful retailer the world has ever known, says that they're going to
completely stop selling VCRs and VHS tapes by early next year (they want  to make room on their shelves for
family-friendly DVDs). Probably not how the VCR wanted to
spend its 30th birthday, but what can you do?


UPDATE: Or maybe not.
Wal-Mart is denying the
report.
