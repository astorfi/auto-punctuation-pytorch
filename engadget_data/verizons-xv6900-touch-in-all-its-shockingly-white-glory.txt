About all we can say is this: Verizon's XV6900 Touch from HTC features EV-DO, Windows Mobile 6, and a 2 megapixel camera like its Sprint and Alltel cousins, it includes GPS, and yep, we're now absolutely certain it's real. There's still no word on whether it's actually thinner than Sprint's version, but it looks pretty chubby from the diagrams in our gallery, so we have our doubts. See the biggie-sized visuals over in the gallery![Thanks, anonymous tipster]
