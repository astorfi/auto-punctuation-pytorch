After a bit of on-stage gaming and a quick 30-second karaoke session, a stage-wide curtain dropped to the sound of a buzzer, revealing 50 nondescript Ultrabooks, each displaying the words "Thank you!" in both English and Chinese. We'll likely be back with hands-ons with some of these devices later today, but for now, the image above will have to do.
