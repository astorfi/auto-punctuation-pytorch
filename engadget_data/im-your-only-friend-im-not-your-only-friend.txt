Like The Longines Symphonette before it, Thingiverse's army of 3D printing enthusiasts don't rest, so when MakerBot put them to the task of building a better home for wayward birds, they naturally jumped into action. Not to put too fine a point on it, but while we're still a ways from indoor plumbing and the like, the American Craftsman Bungalow is surely the sort of thing any upwardly mobile winged friend would want to call home. The first place winner gets (fittingly) an Eggbot, some PLA filament, display space at the MakerBot NY store and the admiration of birds everywhere. And if Hitchcock has taught us anything, it's that you want those buggers on your side. You can download the schematics for all of the winners in the source link below, complete with the standard whistles and bells.
