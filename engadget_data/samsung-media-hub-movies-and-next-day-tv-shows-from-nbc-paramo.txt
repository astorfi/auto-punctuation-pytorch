Compatible with Tab and Galaxy S devices, both movies and next-day TV shows will be available for purchase and rental. As for the content partners, they're not quite shabby: MTV Networks, NBC, Paramount, Universal Studios, and Warner, with more to be announced. Purchased content can be shared with up to five devices. What's not specified is pricing. We should be getting hands-on with it soon, so stay tuned -- or whatever the internet equivalent of that idiom is.
