The slick little bugger you see above purports to be that very device, with the predictably titled PowerShot G11 supposedly boasting a swiveling LCD, 10 megapixel sensor, 5x optical zoom lens, optical image stabilization, SD / SDHC card slot and full manual controls with RAW support and a hotshoe. We're told that it'll be available this fall for an undisclosed sum, and we get the feeling this will all become a lot more official in a matter of days / hours / minutes.[Thanks, Reznov]
