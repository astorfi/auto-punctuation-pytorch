Ubisoft's major next-gen launch game Watch Dogs is now set to release in Spring 2014. The French game publisher announced as much this afternoon, also noting that The Crew is being pushed to the same window. That means that neither game will arrive until at least April 1, 2014.


Though Watch Dogs is a new franchise, Ubisoft's billing it as its next major series after Assassin's Creed, Tom Clancy, and Rayman (among others). For many consumers, it was the tentpole next-gen title that their Xbox One or Playstation 4 purchase was tied to. Ubisoft's dev team blames the delay on "extra time to polish and fine tune each detail so we can deliver a truly memorable and exceptional experience," according to a post on the company blog.


Update: For those concerned about the status of their PS4 Watch Dogs bundle pre-orders, you needn't be. Eurogamer reports that Amazon has confirmed that such customers will keep their place in line and will have their console orders fulfilled without the game. Meanwhile, Polygon got word from Gamestop that it'll still ship consoles on time and let folks either swap out Watch Dogs for another launch title or simply pick up a copy of the game when it's finally released.
