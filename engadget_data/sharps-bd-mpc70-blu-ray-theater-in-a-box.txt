The BD-MPC70 pumps 175W across a full 7.1 channels of 8-ohm phallus with playback support for single-layer BD-R/RE media in addition to DVD video, DVD±R/RW, DVD-RAM, music CDs, and CD-RW/-R discs. It delivers a 12bit/148.5MHz video DAC and 24bit/192kHz audio DAC with a healthy smattering of the ol' in and outs including 2x digital and 2x analog audio inputs and 1080p video output over HDMI. Available June 25th in Japan for ¥1,050,000 or about $8,779 whenever these come Stateside. [Via Impress]
