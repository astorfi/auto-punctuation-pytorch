A few short weeks after Twitter acquired Atebits, the creators of the Tweetie app, the company issued the first official Twitter app for Android; tonight, it looks as if a revamped version of Tweetie (3.0, obviously) will claim that same crown over on iPhone OS. It's tough to say exactly what changes are coming, but a few sporadic tips are coming in from far-flung corners of the globe saying that it's already available. If we were the betting type, we'd say it'll finally pop up in the US app store right around midnight. Pins and needles, we know. 

Update: It's live in New Zealand, and the full changelog is after the break. Hang tight, everyone else!

Update 2: We're seeing scattered reports that it's now available in the US. Thanks for the image, Danny!

[Thanks, Mike]
