Infamous: Second Son has rich day, evening and night environments, as we discussed in the Super Joystiq Podcast last week, and soon players will be able to change the position of the sun and moon at will. The option to alter time will appear in the options menu after beating the game.

Also on the update list: An option to turn the HUD off, and the ability to cap the frame rate at 30FPS.

"Time-wise, the earliest we could have the patch and new features ready is about two weeks from now, so stay tuned for another update - we'll let you know as soon as they're ready to go live," Fleming writes.
