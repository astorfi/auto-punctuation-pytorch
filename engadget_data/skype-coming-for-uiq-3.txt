       If you believe everything you read, then the long-rumored Skype for UIQ may well be en route. Sony Ericsson's recently announced P1 may have let the Skype out of the bag with its whitepaper mention of "Skype â€“ Voice over IP application that lets the user make mobile phone calls over the Internet." While this could be a typo, we're thinking (and hoping) that an announcement may be just around then bend. If you are in the know and can help debunk or substantiate the rumor, drop us a line.[Thanks, Teemu]
