 
 Funny thing about this year's Computex. There are very, very few ARM-based tablets to be found. Most of the slates we've seen have been running Windows 8 paired with a PC-grade X86 Intel processor (and that's not even counting all of the touchscreen Ultrabooks we've seen!). Well, Intel just dropped a number that confirms we haven't been imagining things. Here at its press conference in Taipei, Chipzilla said more than 20 Windows 8 tablets with Intel innards are on the way, meaning those new slates from Acer, ASUS and Samsung are just scratching the surface. That just leaves one question: who's next?
