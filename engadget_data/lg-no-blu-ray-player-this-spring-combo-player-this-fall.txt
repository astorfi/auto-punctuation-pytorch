 CE Pro is reporting LG sent a memo to theirdealers indicating that among other things, like removing LCoS screens from their lineup, they have cancelled theirBD199 player due to "uncertainty in the market". Without even stopping to mourn the BD199 that never was,they go on to say they expect to launch a combination Blu-ray/HD-DVD player by late summer or early fall.Adevice that plays both formats would seem to be the holy grail of high def DVD's, but we seem to recall Samsung sayingthat due to licensing restrictions of both camps that it would be impossible toproduce one. Now that AACS is somewhat settled, and Sony and NEC workingtogether (although Samsung already similarlypartnered with Toshiba), has something changed? The real question seems to be is there any pointin HDTV owners buying a first generation player if combination units are right around the corner.
