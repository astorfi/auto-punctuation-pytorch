If you're prone to skipping the intro on House of Cards, you might want to ease off the fast-forward controls in the future. Why? Because finally you can enjoy that scenic tour of Washington DC in glorious 4K (you have a 4K TV, right?). Actually, it's not quite that simple, as TVs will reportedly need to have HEVC/H.265 decoding. While season two of Frank Underwood's evil scheming can already be enjoyed (as promised earlier this year) in the higher resolution, there's no word on what content will be next to get upgraded (though there are some wildlife documentaries to enjoy also). Some reviewers apparently got a first look at Frank's sharp(er) suit on the weekend, but the rest of us mortals might have to wait a little longer.
