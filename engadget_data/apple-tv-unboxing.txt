(Hey, what else you got going on to liven things up on a Thursday morning?) Obviously, the packaging and device are a sterling example of Apple minimalism, all the way down to the complete lack of video cables, which sucks for oodles of hapless buyers who are going to discover the absence of such just in time to make a whole 'nother trip to the electronics store. Stay tuned for some interface walkthroughs and various other tomfoolery once we can find ourselves a cable or two that won't look out of place sticking out of Stevie J's latest.
