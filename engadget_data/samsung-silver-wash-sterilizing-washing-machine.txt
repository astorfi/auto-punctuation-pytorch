electrolyzing 400 billion silver ions during the wash and rinse cycles, we might have chortled. But now we know better

garments in an environment that ensures germ-free stasis, it probably won't matter very much even though Samsung claims
the machine prevents future bacteria from clinging to the clothesâ€¦ if that's possible.
