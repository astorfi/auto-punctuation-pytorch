 Cashing in on the all-things-touchscreen craze, word comes to us from ZatzNotFunny that Logitech will be bringing updates to its Squeezebox lineup which include refreshed Boom and Duet specs and the all-new pictured "Squeezebox Touch." A bit redundant on the name, isn't that, Logitech? We'll also overlook the fact that "Squeezebox Touch" makes us think of something decidedly Chumby-ish, as details on the line updates are thin and the name could change. Either way, the device is definitely lacking in hard buttons, which is more to go on than the FCC line art of whatever Sonos is conjuring up with its CR200 controller.
