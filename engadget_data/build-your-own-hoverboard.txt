That completely un-PhotoShopped pic totally convinces us that this is for real, but DesignNews has some
rather spartan instructions (and yes, we realize these aren't the only ones out there) for how to make your very own
hoverboard. Supposedly the Hovaboard (are they trying to piss off Jay-Z?) can achieve a vertical lift of 5 centimeters
as long as you weigh less than 95 kg, and all you need are some boards, a lithium-ion battery, a motor controller, a
segmented hovercraft skirt, and of course, a few ounces of love.


 P.S. - Remember how there was always one kid at every junior high who was convinced that the hoverboards from Back
to the Future 2 were real? No? Forget it.
