Then Microsoft's now got you covered with a fairly extensive overview of its new Games Hub, which has actually been tweaked a bit further from earlier previews it's offered. One of the biggest changes is that the Hub now includes features previously relegated to the separate Xbox Live Extras app, including improved Xbox Live messaging, integrated achievements (complete with comparison views with your friends), and the ability to edit your Xbox Live profile -- not to mention fully animated 3D avatars. The Hub also boasts a new Collection view that promises to let you more easily manage your installed Windows Phone games, and it's literally been brightened up a bit across the board.
