No word on how much it'll cost you if you buy it direct from the source, although our previous post suggests a Â¥5,000 ($43) price point. PSP News reports that it'll work nicely with a few titles, including "Minna no Golf-jou," "Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops," "Planetarium Creator Ohira Takayuki Kanshuu: Home Star Portable," and "Navigation Soft." How did we ever navigate the world without this GPS antenna perched atop our PSP before?
