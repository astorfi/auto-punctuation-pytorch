 
 Ready to pack away the swim trunks and sunscreen and head back to school? If you're a lucky winner of our annual back to school sweepstakes, you'll surely be itching to make the return to campus. With last year's contest deemed an incredible success, we're stepping up the offering for 2012, adding higher-end devices in almost every category. There's an Ultrabook from HP, Sony's new mirrorless camera and a Samsung Galaxy S III, just to name a few. If your name is drawn, we'll be shipping you an overstuffed Engadget-branded Timbuk2 messenger bag, filled with prizes worth more than $3,000 in all. And to increase your chances of winning, we'll be giving away a total of 15 identical bags! That means 15 laptops, 15 cameras, 15 smartphones and 15 very happy Engadget readers. So what are you waiting for? Jump past the break to see the prizes, and be sure to enter in the comments below, and another 14 times on each of our back to school category pages, launching throughout the month.

 

 To reiterate, all of the giveaways will be identical, so feel free to enter by leaving a comment at each of our back to school posts (not including the back to school hub). (Note: you'll only be allowed to win once and multiple comments on a single post will not increase your chances of winning.) Please confirm that your commenting account includes an email address as well -- that's how we'll be contacting the winners. Good luck!

 Laptop            HP Envy Ultrabook 4  There's no shortage of Ivy Bridge Ultrabooks to choose from this season, and HP's 14-inch Envy is among the best-equipped. This super-slim model packs a 14-inch display, 4 gigs of RAM and a battery that promises to keep you going for up to eight hours on a single charge, giving you plenty of time to surf the web during lectures and catch a flick once you're home.  Key specs: 1.7GHz Intel Core i5 Ivy Bridge processor, 14-inch, 1,366 x 768 display, 4GB RAM, 4.5 lbs.  Price: $827 on Amazon     Digital Camera      Sony NEX-F3    Sony's NEX-F3 may not be an enormous improvement over last year's C3, but one of its banner features -- the front-facing LCD -- is sure to be a hit at parties on campus. That 921k-dot screen can also flip back for normal operation, and you can add on an EVF for even more flexibility. The camera kit includes an 18-55mm interchangeable lens, with the option to swap in your own Sony optics to boost image quality and focal range.

  Key specs: 16.1-megapixel stills, 1080/24p video, 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lens, 3-inch front-facing display.  Price: $598 on Amazon  
             Tablet           Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7.0)  An Ultrabook will get you connected when you're able to grab a table and chair, but how will you keep in contact as you queue up for class or hang out on the quad? Samsung's latest Tab delivers seven inches of Ice Cream Sandwich in a package that weighs just 0.76 pounds. It also serves as a universal remote, courtesy of the Smart Remote app and built-in IR blaster.  Key specs: 7-inch, 600 x 1,024 display, front and rear cameras, 8GB storage, 1GHz dual-core processor.  Price: $249 on Amazon     Smartphone      Samsung Galaxy S III (AT&T)  Smartphones don't get much better than this. Samsung's Galaxy S III has made its way to the US, and it's sure to be one of the hottest devices on campus. This AT&T model offers up to 9.2 hours of browsing and talk time and LTE connectivity -- assuming, of course, that it's available on campus. There's also an 8-megapixel camera with plenty of software enhancements, including Samsung's S Beam app for sharing content with other S III owners with a tap.  Key specs: 4.8-inch 1,280 x 720 display, dual-core 1.5GHz processor, 2GB RAM, 16GB built-in memory, Android 4.0 ICS.  Price: $189 on Amazon              E-reader             Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight  Tablets and smartphones can sub in for good ol' paper in small doses, but if you plan to spend an afternoon reading by the rec center pool you're gonna need a Nook. Barnes & Noble's latest e-reader offers a unique backlight feature to boot, letting you catch up on Cuckoo's Nest while your roommate's fast asleep.  Key specs: 6-inch touchscreen, 1-month battery with GlowLight on, adjustable fonts, weighs 7 ounces.  Price: $139 on Barnes & Noble     Headphones      AiAiAi Capital  With a few earbud options bundled with your other BTS devices, we figured you might appreciate some full-size cans as well.

Key specs: Weather-resistant design, 40mm drivers, folding function, in-line remote.  Price: $100 on Amazon             Hard drive    
         Western Digital My Passport (1TB)  You have a laptop with USB 3.0, so you're going to need a hard drive to go with it. Western Digital's My Passport is small enough to stay with you, and USB 2.0 compatibility means you'll be able to transfer docs between your own computer and those aging machines in the lab. It's also equipped with hardware encryption, so you can keep those party pics away from prying eyes.  Key specs: USB-powered, 1TB of storage, USB 3.0 and 2.0 compatibility, hardware encryption.  Price: $96 on Amazon     Laptop bag      Timbuk2 Commute Messenger  Made in San Francisco, Timbuk2's new Commute Messenger has made its way to the company's customize tool, and we've built one just for you!

    AOC 16-inch USB Monitor With power outlets often few and far between, you'll love the convenience of a USB-powered external display. This 15.6-inch AOC LED panel will effectively double your desktop.   $120 on Amazon             Spotify Premium (1-Year)  Spotify has enjoyed a very successful first year in the US, and its streaming music service remains one of the best. You'll receive a subscription code, valid for a full year.   $120         Satechi Energy Station You should be covered for a full day on campus, but it's never a bad idea to carry some backup juice. Satechi's 10,000 mAh Portable Energy Station will charge you up, and fast.   $60 on Amazon      
        Edifier Tick Tock  We hate to say it, but it's only a matter of time before your Flying Alarm Clock takes to the air for the very last time. When that time comes, Tick Tock will get you up, with Bluetooth audio to boot.   $52 on Amazon  
   
    Satechi 12-port USB Hub  That AOC monitor is certainly slick, but you'll need two USB ports to power it up. For those times when an outlet's nearby, this powered hub's got your back -- it'll deliver 12 ports of data and juice.   $30 on Amazon             NuForce Cube  AiAiAi will keep you jammin' solo, but how will you share those tunes with your friends?

       Carbonite Backup (1-Year)  There's a terabyte of capacity on your WD hard drive, but backing up to the cloud is never a bad idea. Carbonite's here to get you started with a year of completely automated backups and unlimited storage.   $59           AViiQ Ready Clips  Replacing ink with electronic exams and note taking? You can fill those unused pen slots with Ready Clips, which are roughly the size of a standard writing implement. Mini and micro-USB are supported, as is Apple's 30-pin dock connector.   $11 and up from Amazon          Targus Defcon 1  Now that you have a bag full of toys, you'll need a way to keep them secure.
