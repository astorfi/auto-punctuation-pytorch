When Samsung's GT-S7272 made its way through the FCC a few days ago, it existed as little more than a set of numbers. If SamMobile is on the ball, however, we may now have a face to go with those digits. The site claims to have an official shot of the phone, which might launch under the Galaxy Ace 3 badge. While it's hard to verify specs attached to the rumor, they line up with both the image and a few previous details. The Ace 3 may ultimately be a subtle evolution of its predecessor with a 4-inch WVGA screen, a dual-core 1GHz chip, Android 4.2 and design ideas borrowed from its bigger cousins. Will this diminutive device launch at Samsung's June 20th event, in tandem with the Galaxy S 4 Zoom? We can't say for sure, but we'll certainly be keeping our eyes open.
