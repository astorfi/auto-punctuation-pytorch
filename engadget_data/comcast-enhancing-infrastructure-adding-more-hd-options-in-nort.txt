 Comcast has been on quite the tear of late, and it seems it's not quite done for the year just yet. Apparently, the carrier will be making "infrastructure improvements to its Beaver Valley and Myersdale systems, which were acquired from Adelphia last year." Additionally, the North Hills / South Hills areas will be seeing unspecified "network upgrades" by next year, and the company's fiber network will be expanded from Morgantown, West Virginia to Myersdale in order to "launch its digital voice phone service." On the lineup front, users in the Pittsburgh region will reportedly gain History HD, USA HD, Sci-Fi HD, CW HD and Discovery HD, while customers in the ex-Adelphia sectors will receive Universal HD, HGTV HD, Food Network HD, A&E HD, National Geographic HD and MHD.
