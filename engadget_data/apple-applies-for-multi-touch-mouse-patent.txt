That's right, a multi-touch mouse building upon the touch-sensitive mouse patent app we've already seen from Apple. This beast would allow for a buttonless pointing device which could sense the position of your digits for a myriad of gestural and positional control. Whether this is a patent to safeguard a brewing idea or actual product in the pipeilne is anybody's guess. Surely this filing, along with those for a backside touch interface and touch sensitive bezel give us a clue as to Apple's product mindset. Multi-touch MacBook touchpads anyone?[Via PC Joint]
