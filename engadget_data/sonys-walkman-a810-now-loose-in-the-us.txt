 Hey, didn't we just see this little guy yesterday all blurry and rumory like? Sure enough, the new Walkman A810 series was just loosed in the US and doing pretty much everything the NW-A800 was doing for Europe and beyond. It's available in white, pink, or silver getups while maxing out storage with a black-only 8GB model (NWZ-A818BLK) just like we heard. 8GB will cost you a full $230 while the 2GB and 4GB models drop off to $140 and $180, respectively. That NWZ-S615F (with FM tuner) remains aloof but we're bound to hear something shortly.
