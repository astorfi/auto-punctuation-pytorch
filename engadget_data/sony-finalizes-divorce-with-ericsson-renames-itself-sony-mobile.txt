  More than half of America's married couples will tell you, breaking up is hard. Hard and expensive. After living in denial, dodging rumors and eventually coming to terms with the inevitable, Sony has finally taken over Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson's 50-percent stake in the pair's former joint venture, a move that was earlier reported to have cost â‚¬1.05 billion ($1.37 billion) to complete. The now fully Sony owned Sony Ericsson will be renamed Sony Mobile Communications, though a few of the outfit's already announced children are keeping their papa's name. Hit the break for Sony's small press release.
