Garmin's been doing the workout thing for a while now in the form of those big fitness-tracking watches. In celebration, no doubt, of the many miles we'll all be walking this week in Vegas, the company's edging in on Fitbit territory with the Vivofit. The band's got a curved display that'll greet you each morning with a daily goal based on your activity level, adjusting accordingly as you hit different milestones. Given Garmin's area of expertise, it's only natural that the device also tracks your progress, including distance, steps and calories -- it'll also send you a friendly reminder when it's time to get off your butt. The Vivofit arrives in Q1 of this year, priced at $130.
