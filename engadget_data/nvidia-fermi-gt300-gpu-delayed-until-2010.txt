Taiwanese industry sources say the release of its Fermi GT300 GPU has been delayed until Fiscal 2011, which for the company means not until at least late January 2010. That "NVIDIA New Year" fete you've been gloating about on Facebook? We really hope you can get the deposit back on the rented space.
