That's not much of a break, but it lets Google resume selling the phone on Google Play for several more days before there's a more definitive consideration on the merits of a preliminary injunction. We're still seeing the Android 4.1 phone listed only as "coming soon," but it may just be a matter of hours before Jelly Bean lovers get another taste.
