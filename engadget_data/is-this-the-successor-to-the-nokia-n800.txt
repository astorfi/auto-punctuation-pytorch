No specs are available yet, but we can tell just by looking at this device that the Finnish giant has been listening to user gripes and thrown in a retractable QWERTY keyboard -- a move that will surely win this product line its share of converts. We'll keep our ear to the ground for more details, but until then you can enjoy a few more pics after the break...
