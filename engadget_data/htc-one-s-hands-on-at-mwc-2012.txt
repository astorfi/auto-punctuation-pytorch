  The second of the One. That's another way to describe the HTC One S, the mid-range selection in the Taiwanese company's trio of new devices. Even though it should be considered middle of the road when being compared to a heavy hitter like the One X, it's not hurting for features in the slightest. The S's claim to fame is its scratch-resistant and durable aluminum backing, and adds a highly respectable list of mouth-watering specs to go along with it. Let's have a look-see: 4.3-inch qHD Super AMOLED panel, 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 (MSM8260A) processor, 1GB of DDR2 RAM, the same 8MP rear camera found on the One X along with a VGA front-facing cam, a smallish 1,605mAh battery and 42Mbps HSPA+ radios (which will come in handy when it shows up on T-Mobile this spring).While we've had the chance to drool all over its bigger brother, the One S still satisfies in nearly every way. The aluminum build was forged using a Micro Arc Oxidation process, and indeed affords us a feeling of security in case the skinny device were to slip through our hands. Given the firm grip we had on it, the chances of something like that happening would be rather slim anyway -- still, better safe than sorry. And the dual-core S4 chipset doesn't disappoint, either, and is going to be a slightly less expensive alternative for anyone who isn't a power user. Add in the same beautiful f/2.0 camera lens with all the Sense 4.0 trimmings, and this will likely stand well amongst its peers. As with the One X, we'd still prefer to see a physical camera button to take full advantage of the swift shutter speed and simultaneous video / still image capture.
