Samsung is showcasing their new H1000 clamshell/slider cellphone with support for
WiBro (South Korea's proprietary, yet
WiMax compatible, wireless broadband
solution) this week at the APEC IT Exhibition in South Korea. They'll also unveil the
M8000 and a WiBro PCMCIA card which will be available to
test on the WiBro service installed at the convention center. Korea will be rolling out their domestic WiBro service by
summer of 2006 and Samsung has already inked a deal with Sprint Nextel to equip a WiBro trial in these United States.
So yes, we might theoretically get our grubby mits on these. Another pic after after the break.
