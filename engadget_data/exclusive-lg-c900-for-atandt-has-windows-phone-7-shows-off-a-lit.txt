To that end, we present to you the LG C900, a rounded landscape slider equipped with a four-row keyboard and a simplified two-button capacitive layout beneath the screen paired with a chrome Windows key. Notably, this is the first time we've seen carrier branding on Windows Phone 7's home screen in the wild -- you can see AT&T's logo prominently displayed as a tile in one of the pictures in the gallery after the break. We're not sure we're digging the matte plasticky look up front, but to each his own, we suppose.
