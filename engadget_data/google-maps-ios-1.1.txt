 The very, very popular Google Maps application on iOS today received its first update, edging the version number from 1.0 to 1.1. In 1.1, users can search saved addresses of contacts from within the app, as well as browse by a variety of categories -- food, coffee, drinks, gas, post offices, hotels, grocery stores, pharmacies, movie theaters, malls, hospitals, atms, and attractions are all choosable (though we'd suggest maybe just calling 911 over searching for nearby hospitals in an emergency situation). The app is also headed (in English) to a smattering of new locales today: Bahrain, Egypt, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE (Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm al-Quwain).
