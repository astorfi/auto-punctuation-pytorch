Well, now the German site DigitalKamera's got some more info on it, as well as the a500. First up, the a850 will boast a 24.6 megapixel sensor, a 35mm CMOS sensor, an ISO range of 100 to 6400, and will be capable of shooting 3 frames per second, with a 3-inch, VGA display. The a500 -- about which a lot less info has been previously leaked -- will have a 12.3-megapixel sensor, an up 12800 ISO, with two live view modes (quick autofocus and direct view). There is still absolutely no official word on either of these bad boys, though we're hearing September -- so maybe we'll catch a glimpse of them at IFA -- we'll keep our eyes peeled until then. There's a shot of the a500 after the break.
