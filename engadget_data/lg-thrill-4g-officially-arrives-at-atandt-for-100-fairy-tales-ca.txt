After several weeks of unexplained delays, the AT&T-branded Optimus 3D is truly, honestly available on the carrier's website for sale at a respectable $100. The device, announced at CTIA 2011 in March, isn't hiding anything we didn't already know: it's got a 1GHz dual-core TI OMAP 4 CPU with 512MB of RAM, Froyo, a 4.3-inch 800 x 480 display, 1080p video capture and dual 5MP rear stereoscopic cameras to add the extra dimension. So if you've been waiting for this phone to get the green light, it's time to stop idling at the intersection.
