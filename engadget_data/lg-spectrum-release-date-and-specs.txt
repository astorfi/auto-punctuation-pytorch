This replacement for the Revolution will feature a dual-core 1.5GHz Snapdragon S3 SoC, along with a 4.5-inch, 1280 x 720 IPS display and an 8 megapixel camera with LED flash. The rear shooter is capable of recording video at 1080p, and there's also a 1.3 megapixel webcam up front. As you might've guessed, Ice Cream Sandwich will be nowhere in sight, but it'll feature Android 2.3 all the way. Rounding out the specs, users can expect 1GB of RAM, 4GB of internal storage and a 16GB microSD card. Like the Revolution, the Spectrum supports LTE on Verizon, although its 1830mAh battery is a significant upgrade over the 1500mAh forebear. According to internal documents, we can expect a January 19th arrival. No word on pricing yet, but if you're interested to see the complete spec sheet on this bad boy, which is nearly a dead ringer for the Nitro HD, make sure to hit up the source link below.
