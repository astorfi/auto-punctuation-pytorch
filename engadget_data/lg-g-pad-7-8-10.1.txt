LG hasn't quite pulled a Samsung with its new G Pad tablet family, but it's coming close by offering the slate in three different sizes: 7-, 8-, and 10.1-inch. We liked the original 8.3-inch G Pad tablet just fine, but found it was a little too expensive compared to others in the in the 7- to 8-inch size range. Pricing details aren't available yet so we don't know if the company has addressed that angle, but the new tablets will include all of LG's latest software tweaks like Knock Code unlocking, and QPair Bluetooth syncing of notifications with an Android smartphone. Information on availability is also TBA, but the public's first chance to put their greasy palms on these screens will come at the MedPl 2014 trade show this week in Monaco -- we're sure you were already on your way there.
