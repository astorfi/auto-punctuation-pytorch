 

The Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) officially kicks off on Tuesday morning, but press attendees have packed schedules starting bright and early tomorrow AM. Microsoft's kicking things off with its briefing, which promises new Xbox One details and a major focus on games. Sony, meanwhile, is officially unveiling its new PlayStation 4 hardware, having teased the look of the new box and naming its nighttime E3 briefing as the big reveal. We'll also hear more on EA and Ubisoft's next-gen console plans, and Alienware's got its own briefing to close out the night. It's going to be quite a busy day. Come Tuesday, Nintendo is welcoming select show goers at its exhibition booth for a sneak peek at new Wii U titles, before E3 opens for business at noon Pacific Time. And that's to say nothing of the Oculus Rifts and OUYAs of the world, not to mention any unknowns.


You'll find a plethora of liveblogs, news stories and hands-on posts on our homepage throughout the week, but we're also rounding everything up at our E3 2013 event hub, which we'll update in realtime with all the gaming news fit to print, straight from downtown Los Angeles.
