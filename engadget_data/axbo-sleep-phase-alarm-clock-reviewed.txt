Martin Regtien doesn't seem to think so, and after reviewing the Sleeptrackeras well, he seems to think the aXbo not only bests its rival, but happens to be one of the best systems on the marketfor waking up right. Unfortunately, he didn't receive the USB cable with his review unit that allows you to check outyour sleep patterns with your computer, but he did have an easy time setting up and using the actual aXbo. Turns outthe wristband sensors are plenty comfortable, but though you can set separate alarms for both you and your partner,Martin's wife was wakened by his alarm. He suggests that the makers of aXbo create a vibrating alarm for the ultimatein sleep bliss, but for the casual user the aXbo seems to fit the bill exactly if you're prepared to fork over the$250.[Via Gadget Review]
