The i7-740QM and its senior sibling are straight replacements for the i7-x20QM models: they retain the same cache and eight-threaded operational paradigm while jacking default and Turbo Boost clock speeds up to a maximum 3.2GHz single-core pace on the i7-840QM. Best of all? Dell's price for the 740QM is currently lower than that for its predecessor, so you might wanna order one up before somebody wakes up -- literally and figuratively -- over at Round Rock HQ.
