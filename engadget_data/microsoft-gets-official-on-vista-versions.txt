       Ok, we've finally got the real poop on thoseMicrosoft Vista releases. Insteadof 8 versions, there will be 6, with three of those for home users, two for business, and one for emerging markets.Oh, and they're required to release a couple of European versions too without that pesky Windows media player. Soactually, it's prettymuch what we already told you, eh? Anyway, Microsoft likes to point out that XP already ships in 6 flavas with Vistaversions organized by what people plan to do with their computer, not what kind of hardware they have. So, here's theofficial rundown:Vista Starter -- Streamlined version meant for low-powered PCs indeveloping nations.Vista Home Basic -- For those content to browse the web, use email, andcreate and edit basic documents from their PC. Includes destop search and security tools.Vista HomePremium -- Includes everything in Basic but also includes the Aero graphical interface, Media Centerfunctionality, and ability to connect to Xbox 360. The version most of us will own at home.VistaBusiness -- The basic version for companies of all sizes with tools to help organizations manage their PCs.Vista Enterprise -- Includes everything in the basic business version with improved encryptionand BitLocker system to keep data from being read on a stolen computer.Vista Ultimate --All the features of Home and Business in one.[Thanks, Tony]
