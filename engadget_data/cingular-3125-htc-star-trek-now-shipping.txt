This re-branded HTC Star Trek will set you back $149 after online discounts assuming you go for the ol' 2-year contract, that is. And yeah, we'll run down the specs on this WinMo flip one last time for ya: Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone, 1.3 megapixel cam, Bluetooth, Direct Push mail, quad-band GSM with GPRS/EDGE, 128MB ROM / 64MB RAM and a 2.2-inch TFT display all powered by a 200 MHz TI proc. So giddy up dog, just don't tell 'em Engadget sent ya.
