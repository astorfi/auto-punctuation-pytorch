The iPod and the BMW are already best friends (or something along those lines), but not to be outdone, palmOne
proves it can pimp a German ride as well as the next gadget maker and has teamed up with Audi. The gist of the deal is
that Bluetooth-enabled Audi cars'll be able to automatically pair up with palmOne's new Treo 650 for use as hands-free
speakerphone and that you'll also be able to use the smartphone to control various features of the car (though we're
not quite sure which ones). Expect some sort of big proper announcement soon, but palmOne was already showing this
dealy off at CTIA the other day.
