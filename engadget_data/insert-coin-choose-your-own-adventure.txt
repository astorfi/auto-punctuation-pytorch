In Insert Coin, we look at an exciting new tech project that requires funding before it can hit production. If you'd like to pitch a project, please send us a tip with "Insert Coin" as the subject line.

There may be an iPad version of Choose Your Own Adventure coming, but will it happen or not? It's up to you to decide. That's how the creators of the famed series of children's books are cheekily pitching their new Kickstarter campaign for an app called Choose 'Toons. The first title, Your Very Own Robot (based on the book) would have you, er, your kids putting together a droid named Gus from discarded robot lab parts. It would feature 20 branches, 11 possible endings and over 30 minutes of total animation. Such productions are pricy, however, so that's where Kickstarter comes in. The creators are looking for $130,000 to fund the project, and backers will be able to pick up the iPad app around May 2014 starting at $6 (an Android version could come later). Other pledge levels will get you a custom stylus ($18), a chance to beta test the app before others ($30) and even your likeness drawn into background of the app ($90). Naturally, all that depends on your "numerous talents and enormous intelligence" -- hit the source to choose.




Previous project update: For any DIY keyboardists wanting to expand their repertoire, TouchKeys is just over halfway to its Â£30,000 goal with three weeks left.
