Naturally, with fierce competition from all sides, the Taiwanese PC maker isn't going to achieve this by simply slapping the Eee logo onto everything it can build; acquisitions are the key to that kind of rapid growth. So it's no surprise to hear Jonney Shih, ASUS chairman, listing Toshiba's PC business amongst its possible targets for acquisition according to the Commercial Times. After all, Toshiba's estimated 5% global marketshare is enough to bring ASUS within wrastlin' distance of Round Rock, Tejas. In a shocking admission by Shih, talks have already begun but the results are not yet finalized.
