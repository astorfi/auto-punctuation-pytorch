Every time something like this crops up you start hearing us
talk
"convergence"
here on Engadget, but we rarely
pinpoint exactly what we mean. Well, we'll tell you what
we mean. We mean exactly the kind of convergence you see in Whirlpool's TV-microwave oven that makes it easier on
yourself in combining your two laziest habits: idly watching TV while nuking unfresh food. Where do we sign up? It
better be online because we're not getting up to go to the freaking store, not for food, and not for devices
to cook 'em.
