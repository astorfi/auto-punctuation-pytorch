Last week we did the Wrist Watch Walk-Talkie. This
week, we bring you the Garmin Forerunner 201 GPS Watch.

What it is:Â This watch has all the goodness of a GPS packed in to a small form factor and geared
towards the gadget wielding jogger. It calculates speed, location, and altitude as you run. Software syncs up with you
computer to keep track of distances and progress.

Why we like it: The best part of using a GPS watch is you can use it to take routes and create your
own custom photo maps. If you'd like to do this too, check out
our How-To article.

Where to get it and how much: You can pick one up on Amazon for usually less than $129.
