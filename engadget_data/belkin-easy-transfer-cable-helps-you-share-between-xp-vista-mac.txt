 Belkin's just come out with its Easy Transfer Cable, which we're guessing by the cryptic name allows you to, um, easily transfer stuff via the magic of USB. You plug one end into your XP machine, and another into your Vista box, and voil√†, the bits start flying. Belkin claims that this eight-foot cable will transfer at speeds of up to 480Mbps (yep, that's standard USB 2.0, indeed), which translates to 30GB in an hour. Is this convenience worth a pair of Jacksons ($40)? We'll let you decide for yourself.
