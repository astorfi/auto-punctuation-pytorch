It wouldn't be the first time ASUS saw a US smartphone launch -- though last time the company had the GPS experts at Garmin to help it find its way. This time, according to Jonney Shih, the maker of both the Padfone and Fonepad (coincidence?) is looking to take a more direct route. The ASUS chairman told All Things D that his company has been making progress building bridges with retailers and carriers alike in an attempt to succeed in the already crowded US market. And while it may not be impossible, a 2013 launch is looking unlikely. "I think next year is more reasonable," he told the site.
