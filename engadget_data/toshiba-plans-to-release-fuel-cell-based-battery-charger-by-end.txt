 Toshiba's finally ready to enter the fuel cell market, or at least it's saying as much. The company announced this week that it'll release a direct methanol fuel cell-based (DMFC) battery charger this fiscal quarter, before the end of March. Toshiba also said it'll launch DMFC packs for cellphones and laptops in the following fiscal year that begins in April. Details are pretty scant at the moment, and given the technology's past track record, we wouldn't be surprised if it missed the upcoming deadline. Here's hoping our skepticism is unfounded.
