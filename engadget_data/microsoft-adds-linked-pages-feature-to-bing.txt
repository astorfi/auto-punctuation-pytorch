   Looks like Microsoft isn't done flipping the switch on fresh bits within its beloved search engine. The new feature, dubbed Linked Pages, can "decide how you look to your first crush" by allowing you to select which results are actually related to you. If you're bent on making it easier for people to stalk you, then all you need to do is pop in your Facebook credentials and allow the Bing app to do its magic once it's accessed your account. The Redmond folks say you'll be able to link anything from a blog, personal site, organizations or your friends (just make sure to ask first). Unfortunately those of you outside of the States looking to Bing yourself are out of luck for now. In the meantime, head past the break to check out a full-on tutorial courtesy of The Bing Team.
