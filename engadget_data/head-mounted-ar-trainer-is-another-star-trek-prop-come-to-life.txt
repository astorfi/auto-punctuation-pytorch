Japan's institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology is putting the finishing touches on a device to help newbies through complex and dangerous jobs. A head-mounted GoPro Hero 2 HD relays a picture back to an expert, who directs the action while wearing colored gloves. Using color separation, just the hand movements are sent back to the user, processed by a Toughbook in a backpack and overlaid onto the Shimadzu Data Glass HUD. There's nothing special about the tech, but that's what makes it so likely we'll see this making the leap to reality -- more so, because all of the components are off-the-shelf. The only issue is with the unit's software calibration, which takes far too long, but AIST hopes to remedy this over time. Just be careful if you see a backseat driver with blue gloves -- they could make your life miserable.
