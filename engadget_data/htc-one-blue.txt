The HTC One has seen a few different colors in its days -- silver, black and "glamour red" come to mind -- but we haven't actually seen one of the company's flagships in blue until now. It appears that this rumored blue variant is about to get official, though: that press render up there comes courtesy of leakster @evleaks, who claims the phone should be showing up sometime this year. We're not seeing any carrier branding, which indicates that it would likely be released in other parts of the world besides the US, such as Europe, but we certainly don't want to rule out a possible appearance on this side of the Atlantic either.


Update: PhoneArena is reporting that the blue-colored One has been seen in Verizon's internal systems, so it's possible we will indeed see this particular color option here in the states. [Thanks all!]
