Apple just affirmed that this year's Worldwide Developers Conference will indeed kick off on Monday, June 8th, and the keynote address will be given at 10:00AM PT (so 1:00PM here on the right coast, and 7:00AM on the gorgeous isle of Maui). The big news, however, isn't that we'll be there live for every last word ('cause you already knew that, yes?) -- it's that Philip Schiller and company, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing, will be manning the address, offering devs an "in-depth" look at iPhone OS 3.0 and OS X Snow Leopard. In fact, attendees can expect a "final Developer Preview release" of the forthcoming OS, but you'll have to wait a few weeks yet to get details beyond that.
