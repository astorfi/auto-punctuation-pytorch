Substantiating said claim is the Everex gPC, which recently did an outstanding job of frustrating and disappointing reviewers at PCMag. Put simply, the gPC was found to be aggravatingly underpowered, and was deemed "one of those PCs you buy as a gift for the holidays and return to the store in January." Additionally, the crew stated that it really functioned best (read: only) as a web-based PC, and while we're sure the operating system will strike people differently depending on their level of computer literacy, these reviewers found a myriad reasons to pile on the hate. Overall, the 1.5 out of 5 rating essentially speaks for itself, but if you're curious to see how a desktop could be slammed this hard, feel free to hit the read link and take a gander.
