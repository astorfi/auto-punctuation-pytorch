That long-teased Motorola X phone might be approaching an official release, if you believe what you're staring at above. Phone Arena says it received the glare-heavy photo from a source that's testing it for Sprint's LTE network. We've already seen official FCC documents pointing to a Now Network future for the Motorola smartphone, while other filings tally with the shape of the device seen here. Aside from a first look at the device sans hardware-disguising casing, there's nothing more to cement rumored specs, although it appears that it will arrive with a screen around the 4.5- to 4.7-inch region -- a size that's suddenly starting to look pretty middle-of-the-road.
