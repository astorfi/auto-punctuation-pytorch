Just like the TiVo Premiere and XL here in the US, the current model has a 1TB hard drive while forum posts indicate a 500GB "baby TiVo" model could be announced next week and arrive in late spring. We'll wait for some official word before knitting lil' TiVo booties, but if the current asking price for the Virgin Media TiVo -- which recently added BBC iPlayer catch-up support to its list of features -- is just too much for you to take the leap, the situation could take a turn for the better shortly.
