Syria's done it before, and now it appears that the troubled nation has dropped its web connection again, according to Google's Transparency Report and other online sources. The outage appears to have begun just before 3PM ET, according to Google's report, and has yet to be resolved nearly three hours later. It's not entirely clear what's caused the outage, but based on educated speculation surrounding previous incidents, it wouldn't be out of the question to conclude that the government was behind this latest interruption. For now, the country remains in the dark -- we'll update this post just as soon as that's resolved.
