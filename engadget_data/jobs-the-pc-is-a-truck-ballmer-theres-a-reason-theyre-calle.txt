Ballmer snap. When it comes right down to it, though, both CEOs expressed relatively similar visions about the prevalence and importance of multiple computing form factors in the future and mostly differed on semantics -- Ballmer came right out and said he thinks the iPad is actually a PC, and we're pretty sure Jobs thinks it... isn't. Check our edited video after the break to watch these two go at it across space and time, and then check our Ballmer liveblog / video highlights and Jobs liveblog / video highlights for more.
