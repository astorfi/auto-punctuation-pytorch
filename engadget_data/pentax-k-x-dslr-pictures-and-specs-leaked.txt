Highlights include a 12.4 megapixel CMOS image sensor with stabilization, 720p / 24 frames per second HD video recording, a 2.7-inch LCD screen, and ISO sensitivity ranging from 100 to 12,800. Consider our interest piqued, but unfortunately we've got no indication when this will see the official light of day -- but with press photos propagating somewhere, we're hoping the waiting isn't too much longer.
