Sonos' Play:3 speaker ran away with our editors' choice award back in 2011, so there's probably a little pressure on the device that's just turned up at the FCC. Ahead of any official announcement, the Play:1 has been outed toting 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi, all thanks to our boys in blue lab coats. Now that the hardware has been deemed fit for human consumption, we can expect some more solid news in the near future. The only question left, therefore, is if "1" is above or below "3" in the minds of Sonos' marketing department.
