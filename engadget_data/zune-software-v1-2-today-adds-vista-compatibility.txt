That said, the Zune team is adding Vista support today in a 22MB update that also claims to fixes bugs, improve the installation process (thank god), and hopefully generally help keep the loathing of Zune to a minimum. Now we're wondering if we'd have had as much trouble with firmware v1.2 yesterday if we'd have waited for software v1.2, too.P.S. -Update goes live at 10:00AM PST, set your downloaders for stun.
