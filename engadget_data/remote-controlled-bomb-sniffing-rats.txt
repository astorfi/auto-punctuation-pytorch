Remote-controlled rats are old news, but the researchers behind the original RC rat project have recently made
another breakthrough, demonstrating the ability to switch on the rats' "sniffer dog" instincts at will. With the new
super rats, a controller can steer the rat to a specific location, then switch on the critter's sniffing senses so they
can locate drugs or explosives. The rats themselves are also trained to find the tiny chemical traces from drugs and
explosives, so they presumably won't get distracted if someone is packing some cheese.
