Ok, it's not as thin as their N76 but let's give 'em some credit here for trying. Having fermented in the rumor mill for a few weeks, we now have ourselves a fully mature Nokia 6120 Classic running S60 3rd Edition, Feature Pack 1 over quad-band GSM and WCDMA/HSDPA 850/2100. The handset packs a 2-inch QVGA display, A2DP stereo Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR, a 2 megapixel camera with flash, and MicroSD slot to store your media. A pre-tax, pre-contract price of â‚¬260/$352 will get you up close and personal when these hit sometime before June lets out. Check all the pics in the gallery below. Sorry, only a tiny backside pic for now; Nokia's being a bit shy 'bout their junk.
