Sixense might not be a household name, but its electromagnetic motion sensing technology crops up in the darndest places. The 1:1 tracking technology is used in medical rehabilitation and Japanese arcade games, but it's most widely known as the wizardry behind the Razer Hydra motion controller. Now the company is gearing up to release a spiritual successor to the Hydra, the Sixense Stem System.


Like the Hydra, Stem offers six degrees of motion-tracking freedom, albeit without the wires or Razer branding. It isn't necessarily more accurate, but it is more comprehensive -- it's a modular system that offers up to five trackable modules, or "Stems," that attach to game controllers, VR headsets, accessories or even appendages. We caught up with Sixense president and CEO Amir Rubin to learn more about the Stem's Kickstarter launch and the company's first foray into the consumer product space.




"I come from a professional simulation background," Rubin told us. "Military and sports. I became an expert in motion tracking technologies." Before founding Sixense, Rubin helped create simulations that trained soldiers and shaped Calloway golf balls. It was when the Nintendo Wii's motion controller caught the public's attention that he started seriously thinking about the consumer space. "It wasn't just coming and going... Nintendo was breaking the ice and introducing motion tracking to the masses, opening it to a broader audience." Even so, the Wii's inertial sensors were too simplistic for Rubin, and he co-founded Sixense with an aim to do better. The company eventually settled on electromagnetic tracking -- an accurate, wireless technology that could keep track of orientation and position with a high degree of precision.
