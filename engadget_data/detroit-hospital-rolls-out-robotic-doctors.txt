 Detroit Medical Center has become the latest hospital to test
robotic "doctors" developed by InTouch Health, a California company that specializes in "remote presence" for
healthcare. The bots are essentially wheeled, white-coated units topped with two-way displays that allow doctors to
check in on patients from remote locations. The robots, each of which costs hospital $3,500 per month, were previously
tested at UCLA Medical Center. Given that one doctor has already rolled out a
robotic nurse, we imagine it will only be a matter of
time before hospitals are fully automated and the only humans patients come in contact with will be in the billing
department. Oh, wait. They've already been replaced by machines.
