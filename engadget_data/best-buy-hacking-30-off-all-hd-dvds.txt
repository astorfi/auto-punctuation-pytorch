At least, that's what we've confirmed for a number of locations. As of now, there's no word on whether the HD DVD players themselves will see equally steep price cuts, but feel free to drop by your local Best Buy at lunch and stock up if you so choose. 'Course, we've got a sneaking suspicions this 30-percent will grow to 50-percent and beyond in the not-too-distant future, but alas, the selection will probably be quite poor by that time.[Thanks, Tim and Vince][Image courtesy of Aaron S.]
