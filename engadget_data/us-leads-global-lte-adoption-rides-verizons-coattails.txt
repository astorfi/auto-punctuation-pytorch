According to Pyramid Research, by the end of the year, the United States will claim 47 percent of LTE subscriptions globally. This is thanks in large part to three mobile operators: Verizon, MetroPCS and AT&T have created seven million connections across the country. Combine that with the fact that 71 percent of all LTE handsets will be in the pockets of Yanks by year's end, and you've got a formula for domestic LTE domination. It comes as no surprise that VZW is the largest LTE operator in the US as it's been making money hand over fist lately -- which has allowed it to expand its high speed network at a dizzying pace. We salute you, Big Red, for carrying the banner for the ol' US of A, blazing the trail littered with dead batteries and over-worked phone chargers.
