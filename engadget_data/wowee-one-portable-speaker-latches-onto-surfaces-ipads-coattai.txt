As with other similar devices, the WOWee One conducts sound through any surface you rest it on (even a wall with an optional attachment), but it also has the benefit of patented "Gel Audio" technology, which promises to produce bass frequencies about three octaves below any other comparable device. You'll also apparently get about 20 hours of use from the built-in rechargeable battery, and your choice of three different colors -- all for the not so low price of $79.99. Head on past the break for a quick video.
