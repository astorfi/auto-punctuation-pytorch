 Originally a $600 piece of kit and released at $400, Amazon and Dash have been drilling away at the Dash Express pricetag since its conception. The unit permanently hit $300 in June, but we're getting the one-day-only vibe on this latest sale: Amazon's offering the Dash Express Navigator as its Gold Box deal of the day for a mere $200 (monthly fees notwithstanding). Not bad for an internet-connected, ultra-extensible navigation device -- in fact, not too bad for 4.3-inch GPS device of any sort, even if those maps are still mega-ugly.
