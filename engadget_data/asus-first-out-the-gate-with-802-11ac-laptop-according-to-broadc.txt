According to the wireless chip manufacturer, ASUS's G75VW gaming laptop will have the honor of being the first machine on the market with an 802.11ac radio inside. During a press event, Broadcom's Michael Hurlston dubbed the PC the "World's first 5G Wi-Fi laptop," saying that it would be available "very shortly." Our cohorts over at Engadget Spanish got hands-on with the lappy last month, but found it's spec sheet decidedly lacking in next-gen WiFi brags. The G75VW had Ivy Bridge under the hood, a 1080p display and a GeForce GTX 670M -- but no 802.11ac. Presumably the discrepancy is due to a planned product refresh, and not to an error on Broadcom's part. ASUS also has an 802.11ac router on deck, and Hurlston claims a desktop motherboard is in the works too. For more, check out the watch on your wrist... it's waiting time.
