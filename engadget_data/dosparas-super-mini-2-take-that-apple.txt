Lucky for us -- or at least our Japanese friends -- DosPara seems to have managed both feats, and they even tossed in some Core 2 Duo action in there, just to show off. We couldn't really ask for much better specs on this little 1.7-inch thick dynamo. Beyond the 1.66GHz T5500 C2D processor, the box runs a dual-layer DVD burner, gigabit Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g WiFi, a 4-in-1 card reader, DVI and S-Video outs, and a TV tuner on the WMCE version. The 512MB of ram and 80GB HDD aren't quite as exciting, but we'll live. Unfortunately, the price isn't so hot, at 122,580 Yen ($1,043 US) for the base version and 139,980 Yen ($1,191 US) for the WMCE unit. Still, we like what we see, and we think we'll have to wish Apple and AOpen better luck next time.[Via Akihabara]
