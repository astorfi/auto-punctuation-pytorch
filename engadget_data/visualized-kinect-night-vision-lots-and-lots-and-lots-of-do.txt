Judging by the videos that have been uploaded to YouTube, this is the kind of thing that will entertain the whole "hackey sack and Rasta hats" crowd for years to come, and to be honest, we're kind of digging it ourselves. Hell, we might even have to dig out that old Bob Marley black light poster. See for yourself after the break.
