While the job listing in question is technically for Microsoft's Mobile Communications Business, which oversees Windows Phone, it's clear that some things have changed since the Entertainment & Devices shakeup: "We are the team that shipped the Zune HD," the post reads. It appears that there's a new group within Microsoft called the Portable Entertainment Group which isn't afraid to design its own hardware and includes the Zune team, though whether that hardware be Zune, phone or something more obscure still remains to be seen.
