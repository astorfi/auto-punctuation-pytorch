A little more information trickles out regarding Apple's
iTunes 4.8 update: looks like the iTunes Music Store is actually selling some video content already. The videos are
not DRM'd (get outta Dodge!) and come in .mp4 format encoded in 3ivx 4.5, and so far look like they're being included
with the purchase of regular albums â€” no word on whether or not you can buy just the videos a la carte. The clips play
either in the area where the cover art is usually displayed, or can be played full screen.
