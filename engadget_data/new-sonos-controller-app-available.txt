Should you own any Sonos audio gear, you've probably been on pins and needles waiting for the company's big (and frankly overdue) controller app revamp. Well, it's here: starting today, both Android and iOS users can snag the redesigned remote without having to sign up for a beta test. As before, the centerpiece is a universal search that makes it easier to find music, whether it's on your phone or a streaming service like Google Play. You'll also get a truly modern-looking interface that's far simpler for both finding your next tune and setting up multi-room sound. The app is available as we write this, so have at it if you're a fan of Sonos' wireless speaker tech.
