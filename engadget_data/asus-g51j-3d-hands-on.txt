Luckily, the ASUS G51J 3D doesn't skimp on the graphics power, despite its almost-pretty-portable 15.6-inch size. We checked out Left 4 Dead 2 in 3D on the machine, using the included NVIDIA 3D setup, and were pretty impressed by the gaming graphics and what 3D adds the experience. The technology is obviously maturing, and the thought of being able to do this on a portable machine makes it even more consumer friendly -- it's not like anyone buys desktops anymore. Our only gripe with the machine is that it's pretty generic and even ugly looking, and the display itself is sharp and bright but suffers from some odd viewing angle problems: the blacks have a tendency to flip out when we get slightly off axis. Viewing some stills shot on Fujifilm's FinePix REAL 3D W1 camera, however, really showed off how vibrant the display is, and as long as you stay on the straight and narrow (most 3D applications are single user anyway) you should be fine.
