RunKeeper has a solid track record when it comes to giving users new ways to interact with the application. It's no surprise, then, that the fitness-focused app is getting some fresh tidbits on Android. Most notably, you'll now see a training plan feature, which is set to coincide with the goals you've set up within the app. This version also brings a redesigned "Me" tab, an option to keep a close eye on training schedules and the ability to view your workout history. It's a very nice update, to say the least -- and given that it's Monday, it couldn't have come at a better time to inspire your next run.
