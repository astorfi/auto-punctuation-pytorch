Remember Project Cars, the beautiful sim racer from the team behind Need for Speed: Shift? Well, it's finally coming out, and relatively soon. Or at least that's what developer Slightly Mad Studios is promising, anyway. After three embarrassing delays, we've got a new release date for your calendar: May 6th. The game will be available first on PC (via Steam) in the US before a staggered international release on PS4 and Xbox One: it'll arrive in Europe and Australasia on May 7th, followed by the UK on May 8th and North America on May 12th. There's no word on the Wii U version though, which is a little worrying.



Sony and Microsoft's latest consoles already offer a few realistic driving games (Forza Motorsport 5, Forza Horizon 2, Driveclub, etc.) but Project Cars is shaping up to be a worthy contender, at least in the graphics department. The latest trailers and screenshots look drop-dead gorgeous, with pixel-perfect cars and immersive weather effects. As usual, it seems PC will be the optimal platform if you have a high-end gaming rig though. The game supports a whopping 12K resolution, which trumps the 1080p and 60 frames per second offered on the PS4, well as the 900p and 60 frames per second found on Xbox One. Not that many people have three 4K monitors lying around, but at least the option's there.
