Good news, then, that Apple is apparently working with the Unicode Consortium in an effort to bring more breadth to the emoji pictures it can offer. Katie Cotton, Apple's VP of Corporate Communications, explains in an email reply to MTV Act's Joey Parker, who raised the issue:



"Our emoji characters are based on the Unicode standard, which is necessary for them to be displayed properly across many platforms. There needs to be more diversity in the emoji character set, and we have been working closely with the Unicode Consortium in an effort to update the standard."



There's no firm date for an emoji upgrade until the Unicode issue is sorted, so for now, well, there's stickers elsewhere. 


(Update: There's also been a recent groundswell for the less important addition of a hot-dog emoji.)
