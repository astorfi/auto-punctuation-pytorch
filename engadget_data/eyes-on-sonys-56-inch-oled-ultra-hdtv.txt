 If you've ever seen an OLED TV, you'd you'd remember it. Same can be said about 4k. Combine the two together and you truly have a sight to see -- which is exactly what Sony has done. Of course it is very difficult to judge picture quality when a TV is on a stage vs in your living room. That doesn't mean we aren't impressed and it doesn't mean we won't be looking forward to the day we can see our favorite content on it in the comfort of our own home -- assuming of course, that one is affordable in our lifetime.
