Spotted out in the wilds of Canada once again, the much anticipated Hercules handset -- a confirmed Galaxy S II variant -- has been captured in not-quite-Mr. Blurrycam form over on MobileSyrup. The device, shown here running on Telus' network, is rumored to pack a 4.5-inch Super AMOLED Plus display, 2 megapixel front-facing camera, 42Mbps HSPA+ radio and a 1.2GHz dual-core Qualcomm processor -- although that Quadrant score could very well indicate an Exynos chip. While we still lack any firm release dates for the phone's Northern American debut, we'd bet that leaked T-Mobile October launch is a good yardstick for soon.
