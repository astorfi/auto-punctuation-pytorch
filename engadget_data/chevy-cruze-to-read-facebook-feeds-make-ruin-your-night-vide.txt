An early Super Bowl ad peek has revealed that the aforesaid automobile has the ability to read back statuses on command, giving you one less reason to keep your mind on the task at hand (read: driving) and one more reason to make The Zuck even richer. Go on and mash play below, but don't expect any details on how exactly this whole setup works. Something tells us it's tied to a BT-enabled smartphone, but hopefully we'll find out the nitty-gritty sooner rather than later.
