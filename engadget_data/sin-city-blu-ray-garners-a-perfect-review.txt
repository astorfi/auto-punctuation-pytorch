 How better to follow up the great DVD box set version of Sin City than with an all-out Blu-ray version (Sin City - Recut, Extended, Unrated)? From the review at HollywoodChicago, that's exactly what Disney did -- the two-disc set scored across the whole trifecta: the video (thankfully) kept the 1.85:1 aspect ratio and accurately captured the abundant dark area details, the 5.1-channel DTS-HD MA audio track left nothing behind and even the extra features provided something for diehard fans and more casual viewers who want to rearrange the jump-cut narrative into linear form for individual characters. Say what you will about a lack of colorific range in the movie, but it's Blu-ray releases that fully deliver the director's vision and one-up the DVD that will get people into Blu-ray despite its premium price.
