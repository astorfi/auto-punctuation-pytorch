Maybe we're just cynics when it comes to cable and satellite providers, but with TV Everywhere and Fancast Xfinity out there, it's hard for us to imagine our provider doing something as cool as connecting this sleek 700u to a standard issue HD DVR. We only wish we could grab this from the store, plug only a USB cable into our set-top box and start streaming video around the internet -- apparently the box configures itself. No, that would just be too easy, but thanks for getting our hopes up Sling.
