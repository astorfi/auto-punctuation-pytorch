From word-of-mouth, to papyrus scrawl, to Gutenberg pressâ€¦ we now bring you da
Bible, in SMS 4m. No we're not kidding. A member of
the Bible Society in Australia has translated all 32,173 verses in just "four weeks" (!) into
SMS-style text. They
even provide a free download
from their site so you can send God nuggets like "In da Bginnin God cre8d da heavens & da earth" to those in need of a little churchin'
up. [Warning: link may invoke choir singing and potential wrath of The
Maker]
