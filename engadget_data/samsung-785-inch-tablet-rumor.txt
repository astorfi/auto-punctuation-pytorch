   Just six days have elapsed since the unveiling of Apple's third-generation iPad, and the rumor mill is already wildly speculating about what's in store for the next one. Korea Times has quoted an unnamed (yeah) Samsung official who has said that we can expect a 7.85-inch version of the tablet to arrive by the end of the year. As usual, it's fair to point out that the company is famous for producing a wide variety of prototypes, so we won't be delaying that pre-order. On firmer ground, they mentioned that as a key component supplier to the iPad, the Korean giant will earn around $10 billion manufacturing Cupertino's NAND flash chips, displays, mobile DRAM and processors -- so no matter who wins the tablet wars, the manufacturing conglomerate will probably do quite well.
