As it turns out, that new world is actually very familiar, consisting of an Arris six tuner DVR and multiroom companion box. The Gateway (pictured above) is a six tuner DVR with a CableCARD slot, 500GB hard drive, WiFi, DLNA and an HD guide that looks just like the Moxi DVR technology Arris purchased over a year ago. The Total Home Portal is the multiroom box that appears to be a refreshed edition of the Moxi Mate extender that lacks its own tuner or hard drive but can stream live or recorded video from the gateway. The cost of one Gateway and Portal is $600 up front or $17/month, while an extra portal is $178 or $5/month. They're currently only available in Calgary and are due to arrive elsewhere in Canada later this summer.
