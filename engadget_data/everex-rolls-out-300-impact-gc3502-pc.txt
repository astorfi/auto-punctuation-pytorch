Helping it in that department is the pre-loaded OpenOffice software, which shouldn't be too taxing on the system's 1.5GHz VIA C7-D processor and 1GB of RAM. Rounding out the specs, you'll find an 80GB hard drive, a DVD/CD-RW combo drive, integrated Ethernet (no WiFi), and VIA Chrome9 HC IGP integrated graphics. Needless to say, gamers need not apply, but those less demanding can get the system now exclusively at Wal-Mart.
