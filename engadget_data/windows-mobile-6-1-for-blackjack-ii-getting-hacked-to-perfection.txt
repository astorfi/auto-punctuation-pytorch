 Why wait for an official announcement and an upgrade that may (or may not) come at some point in the distant future? Do any of us really have the patience for such tomfoolery? We don't think so, which is why it warms our hearts to see the whole BlackJack community huddling together to create, test, and perfect a Windows Mobile 6.1 stack for their beloved devices. It's still in the beta phase, but it's plenty real and the testers are plenty active, giving us hope it'll be stable enough for widespread consumption in the not-too-distant future. At this point, it seems like there's a 6.1 group rallying around virtually every WinMo device out there -- so have hope, (insert device name here) user.[Thanks, MikeyB]
