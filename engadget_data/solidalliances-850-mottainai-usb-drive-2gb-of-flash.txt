Obviously, at 2GB it's not about capacity here, this gold and brass drive is a salute to ostentatious pomp with embedded Statsuma Kiriko crystal. Make them crystals spin Solid-A and we might pop for a few ourselves. Now come on dear readers, admit it, which one of you designed it?[Via Akihabara News]
