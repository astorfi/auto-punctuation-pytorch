The 6.1 megapixel camera takes SD, shoots in RAW or JPEG, has a 2.5-inch display, and comes bundled with an 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor lens. How much? How much you ask? $599, that's how much. We can't find much that isn't pleasing here, so let's pass you on through to see some more photos of the thing.
