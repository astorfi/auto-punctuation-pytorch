Now that we're beyond that, this touchscreen-based desktop -- which was peeked way back in June -- is finally showing signs of life courtesy of a formal pre-order page hosted up at Play.com. The all white machine packs a 1.6GHz Intel Atom CPU, 1GB of RAM, a 160GB hard drive, 15.6-inch LCD, Windows XP Home, a 1.3-megapixel camera, built-in stereo speakers, WiFi, a slew of ports and an integrated graphics set. The current release date is set for November 20th, though we wouldn't bet the farm on that or anything. At any rate, those unable to resist can plunk down Â£399.99 ($685) right now and look forward to free delivery in just over a month.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
