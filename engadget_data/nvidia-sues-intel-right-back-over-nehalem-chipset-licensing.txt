This little bit of nyah-nyah is just the latest in the recent feud between these two: we've got a month-long argument about Atom chips and NVIDIA's Ion netbook platform going on, and don't even get anyone started on whether GPUs or CPUs are the wave of the future, it's freaking endless. Of course, this will all likely end in a settlement agreement and the these two realizing that they're actually in love, but until then we're just going have to put up with it. Video after the break.
