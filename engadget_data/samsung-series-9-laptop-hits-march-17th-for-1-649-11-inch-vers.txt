 
Sure, we saw some pricing leaks of the super slim Series 9 this morning, but Samsung is finally coming clean now with all the official details. Starting on March 17th (yep, tomorrow!), the 13.3-inch laptop with its Core i5-2537M processor, 128GB SSD, 4GB of RAM, and Windows 7 Home Premium will be available for $1,649. Sure, it's a bit more than we expected, but we guess when you consider its solid state storage and 400nit display it makes a bit more sense. Still, there's a big part of us that wishes there was a more entry-level configuration of the beautiful duralumin machine -- in fact the only other configuration will be a $1,699 model with Win 7 Professional. The 13-inch model will be up for grabs at Best Buy, Tiger Direct, Amazon, and a number of other e-tailers.

Wondering about that 11.1-inch Series 9 model that we saw hanging around a few weeks ago? That one is a bit farther out, though not by much. Samsung isn't releasing pricing on the smaller, 2.3-pound version, but it will be hitting in mid-April with a older Core i3-380UM processor, 2GB of RAM, and a 64GB SSD. It sounds like that one will be kinder on the wallet, but we're still convinced there are a bunch out there that will opt for the larger screened machine. We're hoping to bring you a review of the 13-incher very soon, but in the meantime hit the break for the official release.
 

Update: A few retailers seem to have the 13-inch version up for pre-order already, but Dynamism's actually showing the 11-incher for $1,149. Samsung still isn't giving official pricing on that version yet, however.
