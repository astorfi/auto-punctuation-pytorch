Motorola's ultra-narrow KRZR might be old hat in some parts of the globe, but as of today, Verizon is the first American carrier to ship the hotly anticipated RAZR successor. After the Internet exclusive has run its course, brick-and-mortar sales fire up on October 5; regardless of where you pick it up, though, expect to shell out $200 (and two years of your wireless life) to head home with this little bundle of joy tucked under your arm.[Thanks to everyone who sent this in]
