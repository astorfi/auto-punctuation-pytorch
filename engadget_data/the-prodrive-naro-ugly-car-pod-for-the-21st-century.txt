So we're pretty sure that when auto developer Prodrive contracted The Narrow Car Company to whip up an urban concept
vehicle, the Naro (the name, get it?) probably wasn't exactly what they had in mind. Afterall, would you be
expecting a two-passenger pod that turns like a motorcycle when you lean into turnsâ€”furthermore, would you really want
to ride in one? Because here in New York we can totally see people pushing these things over, or confused and
disoriented tourists leaning too hard into turns and falling flat on their sides. Look, we appreciate the good
intentions, but we'll stick with our yellow Crown Vics okay? They kind of remind us of being hauled off in a 5-0
cruiser, fond memories.
