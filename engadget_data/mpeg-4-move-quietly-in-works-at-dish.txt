We've mentioned the DIRECTV MPEG-4 strategies a time or two, but we've been quiet on the Dish Networkfront. Imagine my surprise when I bumped into my friend Paul at work and he mentioned his new Dish HDTV receiver sportingan MPEG-4 logo.I figured he got the non-DVR model 811 since I knew he was thinking of using WMCE for hishigh-def recordings. Nope, Paul has the VIP-211 model. Huh? How did we miss that? A quick bunch of research indicates a 411 modelwith MPEG-4 support also (shown above). The units don't appear on DishNetwork's site yet and there's no news that they're transmitting MPEG-4 signals yet, but it's clear that there'scompression afoot; more deets to follow!
