So soft, in fact, that it has just launched a new version that's completely compatible with OS X 10.4 (Tiger). The update also improves performance of multimedia library browsing and makes a few other minor changes / fixes sure to make heavy users smile. If you're still holding onto Tiger and want to know what the buzz is about, today's your lucky day.
