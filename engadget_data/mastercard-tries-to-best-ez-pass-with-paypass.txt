 While riding around the roads, paying for tolls have always either been cash or a windshield mounted transponder like EZ-Pass or FasTrak. Well, for some motorists in Ohio, there's now a third option. For the next three months, select exit tolls along the Ohio Turnpike will be outfitted with self-service machines that accept MasterCard's PayPass. The trial run allows drivers wielding the appropriate cards to easily pay their toll with the contact-less system, not unlike the EZ-Pass. Vending machines around those exits will also sport PayPass options for added convenience. Hopefully, this convenience won't also be making life easier for hackers.[Via The Wireless Report]
