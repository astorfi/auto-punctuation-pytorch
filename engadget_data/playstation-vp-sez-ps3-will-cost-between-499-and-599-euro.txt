       Don't worry, that faint screaming sound you hear inthe distance is just the sound of a million Sony fanboys. Looks like those rumors of steep PS3 pricing weren'tso far off after all, since in a radio interview yesterday with Générations Europe, Sony ComputerEntertainment Europe VP George Fornay mentioned that the PS3 willcost between €499 and €599, which is around $613 and $736 USD. He excused the price with the fact that it's areal steal for a Blu-ray playback system, but we're not so assured. Of course, Europe always gets a little screwed whenit comes to console pricing, with the premium Xbox 360going for €399 there while it rings up at a mere $399 here. If that logic holds, we might see the PS3 for $499 inthe states, which happens to match up with the current buzz going around the developer community. It's always possiblethat Sony is just throwing out wild and crazy numbers to make us all surprised when the console hits for the regular$300 Sony price point, but it's looking less and less likely.[Via Joystiq]Read:George Fornay interviewRead: Developers say $499
