If Microsoft ever hopes to realize its dreams of using Windows XP Media Center Edition to get more Windows PCs out
of the home office and into the home theater, units like the Teatro D1 from Italian developer OnCinema are the way to
do it. This sleek model comes in black or chrome, and includes an integrated 1280x720 touchscreen display (please don't
try to watch movies on this), a dual-layer DVD burner, and a 500GB drive. All this and more can be yours for only 
€5,500 ($7,500). Hey, we didn't say getting into the home theater was cheap.
