At Sony's pre-E3 press conference tonight mentioned again how its relationship with Activision and Bungie will see exclusive DLC for the developer's first post-Halo game, Destiny, come to the PlayStation 4. It also showed off a trailer featuring in-game action and a live demo. The live action on-stage featured two people playing as a warlock and hunter navigating through a level and dispatching alien foes (you've played Halo, or Mass Effect, right?) in exactly the RPG / shooter fashion fans are expecting.
