Rumors of a YouTube-based music service just got some credibility thanks to an Android Police teardown of the Android app's most recent code. The site has found references to a Music Pass that would let subscribers listen to "millions of songs" ad-free, even with the app running in the background. Customers could also pin content to the device for offline listening, although it would expire if the device stayed offline for too long. There's no guarantee that Google will launch the Music Pass soon (if at all), but don't be surprised if the YouTube app becomes your personal jukebox in the near future.
