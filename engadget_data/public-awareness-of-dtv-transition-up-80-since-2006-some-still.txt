According to new research released by the Consumer Electronics Association, consumer awareness of the looming switchover is up 80-percent since 2006. The study also points out that 72-percent of respondents were schooled courtesy of ads seen on television, while 39-percent heard it through the grapevine (read: "friends and family") and 26-percent found out from the intarwebs. 'Course, we also heard that a whopping 22-percent of folks "had no plans" for the cutover last November, so we're sure there's still a few OTA-only homes out there that have a real shocker comin'.[Via Widescreen Review]
