According to the Telegraph and the Daily Mail, Google is aiming to deliver its set-top software to the UK sometime in the next six months. Eric Schmidt is expected to announce the plans at the Edinburgh Television Festival (which starts today), likely including integration of BBC's iPlayer and ITV's Player. Sadly we don't have any more details yet regarding a specific launch date or hardware, but we wouldn't be shocked if it's timed to coincide with the release of the Honeycomb version of Google TV.
