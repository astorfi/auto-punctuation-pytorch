Their freshly minted VP-11S1 features a full 1080phigh definition picture, Konica Minolta lens, 6,500:1 contrast ratio, pumps out 700 ANSI lumens, and has dual HDMI,dual component, VGA, S-Video, and composite video inputs -- all for a mere 1,800,000. Ahem, that's about $15,300 US. Inother words, you'll have a little time to scrap for spare change before they release this thing Stateside -- if theyrelease this thing Stateside.[Via Impress]
