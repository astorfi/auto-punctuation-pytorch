The DT HyperX (pictured) is the expensive speed line here, offering read speeds of 30MB/sec and 20MB/sec in capacities ranging 2GB for $74 to 8GB for $266. If you're just looking for pure capacity, the DT 110 line will get you in the game at 1GB for just $12, and maxes out at 8GB for $104. If you're the type who wants a flash drive preloaded with random apps, the DT 400 series comes with MigoSync, a utility that promises to keep your various machines in sync. Of course, that's going to cost you -- the 400 series starts at $31 for 2GB and goes up to $137 for 8GB. Pictures of 'em all in the gallery -- surprise, they look like flash drives.
