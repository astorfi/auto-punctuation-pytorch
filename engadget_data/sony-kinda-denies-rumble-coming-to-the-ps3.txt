That's a non-denial denial, if you ask us -- way to be sly, Sony. Karraker also confirmed that updated SIXAXIS controllers with refined motion-sensing features were shipping out, but characterized that as "part of the normal development and evolution of controllers." Here's hoping the SIXAXIS evolves itself a rumble unit sooner rather than later.[Via PC World]
