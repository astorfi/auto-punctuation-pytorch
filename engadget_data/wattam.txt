Did you play bizarre and charming PlayStation 2 game Katamari Damacy? If you did, you're familiar with the quirky stylings of Keita Takahashi, the game's creator. And how about Journey, the beautiful exploration game from thatgamecompany? If you did, you're familiar with Robin Hunicke, one of a small group of folks who created the gorgeous, unique experience. Now put those two artistic sensibilities together and you've got Funonema, the studio that both Hunicke and Takahashi now helm -- the duo revealed their first game today at PlayStation Experience in Las Vegas: "Wattam." What is Wattam? Your guess is as good as ours -- the brief bit shown had a personified cube trying on a variety of adorable hats. What we do know is that the game is headed to PlayStation 4 and we're willing to bet it'll be just as adorable and memorable as previous titles from Takahashi and Hunicke. We'll of course have much more from PlayStation Experience as the weekend rolls on!
