The rumors were true. Nokia's revealed its biggest phone to date, with a screen measuring in at 4.7 inches. It's the Lumia 625, and it joins a series that has grown a fair bit since the Lumia 620 launched earlier this year. Compared to that earlier phone, the 625 keeps the same resolution (a slightly pixelated 800 x 480), but bumps the processing power up to a dual-core Snapdragon S4. Despite that hulking LCD screen, however, it's still thinner than the Lumia 920 at 9.15mm (0.36 inches). It's a Nokia smartphone, so there are plenty of HSPA radio gadgetry to keep the global fanbase happy. What's more -- and this is rare for an entry-level Lumia -- it also has LTE. Specifically, we're looking at the British EE-friendly Band 3 option here, alongside Bands 7 and 10.


If there's anything to remind us that this is no flagship device, it's the camera. Don't expect any 41-megapixel sensors. In fact, get ready to be a little underwhelmed by a 5-megapixel camera module, although you'll still get the likes of the animated gif-making Cinemagraph and the same Smart Camera app seen on the Lumia 925. You'll have 8GB of internal memory to fill with your best photo moments, and there's also a microSD slot behind the removable back. Meanwhile, customization options include orange, green, yellow, white and black cases, although there's no turquoise shade like we saw on the Lumia 620. It's headed to EE, Vodafone, O2, Phones4U and Carphone Warehouse in early September, priced at Â£200 or 220 euros for continental Europeans. Find our hands-on impressions (and a video!) right after the break.



If you thought the notion of Nokia's biggest-screened phone would result in an unwieldy tablet-bordering size, don't worry. The thinner profile makes it as easy to handle as the Lumia 925, while the matte plastic finish means fingers can keep a handle on it. Those brighter color options look great in real life, reflecting lots of light, something that might not be obvious in all of our hands-on shots. The screen is pretty disappointing, with off-angle views suffering substantially. With that WVGA display now spread across 4.7 inches, the pixel density now comes in below 200 ppi, making icons and text a shade more jagged than we'd liked. (For reference, the Lumia 620 was around 246 ppi.)

That mid- to high-end Snapdragon S4 processor means the smartphone didn't stall during our short playtime. We didn't get a chance to test out the camera, although our samples shots from 5-megapixel sensors found in other Lumia handsets should offer a decent estimate of how pictures will turn out, with some extra functionality from the aforementioned Smart Camera app. Barring concerns with screens and the camera, its low off-contract price -- with LTE-capability -- could make the 625 a very enticing package for first-time smartphone buyers.
