The new chipset integrates NVIDIA's nForce 680a SLI chipset with AMD's fresh Athlon 64 FX-70 dual-core processors to great effect, with clock speeds hitting 2.6, 2.8 and 3.0GHz for the FX-70, FX-72 and FX-74 processors. The 90nm chips include 2MB of L2 cache, consume no more than 125W of power, and can support 800MHz DDR2 SDRAM, all based on AMD's Socket F workstation infrastructure. Of course, all this integrated action doesn't come cheap -- or tiny, as the picture above proves -- since the CPUs will run you $599, $799 and $999 respectively. By the time you buy two of 'em, plus 4 NVIDIA cards and a motherboard to hold 'em all, your bank account will be hurting mightily, but if cost is no concern, there's no arguing with the power potential here.[Via El Reg]
