The ultraportable U110 was looking pretty flash in sparkly red, but suffering from a bad case of fingerprint-attraction -- enough so that one poor Lenovo PR dude was just hanging out waiting to wipe it clean every few minutes. We were told that the 17-inch unit here wasn't in fact the gaming-oriented version we'd heard about, but apparently we'll see that tomorrow at Lenovo's booth. Check 'em out in the gallery!
