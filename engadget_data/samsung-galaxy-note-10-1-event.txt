 
 We got our not-so-mysterious invite earlier this month, and now Samsung's "Meet the new way" event is just a day away. Will we see the much-anticipated Galaxy Note 10.1? Given that Sammy already pulled the curtain on the global model, all signs point to yes. As always, we'll be on hand to serve up the details as they unfold tomorrow from Jazz at Lincoln Center (might we expect a full-blown orchestra a la the Galaxy S III launch, we wonder?).

 Our liveblog goes down at 11 AM tomorrow, and you'll want to park your browser here for the full play-by-play.
