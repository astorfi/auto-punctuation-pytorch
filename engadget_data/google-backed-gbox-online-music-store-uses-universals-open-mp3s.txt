 Google, Universal, and a new start-up company called gBox are teaming up to sell music exclusively through an ad based format, bucking the iTunes style method of selling music online. The partnership works out with Google referring users to gBox, where they can buy DRM-free copies of Universal's music catalog for 99 cents. Universal still has to pay Google for the ad space, which begs the question, why couldn't Universal simply distribute the music itself? But hey, at least it looks like the whole DRM-free thing's working out for Universal and Co. Your turn, Mr. J.
