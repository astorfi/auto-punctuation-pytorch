Although more than a few runners track their progress through apps like RunKeeper, it's doubtful that many of them like reaching for their smartphones just to check their pace. Thanks to an updated RunKeeper app, they'll only have to look at the Pebble smartwatch on their wrist. Both Android and iOS users can now glance at the Bluetooth timepiece for vital stats, such as pacing, or start and stop their runs. Only a handful of us will have the needed combination of app and wristwear to justify the update at the source links, but don't despair if you're not part of the Pebble flock. RunKeeper's staff say they "look forward" to supporting wearable technology as a whole, which should let many more athletes keep their eyes on the path ahead, and their hands out of their pockets.

Boston, Ma. -- May 7, 2013 -- Today, RunKeeper rolls out the first-ever Pebble-connected app for iPhone and Android, turning your smart watch into a personal trainer. The partnership with Pebble is just one of many integrations with hardware and fitness tracking devices in the coming months, supporting RunKeeper's mission to become the fitness platform that makes the world healthier at scale.
RunKeeper now allows you to control the app from Pebble, so you can leave your phone in your pocket during a workout. RunKeeper features such as pace, mileage, starting and stopping a workout, and more will be fully accessible on Pebble wearers' wrists.
"People are rightfully excited about wearables because they extend the experience of mobile apps like RunKeeper, so they can be enjoyed without taking your phone out of your pocket," said Jason Jacobs, CEO, RunKeeper. "Pebble is such an exciting partner for RunKeeper; it is a great device and a powerful showcase of how your runs, walks and bike rides with RunKeeper can be enhanced by wearable device integration. We look forward to integrating with more wearable devices in the future."
"Pebble integrates tech into people's daily lives in a fashionable and unobtrusive way. We're excited that RunKeeper will be among the first apps to showcase our smart watch's capabilities and how we support your day-to-day interests and activities, " said Eric Migicovsky, CEO, Pebble. "With the RunKeeper app, fitness enthusiasts can benefit from Pebble to track their workouts, get motivated and meet their goals."
