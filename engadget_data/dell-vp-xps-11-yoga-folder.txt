It's Computex week, which means the technology world is ready to talk up the PCs it'll be pushing out between now and January. Dell's Kirk Schell has let it slip that the company will be beefing up its mobile offerings with an 11.6-inch laptop that should arrive in time for the holidays. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Dell XPS 11 will come with a high-definition display that can be folded backwards to use as a tablet -- which would have been exciting, but for the fact Lenovo got there first.
