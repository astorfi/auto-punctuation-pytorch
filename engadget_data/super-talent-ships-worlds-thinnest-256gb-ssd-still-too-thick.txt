Yeah, the outfit's 256GB FSD56GC25H SSD actually is the slimmest on the market today at this capacity, but the 12.5-millimeter height makes it incompatible with a slew of laptops that can only handle drives that are 9.5-millimeters thick. Nevertheless, those with the room to spare can look forward to 0.1-millisecond access times, 65MB/sec sequential read speeds and 50MB/sec sequential write speeds (maximums), and a lightweight aluminum enclosure. Per usual, pricing information is available only upon request -- but no, it won't be cheap.
