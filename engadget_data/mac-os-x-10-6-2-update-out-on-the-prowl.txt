So far the biggest change here seems to be fixing that nagging guest account deletion bug -- and thank goodness for that. As for whether or not it supports Intel Atom processors, last we heard this morning it wasn't going to be there, but we're gonna have wait and see now that it's officially hit the nets. Leopard users who haven't made the upgrade also get a gift today, in the form of a security update. 10.6.2 release notes after the break.

Update: We just installed it -- it took forever and a day on one of our machines, and sped by reasonably quick on another. Everything seems okay otherwise, how about you?

Update 2: We've gotten enough reports to call it -- Atom support is out. Sorry, hackintosh community.

[Thanks to everyone who sent this in!]
