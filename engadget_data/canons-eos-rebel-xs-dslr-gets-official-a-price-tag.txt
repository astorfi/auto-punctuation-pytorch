The camera -- which ships in August -- will clock in at $699.99, and comes bundled with the EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS  zoom lens, rechargeable battery pack and charger, a handful of cables, and the assurance that your pictures will look markedly better than the ones you took with that camera you bought on vacation that was bright yellow and housed in cardboard. Check out the gallery below for a closer look at both the black and silver versions.
