Leaked photos of the next e-reader to join the Kobo family have appeared online today, and from the looks of it, the company isn't out to reinvent the wheel. We rummaged around in the FCC filings to confirm that it'll come with a 6-inch screen and a 1,500mAh battery, which bests the 1,000mAh one in the Kobo Glo. The design is reminiscent of the Aura HD, with a contoured back so that it rests comfortably in hand. Along the bottom, you'll find a microSD slot and a micro-USB port, while a red power button sits at the top. This new model is rocking some asymmetry, with the Kobo logo set on the left side of the bezel and non-parallel lines marking the back ridges with an off-center, vertical logo. We're still waiting on a formal announcement, so stay tuned for more info.
