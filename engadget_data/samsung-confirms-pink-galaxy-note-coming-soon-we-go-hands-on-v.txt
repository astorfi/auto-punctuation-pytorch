  Sure, you can personalize your Galaxy Note by sketching with the 5.3-inch phablet's S Pen, but there's no better way to express your mobile-obsessed self than by dressing your device in a flashy new color. Pink is the flavor of the month over at Samsung, which just gave us a sneak peek at its rosy Android hybrid at its CeBIT booth in beautiful Hannover, Germany. The sample on hand is of the shell-only variety, in that it doesn't include any internals, but looks pretty juicy even in its static state. The device is virtually identical to its blue and white counterparts, though its backplate is textured like that of the blue model, rather than the glossy rear you'll see on the white. There's not much more to say about pinky here, considering that the sample device won't even power on, but jump past the break for our hands-on video if you'd care to take a closer look. And keep an eye out for the pink Note in a store near you -- it's expected to land (in Germany, at least) within the next two months.
