 The Incredible Hulk Blu-ray is definitely getting a more thorough treatment than its barebones Hulk HD DVD distant cousin, packing U-control picture-in-picture and interactive features as well as a standard definition digital copy on a second disc. The 50GB Blu-ray disc includes the 1080p MPEG-4 encoded flick, a DTS-HD Master Audio track as well as BD Live chat, and scene sharing. Hopefully there's room for the hour+ additional footage hinted at by the director in previous interviews, but we're sure that won't stop fans from preordering to get the limited edition "Green Ray" 3D packaging.
