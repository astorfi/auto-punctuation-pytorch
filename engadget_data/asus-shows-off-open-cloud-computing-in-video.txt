Rather than just give us the dry details, though, ASUS has chosen to sum it all up in a slightly surreal video illustrating how its cloud solves the travails of friends and family. Web storage comes up often for sharing files across the Internet -- apparently, by reaching through clouds -- and is joined by Open Help for sorting out frustrated parents, Open Link for helping woe-is-me teenagers finish high school projects on their Padfones, Vibe for sharing media and Waveface for coordinating a thank you event with everyone. Apart from being a bit trippy, the promo has more than a small dose of science fiction: although we've seen some future product concepts from ASUS before, we're pretty sure there's no holographic watches and virtual assistants on the short-term roadmap. If you can reconcile that with practical reality, you'll be ready for the video after the story jump.
