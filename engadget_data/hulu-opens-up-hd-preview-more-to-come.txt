The streaming video site has recently announced the opening of an HD Gallery, which houses a small collection of 1,280 x 720 resolution files. Granted, the requirements for actually playing these files are quite high -- an internet connection exceeding 2,400Kbps, the latest build of Adobe Flash Player 9 and a wicked fast computer -- but at least the option is there for those with the requisite gear. Apparently, the files are being compressed via H.264, and while we're not told what other high-definition content is planned for the future, we'll be keeping our browsers tuned in to find out.[Via CNET]
