This is at least in part due to some sketchy quality on the M1, with a finish on early machines that looks like a Tamiya kit haphazardly glued together by a four-year-old. The company is saying it will step up and replace all of the pre-ordered units with better ones once it gets its molds to line up, but having to trade in your new computer after a few weeks seems to partially defeat the purpose of getting one early in the first place. Of the two only the S5 is said to be officially coming to America at this point anyway, so hopefully that's the one that caught your fancy.
