       The same Dolby that has been keeping theaters thumping for years is now teaming up with Infitec GmbH, a German company specializing in virtual reality applications, to develop its own 3D projection system for cinema use. While the ideas surrounding 3D displays in various forms are certainly not new, this technology promises to be more affordable than current 3D installations and boost dwindling ticket sales -- ahh, nothing like a panacea to cure what's ailing the movie industry. Dolby's inexpensive, polarized-lens take on 3D hopes to be a bit more widespread than, say, IMAX, in an attempt to get folks away from their internet flicks and DVDs, and back into the realm of overpriced concessions and stadium seating. It's hard to say if this technology will be the thrill people need to swallow the rising box office expenses, but Dolby hopes you'll be giving a gander at the third dimension when their 3D systems get deployed nationwide in spring of 2007.[Via Wired]
