 Apparently, Marine Current Turbines is having quite the time trying to install what would be "the world's largest tidal power project," as the installation that was slated to begin Monday will now be lucky to see completion this year. Dubbed SeaGen, the project will reportedly utilize "twin underwater turbines to generate 1.2-megawatts of electricity off the coast of Northern Ireland," which are said to "look and work very much like wind powered [alternatives]." Notably, the company even mentioned that the devices spin "too slowly to affect marine life," and just in case you're concerned about its future plans, it "intends to eventually build farms of turbines consisting of 10 to 20 pairs each."
